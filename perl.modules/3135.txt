Hello,

After searching CPAN, I haven't found any modules 
matching what I'd like to contribute, so I would like 
to register as a CPAN developer.

Name: Douglas Sparling
Email: doug@dougsparling.com
Homepage: http://www.dougsparling.com
Preferred CPAN User ID: DSPARLING
Description of What I'd Like to Contribute: My 
interests are in musical instrument building and the 
physics of music. I would like to contribute modules 
that could be used for various instrument building 
calculations - fret calculations, string guage/diameter 
calculations, just intonation, numerical calculations 
of flute impedences and standing waves, length/bore 
calculations, note/frequecncy conversions and 
wavelength/frequency conversions.

Modules:

Lutherie::
::FretCalc   cdpf  Calculate stringed instrument fret 
locations

Sound::
::Wavelength cdpf Frequency/Wavelength conversions
