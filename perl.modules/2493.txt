Hi My name is Tolga, I wanted to link the Gd Module but I am having a
lot errors that says "probably harmless" no library found for .....
and bunch of library names with the same message. I don't know what I am
doing wrong. I already reed the readme  file. I could not solve it. I
need some help. I have my four libraries extracted under the other
directory, but I don't know what to do. I will appreciate if somebody
just e-mail me an help me a bit.
Tolga
