From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

I released two versions of App-opan - 0.001001 and 0.001002. The former
didn't index any modules because I'm an idiot, and showed up on metacpan
etc. fine. The latter did index a module because I'd fixed it, and then
nothing has been seen of it anywhere since.
