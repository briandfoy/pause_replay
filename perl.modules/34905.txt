Hmmmm... none of those seem to talk about the name "SQL::SyntaxModel".

It might be just me, but given the name of your module and what you've
documented it does. I wouldn't have connected the two.

The private email discussion that you posted seems inconclusive, and
nobody seems to agree on a really good name.  After wading through
the documentation, I think something like SQL::Tree::* is much
more meaningful.
