Subject: Module submission App::Options

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Options
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: combine cmdline opts, env vars, config files
  userid:      SPADKINS (Stephen Adkins)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    p5ee@perl.org, http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/p5ee/App-Options/

  similar:
    Getopt::Long AppConfig

  rationale:

    * App::Options is very descriptive of what the module does. * The
    root level name already existed but was sparsely populated. * I
    adopted various places in the App::* for a set of distributions
    which make up an application development framework (App::Options,
    App::Context, App::Repository, App::Widget). * App::Options is
    different from other option processing modules (i.e. Getopt::*,
    AppConfig) because it is not merely a toolkit to enable you to write
    configurable programs. It has made many design decisions already
    (what are the config files, where are they, what are the environment
    variables named, etc.) and adds many features (variable
    substitution, conditional option assignment). This makes it *much*
    more useful right "out of the box" with very little effort.

The resulting entry would be:
