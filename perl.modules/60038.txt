The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::SRLock
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Set/reset locking to single thread processes
  userid:      PJFL (Peter Flanigan)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    IPC::Lock

  rationale:

    The API was designed to suite my needs which include iterating over
    the lock table. Also the three implementations included offer a
    wider choice than other modules

  enteredby:   PJFL (Peter Flanigan)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 15 13:43:17 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::SRLock          bdpOa Set/reset locking to single thread processes PJFL
