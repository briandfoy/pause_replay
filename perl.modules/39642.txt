Subject: Module submission Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::ASN1::EntrezGene
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Parser for NCBI Entrez Gene (ASN.1-format)
  userid:      MINGYILIU (Mingyi Liu)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    bioperl-l mailing list

  similar:
    Bio::SeqIO, Bio::Tools::GFF

  rationale:

    Namespace choice reasoning: The parser is used exclusively by
    Bioinformaticians, it parses the ASN.1 formatted Entrez Gene file,
    and it was chosen by a member of modules@perl.org. I had also
    discussed with Bioperl mailing list in choosing between Bio::ASN1
    and Bio::Tools, which contains many Bio-related parsers, among other
    things. Bio::ASN1 was considered a more appropriate choice as well.

    Uniqueness of my approach & reason for listing: This parser is the
    only publicly available parser for Entrez Gene (in fact, only one
    other public domain parser exists, which is buried in NCBI's complex
    C++ toolkit and fairly difficult to use). The parser is also very
    fast and does simple validation and error reporting. Additionally, I
    had produced 3 other Entrez Gene parsers using Parse::RecDescent,
    Parse::Yapp and perl-byacc, which are not included due to their
    slower speed. Yet the regex-based parser that is included can be
    compared to the others, which can be useful for anyone considering
    different approaches for a practical project (for more info please
    refer to http://sourceforge.net/projects/egparser and
    http://egparser.sourceforge.net)

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::ASN1::
::EntrezGene      RdpOp Parser for NCBI Entrez Gene (ASN.1-format)   MINGYILIU
