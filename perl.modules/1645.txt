Grrrrr. So now I read the README and cannot find a sentence that
justifies App:: namespace.

  WHAT IT IS

          This module traces any dynamically linked program for
          filesystem-modifying calls such as rename, open64, unlink, remove
          etc. It will save all the files before they were modified. It can
          then undo and redo the changes as often as you want.

          At the moment, Linux is probably the only system that is
          supported.

Sounds pretty cool, much cooler than the name:-)

It's all about archiving and about file systems, but not about
applications. Maybe Filesys::Monitor, Filesys::Trace, or
Filesys::KernelCalls would describe the purpose of the core module
better?

Well, it's not really about file systems as such but rather about a
thing between kernel and file system, so the File:: namespace might
even work better, maybe File::NoOverwrite or File::Shelter?
