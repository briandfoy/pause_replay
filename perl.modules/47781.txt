The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SAS::Parser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Classes for parsing SAS programs
  userid:      MLF (Michael Friendly)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.soft-sys.sas, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    It is possible that this contribution better belongs under 009 -
    language interfaces. Please advise.

    It is designed to start a new perl topic having to do with
    interaction between the SAS language (http://www.sas.com) and perl,
    hence a new rootlevel namespace is proposed. A namespace under
    Text:: would also be possible, but more limiting for future
    development.

    The current modules and sample scripts have to do with parsing and
    operating on SAS programs. SAS::Parser is the base class;
    SAS::Header and SAS::Index are extensions designed for particular
    tasks, but mainly included to indicate what can be done. At the
    moment they are all packaged in one distro.

    Before I upload to CPAN, you may examine the current distro at
    http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/ftp/sas/perl/SAS-Parser-0.93.tar.gz

The resulting entry would be:

SAS::
::Parser          bdpOp Classes for parsing SAS programs             MLF
