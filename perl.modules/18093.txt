The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geography::Countries::LatLong
  DSLIP:       Rdpnp
  description: List of mean latidue and longitude
  userid:      LGODDARD (Lee Goddard)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Announce to go on comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    None.

  rationale:

    Geography::Countries::LatLong provides mean latitude and longitude
    for almost all countries in the world.

    This compliments the Geography::Countries module, which provides
    decoding of country names, and the Geo::IPfree module, which
    provides non-commercial look-up of IP name to country name. When
    combined with this module, and my Image::Maps::Plot::FromLatLong
    module, it becomes possible to ... use perl to plot IP address on a
    map! What FUN!!

    The more publicity this gets, the less poor people will have to
    hand over hard-earned dosh to the Geo::IP company - who claim
    Geo::IP::Records works for free to supply lat/long, and doesn't.
    Instead it supplies random strings which change depending on the
    size of the code accessing them (apparently): requests for support
    result in requests for money --- not very perl, not very CPAN. This
    module attempts to correct the error.

The resulting entry would be:

Geography::Countries::
::LatLong         Rdpnp List of mean latidue and longitude           LGODDARD
