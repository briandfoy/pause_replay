     why:

    I'm an active developer in NLP/bioinformatics, and I have lots of
    code that I think would be useful to someone other than me. For
    starters I would like to contribute:

    -Several Regexp::Common modules that define regexps for: relative
    dates (e.g. "three weeks ago"), countries/demonyms (e.g.
    "Japan/Japanese"), color words (e.g. "Red" or "greenish-blue"), etc.

    -A verb conjugation model -- sort of like Lingua::EN::Conjugate,
    but with a more elaborate data structure.

    -A unified date/time translator that deals w/ exact dates, relative
    dates, frequencies, etc. (This code is still in development)

    That's all I can think of for now. Thank you for CPAN! Lisa
