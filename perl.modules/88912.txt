Request to register new user

fullname: Andrew Beverley
  userid: ABEVERLEY
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.andybev.com
     why:

    I would like to take over the Device::VantagePro module, which
    appears to be unmaintained (I have had no response to emails). I am
    following the process as per the FAQ, the first step of which is to
    request a PAUSE account.

    I would also like to add another similar weather device with my own
    module, once I get the time.
