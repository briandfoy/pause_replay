Hi,
I think I must have done something bad. I've been uploading, testing and 
deleting bioperl-1.5.2*.tar.gz files, but recently I haven't been 
getting the normal indexing email.

I've just uploaded bioperl-1.5.2_005-RC.tar.gz which has modules with 
the highest version number of any previous upload, but still no 
indexing, even after choosing to 'force' the indexing.

What did I do wrong, and how do I fix it?


Thank you,
Sendu.
