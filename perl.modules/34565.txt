What other sort of module might it be?

It might be linux specific now, but it might not always be.

You may not make it that large, but other people may like to.  When
we consider a namespace, we try to anticipate future additions and
how people will add their own modules.  Choosing a flexible name
saves a lot of future hassle.

I'm still not convinced of the linux only nature of the broader topic.
http://linuxtv.org/dvb/ says:

"Digital Television is supposed to work on every TV set independently
of the software and OS that runs this device. The standards that
guarantee this interoperability are defined by the members of the DVB."
