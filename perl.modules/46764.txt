Usually, this type of modules would go into the WWW:: hierarchy. So I 
would suggest WWW::Salesforce as a module name. Try searching 
distributions on CPAN through search.cpan.org for "WWW": You'll find 
much precedence.

A top level namespace is unlikely to be accepted by the module list 
maintainers.
