This seems like an inappropriate use of Object::Util.

The main ::Util modules (Scalar::Util, List::Util, Params::Util, etc) 
tend to have very specific meaning, they provide very simple functions 
that provide access to very specific things.

Inside-out objects are a recent and specialized invention, and I think 
it would be inappropriate to use up what is really a potentially core 
module name for something that doesn't just deal with objects in the 
most general sense.

If you wanted a util module for inside-out objects/classes, I'd first 
suggest talking to Damian about adding them to Class::Std::Util, and if 
they aren't appropriate there, perhaps Object::InsideOut::Util instead 
of Object::Util.
