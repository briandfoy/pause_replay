Hello,

    Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, but my home machine was 
unwell. Image::OrgChart was written as a Joke/Comment after my companys 
third re-org in as many months. Based off of Image::Timeline, I have 
never been too happy with the code. After checking out GD::OrgChart, I 
think it is a better module. I will see if  I can come up with a patch 
for GD::OrgChart that will allow it to draw horizontal-based Org Charts 
like Image::OrgChart, thus combining the two. If i am able to do this, I 
will upload a new version of Image::OrgChart which notes it a 
depreciated in favor of GD::OrgChart. I will let you know if/when i 
complete the patch.

Thanks;
  -- Matt Sanford
