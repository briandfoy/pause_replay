Help!

I registered a little while back, and I've been waiting for login
details. Now I've just checked the archive and I see there was a
Welcome message, but it contains the WRONG email address for me:
should be stephen.thomas@adelaide.edu.au, but you have it as just
"thomas@adelaide.edu.au".

So I presume my login details went astray.

Can someone please correct my registration details, and (re)send
the login details to my correct address?

Thanks,

Steve
