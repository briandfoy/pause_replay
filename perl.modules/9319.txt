Proudly presenting  === Mail::Box version 2 ===

Mail::Box v2 is a full re-implementation of existing e-mail related
modules.  The current version replaces Mail::Internet, MIME::Entity,
Mail::Mailer, Mail::Send, Mail::Folder, MIME::Parser, and many of
their helper modules.  It took some spare time in the last four months to
accomplish this ;)

Advantages:
- One consistent interface, naming, and structure in pure Perl 5.6.
- Fully object oriented, and written to be extendible.
- Each method and each option is documented.
- 57 packages, over 2400 tests, 6 example scripts, and 3 usable programs
  to start with.  In total 37000 lines of code + tests + pod.
- Currently implements Mbox and MH folders; message thread detections;
  message encoding, decoding, construction, and sending; creation of
  complex replies; complex multi-part handling; a mail folder parser
  in C (fast) and Perl (portable).
- Accepts (and converts) Mail::Internet and MIME::Entity messages.
- The implementation is 'lazy': delays message parsing when possible, which
  boosts performance for most applications.
- ... and still very easy to use ...

Disadvantages:
- Only little real-life tests.
- Still some small modules to replace.
- Some more performance improvements to implement (although it is
  already rather fast).
- Implemented to be portable, however yet only tested under Linux.
- Only partially compatible with Mail::Box v1 and other modules.
- My spelling as non-native English speaker.

Patches and extensions to code and documentation are very welcome.  This
way, some of the disadvantages may be cleared swiftly.

Have a look at the Mail::Box-Overview and Mail::Box-Cookbook pods if you
are interested.  Mail::Box will be presented in a talk at the Perl Workshop
in Germany, February 2002.
