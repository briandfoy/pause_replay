If there's no-one with primary maintenance permissions, only Andreas can
fix it. Most other PAUSE admins can simply "sudo" into other peoples
accounts to act on their behalf.

The one thing you (or mst or whoever has the most recent uploaded
distribution) could try is to force a reindexing of the uploaded file
via the PAUSE menu. After that, somebody *should* be picked up as
"first-come" primary maintainer. If not ==> Andreas.

Best regards,
Steffen
