Governments across Canada spend over $500 billion 
annually to maintain and improve healthcare services. 
To cover one of the largest healthcare systems in the 
world, we are introducing The Canadian Healthcare 
Directory.  This comprehensive title covers all 
Canadian hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacies, 
manufacturers and more and is available at an 
introductory price of $297.

We also publish The Canadian Healthcare Report which 
covers healthcare policy and regulatory developments 
throughout Canada ($775).

Over the past decade, Infosource Group of Companies
has provided organizations with public policy tools
covering areas such as healthcare, education and 
government policy initiatives.  This year, the company 
will expand its North American operation into Europe.
