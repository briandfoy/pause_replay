Hi,

I sent a message to comp.lang.perl.modules proposing the following four
modules for talking to the UK Government Gateway:

  GB::GovTalk::Submission
  GB::GovTalk::Submission::HMCE_NES
  GB::GovTalk::Message
  GB::GovTalk::Message::HMCE_NES

The response was positive (when I explained the proprietary signatures
was an accident rather than copy protection).

But the namespace "GB::GovTalk" is probably not good - any suggestions
for improvement?

Thanks,
