The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tournament::Schedule::RoundRobin
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: RoundRobin Tournament Pairings
  userid:      DRBEAN (Dr Bean)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    A round-robin tournament is a series of matches of the members of a
    league, where every member of the league meets every other member
    the same number of times. See
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament

    An algorithm to do this is: Represent the league members as (Inf, 1
    .. 2n-1), then in round i, i can be paired with Inf, and a can meet
    b, where a+b = 2i (mod 2n-1).

    I had been developing this module under the name
    Games::RoundRobin::Schedule, but after asking whether
    Games::Schedule::RoundRobin might be a better name on the
    module-authors list and some discussion starting at
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/4338, I decided
    that Tournament::Schedule::RoundRobin is best.

    One problem with the name is that round-robin scheduling has a
    different meaning in a computer context.

    There are a number of tournament related modules under the top
    level Games space, but they are mostly tied to particular forms of
    game, like go. I think there is value in promoting Tournament to a
    top level category, not least to keep the length of the name down
    below 3 levels.

    Another reason is I am actually not using it in a game-context, but
    an educational one, namely, student assessment in a classroom
    context. I am an EFL teacher.

    The presence of the algorithm might suggest placing it under
    Algorithm, but I see most use being by programmers not working at
    such an abstract level.

    With this module finished, I am planning to write a
    Tournament::Schedule::Swiss module, something which is within my
    programmaing ability, I think, and there are a number of other
    tournament systems that would be useful to me and other tournament
    organizers.

    There is a C++ library that models much more of the organization of
    a tournament (http://libtour.sourceforge.net) including scoring, and
    programmatic progression through the different stages from
    preliminaries to finals. My module is a lot less ambitious. That is
    why I wanted to keep the Schedule level in the name. 'Schedule' is
    more descriptive than 'System', another possibility.

The resulting entry would be:

Tournament::Schedule::
::RoundRobin      adpOp RoundRobin Tournament Pairings               DRBEAN
