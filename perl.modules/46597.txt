The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  rationale:

    From the release announcement It gives me great pleasure to
    announce the first release of Jifty, a new web application framework
    in Perl. Jifty is designed to help you write clean, maintainable
    applications quickly and easily. Actually, it was designed to help
    _us_ write clean, maintainable applications quickly and easily. We
    very much hope that you'll find it as great to work with as we do.

    As we built Jifty, we talked to many, many folks about what they
    wanted in a web framework. They told us that they didn't want to
    mess with database schema. They wanted AJAX to "just work." They
    wanted their code to be clean and simple. They wanted the power of
    CPAN. They wanted infinite choices about the way their apps were
    built. They wanted "one good way" to make applications built into
    the framework. From what we could tell, they were basically all
    saying the same thing: "I want a pony."

    In addition to being a pleasure to work with, Jifty is a veritable
    treasure trove of buzzwords. At its core is Jifty::DBI, an
    object-relational mapping system with a clean, declarative syntax.
    Jifty::DBI is based on DBIx::SearchBuilder, which has powered
    uncountable thousands of RT instances for the better part of a
    decade but adds a few new twists. Jifty::DBI handles _all_ your SQL.
    No INSERTs, no DELETES, no SELECTs, no CREATE TABLEs and no ALTER
    TABLEs. Jifty will set up your database schema when you first deploy
    your application and upgrade it as you update your model classes.

    Jifty's core web framework follows the Model-View-Controller
    pattern -- with a twist. Rather than the standard URL-based
    controller, Jifty uses a new argument-name-based dispatcher that
    makes Web Services and AJAX/AHAH easy.

    As one might expect, these days, Jifty comes with built in AJAX
    support, based on Prototype.js and Script.aculo.us. It only takes a
    few seconds to set your pages up with rich dynamic
    interaction...that seamlessly degrades in non-AJAX browsers.

    Jifty's application-level continuations make it a breeze to let a
    user pop off to a login page or a wizard and get back to where they
    came from, complete with the results of the their excursion.

    Out of the box, every new Jifty application comes with a built in
    documentation browser, database administration interface. And a
    pony.
