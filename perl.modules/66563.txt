     why:

    I plan to contribute with 3 modules (to begin with). The first two
    modules are ready for distribution and already packed for CPAN. The
    third one is in active development in these days.

    The modules are the following ones:

    Algorithm::WordLevelStatistics which implements an algorithm for
    keywords extraction from texts (language independent)

    Statistics::OnLine which is suited to perform statistics on large
    streams of data (or large datasets that may not fit memory) using
    approximation algorithm

    Thread::LiveObject which makes a thread out of an object, wrapping
    it in a thread and giving messages access to the methods
