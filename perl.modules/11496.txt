Hi,

I've developed a module for use in my genealogy/family history
work. It provides a custom user dictionary for surnames/lastnames
with the ability to add, delete, search for names. The purpose
is to catch typos, for example, RATCLIFF when RATCLIFFE was
intended. Note however that it is not a dictionary in the sense
of ispell etc.

I would like some advice on a suitable name space/module name - 
Lingua::EN::NameLookup seems good to me as the module's use is in
the same field as Lingua::EN::MatchNames and Lingua::EN::NameCase.

TIA

Pete
