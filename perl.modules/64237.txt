Subject: Module submission OpenGL::Earth
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OpenGL::Earth
  DSLIP:       anpOp
  description: Display the Earth with Perl and OpenGL
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I think there's nothing like this on CPAN, or simply I didn't find
    it. The plan is to work out something that can be used to display 3D
    geographic information on a representation of the earth that you can
    move/rotate/etc...

    It would be necessary to include the earth texture, which is quite
    big atm, 30Mb. Is it ok to upload such a module to CPAN?

  enteredby:   COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  enteredon:   Sun Jan 25 22:07:31 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

OpenGL::
::Earth           anpOp Display the Earth with Perl and OpenGL       COSIMO
