I have a young module, based on, and alternative to, Matt Sergeant's Win32::ASP.
It's named simply ASP right now, but am not opposed to renaming it. I would
welcome any ideas.  I have a cross-platform future in mind, hence the current
package name.  I can test it on Win98, WinNT, and Linux Apache w/ ChiliSoft ASP;
this makes for better testing that Win32::ASP.

--------  ----  --------------------------------
ASP-1.00  Rdpr  Perl interface to ASP PerlScript

I have several ASP modules that I've developed for use on my site which also
translate well into scripts (and were derived from former ASP JScript scripts).
1.  object-oriented wrapper package for Persits.ASPEmail
2.  easily modifiable AdCollection module/script
3.  INI dictionary script/module; loads INI file into hierarchical hash
4.  a directory listing script with file/regex mask; similar to Mr. Krynicky's
weblist.pl, but more streamlined and in ASP.  Currently used to implement my
PPD/script repository ( http://dichosoft.com/perl/ ).

Thank you for your time, and I welcome your suggestions.
