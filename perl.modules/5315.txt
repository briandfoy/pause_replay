That's seems very sensible.  Normally, I would wholeheartedly accept your
suggestion.  I might have thought of it myself if I didn't have a compelling
motive for my original suggestion for the module's name.

But the name 'SNMP::NPAdmin' seems to counterstroke my first suggestion because
I want a direct correlation between original program's name, 'npadmin,' and the
module's name that I proposed, 'NPAdmin.'

I am stuck on either name and would your feedback based on my statements in
this email.  It might be worthwhile to throw this at the the clp.modules group.

Thank you.

Cordially,
Robert Lehr
