The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Epeg
  DSLIP:       cdhOp
  description: Perl wrapper for Epeg jpeg thumbnail lib
  userid:      MCURTIS (Michael Curtis)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Image::Magick

  rationale:

    The Epeg library doesn't offer any functionality that Image::Magick
    doesn't have. However, it does offer speed. In some scenarios I've
    seen Epeg perform close to twice as fast as ImageMagick for Jpeg
    resizing.

    It's important to mention that Epeg *only* works with Jpegs.
    Perhaps the JPEG:: root might be a better home.

    More info on the Epeg library is available here:
    http://www.enlightenment.org/doxy/epeg/index.html

  enteredby:   MCURTIS (Michael Curtis)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 15 05:52:37 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::Epeg            cdhOp Perl wrapper for Epeg jpeg thumbnail lib     MCURTIS
