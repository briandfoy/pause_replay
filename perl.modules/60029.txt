Request to register new user

fullname: Amos Shapira
  userid: AMOS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I am the original author of a couple of ancient SGI API's (SGI-GL,
    SGI-FM, SGI-SysCalls) and would like to be able to report bugs in
    CPAN and hopefully contribute code again.

    My original ID was "AMOSS" and I'd like to use it again.

    If absolutely necessary then I should be able to get the current
    admins at cs.huji.ac.il verify that I'm indeed the same person as
    amoss@cs.huji.ac.il.

    Thanks.
