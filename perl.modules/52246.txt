Can anyone help me to close a PAUSE account with the name ICYDEE?

I created this account 18 months or more ago but before I could verify 
my email address I was switched jobs, and email addresses, and so I 
cannot now access the account.

No problem really since I created account ICD but I would like to keep 
things tidy and remove the un-used account.

Can anyone help me with this? Or just delete the account? (It has no 
modules associated with it).

Regards
Ian C. Docherty (IcyDee aka ICD)
