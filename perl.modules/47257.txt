Hi,
I coded a call to getOpenFile and the module was not found.
There are endless references to this module on the web - but they are all complaints and documentation !  No source code.
My install of Tk-804.027 has a .pod file but no .pm.
Where the hell is this thing ?  Has it been withdrawn ?
They even have a screen shot of it in O'Reilly's "Mastering
Perl/TK".  Very mysterious.. Thanks in advance.
