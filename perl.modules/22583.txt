     why:

    I plan to contribute mostly web-related modules. First of all, a
    CGI framework, which incorporate a fast replacement for CGI.pm, a
    module that supports user sessions and session persistence, an
    exception class with ability to dump the stack trace, an
    object-oriented wrapper over DBI, ACL-based access control module,
    and other modules. This framework is a complete solution for
    developing several (related or not) websites under one virtual
    hosting account. Also, I have some utility modules that, I believe,
    are interesting too.
