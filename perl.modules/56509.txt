It's not bad per se to have a distribution name which differs from the 
contained namespaces. libwww does this, for example. The reason for the 
grief is just that the *registered* namespace (the one which was 
manually registered with modules@perl.org) differs from all package 
names. That's how my scripts thought there was no implementation on CPAN.

The only workaround I know is to have such an empty package.

package AFS::Command;
use strict;
1;

__END__

=pod here if you like

I think I mentioned in my initial reply that it's up to you whether you 
want to do that. Though it helps if somebody clicks on "AFS::Command" in 
the modules list and actually gets to see the module :)

Best regards,
Steffen
