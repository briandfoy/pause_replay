The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBI::MySperql
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: Enables one line sql calls w DBI and MySQL.
  userid:      ROGERHALL (Roger A Hall)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    bioinformatics.ualr.edu iosea.com

  similar:
    unknown

  rationale:

    This module is very effective for new programmers and coders from
    other fields, like in Bioinformatics. Many of our clients are
    researchers with backgrounds in Life Sciences who want technical
    skills in order to have more control over their own data.

    MySperql is simple once you understand sql statements perl
    references, which inspire the "type" parameter below, which map to
    the various DBI fetch statements ($type = ['@' | '\@' | '\@@');

    use DBI; use DBI::MySperql;

    $dbh = &DBConnect(%parameters);

    $return = &SQLExec($sql, $type, \%parameters); @return =
    &SQLExec($sql, $type, \%parameters);

    I feel that it belongs under DBI since it is completely dependent
    upon it. :}

    The code has already been in use for six years, and has been
    recently packaged and sligtly enhanced.

The resulting entry would be:

DBI::
::MySperql        Mdpfp Enables one line sql calls w DBI and MySQL.  ROGERHALL
