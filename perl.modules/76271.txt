     why:

    I would like to be able to upload my work in CPAN. I am working in
    Perl every day (I also work as a Software Engineer and my work is
    primarily done in Perl (but also in Python and Java EE)) and I think
    I can contribute to the community. The first module I would like to
    upload in CPAN is called Template::Dir and it's purpose is to offer
    an easy way to manipulate hierarchies of directories and files, to
    match a general template against a file structure and report the
    degree of compliance to the template, and to create templates based
    on custom configurations and some other options related to this.

    I would also want to express my willing to get involved in the Perl
    community. I am still learning Perl advanced features and being a
    contributor to CPAN will increase my motivation even more.

    Thank you. Best Regards. Catalin.
