     why:

    I am mostly finished with a Games::Dice::Probability module that
    provides distributions and probabilities for a recursively-parsed
    die expression. Relies on Parse::RecDescent for recursive parsing,
    and Math::Symbolic::AuxFunctions for the binomial coefficients.

    I eventually hope to integrate more tightly with Games::Dice and/or
    Games::Dice::Advanced, so we could have a single Games::Dice object
    that would recursively parse the same complex die expressions, and
    operate on them as needed.

    Those are my immediate plans. If other modules come to fruition,
    all the better.

    Cheers, Jason
