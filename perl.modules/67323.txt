The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Simple::Procedure
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: An alternative to SQL stored procedures
  userid:      AWNCORP (Al Newkirk)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://code.google.com/p/dbix-simple-procedure/

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is not a new rootlevel namespace so theres that, I choose the
    name DBIx::Simple::Procedure because it depends on DBIx::Simple, and
    it is intended to be an alternative to standard SQL stored
    procedures which are great but are still severely limited in that
    you can't debug them, and writing them is often long winded.
    DBIx::Simple::Procedure attempts to give the developer the basic
    power of a stored procedure while maintaining te flexibility of
    keeping the DB interaction within the code.

  enteredby:   AWNCORP (Al Newkirk)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 24 14:34:49 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::Simple::
::Procedure       RdpOp An alternative to SQL stored procedures      AWNCORP
