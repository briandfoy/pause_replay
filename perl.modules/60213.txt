Subject: McAfee reports a Trojan in PDE-v0.2.12.tar.gz

Ye,

We have had reports from users downloading PDE-v0.2.12.tar.gz that  
McAfee On-Access Scan reported the presence of a Trojan W32/Fujacks! 
htm in the files QuickStartEn.html and QuickStart.html

Doing our own investigation we see that the <script> tag in question  
was first added in PDE-v0.2.6 to all 29 html files under lisp/doc

Whether or not it is a Trojan is not clear to me and I would  
sincerely hope that it is not. However adding "phone home" pings to  
distributions uploaded to CPAN is generally considered unacceptable.

We will be removing all these html files from the search.cpan.org  
interface.

Can you please upload a new release of PDE without those <script>  
tags. I would also like to request that you log into http:// 
pause.cpan.org/ and mark PDE-v0.2.6 PDE-v0.2.9 and PDE-v0.2.12 to be  
deleted from CPAN.

Thanks,
Graham.
