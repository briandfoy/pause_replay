The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URI::ParseSearchString
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: extract search engine query strings
  userid:      SDEN (Spiros Denaxas)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    URI::Sequin

  rationale:

    Most of the approaches I have come across are out of date. For
    example, URI::Sequin still has "mt=" as the registered prefix for
    searches on MSN whereas they have switched to "q=" now. We use my
    module at my work to parse Apache logs with no problem so I thought
    other people as well would find it usefull.

    In the future, I plan to add extra functionality so users can
    easily add/remove search engines through a configuration file.

  enteredon:   Sun Jul 30 23:01:37 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

URI::
::ParseSearchString Rdpfp extract search engine query strings          SDEN
