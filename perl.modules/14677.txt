Dear ,

This module is use in cgi programs which help to modify "url links" ,
while it act like a proxy server but not on http protocol, programmer
would like to modify the links to others web server which could provide such as language translation or filtering and will output the translated content as html (original formatted html) to web client.

I has been suggested HTTP but after consider its usage I decided to
name it in HTML.

Regards,
Paul Lam
