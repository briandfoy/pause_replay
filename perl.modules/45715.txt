Side Note: Inside-Out is _not_ a better object model, it's actually a 
more troublesome and less flexible object model. However, it is a vastly 
more _secure_ object model.

So you'd normally only want to use it when you suspect someone may want 
to muck with your class' internals and you _really_ want to make sure 
that doesn't happen.
