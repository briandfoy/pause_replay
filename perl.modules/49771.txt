The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Mmap::SimpleShare
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Share structures using anonymous mmap
  userid:      ADUITSIS (Αθανάσιος Δουΐτσης)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    will possibly propose to newsgroup comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    IPC::Mmap

  rationale:

    Since this module heavily relies on IPC::Mmap, it seemed
    appropriate to name it under that. Please note that there is not
    inheritance involved, just one module uses the other.

    I just made up the word ShareSimple, wanting to stress that we are
    aiming for simplicity.

    As for uniqueness, as far as I can tell, there are excellent
    choices already at CPAN when it comes to IPC, but I needed something
    that does not map to a regular file (eg. I really mmap to /dev/zero)
    and that does present a minimal interface, so that it can be used
    immediately.

    Lastly, as for listing in the list, I thought that someone else
    besides me might find the module useful some day.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::Mmap::
::SimpleShare     adpOp Share structures using anonymous mmap        ADUITSIS
