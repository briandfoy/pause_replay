Hi Todd,

Your name is given as author for the Sendmail::PMilter package.  Your
email addresses are given too, but I gather that you're not interested
in maintaining it any more.  I've now taken over the maintainership of
the package because I use it for my own Perl milter (which I intend to
publish in the not too distant future) and there are a few wrinkles to
be ironed out.  The Sendmail::PMilter package seems generally in very
good shape, and consistent with stability, and my need for support for
my milter and also perhaps others which may use your package, I intend
to do as little as possible to it.

For my own work I'm using the prefork dispatcher, which appears sound
at least on my fairly low-volume mail servers.  All I've done so far
for my own purposes is change the default dispatcher and tweak a regex
which is used to check the SMTP reply codes (to allow for codes which
have been published in RFC7372, more recently than Sendmail::PMilter).

It's possible that the work I do on Sendmail::Milter will stimulate
a bit of email traffic, and I wonder how you feel about that.

If you'd prefer I can make a note to the effect that you do not wish
to receive mail about the package, or remove your email addresses from
the package, and/or change the authorship with credit to you, or just
remove your name and contact details entirely.  I have no preference,
and I would not wish to take any of the credit for your work.  Please
let me know what you would like me to do.  As I expect you can imagine
there's no rush, it will likely be months before I release any changes
to CPAN, although I'll probably try to get some discussion going.

Incidentally I see that at least one person has forked the package on
Github.  If you know of any similar work I should be grateful for any
pointers that you can offer.

Finally, a big "THANK YOU" for the Sendmail::PMilter package!

Kind regards,
Ged.

PS: I'm afraid if you reply from a 'free' email account rather than
one of those I've written to, your message might be rejected. :(
