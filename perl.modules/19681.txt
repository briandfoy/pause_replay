     why:

    First project is DB2::db, a framework around DBI and DBD::DB2. This
    project started as simply a framework for creating tables (DBD
    dependant) and has expanded to include altering tables, querying,
    updating, and inserting. The modules are DB2::db, DB2::Table, and
    DB2::Row. "DB2" namespace was chosen based partly on the existance
    of Oracle and Sybase namespaces. "db" rather than "DB" may look like
    a pragma, except that it's in a namespace, and "DB" might be
    confused for the DB module which I thought would be worse (given the
    way that the DB module is treated special). Of course, the namespace
    is still modifyable - this is already its third namespace I've used.
