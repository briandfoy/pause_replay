Hello. I'm writing to request a PAUSE developer's account for CPAN
per the instructions here: 
http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#registering

name: Ashley Pond V
email: ashley@sedition.com
home: http://sedition.com
preferred id: ASHLEY (or POND)

planning to contribute:
I would like to contribute a web research assistant framework. It
would probably be a family of modules (is now and it's in its 2nd
draft). I may have something interesting for the Acme:: and CGI::
namespaces as well; and I might like to help patch and extend some
documentation as permitted/welcomed by the concerned authors.

Thank you!
-Ashley
