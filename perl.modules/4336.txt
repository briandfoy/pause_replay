This is an option. Some of the downsides:

* Since the current Net::SSH on CPAN is basically a wrapper around the ssh
command line client, and mine is a Perl implementation of an ssh client, the
code bases are *drastically* different. There is no overlap whatsoever, so I
can't see it being anything more than a namespace takeover.

* Despite the fact that I think a Perl Net::SSH is very useful and
beneficial, I think there still is a place for a wrapper around the client.
Things like Rhosts/RSA authentication (which require read access to the
server host key, readable only by root) are trickier when using a Perl
module than when using the ssh client, which is setuid root.

I will get in touch w/ the author of the current Net::SSH to determine what
he feels about this, though.

bye,
Ben
