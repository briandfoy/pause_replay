Hi Andreas, hi modules@,

I recently uploaded a CPAN distribution of lib.pm. I have co-maintenance
permissions. However, the indexer didn't pick it up (at all). I.e. I
only received two mails from the indexer.

Maybe it's related to that I (have to) generate lib.pm only at make time?

Best regards,
Steffen
