    DESCRIPTION

    This module provides an output class for logging to shared files
    under the Log::Dispatch system.

    Log messages are written using the flock file locking mechanism on
    a per write basis which means that this module is suitable for
    sharing a log file in a multitasking environment.

    This class descends directly from Log::Dispatch::Output.

    OTHER SIMILAR CLASSES

    Log::Dispatch::File doesn't provide any locking mechanism which
    makes it unsuitable for sharing log files between multiple processes
    (unless you don't mind having corrupt log messages on rare
    occasions).

    Log::Dispatch::File::Locked does implement locking, but on a per
    open handle basis which means that only a single process can log to
    the file as long as the file is open. All other processes will
    block. The only way to prevent other processes from blocking is to
    close thehandle after every write which degrades logging performance
    very much. Therefore this class too is unsuitable for sharing log
    files between multiple processes.
