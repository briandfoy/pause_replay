Thanks for that. The statistic was only published a few years ago, so
it's not likely to be highly referenced in Google. And it's not all
surprising that a drug reference takes precedence over statistics on
google, is it, be it a new or old statistic. The statistic is called
"Pot" in the literature, short for "potential energy", just like there is 
a statistic called "Chi-square" and so on. One can't be more accurate. I
don't know what you mean by "binning". I won't google on it though, I'm
sure to come up with rubbish. Is that okay then?

Is "pot" a common name for this sort of thing? Google's results were
polluted about statistics of marijuana. This seems to be the same thing
I used to called binning.

If Curiously, there are a lot of other things called "Schmidt's test",
including one for fermentation.

Is there a name that might make the functionality of the module more
clear to other users?
