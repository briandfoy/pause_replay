Request to register new user

fullname: Daniel Jones

    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    I'm a full time Perl developer and I'm working through the
    Intermediate Perl textbook (previously completed Learning Perl as
    part of a group as can be seen on my GitHub page). In future I would
    like to be able to contribute back to modules as I feel like I'm
    starting to get comfortable with the inner workings of them.
