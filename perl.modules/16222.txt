CPANers,

DJ passed his Finance::YahooQuote module on to me, and I would like to upload
0.18.  As I understand the PAUSE documentation, I can't do that unless it is
registered in my name.

DJ is ok with this per prior email, he is CC'ed here just in case.

Thanks for all your work on CPAN.

Regards,  Dirk
