Sorry for the delay in replying.

Authen::Email doesn't seem a *bad* choice. How about 
Authen::EmailVerification? Hmm. Doesn't include other use cases well. I 
guess Authon::Email is as good as anything I can come up with. When I 
just read the namespace, I can't infer what exactly it's doing, though.

Best regards,
Steffen
