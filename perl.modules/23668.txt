The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IRR
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Internet Route Registry client interface
  userid:      TCAINE (Todd Caine)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This modules is a client interface to the Internet Routing Registry
    database server, http://www.irrd.net/. The IRRd was designed and
    written by Merit and is used by RIPE NCC for the Route Arbiter
    Database, RADB.

    The first version of this module that I uploaded to the CPAN was
    called IRR.pm. As we all know, this creates a new namespace in the
    CPAN. Since the Perl module is a TCP client interface to the
    Internet Routing Registry database server I figured that Net::IRR
    would be a more appropriate namespace since this module is *VERY*
    internet specific. The only other idea for names that I've had was
    DBIx::IRR although this make it confusing as to what this module
    actually is/does. The fact that the IRR is a highly specialized
    database server, (note that this is not a relational database
    server), isn't as important as the fact that this is a client
    interface that will allow you to connect to a IRRd server on the
    internet to perform client/server exchanges for internet routing
    information.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::IRR             bdpOp Internet Route Registry client interface     TCAINE
