The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DNS::Bananafonana
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Bananafonana encoding / decoding for DNS
  userid:      FOXEY (Michiel Fokke)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    cvs repo @sourceforge (project Bananafonana)

  similar:
    Math::Base85

  rationale:

    The module provides 3 function for encoding and decoding numbers
    (specifically ip addresses) in Bananafonana format:

    RFC 1924 describes a compact, fixed-size representation of IPv6
    addresses which uses a base 85 number system. The base 85 numbers
    (from 0 to 84) are as follows: 0..9 A..Z a..z ! # $ % & ( ) * + - ;
    < = > ? @ ^ _ ` { | } ~

    In order to let human beings pronounce the resulting string more
    easily and to be able to use base 85 encoding in DNS naming schemes,
    an alternative encoding scheme is used, based on 85 consonant-vowel
    pairs, as suggested by DGolden on Slashdot
    (http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=649579&cid=24654733). This
    scheme is named after the children song "Bananafonana".

    The functions are mainly useful for encoding and decoding of ipv4
    and ipv6 addresses in pointer (PTR) records in a DNS server (e.g.
    for automatic generation of matching hostname & ptr record for
    dialup or adsl users).

    For this reason, I've chosen the DNS prefix in the namespace. I am
    happy to take better suiting suggestions...

The resulting entry would be:

DNS::
::Bananafonana    Rdpfp Bananafonana encoding / decoding for DNS     FOXEY
