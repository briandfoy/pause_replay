The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::SundayLetters
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Calculate the sunday letter for a given day
  userid:      RBOW (Rich Bowen)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org

  similar:
    Date::Doomsday, Date::DayOfWeek

  rationale:

    The ancient romans, who had a 8 day week, labelled the days in
    their calendar with a 8-letter cycle A..H, with the first day of the
    year always being A. Knowing what letter was given to the first
    market day in a given year, you would then know, for the whole year,
    when market day would be.

    When the 7-day week came into general use, this same technique was
    used, except that the H was dropped. The market-day reasoning was
    then used to figure out when the Sundays were. These letters came to
    be called the "sunday letters."

    The letter of the first sunday of a given year is called the sunday
    letter for that year. And the letter for a given day is also called
    the sunday letter for that day.

    Leap years are strange, as always. In a yeap year, the 24th and
    25th of February are both F days. Consequently, leap years have two
    sunday letters - one for days before the 24th of February, and a
    different one for days after the 24th of February.

    This module calculates, for any given day of the year, what the
    "sunday letter" is for that day. Or, given a year, it will calculate
    the sunday letter(s) for that year.

    Reference: The Oxford Companion to the Year, page 829-832.
