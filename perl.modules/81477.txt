tl;dr - please upload this code to CPAN without a module list registration

I think both of these names are awful, honestly, and that tying code to
mod_perl any time after 2005 should have been a firing offence.

However, this is perl. You're allowed to completely disagree with me about
the right way to do things.

I do think you've clearly put a lot of thought into this, and I think you're
right that the names won't clash with anything else.

As such, I'd encourage you to upload these modules anyway.

You don't need a modulelist registration. At All. And I'm -not- going to
approve this one - but please do upload Perlet and Perlmazing,
http://metacpan.org and http://search.cpan.org/ will both show them in
search results just fine!

Good luck.
