brian, I'm sending this to you directly despite the Reply-To - my mails
seem to have a significant delay to the list.

The most recent mention of this was from a bit more than a week ago:
<6910a60807260905l5ef977efidff8019f71f54f73@mail.gmail.com>, but there's
been other mention.

However, Reini has been working on B::Generate and friends for a while
now. As I mentioned in yesterday's mail which hasn't made it to the list
yet, Josh has been quite happy to pass on maintenance in the recent
past. I know because that's how I ended up with B::Utils. In principle,
Reini should wait for approval from rgs or Nicholas, but both are very
busy, so the request would likely be overlooked.

Cheers,
Steffen
