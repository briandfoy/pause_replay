module description :  Perl interface to GoldMine for Windows contact manager

a proposed DSLI entry:  GoldMine::GMAPI  cdhO  Wraps the GoldMine API
(mswindows)
in a Perl object.

(GoldMine::GMAPI is merely a proposed name, I would appreciate any
suggestions/guidance in choosing a better namespace. )

discussion:  I have discussed this (verbally) with several goldmine
users and they look forward to the release of this module.

notes:  This
interface grew out of the need to integrate the GoldMine contact manager to
various external systems (AMS Sagitta, DBMS data, etc.).  A number of
GoldMine
users have expressed a desire to access the GoldMine API through an open,
shareable scripting environment.  A number of commercial (and expensive)
products are available, but the GoldMine API is available to anyone willing
to
code in either Delphi, VB or C.  A Perl wrapper extends the accessibility to
the
data management functions of GoldMine to an even wider audience.

GoldMine is a registered trademark of GoldMine Software Corporation, of
course.
The API is accessible from the GoldMine DLL (GM4S32.DLL) and, according to
GoldMine Software, the dll doesn't require any special licensing. Module

Description: This module implements the GoldMine Win32 API methods found in
GM4S32.DLL. The API calls provided ensure the consistent handling of
GoldMine
contact data. See GoldMine's documentation regarding the cons of direct
database
update versus using DDE Macros or the GM4S32 API. The primary value of using
the
API functions is that they insure the update of the sync logs, allowing your
data changes to propagate to remote GoldMine users. They also simplify the
assignment of valid accountno and recid codes (GoldMine's foreign and
primary
keys).
In addition to having the BDE (Borland Data Engine) and GM4S32.DLL installed
(if
you have GoldMine, you have this stuff), this module requires Aldo Calpini's
dada@divinf.it Win32::API Module.

This module is essentially written and is now being tested by a GoldMine
user.
