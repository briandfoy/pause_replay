Dear modules@,

an old item from my todo list has reached alpha status. Please visit
PAUSE and see the new menu items "view permissions" and "change
permissions".

Summary: People should now be able to understand how the permission
system works, can elect co-maintainers, can give up permissions they
have, etc. It's not finished, but the functionality that is mostly
needed is there.

I'd welcome feedback about the UI, the wording, and the whole matter.
Is it too complicated? Have I forgotten about something? Any ideas
that make it easier to use are very welcome.

Thanks,
--
