I think you did, too. Thanks! (Including L::Z::Barakhinei, which I
hadn't mentioned but which has a version or two up on CPAN already.)

I suppose so. I'd appreciate input from the modules@perl.org crew as to
what would be a good namespace.

I put it into Lingua:: because I use it to work with natural languages
(changing one language into another by regular sound change), but it's
not specific to any particular language and could really be used with
any text (hence Text:: or String:: as other possibilities).

Has anyone any advice for me? If you need to know more about what the
module does to decide, please ask.

Cheers,
Philip
