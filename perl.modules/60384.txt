The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LSF_PERL_API
  DSLIP:       bdpfo
  description: Platform's LSF APIs to be called by perl.
  userid:      LSFISV (PlatformISV)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.hpccommunity.org/forumdisplay.php?f=53

  similar:
    LSF-Base LSF-Batch

  rationale:

    There are two modules allowing Platform's LSF APIs to be called by
    PERL.

    In the Base module, the APIs allow PERL application programs to
    contact the Load Information Manager (LIM) and Remote Execution
    Server (RES) daemons in order to obtain LSF services. These services
    include obtaining static system configuration information and
    dynamic load information for the hosts in distributed clusters,
    obtaining task placement advice from LIM, executing tasks (UNIX
    processes) on remote hosts with a high degree of transparency using
    RES, remote file operations across hosts that do not share file
    systems, performing remote terminal I/O and signal operations, and
    other related functions. The developer can build distributed
    applications on top of PERL with these APIs to effectively exploit
    the resources available on the network, improving application
    performance and resource accessibility.

    In the Batch module, the APIs allow PERL application programs to
    get information about the hosts, queues, users, jobs and
    configuration of the batch system; PERL application programs can
    also submit jobs, control hosts, queues and jobs, read batch log
    files and write batch error messages.

The resulting entry would be:

LSF_PERL_API      bdpfo Platform's LSF APIs to be called by perl.    LSFISV
