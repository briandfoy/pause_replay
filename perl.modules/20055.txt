I quite understand. My comments were as much directed towards
modules@perl.org [CC'd] as to you. I wasn't suggesting that you had
to change the name. Naturally now the name has been approved we'll
all live with it if you can't find the time to change it.  No problem.

It's up to modules@perl.org to avoid it setting any precedents.
