The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IP::Match
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Efficiently match IP addrs against IP ranges
  userid:      MARCEL (Marcel Grunauer)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    london.pm

  similar:
    Net::Netmask

  rationale:

    This module provides you with an efficient way to match an IP
    address against one or more IP ranges. Speed is the key issue here.
    If you have to check several million IP addresses, as can happen
    with big logs, every millisecond counts. If your way to check an
    address involves a method call and some temporary variables, a lot
    of time is burnt. In such a time-critical loop you don't want to
    make subroutine calls at all, as they involve stack operations.

    So the approach we take here is that of a macro, preprocessed
    through Perl's source filter mechanism.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::IP::
