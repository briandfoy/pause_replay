Although I wrote "Schedule::Comparator" might be nice in reply to
Andreas's email (hmm, it seem not to have reached the list...),
that's sounds better - I think I'll go with that.

Well, 4b is already in. You can do it by passing certain parameters
to crash detecting function. And with 4b implemented, 4a should be
easy - just run it in a loop to check all events and take the event
with closest invocation time.

And, here's the registration info:

  Name:        Schedule::Match
  DSLI:        adpr
  Description: Handles pattern-based schedule in crontab(5)-like structure.
  Info:        TAIY

I'll upload the module in next few hours.
