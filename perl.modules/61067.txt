Hi Perl hackers

I'm the author of IPTables::libiptc.

I'm getting a lot of failed test reports, because my "make test" needs
to be run as root (as it calls iptables via the library libiptc).

Its it possible to specify in my module that CPAN testers:

1) needs to run "make test" as root.

2) only compile this for a Linux platform.


Hope you can help me our, I have tried to google for the answer, but I
couldn't find something that answered my questions.
