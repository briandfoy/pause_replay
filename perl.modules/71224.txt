Hello,

I am completely new to CPAN module authorship and so I apologize in 
advance for something I've obviously missed.

In short, I've been working on a VirtualBox API, a wrapper for the 
command line version of Sun's VirtualBox system, and any day now I'd 
like to upload my results to CPAN (after I've received a little peer 
review from some friends).  I've got an OO framework and a few necessary 
features, so I think it's pretty much ready to be unleashed.

I'm mailing you because someone is squatting the VirtualBox namespace, 
he hasn't touched the code since 2008.  I've mailed him a few days ago, 
no response quite yet.   If you look at the CPAN page for 
VirtualBox::Manage, you'll pretty much see mentions of a placeholder for 
the code.  It's totally barebones, and my code has nothing to do with 
it.  I'm ready and willing to try my hand at getting something useful 
for the community, and it happens that I have plenty of free time these 
days to do so.

My question to you is, how do these things typically work?

If the author doesn't want to relinquish control of the namespace, do I 
just create my own arbitrary (albeit poorly named) namespace?  Something 
ilke, VirtBox::?  Or, is there a better route to take?

Last question, where do I go about creating a CPAN account for myself in 
anticipation?

Thank you in advance for any feedback,

Matt
