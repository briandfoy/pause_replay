Hi all,

I'd like to request PAUSE registration to contribute the following:

Author: Mark D. Maunder
Email: mark@swiftcamel.com
Homepage: www.swiftcamel.com
preferred userid: MAUNDER
proposed namespace: Apache::ClientReloadCache
Description of module:
Control's greedy clients (browsers repeatedly hitting the same URL in
rapid succession) under Apache/mod_perl by serving the page the client
has already been served from a shared memory cache (so the client
doesn't see the standard 503 error, but gets served actual content).
This prevents a website's database from getting hammered when
regenerating dynamic content for the greedy client. It has configurable
options like number of requests before the client starts seeing cached
content and can uniquely identify clients by a cookie or by IP address.
It runs as a mod_perl content handler and requires an entry in
httpd.conf and two lines in the users existing code. It can work as a
chained handler (alongside an existing handler) or with any
Apache::Registry scripts. Developed in response to IE users holding down
the F5 key on our site.

kind regards,

Mark Maunder.
