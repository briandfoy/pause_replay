Hi modules@,

I just reread Andy's request for the HTML::Simple namespace. It's no 
longer necessary to transfer it since he moved to another name, but the 
general issue remains.

There's a lot of registered namespaces for which there never were any 
modules released to CPAN.

Should there be some kind of expiry on registrations? I am thinking of 
something reasonably long, like a year or so.

Best regards,
Steffen

P.S.: I actually kind of like the idea that nobody is going to get an 
HTML::Simple indexed, ever. (Unless TOMC comes back.) *::Simple should 
be banned. ;)
