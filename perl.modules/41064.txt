about what you talking about? i can't understand
maybe you mean problem problem with relative paths on threaded mod_perl2?

  # well, quick solution
  use lib substr($ENV{SCRIPT_FILENAME}, rindex($ENV{SCRIPT_FILENAME}, '/'));

what you said it is not universal solution.
and exists many many examples, where it's can't help.
i have made universal solution

yes, i am renaming packages in compile time. the "personal" it is not best
name for this operation
but! user don't need to think about that:
'use personal PACKAGE' - it said what user want use the PACKAGE only
personaly! and no one other scripts
will access to this loaded copy of PACKAGE. better name 'use local' but
'local' is busy by built in directive.

"to tailor a bunch of code to use it" - i am understanding, what my
documentation is very pure. in
near future i will write more and will be many examples.

"mod_perl traps" - mod_perl1 have not other serious traps. mod_perl2 have,
but not in this area.

ps: i am understanding, what it is the last message in conversation, but..
time will tell
