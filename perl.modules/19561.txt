The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Search
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A simple way of  searching a flat-text db
  userid:      TMURRAY (Timm Murray)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    PerlMonks.org

  similar:
    HTML::Widgets::Search Text::Scan DBIx::FullTextSearch

  rationale:

    CGI::Search has the goal of being easy to generate a simple search
    over a flat-text database file and create HTML output to be sent to
    a web browser. Further, validation of user input and database fields
    is tied tightly into its implementation, thus providing no excuses
    for developers who don't do validation. Further, the output can be
    templated using HTML::Template.

    HTML::Widgets::Search is the closest of the above listed modules to
    CGI::Search. However, it relies on a functional database interface
    and uses an inline HTML syntax (somewhat similar to PHP) instead of
    HTML::Template. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but many
    people are already familer with HTML::Template and might even be
    able to use CGI::Search with only minor changes to their existing
    HTML::Template-formated documents. Further, HTML::Widgets::Search
    doesn't provide user-input validation.

    Text::Scan is somewhat similar to CGI::Search in its approach to
    doing the search, but it doesn't abstract away certain functionality
    that is typical in CGI applications. Text::Scan could potentially be
    used as a backend for CGI::Search.

    DBIx::FullTextSearch is specific, not just to a full database, but
    to MySQL (according to the documentation). Like Text::Scan, it also
    doesn't abstract away functionality typical in CGI applications.

The resulting entry would be:
