Bleading busy, I must say, but I'm getting so bored from these other
works that I'm not taking any new projects since September. They just
never get finished:-/

There are always several things that need to be improved
simultaneously, I usually post my Todo list somewhere below
http://pause.kbx.de/, currently it is in /news.html. I'll make it more
visible within the evolving user interface.

I think, now that we have the add_mod functionality, what we should
offer next is exactly what you said, the "apply for the registration
of a module" form. Suggestions for the proper wording and for the
exact questions in that form would be more than welcome.

I cannot agree with the idea of fully automating. We need to achieve
several improvements to the infrastructure before we can open the
floodgates to module spamming. I just don't feel ready for that.
