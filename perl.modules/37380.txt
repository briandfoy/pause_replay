New Year's greetings from Voicent Communications! 
 
In the past you have contacted Voicent regarding Voicent's products.  We are
hopeful that Voicent products continue to improve your communications efforts
in your work and daily life. In welcoming the new year, we have a new resolution:
 

*** AutoReminder supports multiple users ***

Voicent's AutoReminder product can now support multiple users per license.
For example, in a group doctor's clinic, each doctor can have 
his/her own appointment schedule and reminder calendar.  In addition, a 
doctor can design his/her own reminder messages to maintain privacy and 
personal contact with his patient. Yet all data are still maintained in a single
database and can be viewed and managed together or separately. 


*** Seamless Integration with Customized Import **** 

If you already have office management software that does everything except 
patient appointment reminder calls or if you want to take advantage of 
Voicent's advanced features, the Voicent integration team is available to 
integrate your existing capability with Voicent products.  Simply provide 
us with a sample of your patient scheduling data and our integration 
engineers can write a customized program to automatically convert
your patient scheduling data into the Voicent AutoReminder format. Voicent's
team is capable of integrating virtually any existing text data format with
Voicent products at a very low cost.  If you are utilizing an appointment call
service, consider cost and efficiency. There’s simply no other system  that
offers the capabilities of Voicent AutoReminder at such an affordable price.
Voicent charges a one time license fee and then the product is yours. No
monthly fees, no set up fees, no per call charges, no more data 
submission to your reminder service provider, etc. You own PC does everything
for you. You can make as many calls as you like.


*** Perl and PHP Programming Interface ***

If you are Voicent Gateway application developers, we also have 
good news for you. We have added support for Perl and PHP interfaces.
