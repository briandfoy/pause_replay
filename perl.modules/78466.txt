Dear modules@perl.org elders,

	This is an humble request to get the maintainer bit on 
Business::CanadaPost and GnuPG.

The first is owned by Justin Wheeler, and I would like to apply a patch 
to the module to make it talk to the right server (the server changed 
since the last release in 2005, and the module is useless without the 
patch).  Justin's CPAN email is no longer valid, and the domain itself
seems to be parked, without further information. I tried to find any 
other sign of Justin elsewhere, but had no luck.

For GnuPG, the currently active co-maintainer (ROBBIEBOW if memory 
serves me) already gave me the co-maintainership bit for all modules... 
all except for GnuPG itself, as he's not the owner. We tried to ping 
FRAJULAC, without luck. And again, my stalking skills failed me and I 
wasn't able to find traces of him anywhere else.

Your humble supplicant,
`/anick
