From: dsb@world.std.com (David Boyce)

I maintain a suite of ClearCase-related modules located (naturally) in the 
ClearCase::* namespace. There are now 5 or 6 of these so I decided recently 
that a bundle might be convenient. I followed exactly the instructions at 
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_make_bundle to create 
Bundle::ClearCase and uploaded it but still, weeks later, it doesn't work. 
For instance:

	% perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::ClearCase"

results in

	Warning: Cannot install Bundle::ClearCase, don't know what it is.

My best guess is that bundles must be registered via this mailing list to 
be useable. Is that the case? If so, I'd like to ask that it be registered. 
If not, does anyone know another reason it should fail to work? The bundle 
is definitely present on CPAN, just not useable qua bundle.

A little more background: while I've gone through official 
namespace-negotiation procedures for my general-purpose modules, I've not 
bothered to do so with the ClearCase ones. Since ClearCase::* already 
exists and is the obvious parent namespace, and since most people on this 
list aren't likely to either know or care enough about ClearCase minutiae 
to be involved in choosing the lower-level name, I've skipped that step 
though in some cases I've debated the name within the ClearCase community. 
Anyway, is it possible that a bundle doesn't work unless all its _members_ 
are officially registered? Seems unlikely.

Thanks,
David Boyce
