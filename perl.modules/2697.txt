Contributions:	Tie::SortHash
			This module is designed to be a light weight way of
keeping a persistet sort for hashes.  Tie::IxHash and Tie::LLHash both have
their places and uses and are very good, however, Tie::SortHash is developed to
be very light weight and nearly transparent to use.  You can specify your own
sort block and make it as complex as you like, including sorting on values.  The
other modules mentioned have different symantics and just aren't too the
point.  Also, I'm aware of using DB_File and such, however that isn't intuitive.

		Eventually: Pod::XML
			When I get around to finishing it.

		Other modules that I think up, maintain and/or usefull utilities
and the like.

Thanks.
