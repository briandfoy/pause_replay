Hi Simon, Marcus, and Matt,

At the start of October I emailed you and others about old releases of DB=
Ix-Class appearing in the index, for modules which don=E2=80=99t have any=
 indexing permissions. Half of the old releases have been deleted now.

Would you be happy to delete your old releases please=3F I can do this fo=
r you, if you like. If I do, you=E2=80=99ll get a confirmation email from=
 PAUSE, and will have 72 hours to change your mind before PAUSE actually =
deletes the files.

Why am I doing this=3F As PAUSE has evolved, the permissions model has ch=
anged, PAUSE now tries to ensure consistent permissions on all packages w=
ithin a distribution, otherwise various problems can arise. I=E2=80=99m t=
idying up the historical baggage, so things are cleaner going forwards.

Thanks,
Neil
