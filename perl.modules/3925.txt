What I'm planning to contribute:

Math::BooleanArray   adpO  Parse boolean expressions

    BooleanArray parses a boolean expression and creates an
    array of elements in the expression.  By setting each
    element to 1 or 0 you can evaluate the expression.

CheckList      adpO  Track to-do items. Arbitrarily add to list

    Create a "to do" checklist of items. Each item is marked
    as true or false.  You can arbitrarily add items to the
    list at any time using the set() method.  Items can be added
    multiple times without changing their "done" status. Use next()
    to step through items that have not been marked as "done" yet.
    Originally written for a web spider to keep track of which
    pages still need to be processed even as the list is
    still growing.

PublicInternal adpO  Keep separate hashes of public/internal data

    PublicInternal is intended for use as a base class for other
    classes. Users of a class based on PublicInternal can assign
    any keys to the object hash without interfering with keys used
    internally.  The internal data can be accessed by retrieving
    the internal hash with the internal() method. This module is
    not the same concept as James Duncan's Protect module for
    declaring private subroutines.  PublicInternal is for allowing
    a public hash and an internal (though not private) hash.

These modules have not, as yet, been discussed in any public venue.  These
modules are
part of an application named PtCgi I am writing for "Web Site Toolbox", to
be published by O'Reilly this spring. It is my goal to build an open source
effort around PtCgi.  Joining PAUSE and publishing these modules are steps
toward that goal.
