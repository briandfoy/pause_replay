This is easily achieved by making your intention well-known on the
modules@ list, as you have done now, so when future requests on
Rosetta::* crops up, we can inform the submitter to get in contact with
you first.

Sure; you can clearly indicate this wish in the Rossetta documentation.

According to my understanding, the author that proposes the original
FrameworkName::* do have a socially-accepted control over the namespace
under that toplevel.  However, this only regulates the official module
list, and does not impede on uploading of off-list modules.

The most authoratative way is to state it clearly and strongly in
Rosetta's README and documentation, which I assume would've been read
by anybody working on Rosetta::* extensions.

You can already do this by registering the toplevel namespce first.

This is already the case on search.cpan.org.  For example, whilst there
is no I18N.pm around, one can nevertheless click on=20

    http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Internationalization_Locale/I18N

and see all modules that have the I18N prefix.
