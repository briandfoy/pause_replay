Subject: Module submission Mysql::Connector
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mysql::Connector
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Mysql connection factory; easy DBI
  userid:      NICZERO (Nic Sandfield)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBI DBD::Mysql

  rationale:

    This is a convenience wrapper around DBI, specialised for MySQL,
    providing DB connectors. A connector inherits and retains its
    configuration, providing easy access to pre-configured DBI
    connections. It makes it easy to declare default parameters. It
    makes it easy to use credential files, avoiding putting credentials
    inside sourcecode, thereby greatly improving security.

    The module is of greatest benefit to code that makes more than one
    database connection, but will also be popular with those wanting an
    easy way of getting their database parameters correct (eg utf8,
    auto-commit, raise-exception).

  enteredby:   NICZERO (Nic Sandfield)
  enteredon:   Sat Nov  6 19:48:02 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mysql::
::Connector       bdpOg Mysql connection factory; easy DBI           NICZERO
