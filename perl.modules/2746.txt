    First, I would suggest `Telephone' above `Phone'.  `Phone' could
refer to linguistics.

    Then, I think that ::NA is not such a good idea, because many
people will read that as an acronym for `not applicable' or `not
available'.  NorthAmerica is clearer, IMHO.

    I suggest you start by reading the `perlxstut' manpage.

    If you're not sure if you need comp.lang.perl.modules, then you need
it.  :^)

    Good luck!
