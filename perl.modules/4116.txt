This is a follow-up to my January 2 message, where I was requesting 
the namespace HTML::FormTemplate.

Here is the DLSI:

HTML::
::FormTemplate    adpO Store definition, make persist forms, report DUNCAND

While before I gave just promises, now I have delivered.

I have uploaded the file HTML-FormTemplate-1.02 on PAUSE a few hours 
ago, where it can be seen at 
"http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/".

So in case you were waiting to see the finished product before 
processing my request, you can see it whenever the directory is 
refreshed.

Thank you,

// Darren Duncan
