Hi,

I recently got bitten by installing File::Stat on my Mac, as it =
superseded File::stat, the core module. This broken various things, but =
I only discovered this when two CPAN authors emailed me about some =
failing reports I sent to CPAN testers (I'm using CPAN::Reporter). I =
discovered there are a number of other examples like this on CPAN, and =
as CPAN grows it could happen more.

I've written up the issue, so I could email this short message to the =
PAUSE admins:

=
http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2013/02/pause-permissions-should-be-case=
-insensitive.html

I think the "right solution" is to make PAUSE's permissions model case =
insensitive, and to resolve the current problem cases (I know, much =
easier said than done).

A partial solution would be to let things progress as now, but notify =
people when they upload problem modules, and hope they rename them. This =
would still leave the potential for people to unwittingly shoot =
themselves in the foot.

And maybe I've missed the best solution ... :-)

Cheers,
Neil
