Hello.

I'd like to request a CPAN Author ID and contribute a module to the
archive.

  Name:               Bruno Connelly
  e-mail:             bruno@whack.org
  Preferred User ID:  BRUNO

DSLI entry:

  Name              DSLI Description                                  Info

  WebSpective::BCD  adpO Interface to the WebSpective BCD package     BRUNO

Basically, this module is a direct interface to the WebSpective Binary
Content Distribution package.  I initially created this module in
order to make it easy to automate the configuration/management of the
package for use internally.  However, many people I have spoken to
that also use this package have expressed interest in it's
availability.

WebSpective has recently been purchased by Inktomi, and the package is
now called the Inktomi Content Distribution System.  However,
everything is still referenced as the WebSpective BCD within the
package, hence the name I have given the module.  Any advice on the
namespace for this module would, of course, be appreciated.

The basic purpose of the WebSpective BCD itself is content mirroring,
(an intelligent rsync), and forward deployment of content into an
Inktomi Traffic Server instance.

Thanks,

--bruno
