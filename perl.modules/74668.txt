Yeah, I was using windows and creating the tarball with 7z. My solution was
to just move the module to a linux machine and create the tarball there. A
friend of mine suggested distzilla, but I think I'll try (your)
Module::Release. Perhaps my buddy and I can compare dist tools.

Thanks,
Cameron

You could just check your local distribution to see if it has<br>

<br>
How are you creating the distribution and uploading it? Which operating<br>
