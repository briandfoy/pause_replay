It's been a while since my last message

    I'm taking over XML::TokeParser, mmkay ;)
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2003-03/msg00705.html

to which EBOHLMAN did reply and ok'd my taking over maintenance of XML-TokeParser,
but he has not actually given me permission via PAUSE.

So can somebody, EBOHLMAN or one of you powerful PAUSE/modules@perl.org 
guys give me the appropriate PAUSE permissions?


Thanks.
BTW - it turns out that XML-TokeParser didn't disappear from cpan,
but that the indexer somehow skipped it.
Currently it doesn't show up in any searches on search.cpan.org.
