The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::NDS
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Routines to work with a perl nested data str
  userid:      SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::DRef

  rationale:

    This is intended to be a complete set of routines for working with
    nested data structures. Currently, it does three main tasks:

    It can access a value in a data structure. It can merge two data
    structures. It can test the structural validity of a structure.

    The ability to access a value in a data structure is similar to
    Data::DRef, but that module has not undergone active development in
    some time. Also, the planned scope of this module is such that using
    the Data::DRef module never appeared practical.

    As far as merging two data structures, and structural validity
    checking, no other module supports this functionality to my
    knowledge.

    I plan to add support for searching the data structure and data
    validity checking. Some of this functionality may be done by calls
    to Data::Search, Data::Domain, Data::Validator, or
    Data::Validate::XSD, but I have got to examine them more closely to
    see what is practical to use.

    Hopefully, it will eventually handle (either directly, or via calls
    to other modules) most of the operations that you could do with a
    nested data structure.
