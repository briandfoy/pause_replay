The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::VIGOR
  DSLIP:       cdhfp
  description: Perl IDE based on the VIM editor
  userid:      PEASE (Mark Pease)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Phoenix.pm

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is a set of utility functions and objects that support
    the Perl VIGOR Integrated Development Environment that is based on
    the VIM editor, a VI clone.

    VIGOR (currently :-) is an acronym for "VIM Ingegrated Graphical
    Operating Room" but that might change.

    The complete VIGOR IDE will be distrubuted with this module.

  enteredby:   PEASE (Mark Pease)
  enteredon:   Wed Jan 23 20:49:25 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::VIGOR           cdhfp Perl IDE based on the VIM editor             PEASE
