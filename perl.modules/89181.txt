No problem at all.
(Simple answer to "Retired?" is "Well, emeritus"-- in the nebulous US 
sense of the word, which can mean "gave most of his hard jobs to other 
people; and is perennially working on his translation of the Ginza Rba 
into Thai", just as well as it could mean "Last I heard, he was an 
arms dealer in Thailand, but somebody said they've seen him at the 
Tommyburger in Burbank."  MORE ON THAT LATER.)

My question for the moment, for anyone, but notably modules@perl.org, is:

Can I delete (some) old items from here...?
   http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/

And: How?-- Is it just a matter of jumping into PAUSE and deleting 
them from my home PAUSE directory and then things are automatic?

And: would this be a bad idea in some notable way?

(I figure if anyone's interest in keeping those around would be just 
historical interest, then if someone *wants* a particular old version 
of something, they're much better off going to http://backpan.perl.org/ )


I bring this up because most (not all) of those links are to things 
that are, at best, uninteresting-- they're not-latest releases of 
things.  (In many cases, *very* not-latest.)

Example:

Follow the link to Class::ISA (0.33) ...
    http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Class-ISA-0.33/
and you'll see the whole detail page for that module... with just one 
little note saying that the most recent release isn't this 0.33, it's 
0.36, click here to go elsewhere.

Ditto my (equals old) versions of Pod::Simple,... HTML-Tree,... 
Test.pm,... and other stuff that's just clutter.  Clutter, just 
distracting crufty clutter.

I'm not talking about deleting active stuff-- I mean *only* stuff, in 
my dir, that other people have released newer versions of.  Like the 
above-mentioned.
(As opposed to IO::Null (for example) whose latest release was by me, 
therefore it stays.)
