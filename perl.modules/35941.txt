The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Bof
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Framework for business oriented problems
  userid:      KAARE (Kaare Rasmussen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Business Oriented Framework consists of a Framework Database in
    PostgreSQL, a POE based server, and modules to handle the Framework,
    Tasks (delayed or recurring requests), Schedules, and Printing.
    There's a Report Writer making PDF documents and there's a Client
    module for clients to issue requests to the server.

    Configuration is XML based, and the server is using SOAP. This
    means that clients can be written in any language for any platform,
    graphical or text based.

    It aims to fill the hole for an Application Server that Perl
    doesn't have. I've been searching for years for reasonable solutions
    before deciding to write BOF.

    I'm not arguing for a new root namespace but there really ought to
    be a chapter for business related modules in the Module List.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::Bof             adpOp Framework for business oriented problems     KAARE
