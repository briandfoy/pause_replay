I usually do not question the usefulness of modules, but in this case
I really wonder who would use it. No usefulness springs into my
perception. If you want @array[5,4,8,7,1,2,3,6], you know where to
find it. Sorry if I'm missing something, but maybe this question helps
us to find a good name:-)

Text:: isn't really closed shop but it's a problematic category
because it has been (mis)used for too many diverse things.

Please elaborate a little about the module to help finding a good
namespace. Thanks!
