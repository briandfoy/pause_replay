Subject: Module submission Number::Theory::CFrac

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Number::Theory::CFrac
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Continued Fraction Object & Methods
  userid:      BARUCH (Baruch Ben-David)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, comp.lang.perl.announce

  similar:
    None known to me.

  rationale:

    This module will contain the continued fraction object (CFrac),
    with various methods to create, manipulate, and display them.
    Various operators are overloaded to permit ease of use. Conversions
    between CFrac and other numeric representations, in particular
    floating point and rational (expressed as numerator and denominator)
    are supported.

  enteredby:   BARUCH (Baruch Ben-David)
  enteredon:   Sun Aug 14 07:58:17 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Number::Theory::
::CFrac           cdphp Continued Fraction Object & Methods          BARUCH
