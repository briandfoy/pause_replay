Hi John,

> This brought back some frustrated memories. I tried to take over =
Math::Brent, for the purpose of upgrading the package and fixing an =
error. I managed to locate John Williams, who was fine with it -- but =
who then couldn't grant me co-maintenance because PAUSE didn't have him =
as the owner (I checked, and all of his modules at that time were =
co-owned by another user, although only one had been worked on).

> [=E2=80=A6]
>=20
> It's now two years later. The other user doesn't seem to have =
ownership anymore, but Math::Brent is still has an outstanding bug.
>=20
> I'm still interested in being a co-maintainer. For that matter, I'd be =
interested in co-maintaining Math::Fortran and Math::Derivative, =
although I would probably retire the Math::Fortran name for something =
like Math::Util.

I=E2=80=99ve had email with the original author (John Williams), and =
he=E2=80=99s said he=E2=80=99s happy for them to be handed over.

I=E2=80=99ve emailed CHORNY, who currently has ownership, to see if =
he=E2=80=99s happy for me to give you ownership of all of them.

Please bear with me a day or so while we try and cross all the t=E2=80=99s=
 and dot the i=E2=80=99s.

Cheers,
Neil
