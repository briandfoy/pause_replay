[I've put Tom Christiansen in Cc -- I'm e-mailing him my original message
 separately]

Quoting andreas.koenig@anima.de:
:Underscores within a root namespace are reserved for private usage
:(except those already taken).

Ah, OK. I did not know that. Fine.

:As there is already a good root namespace with "CGI" itself, I'd put
:it there, say as CGI::Multiform, CGI::Multiplexer, or CGI::Screens, Oh
:wait, there's already a CGI::Screen, so this is taken. Multiplexer
:doesn't match the description for my taste, MultiForm would be fine.
:Please note the capitalization. As multi and form are clearly two
:words, we should capitalize Form.

CGI::State is too good a name to waste.

I think CGI::MultiScreen would be better then. Or perhaps, CGI::MxScreen
to acknowledge the name Tom gave to his script. If he agrees and does not
uses that name already.
