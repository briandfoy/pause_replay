Request to register new user

fullname: Silas Sewell
  userid: SILAS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://silas.sewell.org/
     why:

    I work at Shutterstock and we've created a couple of MogileFS
    plugins for our production cluster (ex:
    https://github.com/silas/MogileFS-Plugin-Migrate).

    We'd like to contribute these as we develop and open source them
    and CPAN seems like the best place to distribute them.

    I work with John Napiorkowski (jjnapiork), he said I should mention
    this and I'd definitely be working with him to publish my first
    couple of modules.
