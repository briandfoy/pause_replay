From: robin@kitsite.com (Robin Houston)

I'd like to register as a CPAN uploader.

name: Robin Houston
email: robin@kitsite.com
preferred user ID: ROBIN
planned contribution:

I am being nagged to put
http://www.kitsite.com/~robin/PadWalker-0.03.tar.gz onto CPAN, because
quite a few people are using it now, and it's even a prerequisite for
a CPAN module of Marcel Grunauer's.

I anticipate that the name will have to change before it's registered
into a namespace (perhaps into Symbol somewhere); could this be dealt
with separately?

 .robin.
