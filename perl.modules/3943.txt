I have written a module named "CheckList".  Here's the synopsis from the
documentation:

   Provides a mechanism for tracking a list of "to do" items.  Each
   item can be added to the list any number of times, but is returned
   only once by the next() or each() commands. CheckList provides two
   interfaces: object oriented and tied hash.

None of the existing top level namespaces seem to quite fit.  Would anybody
like to suggest a top
level namespace?
