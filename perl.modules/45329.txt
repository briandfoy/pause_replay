Do you prefer Pod or HTML?

Hmm, looking at your patch, the following line bother me:

> +		    PREOP => '$(PERL) -i -nle \'print if /^(package|.VERSION)/\'
> $(DISTVNAME)/GD.pm',

Unless I'm wrong, this PREOP command is not portable. First, it assumes
that a shell is available, which is not necessarily the case (MacOS Classic).
Second, it assumes that the single quote can be used as a quoting character,
which is not true everywhere (Win32).

On the other hand, simply adding XSLoader.pm to MANIFEST and the following
line to Makefile.PL before WriteMakefile():
    1 while unlink "XSLoader.pm";

Just Works(tm) as expected.


Thanks anyway for your exaplanation and patch.
