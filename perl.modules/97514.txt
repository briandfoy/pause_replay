Does not seem like a big deal to me.

Yupp.

Sorry, I have to tell you that unless you find a bug on PAUSE you will
not be able to uplaod a file with the same name again. Not in this or in
some other directory. Even after it is deleted.

Please make up your mind to bump the version number and make another
release.
