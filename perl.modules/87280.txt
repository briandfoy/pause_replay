The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::E4SE
  DSLIP:       RdpO2
  description: Communicate with the various Epicor E4SE web
  userid:      CAPOEIRAB (Chase Whitener)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    EFNet #perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module makes communication with the various web services
    provided by Epicor's E4SE a bit simpler. SOAP calls that deal with
    NTLM auth on every single call (no sessions) and they're all spread
    across many different URLs.

    The module utilizes XML::Compile::WSDL11 and LWP::UserAgent with
    Authen::NTLM to make anyone who has to deal with Epicor want to pull
    out their hair a little less than normal.

  enteredby:   CAPOEIRAB (Chase Whitener)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 29 18:51:48 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::
::E4SE            RdpO2 Communicate with the various Epicor E4SE web CAPOEIRAB
