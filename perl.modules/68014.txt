    Padre::Plugin::ShellCommand This plugin reads shell commands from
    the active document and inserts the output of the command into the
    document.

    If text is selected then the plugin will attempt to execute the
    selected text. If no text is selected the the plugin will attempt to
    execute the current line as a command.

    "Commands" can either be valid shell commands, entire scripts (with
    shebang), or environment variables to be evaluated.
