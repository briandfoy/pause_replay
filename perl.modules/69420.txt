However, if I go look at permissions in PAUSE, THALJEF does have rights to them via CRITICRE, e.g. https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=me&pause99_peek_perms_query=Perl%3A%3ACritic%3A%3APolicy%3A%3AValuesAndExpressions%3A%3AProhibitSpecialLiteralHeredocTerminator&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit

The relation between THALJEF and CRITICRE is such:

mysql> select * from list2user where maillistid='CRITICRE';
+------------+----------+
| maillistid | userid   |
+------------+----------+
| CRITICRE   | ELLIOTJS | 
| CRITICRE   | THALJEF  | 
| CRITICRE   | CDOLAN   | 
+------------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

with the effect that these three users should have a menu item in the
PAUSE interface that lets them act on behalf of CRITICRE. The meneu
should be labeled "Select Mailinglist/Action" and when you click on it
you can select "Change Permissions". The upper right corner will then
tell you

  ELLIOTJS <...@...>
  acting as CRITICRE <No email???>
  encrypted session

and on the page below you can change the perrmissions as if you were
CRITICRE.

Would you please try it to see if my predictions work as described?
afaics it only effects
Perl::Critic::Policy::Objects::ProhibitIndirectSyntax,
Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitComplexVersion, and
Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::RequireConstantVersion

That's not correct, search marks modules in dev releases as unauthorized
when PAUSE *would* not index them.

I actually appreciate search's ability to tell the user what they can
expect from the next non-dev release.
