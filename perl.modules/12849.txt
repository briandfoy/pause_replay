The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Petal
  DSLIP:       bmpOa
  description: Perl Template Attribute Language
  userid:      JHIVER (Jean-Michel Hiver)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    petal@lists.webarch.co.uk

  similar:
    Template HTML::Template Text::Template

  rationale:

    TAL is the Zope Page Template templating language. It has a formal
    specification. Petal is a Perl implementation inspired from that
    specification, it stands for "Perl Template Attribute Language"
    (Perl TAL).

    Petal makes it possible to write template files which are entirely
    well-formed XML. I was going to go for XML::Template but since I
    added the ability to process HTML files as well this is not relevant
    anymore.

    Petal cannot be under HTML (because it can process XML templates)
    or XML (because it can process HTML templates as well). It cannot be
    in Template::Petal either because Template is taken by the template
    toolkit.

    So I figured out a top-level name 'Petal' would be allright... Hope
    that's OK with everyone.

The resulting entry would be:

Petal             bmpOa Perl Template Attribute Language             JHIVER
