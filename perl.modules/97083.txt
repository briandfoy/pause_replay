Hi Andy, Leon, Curtis,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat. I=E2=80=99m working =
through all the situations where people have permissions on package =
names which differ only in case. PAUSE used to not mind about this, but =
we=E2=80=99re changing that, since it causes problems on operating =
systems with case-insensitive filesystems.

Andy has first-come permissions on TAP::Parser::Iterator::ARRAY, which =
is in the index against A/AN/ANDYA/TAP-Parser-0.51.tar.gz.
The latest version of TAP-Parser is 0.54, released in August 2007. I =
noticed that includes TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array. Ovid and Leon have =
co-maint on this.

Andy also has first-come permissions (& Ovid and Leon have co-maint) on =
TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array, which is in the index against =
O/OV/OVID/Test-Harness-3.26.tar.gz, but the latest version is 3.36, =
released by Leon in December 2015.

So the latest version of neither module is indexed, and I=E2=80=99m =
guessing that might be down to this permissions conflict. Also, the =
latest version of both dists include TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array, and =
both distributions have plenty of downstream dependencies on CPAN. There =
are a lot of other modules in common between these dists, but I=E2=80=99m =
just looking at the case-varying situations, so my script didn=E2=80=99t =
point those out to me.

I have no noodling idea what the right solution is here, but would like =
us to end up with zero or one package on CPAN that matches =
/TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array/i. Can you suggest the path to =
enlightenment please?

Cheers,
Neil
