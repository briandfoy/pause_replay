Dear PAUSE maintainers,

    I would like to register as a CPAN author. I have created three
modules that, imho, have some degree of usefulness to the wider perl
community.

    The first is a tied hash module, Hash::Strict, that allows
programmers to restrict a hash's keys to a limited set of alowed
values. This is very useful for people who use a hash to represent a
database record or other encapsulated sort of object (a very common
use of hashes), where it is important not to accidentally refer to an
invalid field or member name simply because of a typo. (Perl, of
course, provides no validation of hash keys).

    The second is a trivial tied hash module, Hash::Insensitive, to
allow the programmer to refer to a hash's keys in a case-insensitive
manner. $hash{FOO} is equivalent to $hash{foo}. Although it is trivial,
I have had need for such a module (for manipulating HTML attributes),
so why should anyone else have to reinvent the same wheel.

    The third is a robust class for creating and manipulating HTML
tables.


    I have found nothing on CPAN that resembles the first two modules.
The third, however, is redundant with the existing HTML::Table module.
I believe my module has a much more robust internal data representation,
and I like my interface better, but I am in contact with the maintainer
of HTML::Table.pm and am trying to decide whether it is better to roll
the two together or whether they make more sense as separate modules.


    None of these three modules has been announced to the wider Perl
community. I have discussed them with the programming community on
RPI's 'lily' server, and at least a couple programmers have been using
one or more of these modules for a little while now.  I consider all
of these modules to be "beta" software for the time being.


    Current versions of these modules may be found at:

Hash::Strict      http://employeeweb.myxa.com/eric/hs/
Hash::Insensitive http://employeeweb.myxa.com/eric/hi/
HTML::TableManip  http://employeeweb.myxa.com/eric/tm/


My name is Eric J. Roode.
My email address is eric@myxa.com
I do not have a public homepage.
I would like a CPAN userid of 'roode'.
If 'roode' is not available, then 'e-roode'.

Here's the DSLI info for the modules:

Name              DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------     ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Hash::Strict      bdpO  Create key-limited "strict hashes".          roode
Hash::Insensitive bdpO  Create hashes with case-insensitive keys.    roode
HTML::TableManip  bdpO  Create and manipulate HTML tables.           roode


    Thank you very much,
