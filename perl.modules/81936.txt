Personally, I would hate to see your effort wasted.

I think the only good option would be for Ilya to find time helping you

or via modules@perl.org (but not ownership change).

Ilya, would you object to Rocky getting co-maintenance permissions? 
After all, you apparently[1] approved of his changes.
