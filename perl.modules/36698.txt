I am a very module-oriented person. I have always been impressed with how Perl 
modules describe processes so accurately:

    HTML::Seamstress->weave
    HTML::TreeBuilder->look_down
    DBIx::Connect->to('dev_db')
    $request = new Data::Flow $recipes;

However, there is little on CPAN to group a collection of related modules. I 
often spend time trying to get author a and author b to add each other to their 
SEE ALSO section. Sometimes they bristle at the request and other times they 
don't do it.

Ideally the overarching theme(s) behind a module might be browseable along with 
the module itself:

    you search for DBIx::DBO2
and up comes
    DBIx::Wrapper::Evaluation
for you to peruse a "Consumer Reports" evaluation of DBIx::DBO2 along with 
DBIx::Easy, etc... a CPAN version of those who downloaded this module also 
downloaded.... heheh.

Another good example is Regex::Presuf, Match::Any and by BACKPANNED Regexp::Any 
and a new one I believe called Regexp::Alternation all of which provide the same 
functionality. A nice review article evaluating the useability of these modules 
to build software would be useful.

manpages... then again it is POD and POD2latex POD2pdf POD2html are all there 
ready for the printer. but really just manpages is all I focus on.

> - What's the relationship between the magazine and this mailing list?

now that's a good question. I was hoping for a process flow kind of like this. 
Somebody starts with a position paper written in POD (I submitted one to Alzabo 
earlier today and my post on conjunction of method chains was written in POD and 
then emailed to this list), then a number of people reply. Then the original 
author develops a digest. The one for that topic could be named:

Software::Design::Class::Method::Chaining::techniques

which summarizes all that was learned through the discussion process.

I think it boils down to how you like to author things and how much peer-review 
you want.  I don't like HTML authoring so much. Writing something for intensive 
peer review is good, but I prefer something along the lines of 
comp.lang.perl.moderated in terms of how much scrutiny I want.

We also have the option of packaging working code with our articles. The 
HTML::Mason::vs_perl_oop distribution had working pure Perl to emulation Mason 
autohandling. That is easy with CPAN publishing.

Another good point. Again, search.cpan.org keeps dates for modules, so we might 
like to leverage that.

I really like Tim's idea of one distro per article and then create Bundles... or 
heck, forget the bundles.
