     why:

    I had written a simple package to bridge from GNU gettext framework
    to Locale::Maketext framework that is a lot easier, sensible,
    portable, fast and workable than the current
    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, which also partially solved the encoding
    problem of Locale::Maketext, too. I guess this worths sharing with
    whoever need it. I planned to name it Locale::Maketext::Gettext, if
    possible.

    Besides, my full name is in Big5. Its 依瑪貓.
