Google is a marvelous stalking tool :)

If Andy can't find him and reasonable efforts have been made to contact
the author we can give you 'in absentia' module maint with the
understanding that if the author does pitch up and wants his module back
that you will need to work it out. Otherwise, the module does look
reasonably unloved. 

There was a slide in my talk as well as a blurb on the FAQ about this.
Once you've tried for a reasonable amount of time to get in touch with
this guy, let us know and we'll probably be happy to have you keep this
module going :)
