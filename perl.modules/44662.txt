Subject: Module submission HTML::Controls

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Controls
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A library of controls/widgets for HTML forms
  userid:      DAKKAR (Gianni Ceccarelli)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Widgets::*

  rationale:

    This library aims to be a comprehensive base from which to easily
    derive complex form controls. It is, moreover, independent from the
    web-application framework used (can be used in the same way from
    plain CGI to Maypole/Catalyst) and templating system (it uses TT2
    internally, but the user can even use simple print statements).

    The HTML::Wigdets::* modules are not really related to one another,
    and deal more with near-templating tasks than with form "widgets".

    My library is in fast development because I need it for one of my
    projects...

The resulting entry would be:
