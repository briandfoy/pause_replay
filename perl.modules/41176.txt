The reason that I suggested that this go under Schedule is because 
there is a similar module (Schedule::DRMAAc) that is already under 
Schedule. I am not sure which OS it would go under because my feeling 
is that the Sun Grid Engine will work on several OS's. However,  I am 
happy for it to go anywhere.
