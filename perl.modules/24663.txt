The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::SVG
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Seamlessly enable SVG output from GD scripts
  userid:      TWH (Todd Harris)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    BioPerl-l, svg-developers

  similar:
    SVG::GD

  rationale:

    GD::SVG is a wrapper around GD methods enabling users who have
    written scripts to seamlessly export scalable vector graphics (SVG).
    This was initially created as an offshoot of the BioPerl and Generic
    Genome Browser (www.gmod.org) projects.

    A seperate module, SVG::GD, was created by Ronan Oger
    simultaneously as the creation of this module. Ronan and I have
    communicated on this and have agreed to continue concurrent
    development with an eye towards merging these modules in the future.
    In part this was because of three reasons: 1) GD::SVG was created to
    support an aspect of the bioPerl project. As such, substantial
    changes to Bioperl code had already been made in order to support
    the interface of GD::SVG. 2) The modules are currently at different
    levels of development; 3) SVG::GD aims to delve into more of the
    raster processing functions of GD - whereas GD::SVG focuses
    primarily on de novo creation of images from data.

    Thanks,

    Todd Harris
