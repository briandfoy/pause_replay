That preference is insane. Net::Stomp is already significantly used in
production - see

http://cpants.perl.org/dist/used_by/Net-Stomp

for a list of things you're going to break.

You're absolutely right. PAUSE should have refused to let you upload
Net::STOMP since it's obviously going to be broken on any system with
a case insensitive fs - Win32 and default OS X included.

In the mean time, the only way you can avoid gratuitously breaking people's
production code is to either maintain the Net::Stomp API or to rename your
distribution to something saner and put a deprecation notice on Net::Stomp
that points to it.

If you don't wish to maintain Net::Stomp then please assign the namespace to
me and I'll ensure it gets loved.
