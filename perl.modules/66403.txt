Request to register new user

fullname: Nick Patch
  userid: PATCH
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I already have a PAUSE account with the userid NIKOLAO but have not
    uploaded any modules yet and would like to change my userid to
    PATCH. If there's a way to simply change the userid of an existing
    account, please rename it; otherwise, please create a new account
    and the old one can be deleted. When this is completed, I will
    upload my first module, Lingua::EO::Numbers. Thank you.
