Hi Todd,

Done.  Thank you very much for the offer.  I gladly accept.

The RT situation is kind of embarassing.  They fired that thing up and
set search.cpan.org to link to it to report bugs, but at the moment they
set it up, my mail was bouncing.  It detected mail to me was bouncing
and stop trying for the rest of forever.  Years went by before someone asked 
me through another channel why I wasn't fixing my bugs.

I assume no one was using any of the code or cared.  

I only found out about this a couple of months ago and have been scraping
on a new project without time to catch up.  I did some work on the
autobox::Core ones but that's it.

Anyway, after that disaster, it makes me very glad to see a personalized
email, sent directly to me.  Thank you for that.

Please let me know if you find anything in particular that needs my
attention.

Regards,
-scott
