The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::MimeInfo
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: determine the mime-type for a file
  userid:      PARDUS (Jaap Karssenberg)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/zoidberg/File-MimeInfo

  similar:
    File::MMagic

  rationale:

    The File::MimeInfo works similar to File::MMagic but where MMagic
    seems to be written to adopt a zoo of magic file, MimeInfo is very
    particularly ment for usage with the shared mime info database of
    the freedesktop project <http://freedesktop.org>. It tries to
    conform as far as possible to the freedesktop specifications for
    this. The advantage of this that the format of the database files is
    known in detail. The freedesktop mime database is packaged available
    for all major linux ditributions.

    I considered using a namespace below the MMagic namespace, but I
    felt this would be to cryptic for most users.

    Currently only the determining of a mime type from the globs file
    is supported, but other projects implementing (like for example rox
    <http://rox.sf.net>) do the same, so it provides compatibility.

  enteredby:   PARDUS (Jaap Karssenberg)
  enteredon:   Fri Jul 11 21:08:43 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::MimeInfo        Rdpfp determine the mime-type for a file           PARDUS
