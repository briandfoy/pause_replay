The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CDB_File::Generator
  DSLIP:       iupOg
  description: CDB_File::Generator
  userid:      MIKEDLR (Michael De La Rue)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    CDB_File - used

  rationale:

    Namespace: CDB_File - becuase that's what it makes Generator -
    because it's for generating CDB_File databases

    Uniqueness & Value: This interface for creating CDB files allows
    the creation of CDB_Files with no limit in size. The standard perl
    CDB_File system only allows hashes up to the size of memory. CDB
    Databases are most valuable for huge datasets where the cost of a
    normal DBM is too high.

    Since the database is sorted (currently using unix sort) it can be
    used efficiently for seeing all entries which have the same key or
    are rooted from a particular tree.

  enteredby:   MIKEDLR (Michael De La Rue)
  enteredon:   Sun Jun  3 17:49:02 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CDB_File::
::Generator       iupOg CDB_File::Generator                          MIKEDLR
