Hi,

You may not know this, but lately I've been researching how=20
to successfully grow a business on the Internet.  And=20
through this research, I've uncovered an extremely powerful=20
marketing technique that I knew you'd want to hear about...=20

It literally allows you to advertise your business all over=20
the Web, on thousands of web sites, absolutely FREE!=20

You only pay when you make a sale... and that means you=20
ONLY PAY FOR ADVERTISING THAT WORKS! =20

It's called an "Affiliate Program" (also referred to as a=20
Reseller or Associate Program), and it simply involves=20
allowing other people to promote your product or service in=20
exchange for a small commission each time they make a sale.

These people, referred to as "affiliates," send visitors to=20
your site using banner ads, text links, personal letters of=20
recommendation, etc...  and for every visitor they send you=20
that buys, you pay the affiliate a small percentage of the=20
profits you make (called a "referral fee").

Pretty impressive, right?  I thought so too...

It is quite literally the ultimate performance-based=20
advertising because YOU ONLY EVER PAY FOR RESULTS!=20

Hundreds, even thousands, of people can promote your=20
products on every corner of the Web, and you only ever pay=20
them when they make a sale!=20

However, even though Affiliate Programs are...

    A HIGHLY PROFITABLE MARKETING TOOL

..... a critical point I've realized from my research is that=20
your Affiliate Program can only be as good as the software=20
that is running it for you!=20

If you want to be the biggest and best -- and literally=20
BLOW PAST YOUR COMPETITION with an army of affiliates that=20
only get paid when they make a sale -- you had better have=20
software that is GUARANTEED to track every visitor your=20
affiliate sends you ... no questions asked!

But do you need to spend $2,000 to $10,000+ on Affiliate=20
Program software... and then hundreds of dollars a month=20
thereafter... in order to build a successful Affiliate=20
Program?=20

At first I thought so (a lot of the so-called "experts"=20
will tell you this is the only way to go), but then I=20
discovered this powerful software that blows its overpriced=20
competition out of the water.=20

Honestly, if you're interested in starting your own=20
Affiliate Program and advertising your business on thousands=20
of web sites for FREE -- only paying when an ACTUAL SALE is=20
made -- then I'd highly recommend checking out the following=20
web site:

http://www.marketingtips.com/assoctrac/t.x/772430=20

Here you'll find *accurate* information (along with some=20
really VALUABLE MARKETING TIPS) about how you can start=20
your very own successful Affiliate Program using software=20
designed by a highly-respected Internet marketer who has=20
one of the most successful Affiliate Programs on the Web.

(This guy got frustrated by those $2,000 to $10,000+=20
options and decided to take matters into his own hands...=20
with impressive results!)=20

After all the research I've done, this is truly the best=20
information I've found for starting your own Affiliate=20
Program -- and that's why I wanted to make sure you have=20
the same opportunity to profit.=20

Hope this helps,


William
