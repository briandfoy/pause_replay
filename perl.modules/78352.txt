The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Orginal
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple PP/OO Attribues for perl <5.6
  userid:      BYTEROCK (John Scoles)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The main goal of Orignal is to be light and easy to use, the code
    is less than 20k and has no dependencies on other modules not found
    in base perl. I created it out of frustration of needing some object
    style code but stuck with Perl 5.6 and not being able to use C or
    C++ code but like Perl 5.14 attributes

    I plan to have a number of other modules under Orignal for extended
    functionality some that I am working on are

    Orignal::YML Orignal::XML Orignal::Persist Orignal::Light

    Each extending Orignal in some way, or in the case of Light
    shrinking the system down to only SCALAR attributes.

    In case you are wondering there is nothing specail about name
    Orignal except it is Moose in French. Was going to call it ELK (Easy
    Light Klasses) but that name is used by Acme::Elk

    Also I have rewritten my other Mod Test::Class::Rig to use is so I
    can't upload that till I get this one in CPAN

The resulting entry would be:

Orginal           bdpOp Simple PP/OO Attribues for perl <5.6         BYTEROCK
