I think the definition of a shell is something like "an interactive command interpreter"; try google define:shell or see the introduction of man bash, csh etc. for this.

This module will supply the interpreter for a large part of the shell language as specified by the POSIX standard. It lacks the interactive part which is usually handled by the readline lib, which at cpan is located in the Term::ReadLine:: namespace. Since the ReadLine functionality is allready general available I see no reason to include that. All said I think that if you put ReadLine and Shell::Jobs together you will have a shell according to my understanding of the concept.

I actually tried that and ended up writing all compenents from scratch. If there is one thing CPAN lacks for putting together a shell that comes close to any standard unix shell it is a module supppleing job control.

Yes it will be useful to others. A large part of the code is allready on cpan, but as part of the Zoidberg project and therefor lives in the Zoidberg:: namespace. The whole point of making this a seperate module is to make this functionality available for other uses. (Then afterwards of course Zoidberg will depend on this module.) I started this module because various people asked me to have some standard base classes to build there own (specialezed) shells or similar programs.

The functionality that this will add to CPAN is the job control facilities.
See http://www.dbforums.com/t1117565.html for a message I send to some usenet groups with examples of the intended interface.
