Hi,

I would like to contribute to expand Convert::EBCDIC to support several =
EBCDIC Character sets.
The owner of module is Chris Leach, I'm writing this mail to see whether =
Chris Leach is subscribed to one of this distribution lists and can =
reply to this message. His e-mail address supplied by CPAN is refused.

Furthermore I would like know whether the characer set identified as =
$ccsid819 on Convert::EBCDIC is really IBM819, it seems to me the table =
is IBM037 character set.

Greetings,
Ignasi Roca Carri=F3
