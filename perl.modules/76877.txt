Subject: Business::OnlinePayment::CyberSource - takeover?

From: xenoterracide@gmail.com (Caleb Cushing)

I've tried to reach the module author the last couple of weeks, in a
couple of ways, email, and the modules-authors mailing list, to see if
anyone else knew how to reach him. I don't see that he has an IRC
contact, and his site and such seems to not be updated for a couple of
years.

As it stands on cpan the module doesn't work, upstream has changed
it's API, or modules since. I've refactored the code to get it
working, and would like to take over the module. Is this possible to
do without the original author's approval? below is a link to my git
fork.
