Hey modules@perl.org

It didn't cost me anything to take a look at these Celeb sites and there's thousands of them! All you gotta do is signup and you get one password that gives you FREE access to all of these Celeb sites. 

Man, if you don't signup now, you're missing out.

All these Celeb sites are FREE!
