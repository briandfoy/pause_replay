The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Checkers
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: The Checkers game
  userid:      MIGO (Mikhael Goikhman)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    YAPC::Israel::2004, the code is developed in public Arch repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    (I can't seem to find any existing Games::Checkers modules,
    although I see Games::Chess.)

    The game of Checkers is pretty popular in several countries. A
    dozen of different rule sets exist for boards 8x8, 10x10, 12x12 and
    14x14.

    I believe that the design I use (as shown in
    http://migo.sixbit.org/papers/AI_and_Perl/checkers-classes.png) is
    good and probably applicable to other 2-player full-information
    board games as well.

    The first please-initially-test public version is available at
    http://migo.sixbit.org/software/checkers/ (it's not really
    announced). Unpack the tarball and run one or another script in bin/
    directory as is, this should automatically play checkers in console.
    Both scripts accept --help option.

    If for some reason the Games::Checkers namespace is not available,
    I would like to use the Gaminx::Checkers namespace that is used in
    the initial 0.0.1 release.

  enteredon:   Mon Feb 16 23:40:13 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Checkers        adpOg The Checkers game                            MIGO
