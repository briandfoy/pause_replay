Dear Willem.

I'm sorry you're experiencing these difficulties. I have reset your
WILLEM PAUSE account to send email to your secret address and list
your willem@cpan.org address as the public one.

Your name is correct in the 01mailrc.txt file on CPAN.  (The email
address may not be updated there as it takes time to propagate across
the Perl ecosystem)

An incorrect name/email listing at rt.bugs.org is not sufficient
grounds for a new ID.  It's possible that the lack of a published
email address caused problems.  Please see if it clears up in a day or
so now that your listed email address is valid.  If not, please open a
bug ticket with the managers of RT by emailing
rt-cpan-admin@bestpractical.com.

Thank you.

David
