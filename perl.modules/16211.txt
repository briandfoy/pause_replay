The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hash::Filler
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Fill a hash according to rules
  userid:      LUISMUNOZ (Luis Muñoz)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides a mechanism to specify "rules" to fill the
    entries of a hash. This is more easily explained by way of example:

    Let's say we want to have user information about a person in a
    hash. We can have rules assigned to each hash key in order to derive
    its data from other entries. The last name could be derived from the
    SSN, if available.

    With this module, the user can specify rules such as those: To
    derive the last name from the SSN, execute a piece of code. This
    would be writen as

    my $hf = new Hash::Filler; $hf->add('LastName', sub { ... }, [
    'SSN' ]);

    Later, the user can add the available data to the hash ($hash{SSN}
    = $ssn) and call $hf->fill(\%hash) to fill the rest based on what's
    known.

The resulting entry would be:

Hash::
::Filler          RdpOp Fill a hash according to rules               LUISMUNOZ
