I think a new top-level namespace would be justified. Especially when
you implement something networkish that is not exactly a protocol but
doesn't fit into HTTP::* or WWW::* either, you are in quite a miserable
state. Why not introducing Netx:: just as DBIx:: has been introduced to
keep DBI:: uncluttered?
