The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Scraper
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Structured data from (un)structured text
  userid:      MCEWAN (Chris McEwan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    WWW::Scraper Template::Extract

  rationale:

    From the POD:

    Text::Scraper provides a fully functional base-class to quickly
    develop Screen-Scrapers and other text extraction tools. Using
    templates, the programmer is freed from staring at fragile, heavily
    escaped regular expressions, mapping capture groups to named
    variables or wrestling with badly formed HTML. Machine generated
    output such as dynamic webpages are trivially reverse engineered.

    Text::Scraper's functionality overlaps some existing CPAN modules -
    Template::Extract and WWW::Scraper.

    Text::Scraper is significantly more lightweight than either. It has
    no dependencies on other frameworks, modules or design-decisions and
    has a more general application domain than the latter. Text::Scraper
    already benchmarks from 150% to 500% faster than Template::Extract.

    Unlike both existing modules, Text::Scraper generalizes its
    functionality to allow the programmer to refine template capture
    groups beyond (.*?), fully redefine the template syntax and
    introduce new template constructs bound to custom classes.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
