     why:

    I am currently working on a module, tentatively named
    DBIx::DBI2Petal, that reads table metadata from a DBI connection and
    generates templates for Jean-Michel Hiver's Petal engine. The
    templates themselves are generated using other Petal templates
    (meta-templates). This module sprang from the need to generate a lot
    of templates fast for a web application that I was working on,
    however it is now the basis of an article that I am writing on using
    meta-templates in Petal. I am currently awaiting review on the Petal
    mailing list to see if anyone has a more appropriate name for this
    module.

    By the way, I am not the same Kurt Stephens as KSTEPHENS. If KSTEP
    is too close, I will settle for KPS.
