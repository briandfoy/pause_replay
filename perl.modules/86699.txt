Hi Steve

I don't see the need to put Net::* on the front of your namespace. Does 
it actually add anything? See the last link for details on 'Net'.

HTTP2::* is good, but after that perhaps an indicator of the draft 
status, to give HTTP2::Draft::*. This can be removed or changed later.

That way, the 2nd level, after HTTP2::$X is still free.

Of course, if you code is the definitive implementation :-), then yo 
won't need a 2nd level name before Compress, etc.

Also, http://prepan.org/ is one place to discuss naming modules.

And so is http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_namingmodules.
