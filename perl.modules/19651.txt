Dear Sir=2C


URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED


I write you out of utmost necessity=2E My decision to contact you was 
informed by the fact that I do not have any trustworthy person to 
assist me=2C considering the nature and magnitude of this proposal=2E 


My name is Major Eduardo Dembo Malange=2C former aide to the late Jonas 
Savimbi the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola =28UNITA=29 who was killed by Angolan government troops on 24th 
Feb=2E 2002=2E 

Under the Savimbi led Unita government=2CI was in charge of the mining 
and sale of diamond and other minerals that were in the regions under 
the control of the UNITA government=2E Part of the proceeds from the 
sale of these minerals few days before Savimbi's death was not 
properly accounted for by my office because of the uproar and chaos 
at that camp immediately after his death=2EThis money totaling USD8=2E75M 
in cash was successfully stashed away by a group! of officers=2E When 
tension subsided=2Cno enquiries were made concerning this money since 
it was not known =2C we the officers decided to keep this money for 
ourselves=2E 

To make sure that this money will not be detected we defaced the 
currency in order to beat security checks=2C before moving it out of 
Angola=2E This money has since been 
deposited in a security company for safe keeping under an anyonymous 
name=2E 

Sequel to our demobilisation as a rebel army and the national 
reconciliation going on=2C we are in the process of reabsorption and 
reinstatement into the mainstream of the ruling Angolan military 
command=2E Hence our being kept under surveillance and 
restrictions=2E This makes it difficult for us to go and take delivery 
of this consignment from the security company=2E 

This prompted this letter seeking your assistance to stand in for us 
as the bonafide owner of the consignment and receive the money in 
trust for us and subsequently help us to invest th! is money=2E You can 
make your verification regarding my story 
before replying if you wish=2E However=2Cplease do so discretely because 
of the confidentiality in order not to expose transaction=2EThis is not 
to say that my 
proposal is risky=2E 

We have decided to give you 25% of the total sum if you can assist 
us=2C 5% for expenses and 70% for us=2EKindly contact me as soon as you 
get this mail if 
you are willing to assist us=2E 

Expecting your urgent response=2E 

Yours sincerely=2C 

Eduardo Dembo Malange
