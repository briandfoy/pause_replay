For now, it uses sysctl(3) to get some information; future additions will
probably also use the kvm(3) set of library functions to access the kernel
virtual memory image directly, which - I think makes it pretty
opensbd-specific. It just might work on other *bsd variants, but I can
neither confirm nor deny that; I don't have experience with those, and don't
have any boxes running those, either. Furthermore, I'd just like to add more
to this module without having to worry about compatibility with other OSes,
so I still would suggest OpenBSD:: as the namespace.

Apart from that - since I'm just talking to you, thanks to you and Alligator
for "Programming the Perl DBI" - I've got a copy of it here, and it sure has
helped me a couple of times. :)
