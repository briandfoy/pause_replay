The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::GDBReflect
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: C++ reflection API for GDB
  userid:      AFN (Antal Novak)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Devel::GDB

  rationale:

    The Devel::GDBReflect module provides an API for examining C++ data
    types within GDB. Its primary purpose is to recursively examine the
    contents of STL containers (vector, map, set, etc.) in a friendly
    output format similar to Data::Dumper. It uses Devel::GDB to
    establish a connection to GDB, then runs a series of GDB commands
    ("ptype", "whatis", etc.) over this connection to determine the type
    and contents of a given container.

    A short script (tentatively gdbwrap.pl) accompanies the module and
    provides a Term::ReadLine interface which allows the user to execute
    standard GDB commands (which are passed through to GDB verbatim) as
    well as a set of new commands which are intercepted and invoke
    methods within Devel::GDBReflect.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::GDBReflect      bdpOg C++ reflection API for GDB                   AFN
