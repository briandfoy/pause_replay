Also, just to be absolutely clear: the only kind of software allowed
in CPAN is software covered under any of the the OSI-approved "free"
licenses (http://www.opensource.org/ ).  I'm certain you are fully
aware of this, but I'm just being real cautious when getting email
from a commercial software company... please acknowledge whether
you do want the CPAN account for the CtCmd.
