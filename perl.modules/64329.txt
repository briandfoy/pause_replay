The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::FSHP
  DSLIP:       Rdpfb
  description: Fairly Secure Hashed Password
  userid:      BDD (Berk D. Demir)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    http://github.com/bdd/fshp

  similar:
    Crypt::Passwd Crypt::PasswdMD5 Crypt::UnixCrypt

  rationale:

    Fairly Secure Hashed Password (FSHP) is a salted, iteratively
    hashed password hashing implementation.

    Design principle is similar with PBKDF1 specification in RFC 2898
    (a.k.a: PKCS #5: Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version
    2.0)

    On the contrary to other password storage algorithms and schemes;
    FSHP let's the user to customize their password security baseline
    easily by allowing to choose the salt length, number of iterations
    and the underlying cryptographic hash function among SHA-1 and SHA-2
    (256, 384, 512)

    FSHP hashes are self defining with their meta format; thus widely
    portable across platforms. Widely deployed SHA-1 and SHA-2 support
    in various platforms boosts the accessibility and portability of
    FSHP.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
