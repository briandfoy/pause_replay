URL::Checkout works on files. It is not pulling contents incore, 
like LWP would do. It creates a checkout tree rather than fetching a single
file through a single connection as LWP would do. 
Wget allows me to copy a web-page together with all its css, js, image
components, or even mirror an entire subtree hierarchy. These features are
Imho lissing in LWP. wget also has a wonderful --continue option.

Namespace-wise, this would fit really well under the LWP:: hiearchy.
LWP already supports http, https, gopher, ftp, news, file, and mailto
I am basically adding to that list.

True. This is posisbly misleading. I am working with the URL strings, if
close examination counts: I apply regexp and possibly other
parsers to determine (guess?) the best protocol handlers.

File::Copy::Recursive is quite close. It just does not fetch from remote.
LWP::Simple::mirror() is also very close, but does no recursion.
I feel like in between :-)

Oh, no. I am working with VCS's, but not exclusivly.

The purpose is an idiot fool proof way to just 'get that stuff'.
 - be it from a web server, ftp server, VCS server
 - be it a single file, a directory, or an entire tree.

File::Fetch - would be an understatement, 
 it does hint at the remote aspect, but not at the multitude 
 of protocols, not at the multitude of files.

File::Copy::Recursive::Remote::ANY
 would be technically correct, but is too cumbersome.

LWP::Recursive would not sound too bad. Except that I'd feel 
oblieged to at least use LWP for something. :-)

Thanks for the review.
I am a bit stalled with good names now, I appreciate this discussion
and would like to hear more ideas. 

        cheers,
