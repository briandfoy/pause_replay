The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Abstract
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Abstractions for configfiles in many formats
  userid:      AVAJADI (Eddie Olsson)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    configfile@avajadi.org

  similar:
    Config::FreeForm

  rationale:

    The choice of the name is quite simply based on the modules
    functionality: To serve as an abstraction for other config file
    modules that inherit from this one. The basic module is not designed
    to be used directly by anything other than other modules. One of the
    unique features of this module is that it overrides some arithmetic
    operators to allow users to intelligently diff and patch
    configuration files, even files of different formats. The
    intermediate abstraction also facilitates conversion between
    different file formats.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Abstract        adpOp Abstractions for configfiles in many formats AVAJADI
