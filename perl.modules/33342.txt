The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Video::TeletextDB
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perl extension to manage a telextext databas
  userid:      THOSPEL (Ton Hospel)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The idea behind a teletext database is to separate the process of
    collecting teletext pages from the process of presentation. This
    makes programs both shorter (you don't have to implement the side
    your're not interested in) and more flexible (you can read teletext
    pages long after the collector stopped running and you don't have to
    be tuned in to the channel you want to read).

    The module is neutral about who fills in the database, but you'll
    probably need something like Video::Capture::V4l to actually put
    something in there, so likely this module will only get used on
    linux (though it should be portable among unixes).

The resulting entry would be:

Video::
