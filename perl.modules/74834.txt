The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Task::BeLike::LESPEA
  DSLIP:       Rdpnp
  description: Modules that LESPEA uses on a daily basis
  userid:      LESPEA (Adam Lesperance)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is my module bundle. There are many like it, but this one is
    mine. My bundle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it
    as I master my life. My bundle, without me, is useless. Without my
    bundle, I am useless.

  enteredby:   LESPEA (Adam Lesperance)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb 19 20:31:17 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Task::BeLike::
::LESPEA          Rdpnp Modules that LESPEA uses on a daily basis    LESPEA
