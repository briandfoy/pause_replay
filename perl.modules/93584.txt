Hi Craig,

> E-mail to brad@tgsmc.com bounces after multiple attempts and =
bhughes@cpan.org seems to be forwarded to that.  I posted to the vmsperl =
list last October, where Brad Hughes was active 10+ years ago, inquiring =
whether anyone knew how to contact him.  I have received no replies.  I =
have done various searches but not found any publicly available contact =
info for anyone who looks like the same Brad Hughes.

> Can I take over, or at least get co-maint, on VMS::IndexedFile and =
VMS::Lock?

Having found your attempts to find him, and those of others, and not =
being able to track down a working email myself, I=E2=80=99ve given you =
co-maint on these modules. Once you=E2=80=99ve done some releases, if =
for some reason you=E2=80=99d still like ownership (eg to grant co-maint =
to others), please request that down the road.

I=E2=80=99ve copied module-authors, which is another good place to ask =
when looking for CPAN authors.

Brad, if you come across this and aren=E2=80=99t happy with the =
decision, please let us know (via modules@perl.org =
<mailto:modules@perl.org>) and we can revert the decision.

Thanks for taking these on Craig.

Cheers,
Neil
