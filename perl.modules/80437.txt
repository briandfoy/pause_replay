Subject: Module submission Template::Plain
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plain
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: A Perl extension for very simple templates.
  userid:      JEREMY (Jeremy Madea)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perlmonks, github

  similar:
    Template::Toolkit Text::Template Template::Simple

  rationale:

    From the README: << I know, I know. Another templating module? Why?
    Don't we have enough of those already?

    But wait! This one may just be the wheel you've all been
    reinventing because available templating systems were overkill for
    what you needed, had a few too many dependencies, had a learning
    curve that was a little too steep, or were just too bloated. >>

    I've been using a version of this module for years in personal
    projects and it's hugely useful. Mostly it just finds place holders
    in text and replaces them with stuff you tell it to. You don't have
    to learn a mini language to use it. It's small. It's truly simple.
    It's easy to learn and to use. It has no dependencies (other than
    for testing.)

    It also has a couple nice features that don't bother you unless you
    need them. Maybe the nicest of those is the fact that it pulls
    default template content from the calling package's DATA file handle
    (with a fallback to main::'s and a further fallback to *ARGV.) This
    makes it super easy to write really short scripts that fill in email
    form letters or parameterized configuration files and the like.

    I wasn't thrilled with calling it Template::Plain, but the more
    I've thought about it, it's actually quite descriptive. Also
    Template::Simple is taken (by something not quite so simple or
    plain.)

The resulting entry would be:

Template::
