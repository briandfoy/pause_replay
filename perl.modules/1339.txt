module description

Name                  DSLI  Description
--------------------  ----  -------------------------------
POE::Component::POE   adpf  A wrapper for POE.pm


Discussion of module's importance.  (note: "dngor" is the creator
of POE.  I am "Citizen_X").

<Citizen_X> dngor: what do you think about me writing POE::Component::POE?
<dngor> I think it's wacked in the head, especially if you're just gonna
use POE; 1;
<Citizen_X> hey.. that's not going to get me a cpan id, dngor ;)
<dngor> Oh!  Scratch that.
<Citizen_X> you need the cue again?
<dngor> POE::Component::POE is a wonderful idea.  It embodies just about
every module virtue Tom Christiansen has enumerated.


Module background explanation:

POE literally means "Perl Object Environment", but like many good acronyms
it has other has meanings.  One of these other meanings is "Part of
Everything", which explains modules like POE::Component::IRC.  Since POE
is obviously covered under the "Everthing" umbrella, I considered it
necessary to have a POE::Component::POE module, which I would take it upon
myself to write.  As the above conversation indicates, the original
module's author heartily agrees with my view.


Thank you, and have a nice day.
