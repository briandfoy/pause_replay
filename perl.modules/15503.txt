That sounds like a good idea.  However, I took a look through the code and
decided it was more trouble than it was worth.  My module took around 4
hours to write, including docs and tests.  I don't think I could have
fixed Apache::ConfigFile's many problems so quickly.  In particular,
coming up with a better API for an existing module tends to be a lengthy
process of negotiation.  Just because I don't like the current API doesn't
mean the author agrees!

I tried to make it obvious that my module deals with the format of the
Apache config files rather than with Apache config files themselves.
That's why it's called Config::ApacheFormat rather than Config::Apache or
Apache::* anything.

However, my module is general enough that it should work with real Apache
config files.  It just doesn't have any of Apache's configuration
rules hard-coded in the module like Apache::ConfigParser does.

Do you have a better name in mind?  I considered Config::Apachesque, but I
decided it was too cute.

My purpose in providing an Apache-format configuration file is to leverage
existing expertise among the sys-admins where I work.  Another syntax that
also supports nested blocks with parameter inheritance would not meet this
goal.
