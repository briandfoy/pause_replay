Hello,

As I stated in another post to this forum, I would like to submit an RFC 
for OpenTMS.

Exerpt from Readme file below:

NAME
     OpenTMS - Open Tournament Management System

DESCRIPTION
     OpenTMS is a web based mod_perl application to deal with the management
     of tournaments, especially game tournaments/ladders/leagues. It is made
     up of a set of API modules, in the OpenTMS:: namespace (together with
     OpenTMS.pm), and scripts made to run under Apache::Registry.

I have established a sourceforge page at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opentms/ . The code hasn't been imported 
yet, as some issues remain before I can publish it. OpenTMS has been under 
development by yours truly for a long time now, for Gamers Unite, which is 
supposed to be a tournament/ladder/league site for gaming. I finally got 
the other members of the team to agree on open sourcing it, so I am now 
going through a phase to make it possible to use for everyone.

Questions:

Is the namespace for the application ok? I was wondering about using a 
top-level namespace like this, but as it should only apply to this specific 
application, I was hoping it might not be a problem. I use the namespace 
for OpenTMS.pm, the main module, and then several others in OpenTMS::*

Should an application be released to the CPAN? I guess that this usually 
isn't the case, but for example, I see that Slashcode is part of CPAN, and 
OpenTMS falls into about the same category. If so, I guess I would need a 
PAUSE ID, PEREINAR would be good.

I guess that's all. Thanks for your time,
