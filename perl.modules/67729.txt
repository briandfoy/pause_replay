The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::DNS::Zone
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: parse a zonefile
  userid:      ZIBRI (Olof Johansson)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    DNS::ZoneParse Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast

  rationale:

    The proposed module would parse a RFC conforming DNS zonefile (with
    some support for Bind specifics) and provide a object oriented
    interface for extracting data. This is the main difference between
    this and Net::DNS::ZoneFile::Fast. It is not meant to manipulate the
    zone, just extract data from it.

    This module does not validate the rdata, nor the names of the RRs
    (except SOA) because it should be able to handle new RRs without
    need to update. This is the difference between this and
    DNS::ZoneParse, which almost only supports the RFC1035 RRs.

  enteredon:   Sun Sep 20 09:11:08 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::DNS::
::Zone            adpOp parse a zonefile                             ZIBRI
