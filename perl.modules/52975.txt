Dear CPAN administrators,

I have unsuccessfully attempted to upload
a distribution of a new module I am working with. This is my third attempt
and I have no idea what is the reason for the failure.
The module is Parse::Eyapp and the distributions that failed
were:

ftp://pause.perl.org/tmp/C/CA/CASIANO/

Parse-Eyapp-1.06559.tar.gz              367 KB          06/02/07        13:02:00
File: Parse-Eyapp-1.06600.tar.gz        367 KB          06/02/07        16:09:00
File: Parse-Eyapp-1.067.tar.gz          182 KB          07/02/07        07:49:00

I have successfully installed the module on several local machines.
Can you help?


Best wishes


Casiano
