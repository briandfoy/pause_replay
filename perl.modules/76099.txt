The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RRD:Editor
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Portable RRD editor (no need for RRDs.pl)
  userid:      DOUGLEITH (Doug Leith)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    RRD::Simple, RRD::OO

  rationale:

    The module meets three main needs. 1. Fairly complete editing
    support for RRD database files (current modules provide for only
    very limited editing, and the need for editing is a recurring theme
    on mailing lists). 2. Support for RRD interchange across platforms
    (the current format is binary non-portable, this module allows
    conversion between this and a portable format; my own interest in
    this is to allow compatibility with javascript front ends must be
    able to interoperate with server backends). 3 The module is
    standalone i.e. does not depend on RRDs.pm, unlike RRD::Simple and
    RRD::OO. RRDs.pm is no longer part of CPAN and due to its many
    dependencies it is relatively hard to install on shared servers.
    Removing this dependancy is in itself a fairly big boost to
    portability.
