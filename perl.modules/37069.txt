The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::ReportWriter
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Create reports from data stored in MySQL
  userid:      OPIATE (Shane Allen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    My goal is simplicity. I want to be able to generate a page-able,
    sortable report in HTML with a minimum of work.

    It is a common task, and yet not currently something that has been
    addressed.

    Using HTML::ReportWriter, you need only define a query and an array
    of hashes (column definitions), and passing those two pieces of data
    along with a DBI database handle, you can have a page-able, sortable
    HTML report that is pretty, if plain.

    Eventually I want to allow for easy customization, but have not yet
    determined how best to do that. Additionally considered is
    multiple-database compatibility, however it will begin its life
    working only for MySQL 4.0+.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::ReportWriter    idpOp Create reports from data stored in MySQL     OPIATE
