I was curious to the status of a couple of namespaces that I requested to 
be registered.  The edit module meta data function on PAUSE doesn't seem 
to recognize any modules to be currently associated with me.  The 
namespaces in question are:

Exporter::Cluster
XML::XForms::Generator
TEILite

Any response is greatly appreciated.
