Hi all,
 I've just applied for a PAUSE account in order to share some of my musical 
modules. I have a 'generate scales/modes' module, which given a note and a 
scale, returns note names / semitone offsets etc., and am currently working 
on a 'import/export ABC format' P:RD-based module. Other modules I plan on 
writing / have sketches for include assorted Markov / evolutionary-type 
music generation stuff and Indian-related modules (raga generation given 
the time-of-day,season etc.).
At present, the only music-related namespaces are Midi, Audio and 
PDL::Audio (which scares me :)), none of which are really relevant to the 
the above. Should/could a 'Music::' namespace be added, or is there an 
existing pigeonhole into which I could fit?

Cheers,
Ben
