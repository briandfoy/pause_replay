CGI::Application   bmpO   Framework for building reusable web-apps

Description of Contribution
-----------------------------
CGI::Application is intended to make it easier to create sophisticated,
reusable web-based applications. This module implements a methodology which,
if followed, will make your web software easier to design, easier to
document, easier to write, and easier to evolve.

The guiding philosophy behind CGI::Application is that a web-based
application can be organized into a specific set of "Run-Modes." Each
Run-Mode is roughly analogous to a single screen (a form, some output, etc).
All the Run-Modes are managed by a single "Application Module" which is a
Perl module. In your web server's document space there is an "Instance
Script" which is called by the web server as a CGI (or an Apache::Registry
script if you're using Apache + mod_perl).

CGI::Application is an Object-Oriented Perl module which implements an
Abstract Class. It is not intended that this package be instantiated
directly. Instead, it is intended that your Application Module will be
implemented as a Sub-Class of CGI::Application.

This module has been in use for two years at my company.  All the
programmers (staff and contract) who have worked with us for the past two
years have been using this system, and have expressed a strong appreciating
of it.  They have found it to be simple to use and of very high utility.
The techniques enabled by this module have been discussed in public
technical groups, where they have been greeted with enthusiasm.

It is the strongly voiced opinions of the numerous programmers who are
familiar with this system which have inspired me to release this module to
CPAN.  After being a user of CPAN for many years, I am quite excited to
finally have an opportunity to contribute something back!

Full Perl docs are available if you wish a closer look at the module.


Thanks!
