The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Barcode::Zebra
  DSLIP:       bdcOl
  description: Read barcodes from images or video devices
  userid:      SPADIX (Jeff Brown)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://zebra.sourceforge.net/

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Zebra Barcode Reader library is for scanning and decoding bar
    codes from various sources such as video streams, image files or raw
    intensity sensors. It supports EAN, UPC, Code 128, Code 39 and
    Interleaved 2 of 5. This module has the Perl bindings for the C
    library.

    There are a few loosely related modules under Barcode:: for
    generating or manipulating barcodes. This also seems an appropriate
    place for a reader...

    Note that the Barcode:: namespace currently occurs in chapters 11,
    18, and 23. IMHO barcode reading is not specifically tied to images
    (or text processing), so I opted for "Miscellaneous". Of course I'm
    open to feedback if anyone thinks this is inappropriate.

The resulting entry would be:

Barcode::
::Zebra           bdcOl Read barcodes from images or video devices   SPADIX
