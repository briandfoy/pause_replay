It is not necessary for you to register a root in this way.

If the root is not usable from the perspective of the letters being 
meaningful in any other contexts, which seems to be the case, then 
simply upload the module underneath it as normal.

Second, typically companies do not reserve namespaces in this way. 
Namespaces like Sony::Whatever are not reserved by Sony, they are simply 
modules that interface with Sony devices written by various different 
people.

And thirdly :) if the modules you are writing ARE generally useful and 
don't have any Komputer Associates-specific functionality in them, you 
should consider registering them in generic namespaces in any case.

If you need help with any specific module or application names, let us 
know and we can help you out.
