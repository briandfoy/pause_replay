The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Amazon::SQS::ProducerConsumer
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Producer and Consumer classes for Amazon SQS
  userid:      NICWOLFF (Nic Wolff)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module makes it very easy to use Amazon's Simple Queue Service
    to coordinate worker processes using a producer/consumer pattern in
    which each process loops while reading messages from a queues,
    processes them, and publishes new messages in other queues to drive
    the workflow along to other workers.

    Messages in the form of Perl data structures are transparently
    serialized to JSON and published to a queue with one method call

    $queue->publish($message);

    and on the consumer side, one method call

    $message = $queue->next;

    deletes the processed message and gets the next, which is returned
    as a Perl data structure. See t/03-cycle.t for an example.

    This module has been in production for some time, but can now be
    open-sourced. Thank you for your time and attention to this!
