That's probably because ESplit is not a registered toplevel namespace.
Or it has some other reason, I don't know for sure.

Anyway, we should probably discuss your previous posting as of June 11
first:

hc> I'd like to register for a home directory at the CPAN's Perl 
hc> authors/id tree.

hc> My name:        Hartmut Camphausen
hc> email:          h.camp@creagen.de
hc> www:            http://www.creagen.de/
hc> pref. user ID:  HCAMP or HARC

hc> I would like to upload a Perl module to the CPAN, ESplit.pm. I think 
hc> it would fit into the Text::-namespace.

hc> Description:

hc> Esplit.pm, version 1.00 ESplit.pm provides one function,
hc> e_split(), to split (sic!) scalar values (AKA strings) at
hc> arbitrary characters/strings (may be given as regex). Usefull to
hc> deal with CSV data.

hc> - Delimiters contained in quoted strings will be ignored, as well as 
hc> \- 
hc>   escaped delimiters.
hc> - Delimiters given in () will be returned as n + 1. elements in the
hc>   resulting array (like split()).
hc> - One can tell e_split() to return only the first n elements - or the
hc>   last n elements.
	  
hc> e_split is 2-5 times faster than Text::ParseWords::parse_line.
hc> e_split deals with quoted strings (fields) in a more reasonable way
hc>   (well, IMHO :-)) than parse_line.
hc> e_split deals correctly with mixed qoutes (e.g. double quotes at 
hc> start of
hc>   a field, a single one at the end).
	
hc> Any comments and suggestions are highly appreciated.

We usually do not discuss in depth the usefulness of modules here, we
rather try to concentrate on namespace issues and problem
identification.

Your module is definitely not suited for a top level namespace. The
problem area it acts upon is "Parse" or "Text" related. You mention
Text::ParseWords as a competitor and so maybe you could try to get a
patch to Text::ParseWords approved. OTOH, I cannot imagine that many
developers would agree with you that allowing 'mixed quotes" is a good
idea and so such a patch might not be accepted. But still, you wrote
partly an alternative to Text::ParseWords and so I could imagine e.g.
the namespace Text::ParseWords::Fast. Other namespaces probably seem
plausiblible too. But as said, this is no toplevel problem domain.

Thanks,
