The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::ShowDiff
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Show character differences in strings
  userid:      BIGJ (Janek Schleicher)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Algorithm::Diff Text::Diff Text::ParagraphDiff Test::Differences

  rationale:

    This module is a wrapper around the diff algorithm from the module
    Algorithm::Diff. It's job is to simplify a visualization of the
    differences of each strings. In its first version, it has a simple
    method ansi_colored_diff($string, $changed_string, $options) that
    displays the differences of the two strings on an ANSI-Terminal.
    Further visualizations (pure textual, html like, ...) are planned.

    Compared to the many other Diff modules, the output is neither in
    C<diff>-style nor are the recognised differences on line or word
    boundaries, they are at character level.

  enteredby:   BIGJ (Janek Schleicher)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 25 18:40:45 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

String::
::ShowDiff        adpfp Show character differences in strings        BIGJ
