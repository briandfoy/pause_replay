The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MobileFilter::WURFLFilter
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: Mobile FIlter for Apache 2.x Web Server
  userid:      IFUSCHINI (Idel Fuschini)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.idelfuschini.it

  similar:

  rationale:

    MobileFilter::WURFLMobile is an implementation of the Apache filter
    in Perl, the propose of this filter is to help to manage the mobile
    web solutions. This solutions is based to WURFL solutions. A good
    point to start is: <http://wurfl.sourceforge.net>

    The idea is to give to anybody the possibility to create mobile
    solution, it's not important if you know programming language just
    what you need to know is a little bit of html and if it's necessary
    wml. So I thought it was to make something simply that can identify
    a browser and redirect it the correct url (for mobile or pc). If you
    are a programmer and you want to develop a simple mobile solution
    you can use this module to pass few Wurfl Capabilities information
    to your application. In this case it's not important with which
    technology you want to develop your site and you don't need to
    implement new methods to how recognise the devices.
