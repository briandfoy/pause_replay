I would say if adding Jan and Adam to it resolves all remaining issues, 
then that would be a good and extensible solution. But to be honest, I 
haven't spent the time to fully understand the workings of those 
"mailing list" users.

(Eventhough I wonder whether it would make sense to introduce something 
like that for PAR because I could have all RT ticket mails sent to the 
PAR mailing list instead of to my overflowing inbox only. Perhaps then, 
I wouldn't be the only one to actually read those tickets.)
