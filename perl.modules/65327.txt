Hi Colin,

no idea if you'll ever read this. You should really configure your PAUSE
mail account to go somewhere.

We generally dislike the use of underscores in module names. Mostly,
we'd like to see those reserved for privately used namespaces.

Typically, we suggest appending an "X" for "eXtension" modules for a
given base distribution. In your case, that might be a little awkward
(VIXX...).

How about these?

VMware::VIX::Ex::VMhost
VMware::VIXContrib::VMhost (no underscore)

Best regards,
Steffen
