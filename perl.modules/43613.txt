The resulting entry will be:

EB                adpOp Electronic Bookkeeping (Dutch/European)      JV

JV comments:
EekBoek is a Perl program for elementary bookkeeping intended for small, European companies. In particular, but not exclusively, for people with a technical background that are not experienced bookkeepers.

The rationale to develop EekBoek:

  * The European way of bookkeeping is significantly different from the American way. Since most existing open source bookkeeping programs are based on the American way, they are hard to use and error prone for Europeans.

  * Most existing open source bookkeeping programs are Web based, which is suboptimal if not dangerous. Due to the stateless nature of the Web, the chances of loosing transactions is too high to be acceptable, especially for non-expert bookkeepers. Direct feedback is not possible.

  * Other open source bookkeeping programs run on non-free platforms only. 

  * None of the existing open source bookkeeping programs an be easily controlled using command-line scripting.

  * None of the existing open source bookkeeping programs has an easy accessible program API.

  Development goals for EekBoek:

  * Easy to install and use.

  * Data is maintained in a relational database (initially, PostgreSQL) for reliability and robustness.

  * Bookkeeping according to the European standards.

  * Reports that are understandable and acceptable by accountants and tax departments.

  * It is possible to do the complete bookkeeping using command line scripts and/or API calls.

  * Easy interaction between EekBoek and user programs.

  * A snappy, state of the art GUI companion program (wxperl based) will be provided.
