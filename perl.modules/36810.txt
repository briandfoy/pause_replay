The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Copy::Recursive
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: uses File::Copy to recursively copy dirs
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    beginners@perl.org

  similar:
    File::Copy I think there are some but I though made more sense to
    use the name space instead of create a new one

  rationale:

    I wanted to Copy files like this:

    copy('./dir','./other') or die $!;

    so that if it was ./dir/foo and ./dir/bar and ./dir/dir/baz I'd
    then have ./other/foo,./other/bar, ./other/fi/baz

    I'd have a setting for depth so we don't go to deep and other
    control options like symlink handling and error handling goodies :)

    maybe do rcopy('./dir','./other') or die $!; to do regular files or
    directories recursively and dircopy() to warn or die or return false
    if the specified files are not directories like File::Copy::copy
    does if they are directories

The resulting entry would be:

File::Copy::
::Recursive       Rdpfp uses File::Copy to recursively copy dirs     DMUEY
