Request to register new user

fullname: Mihai Bazon
  userid: MISHOO
    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    A replacement for Class::DBI (I named it DBIx::Object, seems like
    this name is free) that I coded in-house. I make no claims that this
    is better than Class::DBI in any way, but it does have some neat
    features and I already use it in production code--so I thought
    others might benefit from "yet another choice". ;-)

    I might contribute more modules in the future.
