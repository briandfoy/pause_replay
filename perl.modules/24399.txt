The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gtk2::CV
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: A modularized XV clone written in perl
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am developing a clone of the popular (around my place) xv image
    viewer. I choose the name Gtk2::CV because it's Gtk2 based and the
    application that gets installed is named CV. Therefore, the widgets
    and data file are put below the Gtk2::CV namespace.

    (And no, it won't be as featureful as the original xv, but faster
    and easier to extend).

  enteredby:   MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov  7 03:15:25 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Gtk2::
::CV              adhOg A modularized XV clone written in perl       MLEHMANN
