Description: The first module I plan to contribute is an Apache module
called Apache::ContentHandler. Apache::ContentHandler is a generic
framework for creating mod_perl (and regular CGI) based
applications. It provides a basic event mechanism and a subclassable
framework for customizing actions.

In DSLI Form:

Apache::ContentHandler|MdpO|OO system for mod_perl/CGI event-based apps

I haven't discussed this module w/ any groups, but I have used it for
several different projects with good success. I also have several
other modules to contribute in the near future.
