The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::Interval2Prefix
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Generate prefixes from intervals
  userid:      LTHEGLER (Lars Thegler)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    module-authors@

  similar:
    None, as far as I know.

  rationale:

    Root namespace choice: this is a pretty 'generic' algorithm, usable
    for both telephone numbers and IP-addresses, so I believe
    'Algorithm' is the correct rootlevel namespace. For
    'Interval2Prefix', I have not been able to come up with anything
    that more clearly explains the function. The usage of '2' instead of
    'To' is a question of taste, but I'm perfectly willing to change
    this, should it come to that.

    My own combing of CPAN, plus the discussion on module-authors@
    suggests that no implementations of this algorithm is present on
    CPAN yet.

    It is my implession that this algorithm is *not* trivial, and
    difficult to get right, so it might come in handy for others in the
    same situation.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::Interval2Prefix bdpfp Generate prefixes from intervals             LTHEGLER
