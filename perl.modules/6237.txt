From: hdp+cpan@theoscape.net (Hans Dieter Pearcey)

I am Hans Dieter Pearcey.
I can be reached at hdp+cpan@theoscape.net.
My home page is http://www.theoscape.net/~hdp/
I'd like my PAUSE id to be HDP.

I'm planning to contribute a few related modules; one sort of like
IO::Scalar in reverse (Tie::Scalar::File -- "This looks like a scalar,
but really, you're writing to a file"), one similar but with arrays
instead (the difference being that Tie::Array::File splits on
/(?<\\n)/), and a Tie::Hash::Dir module that uses them both to
represent a portion of the filesystem as a hash. (i.e. if tied with
"/foo/bar" as a base, $hash{baz} is /foo/bar/baz, whether that's a
directory (and thus another Tie::Hash::Dir object) or a file
(Tie::(Array|Scalar)::File)).

hdp.
