Here is a quick description of the module: there is one function which takes
a transformation document (called an XTMPL) and a flat text document, then 
returns a transformation on the flat text as described in the transformation 
document to produce XML.

 $xml = parse ( $xtmpl, $text );

The XTMPL is currently in XML, but only because it's a good medium, not
because the output document is XML.

Basically, this module has a function that transforms text to marked up
text.

What would a good name for this module be? XML::Text2XML? Text::XML?
Conv::Text2XML? Something else?

Thanks.
