Hi Brian,

Was talking about my generic non-descriptive namespace request at work
today, and other suggestion were:
Sys::Daemon::Shutdown
Daemon::Shutdown

I'm not religiously attached to anything, but slightly prefer
Daemon::Shutdown (everything is a System, and there could be more (perl)
Daemons)...

What's the protocol now - resubmit request with another name?

Best regards,
-Robin-
