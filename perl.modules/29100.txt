     why:

    The OpenOffice::OODoc module provide an object-oriented interface
    for reading and editing of OpenOffice.org documents by Perl programs
    without having to use the OpenOffice.org software. It's mainly based
    on XML::XPath and Archive::Zip.

    Their objective is to offer programmers a concise and reasonably
    high-level language, allowing the manipulation of document objects
    without having to know the details of data representation used in
    OpenOffice.org files or of XML programming interfaces.

    The project page is http://www.genicorp.fr/devel/oodoc It's already
    referred in the OpenOffice.org community (see
    http://xml.openoffice.org/uses.html) as a toolbox allowing "direct
    OpenOffice file update and creation from Perl scripts (for automatic
    document processing out of the OpenOffice software)".

    The distribution file (OpenOffice-OODoc-1.102.tar.gz) contains only
    an introduction (README), while the full reference manual of the API
    is a 100-page document in OpenOffice.org (SXW) format, not included
    in the CPAN-compliant package. This manual is downloadable at
    http://www.genicorp.fr/devel/oodoc/oodoc_man_en.sxw
