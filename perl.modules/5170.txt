From: michael@vivtek.com (Michael Roberts)

I'm the author/maintainer of the wftk (open-source workflow toolkit) and
I'm starting work on a Perl module integration for the library.  I'd
like to be able to upload it to CPAN when it's working.

Name: Michael Roberts
Email: wftk@vivtek.com for this purpose
Homepage: http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html
Preferred userid: MICHAEL or VIVTEK.  Usually MICHAEL is taken.  :-)
Description: above.
Description in module list format: premature, right?  Nothing's actually
written yet.

You can see the site itself for some public discussion; I've also
published an article on IBM's site, but it's very old and not all that
descriptive.  Suffice it to say, this isn't coming out of left field.

Thanks!
Michael
