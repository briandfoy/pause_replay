The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VisualDreams
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Web toolkit for Authentication & Conversion
  userid:      WILDCHILD (Gunther Voet)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace will be used for modules specified to one platform;
    "The VisualDreams engine". The released modules will be able to work
    with this platform as well able to be working alone; Like as example
    the Yubikey::online module which can be used to authenticate a
    yubikey online.

    The VisualDreams engine consists of years of programming code by
    me, Gunther Voet. Some of this code will be gradually released
    towards the outside world. Most of this code still needs to be made
    modular before it can be used by the general public.

    The engine is specifically written towards rapid processing of
    rich-media files, xml in-output and realtime conversion, rpc-xml and
    server routines. This to ensure compatibility towards different
    platforms and devices.

The resulting entry would be:

VisualDreams      bdpOg Web toolkit for Authentication & Conversion  WILDCHILD
