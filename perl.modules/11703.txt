The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MP3::Player::PktConcert
  DSLIP:       cdhOp
  description: Perl OO API for Intel PocketConcert(tm)
  userid:      MIKEWONG (Mike Wong)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    The MP3 branch is obvious; the Intel PocketConcert(tm) is a
    portable mp3 playing device. As there are many such devices on the
    market, I think that having an MP3::Player branch ought to encompass
    all sorts of interfaces to any of these devices. My motivation was
    to generate a list of mp3s and have that list downloaded to my
    PocketConcert everytime I got tired of the current list. Perl is the
    perfect tool for this. I chose MP3::Player::PktConcert because I
    don't want to imply that I work for Intel, or have any association
    with Intel other than the fact that I buy their products.
    PocketConcert is trademarked, and I'm just another perl hacker. Plus
    it's less characters to type. Unfortunately it's also hard to find
    with search engines; hopefully the meta-data will suffice. Thanks,
    and power to the camel!
