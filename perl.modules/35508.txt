When I looked at the CGI.pm module (5+ years ago), it did not allow you to
generate content without having it sent immediately to the client.  The
HTMLObject was developed to allow me to write my web apps with the following
goals in mind:

1) be able to generate <head> content at any time of the process, this includes
cookies, javascript, etc.
2) be able to throw away the current document and start on another document
without the client knowing anything happened.  This is not possible if you have
already sent down your doctype, cookies, etc.
3) be able to delete parts of the generated document or do substitution on the
body until the user has decided to start trickling the document to the client.

It's a framework to allow you to create HTML documents (framesets or
non-frameset docs) and be able to build up the pieces, where the head, body,
style, cookies, links, meta tags, javascript, etc. are all accessible via an OO
interface.  We provide a CGI parser module (for getting the input from the
browser) and a Form module that allows us to generate html forms, parse and
validate the input and re-display the form hilighting any invalid entries.

The CGI helpers I was referring to are the ability to do $doc->br or any other
html tag (that is in the 4.01+ specs) and have the correct xhtml compatible
output generated.

If you want to see an example, download the website code for the content running
on the SF site @ http://htmlobject.sf.net/.  That is a cgi script that is using
the HTMLObject to present that content.
