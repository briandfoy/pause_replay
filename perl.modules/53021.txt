hi Guys,
Everytime I log into PAUSE and click the "Edit Module Metadata" link, all I
got is the following error message:

Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to DZHUO. Please note, only
modules that are already registered in the module list can be edited here.
If you believe, this is a bug, please contact modules@perl.org.

but clearly, my module is listed here:
http://search.cpan.org/~dzhuo/Google-Checkout-1.0/.

Is this a mistake? If so, anyway you can fix it for me? What i would like to
do is change the license as well as edit a few things.

Thanks!
David
