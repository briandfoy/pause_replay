Module:            File::Rsync.pm

Description:
   A OO-style module to wrap the rsync(1) program.  The rsync program somewhat
   similar to mirror.pl.  It has the advantage of only transferring the
   differences between files. See the rsync home page listed below for
   details on how this is done.  The module captures the output
   messages, and return status from calls to the binary.  It also tries to
   make the command line options easier to handle.  Latest version (0.07)
   has been uploaded to PAUSE (Andreas created my ID so I could reserve the
   name).

Discussions:
   I've sent a copy of the first version (0.01) to the authors of rsync.
   They are not perl programmers, but put a copy on the 'resources' page as
   'rsync_wrapper.pl'.  I also sent a copy to Graham Barr for review and
   comments.  His response was 'Wow, that is some module.'  which I chose to
   take as good ;)  I've also submitted it to module-authors@perl.org where
   Tim Bunce suggested it belonged in File:: instead of Net:: as I initially
   thought.

Any and all feedback appreciated.

Proposed DSLI entry for modules list:
