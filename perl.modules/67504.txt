sorry for the delay.

In your case, this was actually quite simple. a) You just gave us the 
secret address which wasn't visible normally. b) Your gmail address was 
listed as the public address already.

I just set your "secret" address to the gmail one as well. This should 
let you use the "password reset" feature.

Cheers,
Steffen
