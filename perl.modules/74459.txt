Request to register new user

fullname: michele ongaro
  userid: MICHELEON
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Because I'm going to be co-maintainer of Net::Filemaker::XML and
    because I should soon upload the relative Catalyst model
    Catalyst::Model::Filemaker. I already have an account (micheleo) but
    as I don't have anymore that email and I don't remember the password
    I cannot login. It would be great if you could reactivate that
    account with the current email.

    Thank you

    Michele
