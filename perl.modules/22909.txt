The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filesys::Statfs
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Interface to the statfs() system call
  userid:      IGUTHRIE (Ian Guthrie)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Filesys::Statvfs Filesys:statfs

  rationale:

    As far as I know the Filesys::statfs namespace is reserved but
    there is no known module. I tried to contact the owner but have
    gotten no response. I have tried recently and also a few years ago.

    I would like to create a module that uses XS to call the statfs()
    function directly. Currently there is no mechanism to do this in
    Perl. It would mirror the Filesys::Statvfs module closely and I
    would like to tie it into Filesys::Df as well. This will be useful
    for operating systems like OS X which do not have a statvfs() call.

    If I can not use Filesys::Statfs would a different namespace be
    possible?

    Thanks, Ian Guthrie

The resulting entry would be:

Filesys::
