The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       News::yEnc
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: yEnc decoder, w/database of file parts
  userid:      SWMCD (Steven McDougall)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    comp.land.perl.modules, modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    yEnc is a new encoding format for transporting binary data in
    nominally ASCII channels, such as usenet. It is an alternative to
    uuencoding.

    Although there are concerns about the architecture of yEnc (see,
    for example, http://www.exit109.com/~jeremy/news/yenc.html), it is
    now in widespread use in usenet binary groups. I need to decode
    these postings, so I wrote a module to do it.

    The yEnc format was developed for encoding usenet binaries, and
    that is currently its most common use. This suggests a module name
    of

    News::yEnc.

    An alternative would be to make yEnc:: a top-level name, like
    MIME:: but... - yEnc isn't as big as MIME - The yEnc format will
    likely stay confined to usenet

    Also, a top-level yEnc:: module namespace violates CPAN
    capitalization conventions, while a YEnc:: namespace is unaesthetic.

    OTOH, a top-level yEnc:: namespace allows for both yEnc::Decoder
    and yEnc::Encoder, when someone gets around to writing one. If we
    put them all under News::, then we either have 3-level names, like

    News::yEnc::Decode News::yEnc::Encode

    or compound words in the module names

    News::yEncDecode News::yEncEncode

    which is a bit of a mouthfull.

The resulting entry would be:

News::
::yEnc            adpOp yEnc decoder, w/database of file parts       SWMCD
