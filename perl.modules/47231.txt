     why:

    The CPAN module GSSAPI-0.13 is broken and does not compile.

    We have fixed the bugs and added Heimdal support for GSSAPI-0.14

    We will also provide LWP::Authen::Negotiate based on that Bindings.

    I know that this is an "unfriendly overtaking" of a module, but the
    Author hav not reponded to emails since summer 2005 and the module
    itself is unmaintained since 2001.

    Our Project home is <http://perlgssapi.sourceforge.net/>

    Please let me know if you want to get a snapshotrelease of
    GSSAPI-0.14

    Please let me know if you need more information.

    Thank you, Achim Grolms
