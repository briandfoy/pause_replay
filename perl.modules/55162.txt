You might want to break up BioPerl into smaller chunks, but I don't
think that should mean one distribution per module. Groups of modules
likely will always go together, so group those in a single
distribution.

Some things to consider:

* Is this a real problem that people complain about, or just
speculation about a problem?

* Is installing one big package more annoying than installing 45 small
packages?

* Is the maintenance of 900 packages with multiple overlapping
dependencies worth the effort to create and maintain the packages?

* If something changes in BioPerl, how many distributions will you have
to update?
