The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Embed
  DSLIP:       adprp
  description: seperate unwieldy chunks of text from code
  userid:      MCEWAN (Chris McEwan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=442223

  similar:
    Inline::Files

  rationale:

    from the Abstract:

    "Often, code requires largish chunks of text to operate - not
    enough to add extra file dependencies but enough to make using
    quotes and heredocs' ugly.

    An obvious example is code generators - the text itself is code,
    and as such, is difficult to differentiate and maintain when it is
    embedded inside more code. Similarly, CGI scripts often include
    embedded HTML or SQL templates.

    Text::Embed provides the programmer with an easy way to store these
    portions of text in their namespace's __DATA__ handle - away from
    the logic - and access them through the package variable %DATA."

    The namespace choice I am open to suggestions about. Indeed the
    code appears in the above perlmonks thread under the name
    'Tie::DATA' - which I feel is misleading and a little vague. A more
    current version of the module is available at:

    http://users.aber.ac.uk/cim3/Embed.pm

    As far as I can tell, there is no such module on CPAN. A similarity
    to Inline::Files was suggested, but I would stress that my module is
    much more lightweight and less ambitious.

    Text::Embed is simply a generalisation of a similar routine I have
    written in lots of code. Its quick and handy, and keeps my source
    code more readable.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Embed           adprp seperate unwieldy chunks of text from code   MCEWAN
