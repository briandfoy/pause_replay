The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::ApplyDiffs
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Apply one or more Algorithm::Diff diffs
  userid:      ANDREWC (Andrew Chadwick)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::Merge

  rationale:

    * Name

    I was going to call this thing Algorithm::Merge, but the problem
    space is quite different from merge(1). For example,
    Alg.::ApplyDiffs doesn't do fuzzing and chunk rejection, but it can
    handle the appliction of more than one diff sequence at a time, and
    handle conflicts.

    * Other modules ** Algorithm::Diff

    ApplyDiffs applies the diff sequences generated by diff() in this
    module. Algorithm::Diff does not contain a routine for applying diff
    sequences.

    ** Algorithm::Merge

    Features a diff3() and a merge(), which you could argue does the
    same thing as Diff + ApplyDiffs. However Alg.::Merge::merge() only
    merges the three-way differences between an original and two
    descendent revisions. Alg.::ApplyDiffs' routines are not limited in
    this respect: you can apply the diffs from an original array and one
    or more descendents together, albeit at the risk of harder-to-solve
    conflicts appearing.

    Like Alg.::Merge, Alg.::ApplyDiffs has a conflict-resolution
    callback which can be used to resolve conflicts during application,
    or just inject conflict markers.

    ---

    Now the fun bit. I plan to work the Alg.::ApplyDiffs code so that
    it can reduce conflicts. There are even certain cases that can be
    optimised away cleanly:

    >>>>>> src_diff_x Hello world >>>>>> src_diff_y Hello world <<<<<<

    for example. Currently it spits that out as a conflict, even though
    it patently isn't: all derived revisions contain the same text at
    the same point.

    Alg.::ApplyDiffs' diff-based approach lends itself to greater
    analysis and optimisation.

    ---

    I've contacted the authors of both the other Algorithm:: modules
    privately by Email to discuss the upload of this module, and had a
    response from neither. I'm concluding from this that they don't have
    any problem -- or rather, that they have no explicit objections or
    wish to incorporate my code into theirs -- with my uploading my
    module.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
