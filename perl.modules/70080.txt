The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weather::Airport
  DSLIP:       Rnpfp
  description: Get Airport Weather Information
  userid:      DROOGIE (Joseph Tartaro)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a basic module that will grab the weather information from
    any airport code given. I wrote it for a friend of mine who is a
    pilot and thought that some others may get some use out of it. It
    stores all the information in an array like so...

    This is LAS.

    $VAR1 = [ ' Address: 5757 Wayne Newton Boulevard ', ' City: Las
    Vegas NV, US ', ' Visibility: 10 miles ', ' Dew Point: 24째 F
    (-4째 C) ', ' Wind: Wind direction is 30 degrees Speed is 9 mph ',
    ' Barometer Pressure: 29.97" ', ' Sky Conditions: Broken layer at
    7000 feet. Broken layer at 15000 feet. ', ' Sea Level Pressure:
    29.958185" ', ' Last Updated: Wed Feb 24 15:56:00 PST 2010 ', '
    Includes the Counties Las Vegas Valley ' ];

    This is LAX.

    $VAR1 = [ ' Address: One World Way ', ' City: Los Angeles CA, US ',
    ' Visibility: 10 miles ', ' Dew Point: 42째 F (5째 C) ', ' Wind:
    Wind direction is 340 degrees Speed is 3 mph ', ' Barometer
    Pressure: 30.12" ', ' Sky Conditions: Broken layer at 2200 feet.
    Overcast layer at 3300 feet. ', ' Sea Level Pressure: 30.117647" ',
    ' Last Updated: Wed Feb 24 15:53:00 PST 2010 ', ' Includes the
    Counties Los Angeles County Coast ', ' Includes the Cities Downtown
    Los Angeles-including , Malibu , Santa Monica , Beverly Hills ,
    Hollywood , Long Beach ' ];

    etc.
