     why:

    I have the pleasure of writing to you for the first time. My name
    is Yu ISOBE. I develop web applications by Catalyst. These days, I
    have written coding around VIEW ( ex.Template Toolkit ), and I
    developed some reuseful modules. I want to contribute by updating
    there modules at first. Furthermore, I contribute to increasing
    Japanese perl developer, by piecing out modules in CPAN.
