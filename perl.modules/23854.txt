Thank you for your communication regarding
Mail::IMAPClient. 

Since my work on this module is a volunteer effort, I
cannot always respond immediately to questions, bug
reports, and comments. However I will back to you as
soon as I can.

If you are having trouble with Mail::IMAPClient, please 
double check the following:

1) Have you read the documentation and the RFC?
2) Have you turned on debugging and seen precisely
what's failing?
3) If you are having problems with the BodyStructure,
Thread, or MessageSet subclasses then is your
Parse::RecDescent module up-to-date?
4) If your problem is with logging in, can you log in
by hand (using telnet or imtest) with the same credentials?
5) Have you read the documentation and the RFC?
6) Have you followed the instructions on reporting bugs
in the POD?

Number 6 above is critical when submitting bug reports.
If you've submitted a bug report without the
accompanying documentation then I really can't do much
about it. But don't worry! It's not too late. You can
go to rt.cpan.org and update your ticket to add the
supporting documentation (especially debugging info).
If you do this right now I probably will never notice
that you left it off to begin with! ;-)

Thanks again for your correspondence,
Dave Kernen

DJKERNEN (David J. Kernen) visited the PAUSE and requested an upload
into his/her directory. The request used the following parameters:

 pause99_add_uri_httpupload        [Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9.tar.gz]
 SUBMIT_pause99_add_uri_httpupload [ Upload this file from my disk ]

The request is now entered into the database where the PAUSE daemon will
pick it up as soon as possible (usually 1-2 minutes).

During upload you can watch the logfile in
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=tail_logfile&pause99_tail_logfile_1=5000.

You'll be notified as soon as the upload has succeeded, and if the
uploaded package contains modules, you'll get another notification from
the indexer a little later (usually within 1 hour).


Thanks for your contribution,
