If it were to be under XML::, then it would probably have to be something 
along the lines of XML::Template::Petal because XML::Template is too generic, 
and there already are other XML templating systems (a bunch of XSLT 
implementations, XPathScript, etc...).

What your module is at heart is a templating system. I know that it works 
using attributes which would tend to link it to XML and HTML but you don't 
know where it might go in the future. There are other ways to glean 
attributes than the way it's done in XML and HTML. Perhaps someone will add 
functionality to somehow read in Pyx or YAML, or in fact anything that 
represents data structures so long as there's a way to look elsewhere in the 
tree and identify stuff as attributes.

I'm pretty sure that the Mason folk would have been happier chosing 
Template::Mason than HTML::Mason, simply because what they do is templating 
much more than HTML, and even though 99% of the time Mason templates deal 
with HTML. I cannot speak for them, but imho if you ask their opinion the 
odds are they'll shout "Template::Petal" in unisson ;-)

Removing the HTML bits would not be a prerequisite to going into into the XML 
namespace so long as it is primarily an XML tool and doesn't warp XML (eg 
XML::LibXML reads HTML as well). I know that the boundaries of what XML is 
are now very much blurred thanks to SAX being able to read and write 
anything, only pretending that it's XML in the middle but I still do think 
that Petal is more orientated towards templating than towards XML. In other 
words, it makes sense without the XML bits but doesn't do anything without 
the templating bits. As such, I think that Template::Petal just works great.
