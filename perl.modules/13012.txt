The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::Polyline
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Polyline object and utils for use w/GD
  userid:      HARASTY (Dan Harasty)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    private discussion with Lincoln Stein

  similar:
    GD::Polygon (although that is "inlined" with GD.pm)

  rationale:

    This module extends GD with an "open polygon" object (which are
    commonly called "polylines"), and is a lot like "GD::Polygon", which
    already "exists" in module-space by way of it's use inside of GD.pm

    Lincoln Stein has blessed the use of GD::Polyline, and in fact
    plans to include the module in his upcoming release of GD v2.0.
    However, for users of previous versions of GD, and so that I can
    release updates and bug fixes of GD::Polyline when no concomitant GD
    release is planned, I propose we establish it as an independent
    module "listed" on CPAN.

  enteredby:   HARASTY (Dan Harasty)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug  2 20:28:33 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GD::
::Polyline        RdpOa Polyline object and utils for use w/GD       HARASTY
