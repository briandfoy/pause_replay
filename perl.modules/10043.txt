Subject: Module submission Uttu

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Uttu
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: web application driver
  userid:      JSMITH (James G Smith)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modperl@apache.org

  similar:
    HTML::Mason HTML::Embperl

  rationale:

    Uttu itself (as a name) is the Sumerian goddess of the weaving arts
    and is closely associated with spiders.

    Uttu provides core functionality around which a framework can be
    built that defines the flavor of the environment in which an
    application runs. More information is available at
    http://uttu.tamu.edu/docs/ (currently being used as a development
    server, so if it doesn't show up, I'm working out a bug somewhere -
    plus a few details are still subject to change :/).

    Uttu has (pre-alpha) support for internationalization and (beta)
    support for uri->filename translation. This last bit separates the
    public and private namespaces from each other, allowing changes in
    one to not affect the other.

    Uttu currently only supports HTML::Mason, but should be modular
    enough to allow support for Embperl, template toolkit, etc. as a
    basis for the web pages.

The resulting entry would be:

Uttu              adphp web application driver                       JSMITH
