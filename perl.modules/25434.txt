9-11 Widow Files rico Lawsuit=20

public signatures sought to support Investigation

PHILADELPHIA, Jan 6 -- Ellen Mariani, whose husband died in the =
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks when UAL 175 was flown into the =
World Trade Center, has filed suit in a US District Court alleging Bush, =
Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld and other co-defendents had sufficient =
warning to stop the terrorist attacks but failed to either warn or =
protect the public.=20


=20

According to a recent CBS News, the Republican 9-11 Commission Chairman =
agrees:

=20

9/11 Chair: Attack Was Preventable

(CBS News -- December 18, 2003) For the first time, the chairman of the =
independent commission investigating the Sept. 11=20

attacks is saying publicly that 9/11 could have and should have been =
prevented, reports CBS News Correspondent Randall=20

=20

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/17/eveningnews/main589137.shtml

 =20

Mariani's suit also charges the Bush Administration with burying =
evidence of its failure and refusing to release vital information.



Philadelphia Attorney Philip J. Berg, who filed the suit on Mariani's =
behalf, says the Administration must be held accountable. Berg launched =
the suit on November 26, and has since put up a website explaining the =
details of Mariani vs Bush, et al. The Bush Administration is currently =
trying to have the charges dismissed in court.

=20

Public support is critical, says Berg, who has posted an online =
petition.  "We need at least a million signatures for them to take it =
seriously." He added that mounting a class action is also being =
considered. Concerned citizens are urged to read and sign the petition =
here:
