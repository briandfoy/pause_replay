Thanks for taking your first steps in being a CPAN author :)

You a tool such as Module::Starter to create a conventional Perl
distribution with a conventional build script.

If you want to read about all of the details of PAUSE and CPAN
authorship, check out Sam Tregar's free e-Book "Writing Perl Modules
for CPAN": 

http://www.apress.com/book/view/159059018X

There used to be a free e-Book download, but that seems to have
disappeared.

Good luck,
