Subject: Module submission Bloom::Faster
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, palvaro@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bloom::Faster
  DSLIP:       RdcOg
  description: High performance bloom filters
  userid:      PALVARO (Peter Alvaro)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Bloom::Filter

  rationale:

    I release this module back in '06 but never heard back about my
    registration. I think there is a clear need in the community for
    this module:

    1. there are bug reports associated with Bloom::Filter asking for
    more capacity and better performance. 2. Bloom::Filter appears to
    scale exponentially as the data grows. 3. quite a number of users
    are already using Bloom::Faster in spite of the fact that it's not
    registered.

    I feel that the module belongs in the bloom namespace, and would be
    willing to change "Faster" if necessary, but recommend against it
    since the module is already in use.

    thank you!
