     why:

    I am a beginning Perl developer trying to catch with Perl tools and
    engines. My first contributions are humble messages about issues on
    CPAN modules that I use heavily. I work mainly in Windows machines
    and life is not easy compared to the Unix toolkit Perl developers
    take for granted. I also have some code I intend to publish on CPAN,
    but I need to polish it and check with others if they are worth or
    if I am just repeating existing modules. My interests are wide, from
    SQL statements with named placholders (:a instead of ?) to IRC bots.
