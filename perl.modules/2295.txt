Maybe I should give a little background. The PAUSE indexer will accept
and index all three modules even if the module list doesn't mention
them all. That means that all interfaces to CPAN that I know of will
treat the three as first class citizens.

The modulelist's main goal is to provide hints and *sufficient*
namespace protection. It is not trying to be complete. Completeness is
something that the PAUSE indexer and search.cpan.org try to come up
with. Cross referencing should be provided by the authors in their
manpages.

BTW, the module list actually lists only 1354 of 7151 namespaces.
