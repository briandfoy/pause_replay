Hi,

I am a first time contributer to cpan and am creating a personal finance manager using perl.   The application that I am creating is to be named OpenFinance.  The first module that I wish to submit is an interface to the Huntington Online Bank.  It will interact with the site, but currently just parses information from downloaded pages.  I was planning to name the module OpenFinance::Huntington.  Does anyone see issues with this or have any suggestions?

Thanks,
Chad Lavy
