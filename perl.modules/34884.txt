Subject: Suitable module name - Nokia::NFB::File?

From: robert.price@gmail.com (Robert Price)

I've written a module that is capable of creating, extracting and
manipulating existing Nokia nfb (phone backup) files. I would like to
share this on CPAN, but I am unsure of a final name for the module.

Currently I am using Nokia::NFB::File, but I'm not sure this is
suitable for a CPAN release as it would involve creating a new top
level namespace. I have looked at the existing namespaces, but can't
find anything else suitable.

Any suggestions? Should I stick with Nokia::NFB::File?

Thanks

Rob
