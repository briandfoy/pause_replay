Dear MediChest Customer:

Thank you for emailing MediChest. Our hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 08:30am to 04:30pm Eastern Time. We do receive hundreds of emails each day. Your message is very important to us. We will respond as quickly as possible, or upon completion of your request.

*IF YOU HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED OF A BACKORDER:
Occasionally, there will be a backorder on certain products in our database. A backorder means we're waiting for the item to arrive from the supplier. Your order will remain intact and will be shipped the very moment the product does arrive into our facility. Our shipping time for backorders is generally 3 to 90 days. Backorders are treated the same as in-stock orders. We log all backorders and work on them regularly.
**PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL EMAILS SENT TO US MUST HAVE A SUBJECT. IF THERE IS NO SUBJECT, THE MESSAGE IS ERASED
