I think Ewan how now done this but I'm not clear that it 'worked'. When 
I click 'Select Mailinglist/Action' and choose 'edit_mod' for 
'BIOPERLML' is says in the top right corner 'SENDU <bix@sendu.me.uk>
acting as BIOPERLML <No email???> encrypted session' (even though I set 
a mailing list address) and in the main body text, 'Sorry, there are no 
modules registered belonging to BIOPERLML. Please note, only modules 
that are already registered in the module list can be edited here. If 
you believe, this is a bug, please contact modules@perl.org.'

I was expecting to be able to do something on that edit page, or at 
least see there were registered modules belonging to BIOPERLML. Have I 
not understood what is supposed to be happening here?
