I was alerted to an interesting and dangerous group of Perl modules
that we might need to do something about.

The Makefile.PLs in the modules by DOMIZIO use LWP to download
informtion from his website, then evals that code.  

http://search.cpan.org/src/DOMIZIO/CGI-Builder-1.2/Makefile.PL

I checked the link, and it looks like a simple print() right now, 
but even if the author has innnocent intentions, someone else with some
various net fiddling could hijack the process, turning these
modules into trojan horses, and by extension, CPAN.pm into the 
way it spreads.

http://search.cpan.org/~domizio

How do we normally handle these things, or is this new territory?
