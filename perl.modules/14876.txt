in my opinion (and only that right now), we have no territorial rights
to any namespace, and i don't want to reject good names for only that
reason.

i agree that authors should talk to other people about their plans,
but ultimately this is a community (as in commune) and not a regulated
market.  i'm more interested in community freedom than individual
rights---but that's just my opinion.

if we decide something else, i'll live with that, too. :)
