Adam,

According to the embperl's home page at http://perl.apache.org/embperl/ , 

<<
Embperl is a framework for building websites with Perl.

For the beginner it's an easy to setup and use way of embedding Perl code
in HTML pages. It delivers several features that ease the task of creating
a websites, including dynamic tables, formfield-processing,
escaping/unescaping, session handling, caching and more.
>>

Accordingly, it is a huge system, with hundreds of pages of documentation
describing its environment and operation. In contrast, Magic is a
straightforward template processor with full documentation occupying
barely two printed pages. As a result, a developer can begin using it
efficiently without hitting much of a learning curve at all. And Magic can
be used efficienly in any environment, not only in web applications. 

If you compare Magic to embperl's templating mechanism you'll find two
quite different systems. Similar to other systems, Embperl introduces the
whole new mini-language and syntax, as outlined here
http://perl.apache.org/embperl/pod/intro/Intro.-page-3-.htm, and does some
magical things with the template code around its tags (dynamic tables.)
All this complexity limits performance and flexibility and prone to
errors.

Magic is the only templating system I know of that allows embedding of
variables directly into template text for expansion, without any
intermediate delimiters. Using embperl's syntax, you can write

My name is [+ $name +]

, whereas in Magic it's simply

My name is $name

where $name is interpolated directly as a Perl variable in double-quotes.
Not only it's much cleaner, it requires far less processing power. Magic
requires no configuration and its programming interface consists of a
single exported function. A complete description of Magic can be found at
http://www.denispetrov.com/magic/

In summary, I think that simplicity combined with power and an innovative
approach to variable expansion can make Magic a valuable addition to the
CPAN.

Hope this helps,

Denis
