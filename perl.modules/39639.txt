The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Manager
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Multiplayer Game Manager
  userid:      KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Bot-Depot.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    Games::Manager is a module for the control and management of
    multiplayer games for realtime, interactive environments (for
    example, IM chatterbots or a server daemon). The name
    "Games::Manager" is appropriate because this module does just that:
    it manages games.

    A single Games::Manager object can manage virtually unlimited
    games, provided that the games all have a unique ID. It features
    things such as creating/deleting games, adding and removing players,
    and a function to destroy a game - forcefully if it has to (a game
    with players present won't be destroyed without a "force" flag being
    sent in).

  enteredby:   KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 13 11:59:34 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Manager         Rdpfg Multiplayer Game Manager                     KIRSLE
