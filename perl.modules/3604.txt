bdpO File::Searcher - Search filetree do search/replace regexes

	Searches for files and performs search/replacements on matching files

bdpO File::Searcher::Interactive - Interactive search do search/replace regexes

	Searches for files and performs search/replacements on matching files, 
uses terminal to make the searches interactive.

The above are tested and almost to R stage (names not set in stone, will 
confirm with PAUSE users before submitting). I have a dozen or so sys admin 
friends using them and suggested I go the distance to submit to CPAN, so I 
will do so.

Also have completed modules that need to be CPAN readied, as well as more 
in the hopper with some other developers.


Thanks,

Adam Stubbs
