     why:

    I've written a apache module subclassing Apache2::AuthTicket for
    Captcha::reCAPTCHA, Basically i have apps that are frequently
    harvested for data public records and what not. I've written this so
    the first time someone uses the app it gives them a cookie for x
    ammounts of minutes after the ticket expires they must do another
    captcha to make sure they aren't giving the cookie's to robots to
    harvest data.
