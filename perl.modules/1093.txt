Description of what I plan to contribute: 

Yet another text-templating system, but with important differences from
what I've seen out there. I've been using Text::Boilerplate since 1997, so
it's pretty sturdy. It's a flexible templating system that allows users to
separate HTML/text/any other formatting system from their Perl code, using
tags such as [* VALUE NAME="foo" *] (or [* "foo" *] as a shortcut) and [*
REPEAT NAME="foo" *] <P>[* "bar" *]</P>[* /REPEAT *]. There are built-in
formatting tags for HTML. The cool part of Text::Boilerplate is that on
initial load-in, the boilerplate is translated to a Perl subroutine, thus
gaining a great deal of efficiency since we don't need to re-parse the
boilerplate file every time we want to fill it in. This feature is
particularily useful for FastCGI scripts, which can load and parse the
boilerplate at start-up time and then use it repeatedly with great
efficiency. The other useful part of Boilerplate is that since no Perl
knowledge is required to create or alter it, one can simply turn the HTML
design work over to an HTML designer.
