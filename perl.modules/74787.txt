Years ago, when Iain Truskett died, I took over his modules and his =
PAUSE account, SPOON.  As of a week or two ago, I had given up ownership =
or handed over all the modules that he maintained.

Right now, his email at spoon@cpan.org comes to me, and nothing good =
comes in it.  It's all spam.  Can this please get redirected to =
/dev/null?

Also, with Randy Kobes' passing, too, it makes me think that there might =
be a need to note modules where the author is never going to answer.  =
There are other, non-death reasons for this as well.

Thanks,
xoa
