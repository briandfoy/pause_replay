The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unix::Lsof
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Wrapper around *NIX lsof utility
  userid:      MARCB (Marc Beyer)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides a wrapper around the lsof utility and a
    perlish interface to the data returned. It makes lsof (which is a
    very useful utility for sysadmins that lists open files and their
    properties) more easily usable from within a Perl program.

    The module was presented and discussed at
    http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=669881 , and though not much
    discussion took place there was no negative feedback. A (very) short
    CB poll suggested that the name Unix::Lsof is preferable over
    Unix::lsof.

  enteredby:   MARCB (Marc Beyer)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb 28 11:43:55 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Unix::
::Lsof            adpOa Wrapper around *NIX lsof utility             MARCB
