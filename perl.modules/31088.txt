The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::SHTML
  DSLIP:       Rdpfb
  description: Apache SSI parsing (for small sites)
  userid:      TSKIRVIN (Tim Skirvin)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::SSI CGI::SSI_Parser

  rationale:

    I don't have too much call for the namespace, I'll admit; it' s
    just what I've called this internally for years, and doesn't hit the
    other two attempts.

    This one is specifically designed to be as similar as possible to
    just using the CGI module's start_html() and end_html() functions,
    except using specific files as headers and footers.

  enteredby:   TSKIRVIN (Tim Skirvin)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 22 21:09:16 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::SHTML           Rdpfb Apache SSI parsing (for small sites)         TSKIRVIN
