Hullo again-

I just posted a question soliciting feedback for a name for WDDX.pm and
happened to look through the mailing list archives after I sent the
message (I know, I should have done it the other way around, sorry).

Apparently there was discussion about WDDX.pm back when David Medinets was
working on a module last November. There were a few suggestions but
nothing decided. So I wanted to offer my two cents after reading them:
David Medinet's idea of XML::DTD::WDDX was nixed, but what about simply
creating a top-level DTD category? XML will become more popular and more
modules will likely spring up simply to provide an interface with some
standard DTD. This would provide a place for them that's clear and easy to
find.

Having XML and DTD categories also seems to me to mirror the DBI and DBD
category structure. DBI and XML provide low level stuff. DBD and DTD layer
on top of them. Or has this issue of categorizing modules that layer on
top of XML already been decided...?
