Hi,

My name is Sam Corl.

My CPAN/PAUSE userid is "SAMCORL".

My email address on the CPAN site and on PAUSE is outdated and I 
don't have access to it anymore.

Please change my email address to "sam@samcorl.com" in both places, 
so I will be able to log in and upload some packages I've been hoping 
to contribute.

Thanks for your attention,

Sam Corl
