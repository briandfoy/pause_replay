I know that Steffan suggested "Simple", but that's as meaningless as
"Easy". Words such as simple, easy, complex, and intuitive mean 
different things to people. Your easy way of doing things is somebody
else's frustrating interface.

A much better name describes how you make it easy or which class of
problems it makes simple.
