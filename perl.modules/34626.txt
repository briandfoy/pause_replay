The other day I found I needed a set of Perl bindings to the
Linux joystick driver, but couldn't find anything on CPAN (except
SDL, but it's overkill for my purposes)..

So I coded up a module I call Linux::Joystick. It's a pure Perl,
object-oriented interface for reading events from the joystick
device, and I want to share it with the world...

What does everyone think of putting this in the Linux namespace? There
are already Linux::AIO, Linux::Cpuinfo, and a few others. The only mention
I can find of joysticks on the module list is Win32::MultiMedia::Joystick,
which isn't going to do me any good...

I suppose it would have made just as much sense to invert the namespace,
so there'd be Joystick::Win32 and Joystick::Linux (and eventually
Joystick::MacOSX, Joystick::NetBSD, etc), but it looks like the precedent
for platform-specific modules is to put them under the platform name.

For anyone who's interested, I've got the module packaged up & ready
to upload. This is my first ever CPAN module, so I'd really appreciate
input from experienced CPANners. You can download the tarball here:

Let me know what you think...
