     why:

    I have a module I Call Binary::ProtocolConstructor I wish to
    contribute, which aids in the transmission and disassembling of
    network packets at a low level with support for both Big and Little
    endian byte ordering. Very useful for making both clients and
    servers that use binary protocols :). I may also have projects in
    the future.
