Hi -

Apparently I'm a conehead, and when I sent my initial request for a PAUSE id
to upload my Win32::SystemInfo module, I only listed the name as SystemInfo.
I have a feeling that this may be why I can't find my uploaded module
through the search.

If it's possible, I would like to have the namespace Win32::SystemInfo for
my module. Is this a change that can be made after the fact?

My PAUSE id is CJOHNSTON

Thanks in advance,
Chad Johnston
