Request to register new user

fullname: Myrddin Wyllt
  userid: MYRDDIN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: https://github.com/MyrddinWyllt
     why:

    The online betting exchange 'Betfair' has a new JSON API for which
    there are no existing CPAN modules. The old, SOAP-based interface
    has a module, but the author (David Farrell) is not interested in
    updating it, so I want to put my own Betfair module up on CPAN.
    Also, I'm working on a few modules to talk to International Aid
    Agencies (World Bank, DfID etc) which have recently introduced new
    JSON APIs, and would like to make these available when they're done.
