REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION 

I am contacting you based on information and esteem
recommendation I received of you from a high ranking
official in the commercial section of the Nigerian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry who guaranteed your
reliability and trustworthyness in business dealings.
This business proposal I wish to intimate you with is
of mutual benefit and it's success is entirely based
on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of
confidentiality as regard this transaction. 
I am the Chairman of the contract Advisory Committee
(CAC) of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Works and
Housing (FMWH). I am seeking your assistance to enable
me transfer the sum of US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
into your private/company account. 
The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded
and executed on behalf of my Ministry the Federal
Ministry of Works and Housing. 
The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign
contractors to the tune of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty
Million United States Dollars). 
But in the course of negotiation, the contract was
awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of
US$43,500,000.00 (Forty-Three Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown
to the contractor. This contract has been
satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian
firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry,
where I am the Executive Director in-charge of all
foreign contract payment approval. 
As a civil servant still in active government service,
I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside
the shores of Nigeria. Hence this message to you
seeking your assistance so as to enable me present
your private/company account details as a beneficiary
of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian
contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided
account. 
On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated
below. 
1. 30% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary. 
2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for
incidental expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction. 
3. 60% of the fund will be for me which I intend to
invest in your country with you as my partner. 
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction
within the next few working days of commencement. For
further details as to the workability of this
transaction. 
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent
response. 

Yours Sincerely, 
Dr. Zack Ego.
