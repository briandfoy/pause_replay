Yes. Unfortunately, that is not uncommon. Three months is not even that
uncommon. It's a good idea to give a gentle reminder every three weeks
or so, as you did. (I've been waiting for a registration for about two
months now as well.)

I believe so ;). That was one reason why I, at one point, considered
joining the ranks of 'modules@perl.org' voluntarily, but I wasn't sure
whether I had enough CFT to really do the job justice.

I think that different admins have different levels of power -- for
example, I think everyone can register a CPAN ID for a new user, but not
everyone can approve a module, or something like that. I think only
Andreas K=F6nig can add a module to the Official Module List, but that
might change in the future -- I believe they're re-thinking how things
work and who gets to do what.

Cheers,
Philip
