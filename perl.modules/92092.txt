Hi Ron

It looks like you hit the mark. I had already uploaded 0.06, so I went
in and did a forced reindex.  Now there's BRAAM as "first-come", LZAP as
"co-maint", and me as "modulelist" and "owner".

I'll let the dust settle for a bit (and let the testers chew on it)
before I do any more.

Thanks!
Rick
