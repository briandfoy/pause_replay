     why:

    I'm working on a module that I hope will receive the name-space
    Audio::Tagger. This module is being designed to provide a simple OO
    interface to scan, look up, tag and rename audio files. Currently
    the project is almost ready for its initial release, and I'm
    currently busy improving documentation and testing the API.
