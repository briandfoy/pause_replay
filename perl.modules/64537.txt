The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Framework
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: A framework to simplify script development
  userid:      SDPRICE (Steve Price)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides all of the common setup and management of most
    Perl spplications. This leaves the developer free to concentrate on
    the application itself, rather than gathering options, making the
    documentation match etc.

    All of the application set up is actually done in the pod
    documentation, defined at the end of the script. So the
    documentation and script usage always stays in sync.

    The module also provides a default set of options (e.g. setting
    debug level, specifying a log file etc).

    Future enhancements are intended as extra modules that simplify the
    creation of filters, POE programs, HTTP server programs, apps that
    communicate with PHP etc.
