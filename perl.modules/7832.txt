As I said in the registration email, you can find some emails that
went to modules@perl.org in the archive
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/

I do not know if any of these modules have been implemented since, but
you can find out by browsing these people's directories and by talking
to them directly.

One aspect of proper naming is always what is already there and how
does it relate to your work.
