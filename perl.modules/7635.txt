The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EPI
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: E-Payment Interface for
  userid:      GEORG (Gheorghe Chesler)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    newsgroups, chatrooms

  similar:

  rationale:

    I started building EPI because I could not find a common interface
    of its kind. The module is developed to be of a similar
    functionality as DBI, for payment gateway access.

    Initially the module was built only in "The CITY Shop", an
    object-oriented ecommerce package that I maintain, but many people
    and companies expressed the need to implement this interface in
    existing shopping carts.

    Currently I have 8 distinct gateways built in, more than any
    proprietary shopping cart.

The resulting entry would be:

EPI               adpOg E-Payment Interface for                      GEORG
