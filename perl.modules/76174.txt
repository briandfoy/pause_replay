The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW:Google::ShortLink
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to Google Labs Apps Short Links
  userid:      BOBP (Bob Parker)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Google Apps Lab Short Links Google Group

  similar:
    WWW::Google::UrlShortener

  rationale:

    This module provides the interface to the Google Apps Lab Short
    Links API for users of Google Apps Standard, Business and Education
    version, as opposed to the public url shortener used on goo.gl,
    which is covered by WWW::Google::UrlShortener.

    There are multiple namespaces that are used for Google services,
    the this appears to be the most appropriate and most recently used
    by the majority of the modules used for Google APIs that deal with
    Google Apps and related Services. It seemed to me that a
    Google::Apps::*, Google::Services::* or Google::API::* namespace
    would be more appropriate, but I opted for consistency over
    appropriateness to stay in alignment with the general community
    consensus.
