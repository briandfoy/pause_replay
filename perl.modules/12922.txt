The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::BlackSch
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Black-Scholes option price model functions
  userid:      ANDERS (Anders Johnson)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Black-Scholes model is the most widely-accepted way to value
    stock options. There really ought to be a reference implementation
    in Perl.

    I'm flexible on the module name. Unfortunately, "BlackScholes"
    violates the 11-char limit. Math::Business already exists, and
    seemed like a logical place. I'm calling this "beta" (even though it
    has been thoroughly verified) in case a name change is indicated.

  enteredby:   ANDERS (Anders Johnson)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 29 17:42:30 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Business::
::BlackSch        bdpfp Black-Scholes option price model functions   ANDERS
