The problem is that there is a real need for a browsable view of what
is out there (be it the module list or the search.cpan category
buttons I don't care). Witness the recent OSCON, where a great number
of the perl talks consisted of bringing great modules to people's
attention. If I had a nice up-to-date descriptive and browsable view
of the module space I could have saved myself some liver damage and
stayed at home :-)

Now I *know* everybody is doing this on a best efforts basis - I am
not whingeing! But there is no clear mechanism by which anybody can
help. If I say "Hi! I have 120 man hours to donate to updating the
module list" (which I do BTW), who takes me up on it? What do I do? 
Right now the only thing I can think of is to start at A and hope I
get to Z before I die.

Dmoz is fine - the critical point is that there currently is no
community mechanism for donating editorial content. I am personally
not qualified to police the namespace (and am highly grateful to those
that attempt it) but if I:

* have spent two hours deciding whether I should use Date::Parse or
Date::Manip in my software (I know, I know - it is just an example)

* tried to use a module and found it too slow for my particular
application

* know lots about astronomy and can give you a rundown of what the
different modules in Astro:: do

there is currently no way to put that information back in the
search.cpan/module-list pool for somebody else.

Suggestions welcome. I have people who are willing to help. 

Aloha,

        Frossie
