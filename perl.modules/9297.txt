To The Modules Master:

I'm trying to update DSLIP settings of some modules, but they
are not showing in my module list with PAUSE. [BBB]
Can someone help me fix it or tell me what I'm doing wrong
or at least tell me someone that knows how to take care of
these problems?  The following need to show in my list:

1) Sys::Ptrace - Perl interface to the ptrace(2) command

Did I stick this in the wrong root?  Or is this module
inappropriate?  Or what?  Just let me know.

2) File::DirSync - Syncronize two directories rapidly

I have no idea.  Do I just need to wait for someone to add
it to the module list, or what?

3) Net::Ping - check a remote host for reachability

I think this is the toughest one of all.  It is still with
Russell Mosemann (RMOSE), but he told me he'd be happy to
switch it to me.  Unfortuneatly, he says he has
password/email problems or something.  Maybe Andreas
König is still working on fixing this one?  Below are some
emails from Russell which might help with that.

Thanks for the help!

Contrary to the rumors, I am alive, if a little backlogged.  :-)  I am
impressed at the improvements being done to Net::Ping.  If you are willing
to spearhead things and take them forward, I would be happy to transfer
ownership to you.  It's been a long time since I have worked with CPAN.
Do you know the steps I'd have to go through to do the transfer or a
pointer to some directions?  Thanks.

I have run into a problem with my password/email address.  I have emailed
Andreas and asked him if it can be fixed.
