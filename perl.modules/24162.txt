I originally sent this to cpan@perl.org. I hear this is the appropriate address for this sort of thing?

CPAN Maintainer(s?),

The WWW::Search::PubMed module is broken and has been for quite some time. It was last updated over three years ago, and as far as I can tell has been broken for the majority of that period. I attempted to contact the author, Jim Smyser <jsmyser@bigfoot.com>, to offer to take over ownership of the module, but email to that address is bounced by bigfoot with the message "This account is not allowed...jsmyser@bigfoot.com."

Is there an established protocol for dealing with a situation like this? I've got a new version of the module that works that I'd be ready to upload, but I believe I'd need to be listed as a co-maintainer of the module before this could happen (is this correct?).

Any help you could provide would be appreciated.

thank you,
Gregory Williams
