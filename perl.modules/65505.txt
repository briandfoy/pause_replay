Hi,

I'm about to finish a module for accessing Java JEE Server's JMX  
MBeanServer
remotely by transfering JSON entities. This contains a Java agent  
part, which
gets deployed as a WAR on the JEE Server and which exposes JMX  
information via
HTTP.

The perl side encapsulates the HTTP request and JSON parsing. It  
provides an
OO style programming model which can be used for Nagios checks to  
monitor
JEE Servers. The question is, which is the appropriate namespace.

The closest toplevel existing namespaces are "Nagios" and "SNMP", but  
evidently
JMX is something quite different. In a perfect world, they would be  
all below
a top level namespace like "Management".

My suggestions for a module name are:

JMX::JJAgent             - Top-Level "JMX" ("JJ" for "JMX JSON")
Management::JMX::JJAgent - Top Level "Management", but this seems to  
be overkill for
                           a single module, or ?
Nagios::JMX::JJAgent     - Since the module is probably most valuable  
for nagios checks,
                           but it is not related

My prefered name for now is 'JMX::JJAgent', where I might consider to  
provider alternative
modules for accessing JMX information via perl modules (e.g. one based  
on GCJ::Cni)

What are your opinions on this ?
