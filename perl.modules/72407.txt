     why:

    I wrote a module called Net::Squid::Guard, which helps writing a
    redirector for the popular Squid web proxy engine. It was inspired
    by the squidGuard redirector, hence the name, but aims to be more
    flexible (not that difficult). I think it can be useful for others
    too.
