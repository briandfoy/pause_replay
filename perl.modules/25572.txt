Dear Colleague,

Happy New Year!

As we know, codon preference among different species could be dramatically
different.  To enhance the expression level of a foreign protein in a
particular expression system (E.coli, Yeast, Insect, or Mammalian cell), it
is very important to adjust the codon frequency of the foreign protein to
match that of the host expression system.  One classic example is GFP (green
fluorescent protein) which was optimized to achieve high-level of expression
in mammalian cells.

GenScript has developed a proprietary algorithm for codon optimization.
This algorithm can optimize sequences for protein expression using either
your own codon usage table or those from publicly available codon usage
database.  It can converts your amino acid sequence into a DNA sequence with
overall codon usage similar to a specified organism, and also optimizes the
RNA secondary structure, GC content, repetitive codons etc. Using Genscript
optimized synthetic genes, many of our customers have reported dramatic
increase on protein expression.

The optimized gene can be synthesized by GenScript gene synthesis technology
with 100% fidelity.  The cost is as low as $2.35 per base pair.  Our service
is very flexible, we can clone the optimized gene into our standard vectors
(without extra charge), or any expression vector that you provide (for $400
extra charge).

Gene synthesis is a powerful technology and it has many other applications.
Another application example is to replace PCR Cloning.  Please visit our web
(http://www.genscript.com/gene_synthesis.html) to learn more about this
technology.

Besides Gene Synthesis, we also provide custom vector-based siRNA, siRNA
cassette, peptide, oligo, cloning and protein expression, biochemical
reagents, and labwares.  Please visit our web site
