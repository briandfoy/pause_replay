My CPAN id is CARPENTER.  A few days ago I uploaded my Storm-Tracker bundle.
This bundle is currently in the Geo::Storm_Tracker::bla namespace.  I am
considering renaming it to be in the Geo::StormTracker::bla namespace for
version 0.02.  The only problem with the new name being that StormTracker
has 12 characters which is more than the recommended 11.  Any guidance here
would be appreciated.

I have noticed that although I can search CPAN by author for CARPENTER and
see my module listed, I can't search for Geo and find my module.  This works
for Geo::METAR and Geo::WeatherNOAA but not for mine.  Have I done something
wrong?

I have yet another module that I may or may not release.  I would like to
bundle it separte from my Storm-Tracker stuff although it is related.  It is
currently named Bla::Graphics::GeoPlot (a namespace only used by my
employer).  I have considered naming it either Geo::StormTracker::GeoPlot or
maybe Graphics::GeoPlot but don't really know what namespace to use.  It is
used to plot a position track (as returned by
Geo::StormTracker::Data::position_track ) via gnuplot to generate track maps
similar to what can be seen at http://www.chron.com/storm  It does not use
any of the Gnuplot related modules on CPAN but rather just writes the
gnuplot configuration files directly.  The advantage of leaving it as a
separate independent bundle is that if my employer decides to release it at
a later date (very possible), it will not require any additional work to
integrate it into the Storm-Tracker bundle which will soon be maintained by
Dr. Ruscher at the meterology department of Florida University rather than
by myself.
