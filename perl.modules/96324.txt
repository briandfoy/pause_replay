Hello,

I would like to ask for co-maintainenance rights to TeX::Encode.

I posted my patch to the PAUSE bugtracker (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Dis
play.html?id=118001) on 2016-09-03. I have since tried contacting the
author on his timbrody@cpan.org email (doesn't deliver), the email in the
.pm file as well as the email on his Github profile, all without success.

Besides my patches, there are 3 other open patches at the moment, the
earliest dating back to late 2011.

See below for the emails sent.

Thanks and regards,
Ahmad Fatoum (athreef@cpan.org)

Hello Tim,

I submitted a patch to TeX::Encode a week and a half ago and would like to
ask you to incorporate it into TeX::Encode on CPAN. The patch is here:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=118001

I am also interested in the other open patches/issues. I am writing an
Input method for OS X (http://github.com/a3f/Bowdlator) and one of the
stock profiles is a method where entered *\texnotation* is translated to
Unicode on the fly and I would like to use TeX::Encode for the translation.

For this, it would be nice to have the other patches merged. If you are too
busy, I would appreciate if you could assign me co-maintenance, so I
can incorporate the changes myself.

Thanks and regards,

Ahmad (athreef@cpan.org)
