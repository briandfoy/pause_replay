Please do not upload a distribution that supercedes an existing
distribution but has a module with a LOWER version number than the
existing CPAN distribution.  It confuses the heck out of CPAN.pm.

Specifically, Template::Plugin::Filter seems to have gone from version
1.04 to 1.03 when Template-Toolkit went from 0.27 to 1.02.  CPAN.pm
therefore wants me up install 1.02 to upgrade most things, but then
wants me to install 0.27 to "upgrade" ::Filter.  Bleh.  I can't win.

[And module-ators, isn't there some checking we can do in PAUSE to
automatically reject such distributions?  We've now had both this
distro and the WWW::Search mess to deal with.]
