Right, fixing it is always possible (except the module is already in use -
so that's another issue). However lets take a look at CPAN's root
directory:

ARS
ACE
B
BBDB
BnP
CIPP
Cdk
Cz
DCE
DWH_File
ERG
FFI
LSF
LWP
MOP
NNML
PDL
POE
PV
Sx
WDDX

Phew - that's an awful lot of acronyms ;-)

I know I'm stretching this a bit - the above is meant humorously, and I
realise that a lot of the above will have been uploaded without a request
to modules@perl.org, but AXDTK is more of a product, than something that
should be under the Apache::XML::* namespace. I guess that's my opinion,
anyway.

As for being "widely known, standards, etc", well I hope to make the first
one of those a reality in the near future with a number of articles in
various publications. That's how a lot of the above got to be "widely
known" too. Although some of the above are just simply named badly! ;-)
