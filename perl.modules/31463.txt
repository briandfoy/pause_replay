The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Baseball::Simulate
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: Baseball team's season simulation
  userid:      NIRAVE (Nirave Kadakia)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    CVS repository, Mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    Baseball is sport that relies on statistics and computations. There
    is a large and growing segment of baseball fans that are moving
    towards more analytical and mathematical judgements of players,
    teams, and events. This is evidenced by the large propogation of
    baseball statistical sites, the growing membership of the "Society
    for American Baseball Research", and teams such as the Boston Red
    Sox, Toronto Bluejays, and the Oakland Atheletics, who heavily rely
    on mathematics, simulation, and data mining to determine player
    roster and movements.

    This means the rootlevel "Baseball" namespace should be created, as
    there are many calculations and tools that can be available to the
    average fan.

    The "Simulate" namespace is named so because it simulates a season
    for a specific team.

  enteredby:   NIRAVE (Nirave Kadakia)
  enteredon:   Mon May  3 18:38:36 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Baseball::
::Simulate        adpOl Baseball team's season simulation            NIRAVE
