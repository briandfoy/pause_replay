The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::CGI::Dependencies
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: install all CGI dependencies
  userid:      SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This was originally an autobundle that I put together to maintain
    and update my CGI modules. It has saved me so much time that I
    decided to put it on CPAN. There is a companion module that I'm
    working on to go along with it: Bundle::CGI::All.

  enteredby:   SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  enteredon:   Sat Jul  7 04:17:28 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::CGI::
::Dependencies    adpnp install all CGI dependencies                 SKI
