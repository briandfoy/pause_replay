The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TDB_File
  DSLIP:       bdcrg
  description: Tie to TDB files
  userid:      ANGUSLEES (Angus Lees)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perhaps samba@lists.samba.org (TDB doesn't have its own list)

  similar:
    DB_File DBM_File GDBM_File

  rationale:

    I don't like the name, but it seems to be where all the DBM
    interfaces are, and TDB_File is definately one of them :(

    (unsure whether i need to "register" this name, since its not
    really a new "namespace" - but its a top-level, so i thought i
    should)

  enteredby:   ANGUSLEES (Angus Lees)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul  2 00:05:40 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

TDB_File          bdcrg Tie to TDB files                             ANGUSLEES
