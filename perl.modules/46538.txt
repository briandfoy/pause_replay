The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chatbot::RiveScript
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Perl RiveScript Interpreter
  userid:      KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    aichaos.com, bot-depot.com

  similar:
    Chatbot::Alpha

  rationale:

    RiveScript is the successor of Chatbot::Alpha. The RiveScript reply
    language format is similar to that of Alpha replies, but has much
    more power and is not entirely compatible with Alpha.

    RiveScript is a line-by-line command-driven response language,
    where the first symbol(s) of each line is the command that tells the
    module what to do with the rest of the data.

    RiveScript is a chatterbot reply language script. User input is
    sent into your RiveScript code, and a reply is sent back.

    The naming of Chatbot::RiveScript is appropriate because it is for
    chatbots and the name RiveScript is descriptive of what it does: it
    interprets RiveScript.

  enteredby:   KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  enteredon:   Wed Dec 21 22:47:42 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Chatbot::
::RiveScript      bdpOg Perl RiveScript Interpreter                  KIRSLE
