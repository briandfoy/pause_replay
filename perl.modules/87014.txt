Hi,

Can you give me primary ownership of Apache::OneTimeURL and HouseURL =
please? These are in the Apache-OneTimeURL dist, which was released by =
Simon Cozens. HouseURL has ADOPTME, but Apache::OneTimeURL doesn't.

I'd like to do a release that doesn't contain HouseURL. I note that =
Apache::OneTimeURL has the following perms:

Apache::OneTimeURL,AUDREYT,f
Apache::OneTimeURL,JESSE,c
Apache::OneTimeURL,NUFFIN,c

I'm assuming this isn't because they wanted to release the module, but =
was done at the time HouseURL gained ADOPTME. I emailed all three asking =
if they were happy for me to take ownership, but haven't had a response.

I've had email with Simon Cozens, who agrees that HouseURL should be =
removed; he no longer has ownership of either module (which is why he =
couldn't give me ownership, or at least add ADOPTME to =
Apache::OneTimeURL), but his release is the most recent one on CPAN.

My plan is to do a release without HouseURL, then remove all permissions =
from HouseURL, so anyone could come along and start afresh with that =
name, should they want to.

Cheers,
Neil
