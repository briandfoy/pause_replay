Hi Neil, and CPAN admins,

I would like to maintain the Term-Shell CPAN distribution -
https://metacpan.org/release/Term-Shell . It wasn't maintained since
February 2007 (over 5 years ago), there are 5 lingering bugs, and it has
some test failures. There is one 4 stars review and one 5 stars review so
people appear to use it.

If you can give me COMAINT on its namespaces, that would be great.

The maintainer of the module is:

https://metacpan.org/author/NEILW

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
