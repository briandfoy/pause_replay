The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Checker
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: a framework for checking data validity

  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)

  rationale:

    A commonly performed task is to have a set of data that you want to
    validate. Given a set of elements, you want to test each to make
    sure that it is valid, and then break the set into two groups: the
    group that is valid, and the group that is not. With the group that
    is not valid, you usually want an error message associated with that
    element so you can see why it is not valid.

    Although this is an extremely common task, there isn't a convenient
    framework for expressing these tests in, which means that every time
    you want to do this kind of testing, you not only have to write the
    functions for doing the tests, you also have to write the entire
    framework as well.

    This module was written to provide the framework around the tests.
    A number of common test functions are provided, or you can write
    your own, and the framework will take care of the rest.

    The framework includes the following commonly desired
    functionality:

    1) Automatically take a list of elements and test each, separating
    them into groups that passed and failed.

    2) Run tests in parallel if desired.

    3) Support for including warnings and notifications for elements.

    The framework also includes some basic test functions (stored in
    Data::Check::XXXX modules) to do some types of tests.

    Originally, I wanted to use Data::Check, but it's been registered
    (but not used) unfortunately. Data::Validate is in use. I'm open to
    Data::Verify or any other reasonable variant.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
