The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Gradient
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Calculate Gradients Between Multiple Numbers
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is very simple; just four pure-perl functions. In the
    future I may make this module Math::Gradient::PurePerl and write a
    C-based version as well for speed enhancement.

    Mathematical gradients are an essential part of both graphics
    manipulation and statistics. I looked for a module that would
    calculate simple gradients on CPAN and could not find one, and I
    have two projects that I am working on right now that require such
    functionality. I felt this module would be useful to others as well
    because of it's application in graphics especially; the ability to
    generate fully gradient palettes for use in dynamic webpages seems
    really, really neat, and there's dozens of other applications as
    well.

The resulting entry would be:
