     why:

    I want to write a plugin for class DBI that allows programmers to
    quickly create and manage records with defined date ranges. EG
    records with a start_datetime and end_datetime column. The module
    would provide methods similar to those provided by Date::Interval
    but oriented towards searching for records rather than comparing
    existing data structures.
