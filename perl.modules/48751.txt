This is easy to solve for either of you: the next one to upload or
reindex a WWW::Bugzilla module distro is the owner. Whoever that is
can then give the other one comaintainership permissions.

Please take your chance soon, so that the database appears correct to
the CPAN cuser community.

Thanks (and sorry for the "process error", whatever this was)
