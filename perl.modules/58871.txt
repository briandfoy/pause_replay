The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::Maker
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Create many forms of Graph
  userid:      BATZ (Matt Spear)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Graph has a random graph creation function already

  rationale:

    Creating special graphs is an essential part of simulation and
    studying, this module seeks to provide many of the basic graph
    models (Barbell, Erdos-Ramsey, Grid, Cycle, ...) and some of the
    newer models (e.g. Small World).

  enteredby:   BATZ (Matt Spear)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb  2 23:49:57 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::Maker           RdpOp Create many forms of Graph                   BATZ
