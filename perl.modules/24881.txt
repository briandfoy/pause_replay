The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::NSP
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Ngram Statistics Package
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Package is already released via developer and ngram.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Text::ngram

  rationale:

    NSP is the Ngram Statistics Package. This is a package that allows
    uses to count up sequences of words in large samples of text, and
    find out which character sequences are particularly interesting.
    This is a released package that is used in Natural Language
    Processing research. It deals with Text in any language, hence the
    name Text::NSP. The package is reasonably mature, but still under
    active development. We are currently making it more modular in order
    to release via CPAN. The existing sites for NSP include the
    following:

    http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html
    http://ngram.sourceforge.net

    We believe that CPAN distribution is also important, since the
    package is written in Perl and would be of interest to the Perl
    world.

    Text::ngram is not quite as developed a package as Text::NSP.

  enteredon:   Fri Dec  5 00:25:53 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::NSP             Rdpfg Ngram Statistics Package                     TPEDERSE
