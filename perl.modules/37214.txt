From: curtlg@msn.com ("Curtis Greer")

I've deleveloped 3 modules that I would like to add to CPAN.

The first wo modules I've called  AuthenCert & AuthzCert. These modules are 
modeled
    after AuthenLDAP and AuthzLDAP. AuthenCert authenticates a user
    against an LDAP server by verifying that the user's Distinguished
    Name as well as the X.509 certificate is in the LDAP directory.
    AuthenzCert authenticates a user and authorizes that the user is in
    a group specified in the LDAP directory.

The third module is Register that registers a certificate and the 
information in a certificate in an LDAP store.

These modules were developed and tested using Netscape Directory Service 
6.2.  I have not tested with OpenLDAP.

I'm new to Perl so I don't know how to build a Makefile.PL and am proposing 
to just add the modules.
