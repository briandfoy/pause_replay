Hello Steffen et al, thanks for your response.

I was not previously aware that Adam had taken this up; no mention of it in any 
forums I frequent nor on CPAN.  But I'm very happy to hear it nonetheless.

If Adam is serious about this and wants to organize the effort to keep 
DBD::SQLite up to date, then I'm quite happy to step back from trying to start 
my own effort.  The main reason I offered to take over or co-maintain back 
around Jan 12th was because the module seemed to be abandoned and no one else 
was stepping up.  So I'm happy and prefer to join Adam's effort rather than 
doing a separate one.

Adam, I see from the Changes file in your repo that your group's most recent 
work is later than my announcement, since I announced when SQLite 3.6.8 was new 
and your repo has 3.6.10, and you've made a number of bug fixes.

Please indicate the main forum where your group is discussing this work so I can 
join it.  And I look forward to a CPAN release.  Or in helping you do it.

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
