The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::AA
  DSLIP:       Rnppp
  description: Japanese character plastic operation
  userid:      ARUTEIDO (satoshi ishikawa)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    These sentences are processed on the translation site. It undergoes
    plastic operation by a Japanese character-code. When displaying it
    by browser standard style MS Gothic 12 points of Japanese, the
    character string after it undergoes plastic operation can be
    normally displayed. It undergoes plastic operation without using tag
    only by half angle space, the em-size space, and the dot. It is the
    general one in the huge bulletin board group named two channels of
    Japan, and the one seen the picture made only from the character and
    ASCII art exist though the sphere of the language is limited, too.
    It is a module to be able to do an easy plastic operation of right
    adjust etc. without using the characteristic, and using tag. The
    function of division from the character string to 1 character in
    which the garble happens easily in the processing used by this
    module is being offered.
