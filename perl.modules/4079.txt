To whom it may concern:

I have been trying to download perl 5.003-005 and
www.cpan.org and once I receive the tar file, my virus
detection detects a virus and tells me that it cannot
be cleaned and advices me to delete it.  We are
implementing a Oracle Archiver and this is critical in
implementing.  Can you provide me with another copy of
perl 5.003-005 or can you suggest a way for me to get
a clean copy.  This is urgent and a prompt response is
appreciated.

Thank you,
