The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       version
  DSLIP:       MdhOp
  description: structured version objects
  userid:      JPEACOCK (John Peacock)
  chapterid:   27 (Pragma)
  communities:
    perl5-porters@perl.org

  similar:
    Perl::Version Data::VString

  rationale:

    I've been really lax about registering this namespace. With v5.10.0
    coming out, and version objects being in the core, I want to make
    sure that not just any module gets added to this namespace.

    Perl::Version is another way to handle version objects, but it is
    largely incompatible with version.pm and the core objects. I suspect
    I could help the author of this module get it to work with the base
    version.pm class (if he wanted), since most of the things he
    discusses as missing have now been added.

    Data::VString is (IMNSHO) simply misguided (in that it returns to
    the freeforall of v-strings). Perl v5.8.1 or better already have
    magic v-strings (which means you know that something is a v-string).
    This module is not OO, so there is no way to know /a priori/ that a
    given scalar was a "vstring" or not.

The resulting entry would be:

version           MdhOp structured version objects                   JPEACOCK
