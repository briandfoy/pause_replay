Removed from the deletion list. You received the mail because this
distribution hasn't been indexed. It hasn't been because there is no
non-development release on CPAN. This means that installing it via the
CPAN shell as "cpan Scalar::Footnote" should also not work.

(Development releases have underscores in the version numbers.)

Whether or not you want to change this is up to you, of course.

Best regards,
Steffen
