The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::FormBuilder
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Easily generate and process stateful forms
  userid:      NWIGER (Nathan Wiger)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailing lists, websites, many forums

  similar:

  rationale:

    Basically, this thing saves tons of time and effort. It's a layer
    that sits on top of CGI.pm which takes a more abstract approach to
    forms. It has a couple key wins: (a) automatic, 100% correct
    handling of stickiness, independent of the type of field (even
    handles multiple selects), (b) clean default HTML generated, and (c)
    plugin support for both HTML::Template and Template Toolkit. The
    module is already quite widely-used and very stable. Check
    www.formbuilder.org
