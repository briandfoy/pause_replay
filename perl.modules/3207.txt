Sigh.  Ok. I  understand that.  I may  misunderstood something  in the
pause docs, but  I thought if I  upload something to pause,  and it is
accepted, then  it is automatically  accepted as a  namespace request.
Unfortunately  dTemplate and  TableMap  is quite  stable  now (I  have
just  released TableMap  1.0 and  dTemplate  1.0), and  has some  user
base. Changing  the namespace  all programs which  are based  on these
needs to be rewritten.

Is there  any policy  how to  choose namespace for  a module?  I think
"dTemplate"  namespace is  very unique  and could  not conflicts  with
other  module names.  That's why  I  want to  keep  it. If  I need  to
categorize  this  module, then  it  is  a general  purpose  templating
system  which can  be  used  in CGI,  text,  xml,  html Building.  All
namespaces could be  used, but neither of that could  describe that. I
think  Template::dTemplate  would  be  a  good  name,  but  "Template"
namespace  is reserved  by the  Template Toolkit  (hmmm), and  I don't
like  if someone  thought these  two are  in close  relation. The  two
module has very  different approach. So I don't think it  is a problem
if "dTemplate" remains  "dTemplate": anybody who is  searching for the
word "Template"  will find it,  and I think  this is the  most perlish
templating   system   available   :-)    (in   my   personal   opinion
Template::Toolkit is a  very big beast which has  too many unnecessary
complexity built in).

TableMap is  another story. This  can be renamed to  DBIx::TableMap or
Class::Relation (Class::DBI is alread exists).

If I  must rename my  namespaces do you have  idea how I  can maintain
compatibility with the already released versions?
