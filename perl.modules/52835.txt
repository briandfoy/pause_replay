A top level generic-word namespace is probably not appropriate for a 
document parsing module, and further, your module seems to be about the 
OpenXML document standard, rather than the Microsoft Office program.

XML::Open obviously sucks, and XML::OpenXML seems odd too... and given 
you want to do a complete suite of modules, perhaps a top level of 
OpenXML.pm rather than Office.pm.
