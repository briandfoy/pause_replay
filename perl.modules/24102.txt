now forced to live in exile due to high pressure from International =
communities.

the sum of

maiden name, whose location will be revealed to you after your response, =
indicating your Interest to assist me. This money was moved safely to the =
Security/Finance company in concealed boxes as family valuables and precious =
items. I used this method to transfer the boxes safely through a diplomatic =
channel. 
Due to the my present condition, I search for a trusted foreigner who Will =
assist me to lift the funds safely out of the security company and deposit it =
in his account for safety purpose. You will also help me to invest this money =
in any lucrative ventures in your country but I myself will like to invest =
some of the money in real estate. I have all the deposit information and =
documents with my lawyer there . We are going to begin the process of =
changing the beneficiary In your favor to enable you claim the funds from the =
security/finance company, by the time I have established confidence in you =
and your readiness and competence to be very swiftly and sincere to handle =
this business with me.
I want you to know that due to our position in exile here in Nigeria that the =
confidentiality of this transaction is absolutely essential to me. As soon as =
the consignment is out from the finance company and the Transfer made, you =
will be compensated with 20% of the total sum, while the remaining will be =
for investment. If you are willing to assist me in this transaction, kindly =
contact  my lawyer as my lawyer will handle the responsibility of this =
transaction from the point of forwarding the binding agreement to you for =
endorsment as my antineries would not permit me regular audience at frequent =
intervals.I will appreciate with great magnanimity your favourable dispostion =
and facilitated accord and your good hands of friendly partnership in this =
business .
This is lucrative business which i want you to handle with seriousness and =
confidentiality until the money gets into your hand for investment purposes =
