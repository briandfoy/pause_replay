Well Johan, I think that I owe it to this list and you the maintainer 
to do my part in reducing your work load and frustration.

Therefore I retract my April 4th request for the 3 module 
registrations, given that I hadn't really given a concise feel of 
what the modules did and how they were unique.

The subject in question was "I request namespaces for 
File::VirtualPath, Config::HashTree, HTML::Application".

Furthermore, I won't make any more registration requests until I have 
uploaded the module in question to CPAN (or another public server) in 
its finished or semi-finished state.

This way, you will only see requests for modules that you don't have 
to wait for and that you have a clear idea what they do.

That said, I do hope that you will honor today's new request for 
registering "File::VirtualPath", as it did follow a completed module 
upload, and/or follow-up on it somehow.

Thanks for all your efforts,

// Darren Duncan
