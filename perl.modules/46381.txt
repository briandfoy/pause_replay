Subject: GD::Graph maintenance questions
Date: Sat, 10 Dec 2005 15:48:04 -0500

From: bwarfield@cpan.org (Benjamin Warfield)

I would like to volunteer to help maintain the GD::Graph  
distribution.  I've been working on integrating the various patches  
that have accumulated on RT.cpan.org, and I'd like to get those  
patches out where other people can use them.

The problem is this: I tried a few weeks ago to contact Martien  
Verbruggen (with an offer to send him either an integrated patchset  
or an uploadable tarball of the patched distribution) at his listed  
address on CPAN, and have received no response.  This could be for  
any number of reasons, but it leaves me in a slightly unproductive  
limbo: I don't know of any other means of contacting him, and given  
the length of time since the last GD::Graph release, and even since  
the last post of his I could find on CLPM, it seems not unlikely that  
he simply hasn't got the time right now to deal with even potentially  
helpful e-mail about it (even assuming that e-mail address still  
reaches him at all).

That said, I'm wondering what to do.  Is there a better way I should  
go about attempting to contact Martien Verbruggen?  If I can't reach  
him by any means at all, do you have any suggestions for what I  
should or could do to contribute to the upkeep of this module, beyond  
adding patches to the current accumulation on RT?

Regards,

	Ben Warfield
