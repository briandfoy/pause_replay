Hi there:

These new modules have been available for a few months now.

Net-Subnet-Count is written to simplify collecting subnet statistics out =
of log files. Tie-IP-Address provides a hash interface to IP-Address.

I would like both to be included in the official module list.

Thanks in advance.
