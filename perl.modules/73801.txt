The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::REHash
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Hash with both plain and regexp keys
  userid:      METADOO (Alexandr Kononoff)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tie::RegexpHash

  rationale:

    Tie::REHash is to mean tie()d implementation of RegExp (keys) Hash
    that can have regexps keys along with plain keys (plus some more).
    Such name is consistent with already existing naming of listed
    modules, like Tie::IxHash, Tie::LLHash, Tie::CPHash, etc.

    Similar functionality is offered by Tie::RegexpHash, but suggested
    Tie::REHash module is different - it offers partially different hash
    interface, has different implementation approach (somewhat like
    differences of those Tie::LLHash and Tie::IxHash) that makes it more
    scalable, and offers wider functionality.

    Thus, the existing Tie::RegexpHash can be viewed as simpler (in
    terms of use, implementation and even name, which is more obvious
    for novice) alternative of more advanced suggested Tie::REHash. As
    famous Tim Toady once said, there should be more than one way to do
    it. So, here is the second way - Tie::REHash.

  enteredby:   METADOO (Alexandr Kononoff)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov 29 23:45:29 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::REHash          Rdphp Hash with both plain and regexp keys         METADOO
