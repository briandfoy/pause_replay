Dear fellow developers!

I already have an account at PAUSE (AMALTSEV), but as the modules I'm
going to upload to CPAN were created by our team I would like to apply
for some kind of team account if you please. The software is released
under GPL (we are considering Apache style license, but it should not
really matter I guess). It is just that I do not feel right about
publishing team work under my name.

So, here goes:

  Name:              XAO Inc.
  Email address:     am@xao.com
  Homepage:          http://xao.com/
  Preferred CPAN ID: XAOINC (I would prefer just XAO, but you have
                     limitation of 4 to 9 characters, hence XAOINC)

We're going to contribute some perl modules we developed:

XAO::Base - utilities, base classes and dynamic object loader for
perl. We find it very useful to be able to have different modifications
of the same object in memory simultaneously in mod_perl environment.
This module helps with that.

XAO::FS - database independent hierarchical database API. Currently
has a driver for MySQL, but is not limited to that or to relational
databases in general. Has XML DOM interface in development, will most
probably have XPath interface and probably some other XML related
modules.

XAO::Web - rapid web development environment. Has embedded support for
XAO::FS. Has modules for building e-commerce applications and generally
to build all kinds of dynamic content. Modular, object oriented. And we
like it a lot :)

XAO::Messenger - remote access suite for XAO::FS, allows to manipulate
data in XAO::FS remotely using SOAP and WSDL. That's in development, but
chances are very good it will come out soon.

So, bottom line - please approve.

Thinks!

Andrew.
