Hi

I am not sure of the procedure.  Anyway I uploaded an update to
Digest::Hashcash to support the newer version 1 format strings.
(Original auther Marc Lehmann Cc'd).

Now when I uploaded it said something about permissions missing for me
to do that, however searching cpan finds -0.04, the one I just
uploaded.

As this is my first upload, I am not sure, but is this ok -- it seems
to find it which is what counts I guess.

Adam
