The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SWF::Search
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Find text strings in SWF (Flash) files
  userid:      MAJCHER (Marc Majcher)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    SWF::File

  rationale:

    This is a simple module intended to be used by "search engine"
    authors for the purpose of extracting text strings from Macromedia
    Flash SWF files. While a developer could use the full SWF Parsing
    modules available and write extensions to detect and pull out
    strings, this module provides a solution that is lightweight, with a
    very simple interface. It is intended for those who just want it to
    go, and don't care to muck about with SWF internals.

The resulting entry would be:

SWF::
::Search          bdpOp Find text strings in SWF (Flash) files       MAJCHER
