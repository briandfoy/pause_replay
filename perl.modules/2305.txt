Dear Sirs,

my name is Andrea Spinelli, my permanent email address
is spinellia@acm.org, my personal home page is
http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/9626 (but it deals
mainly with my family!), and I have some extremely
simple functions I would like to contribute
to the Math::VecStat package.  Specifically,
I would like to add functions for multiplying
a vector by a scalar, for testing whether an
array is ordered, for convoluting vectors.

Moreover, I would like to add a test harness to
the existing module.

I did not do a discussion in public of the topic
on the Perl newsgroups, but I am prepared to do so
before applying my changes.

I have written to the module author exposing my views,
but he is not available for further development,
as you can read from the attached e-mail exchange.
He is reading this message in carbon copy.

I therefore propose to become the maintainer of the module
on CPAN.

In case my proposal is accepted, I will need some pointers
to help me become a CPAN author...

Thanks for your attention
   Andrea Spinelli
