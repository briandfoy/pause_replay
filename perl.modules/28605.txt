     why:

    Dear CPAN,

    Currently there are two things I want to contribute. I don't want
    to waste your time, so I start explaining:

    The first one is, I added server-support to Authen::SASL::Cyrus
    (currently only client behaviour is implemented). Of course I tried
    to contact the author (Mark Adamson) to apply my patches, but I
    don't received an answer (I contacted him in Nov/Dec 2003, Jan 2004,
    last try was 1 weeks ago). Graham Barr, who will apply a patch to
    Authen::SASL to enable server functionality, suggests to create a
    new module. Andreas Koenig added: at least a temporary module, until
    Mark is responding again.

    I needed the server functionality of Authen::SASL:: because I wrote
    a client/server framework in OOPerl which relies on SASL for
    authentication. This will be my second contribute to CPAN in the
    next time.

    I think in the future I will bring maybe some more useful things,
    but currently this is what I would like to provide.

    best regards and thanks for your attention, Patrick Boettcher
