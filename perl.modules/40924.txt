I agree with you, Adam and Brian. I have renamed the distribution to
Business-BR-Ids where Business::BR::Ids will be the module that glues
together modules which deal with Brazilian identification codes.

Actually the distribution still has a Business::BR module and it does
nothing. Just reserves the namespace and define a root module which
points how to find other Business::BR::* modules. And it was in this
vein that I first submitted a request for registration of this
namespace. It got me confused that in PAUSE I asked for namespace
registration and in this list it shows up as module submission. It is
really not a good idea to take over such a general name with some
functionality that I may think it is universally useful (and I don't
want to do that). But what about this strategy to keep the
Business::BR module as a general pointer?

Adam Kennedy was the first to point me the general benefits of small
distributions that can occasionally be bundled to a larger one. I will
adhere to that.

Thanks a lot for the hints. And a little question: the modules of the
distribution will just show up in a query to search.cpan.org with
mode=3Dall when it is not a developer version?

Best regards,
Adriano.
