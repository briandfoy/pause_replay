why not?  and if modules shouldn't use it, why does it need to be a pragma?

still, how do you expect people to enforce correct usage if you can only 
use it once?  i certainly wouldn't allow such a pragma in a team development
environment.  it sounds very fragile.

sounds too complicated.  i like the way Socket.pm, Fcntl.pm, and others
do it.  it's much more simple.
