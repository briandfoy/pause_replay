I have not gotten a reply from Steve since posting this message, over a mon=
th
ago (and I checked my spam folder). As a result, I ask the CPAN admins to g=
ive
me COMAINT on String-Random so I can submit new releases.

One should note that String-Random is quite high on the CPAN adoption list:
http://neilb.org/adoption/index.html .

Best regards,

	Shlomi Fish
