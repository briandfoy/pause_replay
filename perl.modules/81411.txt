Subject: Module submission MooseX::Types::Time::Piece

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::Types::Time::Piece
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Time::Piece type and coercions for Moose
  userid:      STEVENL (Steven Lee)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    MooseX::Types::DateTime

  rationale:

    I'm working with a system which has lots of objects that represent
    call detail records. DateTime objects are simply too heavy for my
    purposes, and is really detrimental to the system performance,
    especially during object construction. I much prefer to work with
    Time::Piece because it is fast and lightweight, and has all the
    functionality that I need.

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::Types::Time::
::Piece           idpOp Time::Piece type and coercions for Moose     STEVENL
