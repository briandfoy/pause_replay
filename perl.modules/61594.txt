I tried contacting Patrick Collins, PCOLLINS, the original author
of HTTP::DAV, but it seems he's out of reach.
The RT bug queue of HTTP::DAV seems to be stalled.

I think there's a *big* problem with circular references that
I'm working on, and I will probably have a fix soonish.

So we (CPAN:OPERA in this case, not CPAN:COSIMO)
are asking to get co-maintainership of HTTP::DAV,
at least until Patrick shows up.
