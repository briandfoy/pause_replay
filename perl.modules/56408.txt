Dear Steffen,

That's strange enough because


      id/D/DM/DMOW/DBD-SQLrelay-0.1.tar.gz

is shown under my PAUSE account on 'Show my files 
<https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=show_files>' and 
'Delete Files 
<https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=delete_files>' sections 
but not on http://search.cpan.org/~dmow/.

I know no one using this module so it's OK to cancel the namespace 
registration.
