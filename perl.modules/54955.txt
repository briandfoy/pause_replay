The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App:CamelPKI
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: PKI based on Catalyst
  userid:      GRM (Jeremie Klein)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    We developped a full PKI with Certificate Authority in Perl. We
    choose the name App because it is an entire application. CamelPKI
    was choosen because of his reference to the Perl Camel.

    If you need aything more, i could send it to you.

    Thank You ! -- grm
