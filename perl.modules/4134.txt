Net::ConnectTunnel seems a bit clumsy, but I can't really think of
anything better.  Net::Tunnel would cover too much, as it's not a
general tunnelling module.  Eventually, I'd like to extend the module
to include other ways of tunnelling through HTTP proxies, at which
point the name Net::HTTPTunnel would become appropriate; perhaps it's
better just to assign that now.  In truth, either ConnectTunnel or
HTTPTunnel would be fine with me.

The module is an OO interface to sockets that are tunneled through an
HTTP 1.1 CONNECT proxy request.  I can imagine that it would be useful
for adding a tunnelling option to scripts so that they may be used,
for example, behind a corporate firewall.
