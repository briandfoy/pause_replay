Hi

I have been working on concordancing scripts for a few years now and
have finally got around to the realisation that this all should be a
nice neat module (to stop people asking if it is available).

So the initial module I am proposing is a concordancing module that
given an arbitrary text/html (and possible PDF or RTf) file it will
produce a concordance of all the words, the top x most common words or a
contextualised list of the sentences that use the list. The file could
be in the local file system or publicly available on the Web (ftp and
http).

An example cgi is working from www.spaceless.com/concord/

I am also working on an HTML2RTF convertor that would produce an RTF of
all the text and images in the file. Many of my students have asked
about this too.

I also have a more generic module that checks if a file is a valid GIF
or JPEG file and returns the dimensions of the image.

(There's other things too).

my homepage is http://www.spaceless.com
preferred email is gordon@spaceless.com
preferrred user-ID is GFLETCHER (that fits nicely!)

Thanks for your attention

Gordon
