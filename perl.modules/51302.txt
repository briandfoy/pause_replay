The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Search::QueryBuilder
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Search tokenizer
  userid:      CSELT (Emma Tonkin)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Search::Circa Search::QueryParser String::Tokeniser

  rationale:

    The namespace - I originally was planning to propose putting this
    under an EPrints- namespace, since it is used by the EPrints
    projects in the UK. However, I am informed that EPrints is likely to
    change its name... since it is effectively a tokeniser and query
    builder intended for search functionality, it seemed to make sense
    to place it under Search::.

    The approach: well, there was until recently no standardisation on
    the syntax allowed for search input on digital repositories. This is
    an attempt to provide something that current partners will be happy
    with, and to provide means to link it up with the various syntaxes
    already in use elsewhere.

    Why it should be listed in the module list? I think it does a
    fairly decent job of solving a fairly common problem, has no
    dependencies and is quite easy to use.

The resulting entry would be:

Search::
::QueryBuilder    bdpOp Search tokenizer                             CSELT
