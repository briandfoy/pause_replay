Looks like where were some goofs in the PAUSE indexer as well as a bunch
of permissions fixes necessary.

This should be owned by me.  Its currently owned by JHI in the "first come"
basis because he released it in 5.8.1 RC2.

Ditto.

The only mention of "package MY" in MakeMaker.pm is once in an eval and
once in the documentation.  The indexer shouldn't pick that up.

This is a bug.  There is a here-doc in MM.pm which contains /package in/, it
must have picked up on that.

It appears PAUSE is applying the $ExtUtils::MM_Unix::VERSION to
ExtUtils::MakeMaker::_version.  This appears to be the general behavior
when it finds an extra package without a version #.  Doesn't seem right
at all.
