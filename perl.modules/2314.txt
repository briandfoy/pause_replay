DBIx-Password is a module that gives you a central place to store
passwords for databases.
During the make process you assign to a virtual user the connect string,
username, password
and any attributes that make up the virtual user. You then call
DBIx::Password like
you call DBI and use its connect method (which takes a virtual user
name) and it 
returns a DBIx-Password database handler (AKA reblessed database
handle).

The module will be MdpO

Its been discussed on the slashdot authors mailing list. It is being
used
in the next version of slashdot to get around some of the chicken and
egg 
problems of having all of the scripts find the right databases and
passwords.
I decided to write it generically enough to be of use to a wider
audience
since this is about the 5th time I have reimplemented it for a different
group.

You can find the module at:
ftp://ftp.tangent.org/pub/perl/DBI-Password-1.1.tar.gz

If you need any further information, please ask.
