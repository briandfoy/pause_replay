I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working on=

<br>
You have ownership of the =E2=80=9Cbeagle=E2=80=9D namespace, as a result o=
f your beagle module, which is part of your Bio-Phylo-Beagle distribution. =
This now clashes with the Beagle module, owned by SUNNAVY, and part of his =
Beagle distribution. This conflict means that people couldn=E2=80=99t insta=
ll your distribution and Beagle at the same time on case-insensitive filesy=
stems (eg Windows and Mac OS X).<br>
<br>
The best solution would be for you to rename the =E2=80=9Cbeagle=E2=80=9D m=
