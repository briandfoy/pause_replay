     why:

    i have several modules i've authored. the one i'm wishing to
    contribute currently is called AI::LibNeural. others may be added as
    they mature, or someone expresses a desire/need for them.

    it consists of xs wrappers for the libneural c++ library. it's
    built with the standard process, perl Makefile.PL, documented
    decently and tested with the Test package.

    i'm also one of the primary authors of gtk2-perl(-xs), which
    another developer is currently posting on cpan.
