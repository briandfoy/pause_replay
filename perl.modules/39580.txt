The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::PostalAddress
  DSLIP:       cdpOb
  description: Country-specific postal address management
  userid:      PAUAMMA (M. Lavondes)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lingua::EN::AddressParse.pm

  rationale:

    This module attempts to provide a country-specific (or
    country-localisable) and language-independent framework for handling
    postal addresses. Unlike Lingua::EN::AddressParse, it doesn't embed
    language-specific information beyond "use locale"-enabled regexes.
    It seems to me that Locale:: makes more sense for it than Lingua::.

    Also, some countries may require specific extensions to the
    framework, which I feel would best go under Locale::PostalAddress::
    using the 2-letter ISO 3166 country code as the module name. For
    that reason, I'd like to register both Locale::PostalAddress.pm and
    Locale::PostalAddress::.

  enteredby:   PAUAMMA (M. Lavondes)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 10 17:18:42 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Locale::
::PostalAddress   cdpOb Country-specific postal address management   PAUAMMA
