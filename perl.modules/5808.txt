Hi Maintainers!

	I am writing you in the hopes of getting a CPAN account activated to post
my contributions to perl. Here are the actual requested informations:

Name: Benoit Beausejour
Email: bbeausej@pobox.com
Homepage: http://www.flatlineconstruct.com
Requested Userid: BBEAUSEJ


I currently have two modules I want to contribute, I actually also want to =
discuss their names
and pertinence:

1. DBI::Sequence

This module is intended to give easier portability to Perl database applica=
tion by providing a=20
database independant unique ID generator. This way, an application develope=
r is not bound to use=20
his database's SEQUENCE or auto_increment thus making his application porta=
ble on multiple database=20
environnements.=20

This module implements a simple Spin Locker mechanism and is garanteed to r=
eturn a unique value=20
every time it is called, even with concurrent processes. It uses your datab=
ase for it's state=20
storage with ANSI SQL92 compliant SQL.=20

POD documentation available at: http://bbeausej.people.hbesoftware.com/DBI-=
Sequence/man.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
------------

2. Date::Object

Date::Object is a container for dates that holds all the methods to transfo=
rm itself
from Timezone to Timezone and format itself. This module idea comes from an=
 original version
written by dLux (Szab=F3, Bal=E1zs) <dlux@kapu.hu> in his module Class::Dat=
e.

Date::Object is implemented in pure Perl using POSIX modules, it encapsulat=
es the environnement=20
variable TZ for it's time zone management so you don't have to play with it=
 externally in the=20
implementation.

It uses operator overloading and Delta date objects to calculates time diff=
erences.


POD documentation available at: http://bbeausej.people.hbesoftware.com/Date=
-Object.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

=20
Both modules are complete with documentation and working...

I'd really like comments on the implementation, the documents should give a=
n idea of what
I am trying to do in both modules...I hope I'm not completely out of line ;)

Mainly also, I hope the names I gave to them fits in available namespaces...


thanks alot!

Ben
