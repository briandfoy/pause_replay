Adam,

Short answer: You're right. I'll take Agent::TCLI.

The T has always meant Transactional to me. That's different from an
interactive interfaces, say curses or GUI, which can interpret things
as they are typed/clicked.

Good point. That's about it. Hopefully with a lower learning curve and
easier navigation, but that sums it up rather well.

Transports are all providing a TCLI. IM obviously works that way. For
HTTP, I'm thinking basically a chat window, with the help and manual
provided in separate frames. Still one would be typing the commands.

Agent wasn't something that I had considered much before writing the
email, but after looking at it again and thinking about it after the
request was sent, I was leaning that way too. Now you've pushed me
over. I am going to keep the T for Transactional though, since other
CLIs are usually interactive and don't provide transaction response
codes.

The same could be said of a GUI. The problem is that in most cases,
there is no underlying CLI to use, or it is so complicated one has to
specialize in it to use it. Here I'm trying to make a CLI that people
can use, while at the same time making sure that computers can use it
too. I didn't intend on the latter from the start; it evolved out of
the testing requirement. That will be limiting to some degree, in what
stuff can be done computer to computer, but I expect that TCLI could
mostly compete with things like SNMP or TL1 (a telco interface).
Especially for accessing one's refrigerator before leaving work to
find out if there is enough beer for tonight's game.

I could go into a long story about why I see XMPP or SIP as being the
desired transport here, but this is not the right forum. Lucky you. :)

Thanks for your help.
