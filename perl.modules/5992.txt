The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Link
  DSLIP:       iupOp
  description: Link Testing related modules
  userid:      MIKEDLR (Michael De La Rue)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    libwwwPerl.

  similar:
    uses libwwwperl: there are various programs but no modules

  rationale:

    I'd like this as a namespace place holder, at least to get further
    comments. There are a number of 'submodules' that I'd like to put
    under it to do checking etc. of modules. These are basically the
    reusable parts of a piece of link checking software that I am
    writing.

    Namespace: This is really WWW related so seems to fit here. URL and
    URI cover actual representations of Links. Link is a more general
    thing. Modules which work on links can fit here quite well.

    Uniqueness: No other modules are directly related to link checking.
    There are modules related to the web.

    Value: Link checking keeps coming up as something that people want
    to do with perl. However, there is no standard library specifically
    dedicated to doing this.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
