The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SMTP::ESMTP
  DSLIP:       bdcOl
  description: SMTP client library (wrapper for C libESMTP)
  userid:      MAKLER (Piotr Klaban)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::SMTP Net::Server::Mail Mail::Transport::SMTP

  rationale:

    This libESMTP wrapper is fast, based on callback functions.
    libESMTP is an excellent ESMTP library, with DSN, SASL (not
    cyrus-sasl!), TLS, ETRN etc. support.

    It is a contrary to my another module - MIME::Fast (based on C
    gmime library). I plan to release also a wrapper for libfolder (a
    part of future balsa MUA project). Then this three modules would
    even allow anyone to build a separate MUA (without huge disk and RAM
    usage). Net::SMTP::ESMTP is independent package (depends only on
    libESMTP and optionally openssl), and could be used to send e-mails
    to SMTP server from any source.

    I have proposed two names on usenet news (comp.lang.perl.modules):
    - Net::SMTP::Client (this is bad because libESMTP could one time to
    become more advances library, that some MTA could use it as well). -
    Net::ESMTP - is would be the best one, because it is short. But I do
    not know if it is good to start a new namespace in Net. Is it??

    Other modules comparison: - other modules are written purely in
    perl, this module does not need other perl modules, then it is
    easier to use - Net::Server::Mail is meant for servers -
    Mail::Transport::SMTP is a part of Mail-Box. This is very good and
    well designed package, but Mail::Transport::SMTP is not so advanced
    as Net::SMTP::ESMTP.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::SMTP::
::ESMTP           bdcOl SMTP client library (wrapper for C libESMTP) MAKLER
