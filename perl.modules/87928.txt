Hi Ron and friends.

This morning I logged in to PAUSE and saw that all versions of my
App::GitGerrit module were effectivelly deleted. Then I checked on
www.cpan.org/modules/index.html and on search.cpan.org and couldn't find
any mention of it.

After that, I released a new version of my module (v0.017) and uploaded it
to PAUSE. I can see it there in *my files" already. However, so far I only
got the email titled "CPAN Upload". I haven't got the email titled "PAUSE
indexer report" yet, which is the strange behaviour I was getting since
v0.010.

I'll wait until tomorrow to be sure it won't be really indexed and I'll let
you know.

Hope was the last thing coming out of Pandora's box, wasn't it? :-)

Gustavo.
