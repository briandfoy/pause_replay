The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Solaris::ProcessContract
  DSLIP:       RdhOp
  description: Manage Solaris process contracts
  userid:      DWARREN (Danny Warren)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/dannywarren/Solaris-ProcessContract

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will be used to manage process contracts on solaris via
    the libcontract interface.

    I searched cpan for any existing modules that would help do this,
    but it looks like there isn't anything out there.

    The namespace for this module may be a little wordy, but I had to
    do that for code clarity and to make it easier to understand at a
    glance.

    Unfortunately solaris uses the term "contract" to refer to most
    everything related to the contract system, so I needed a way to
    differentiate the main module class from the actual contract
    instances.

The resulting entry would be:

Solaris::
::ProcessContract RdhOp Manage Solaris process contracts             DWARREN
