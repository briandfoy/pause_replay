I've broken up the libwin32 distribution into individual uploads
for each package.  There seem to be 2 minor indexing problems:

Could you remove the old package from the index?  This problem doesn't
prevent Win32-Pipe to be listed correctly by search.cpan.org, but it
prevents an entry for Win32::Pipe in modules/02packages.details.txt
(there is no entry for Win32::Pipe in it at all right now, not even
for the old package that prevents the new one from being indexed).

The Win32::Sound::WaveOut namespace is defined in the same source file
as Win32::Sound, so please make the co-maintainerships for
Win32::Sound::WaveOut match the one for Win32::Sound.
