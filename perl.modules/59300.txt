SMUELLER comments:
Hi Tom,

thanks for writing the module. If your new module has full access to the Mac Paste-/Clipboard, would you consider talk to or working with the author of Clipboard.pm to include support for your new module into the Clipboard.pm one? That way, it wouldn't have to resort to shell commands any more.

Just a suggestion. I think it would be a great win for users.

Cheers,
Steffen
