The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Iterator::Hierarchical
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Iterate hierarchically over tabular data
  userid:      NOBULL (Brian McCauley)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module abstracts out a technique that I and all my colleagues
    use day-to-day but for reasons I could never understand does not
    already appear to be implemented on CPAN.

    Initially I called this iterator "recursive" but eventually decided
    on "hierarchical" as being more descriptive.

    I chose Data::Iterator over Iterator as this does not inherit from
    Iterator. I considered doing so but this made the API unwieldy.

    I've marked this as "beta" but really the only thing that remains
    before I release this as 1.00 is a clean up of the documentation.

    I'm not sure where to put this in terms of "Module List Chapter".
    I've said Data_Type_Utilities. It could also be seen as fitting
    Database_Interfaces but it is not limited to being used with DBI so
    I've resisted putting it that chapter or in DBIx namespace. It could
    also been seen as fitting in Control_Flow_Utilities since what it
    does is simplify the flow control when reading a rowset from a
    joined database query.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Iterator::
::Hierarchical    bdpfp Iterate hierarchically over tabular data     NOBULL
