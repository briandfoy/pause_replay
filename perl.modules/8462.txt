I'm writing source filters allowing number literals like 1M or 64k, etc.
(with every SI prefix (postfix)) and 5i (for imaginary numbers) to
demonstrate my idea from perl6-language@perl.org. I'd like to make those
modules available on CPAN, as well as couple of other, mostly adding
some new syntax to Perl.

(I've read that IDs should be 4-9 chars long, but there are a lot of
3-character IDs already registered. Also it's very important to write my
name exactly RaFaL as I've been writing it this way for ten years or
so.. :) I hope it won't be a problem.)

Thanks a lot.
