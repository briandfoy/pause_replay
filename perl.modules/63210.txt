Hi Piotr, hi James,

James, please note that the actions taken are all reversible. Nothing is
being taken away from you. You are still primary maintainer of the module.

[snip copy of mail to James]

Piotr, I have given you co-maintenance for the "all" modules. We've
waited for such a long time in case James was simply unable to read his
mail for some time. Please read
http://steffen-mueller.net/taking_over.txt for an explanation of why and
how things are handled around here.

Best regards,
Steffen
