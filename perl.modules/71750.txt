The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JSPL
  DSLIP:       RdcOp
  description: A bridge between JavaScript and Perl
  userid:      SORTIZ (Salvador Ortiz)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl-javascript@perl.org

  similar:
    JavaScript JavaScript::SpiderMonkey JavaScript::V8 JavaScript::Lite
    JSP

  rationale:

    JSPL is a new approach to languages integration. Its allows perl
    programmers to use inline and outline JavaScript code, extend perl
    with JavaScript functions and objects. Allows JavaScript programmers
    to extend the language with perl code, perl modules, even use most
    of CPAN unchanged.

    JSPL originated as a fork from Claes Jakobsson's JavaScript module,
    its API and namespace hierarchy are too similar and require a
    separate namespace to avoid confusion.

    I expect to have eventually a lot of "glue" modules being created
    by other developers, to simplify the use of existing perl modules in
    CPAN for JS programmers, please see "JSPL::Tweaks::IO::Handle" in
    the distribution as an example. So the project needs a short top
    level namespace.

    I'm aware that an acronym reduces the chances of other people to
    discover our project, but when all good names are taken, the second
    best is a totally new name.

    I originally requested 'JSP' but that clashes with unrelated "Java
    Server Pages". So in the same spirit of Larry's JPL I'm now
    requesting 'JSPL'.

    Thanks again.
