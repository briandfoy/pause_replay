Hello,

I'd like to have a user-ID on CPAN. Here is, what I have to offer:

my name:          Tommi Mäkitalo
email:            tommi@maekitalo.de
homepage:         http://www.maekitalo.de (as usual it is under 
construction)
prefered user-ID: TMAEK
short description:

I created a extension for DBI, which represents a cursor for a single 
table. You can select, update, insert or delete entries in a table in a 
easier way than creating SQL-statements. It is called DBIx::Cursor. It 
does not use any specific features of any database, so it should work 
with every driver. (I've tested it with postgresql by now).

Another thing I have is a (or two) cgi-scripts, which creates 
HTML-documentation of pods installed when requested. So you have the 
perl-documentation online as soon as you install a new module. We use it 
since almost 2 years.

Tommi Mäkitalo
