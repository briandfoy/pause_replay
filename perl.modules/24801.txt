Hi Andy,

Sure, if there's still a need for WDDX and you want to take it over, go 
for it. I haven't touched it in a while and it has gotten quite stale. 
At one point a year or so back I sent out an email to folks who'd sent 
me previous bug reports asking if anyone was interested in picking it 
up, but no one was then. Have fun with it, and hope my code ain't too 
hard to parse. :-)

Let me know if I need to do anything via CPAN or if the cc: is enough.

Thanks,
   scott
