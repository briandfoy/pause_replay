cool, Data:: was originally what i was thinking of. the term
'Properties' itself has a very specific meaning to java
programmers, specifying a file format and an object
interface. im not averse to using a more descriptive name,
as long as i dont tie it to a data structure. perhaps
Data::NVStore (nv == name/value), Data::NVTable, or
something along those lines?
