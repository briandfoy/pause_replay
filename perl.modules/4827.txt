I am Ilya Sterin.
I am the developer of XML::CSV module.
I am in the process of developing XML::Excel module and would like to
reserve another namespace.  My PAUSE username is ISTERIN.
I have discussed this module on ActiveState's Perl-XML mailing list
(Perl-XML@listserv.ActiveState.com) and they greatly supported it and
believe it will be as usefull if not more as XML::CSV.  I already have a few
volunteers to do the testing and some are ready to implement.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ilya Sterin
