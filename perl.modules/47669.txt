The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SXIP::Digest
  DSLIP:       Rmpfb
  description: Create a SXIP digest from a SXIP message
  userid:      KGRENNAN (Keith Grennan)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)

  rationale:

    Hello,

    I've just uploaded an implementation of the Simple eXtensible
    Identity Protocol (SXIP).

    There are no SXIP-related modules on CPAN yet, as far as I know.

    I've created a package called "Net-SXIP-Base", which contains
    common SXIP-related modules used by various other SXIP modules and
    applications. The only module in this package right now is
    Net::SXIP::Digest, but I expect there will be more. Not sure if I
    should be registering the package or the module here. Anyway -
    thanks!

    Cheers, Keith
