     why:

    I'm a junior developer. I have built an application using Perl for
    the company I work for. I have used CPAN modules to do this and
    wouldn't mind adding to CPAN myself. I work with a more experienced
    developer who has suggested that with a CPAN id he would allow me to
    maintain and make changes to his modules
