The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EBook
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Object class for manipulating E-books
  userid:      AZED (Zed Pobre)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, an earlier RFC sent to modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The project is a base class and an associated command-line tool for
    generating and manipulating e-books based on the IDPF standards. I
    previously sent a RFC for the name EBook::Tools to modules@perl.org,
    and it was given blessing, but it was a name really more appropriate
    to what the project looked like when it began, namely a collection
    of procedures mostly oriented at helping me do some e-book
    conversions. I eventually moved the main functionality into an
    object now capable of substantial examination and modification of
    the book metadata, and now it seems more appropriate to me to simply
    name the module 'EBook'. There do not appear to be any competing
    projects on CPAN at all.

    <p>I've made a snapshot of the pod2html output for both <a
    href="http://www.resonant.org/project/ebook/ebook-tools.html">module</a>
    and <a
    href="http://www.resonant.org/project/ebook/ebook.html">tool</a> so
    people can get a better idea of what the code does (though I'm still
    using the old EBook::Tools name in my working copy). One of the
    things that I would be working on in upcoming releases would be
    unpackers for proprietary formats (reimplementing convertlit,
    mobi2html, and pdbshred), using my base module for cleanup and
    modification. These would end up going into EBook::Unpack if I claim
    EBook for the base module.

The resulting entry would be:

EBook             bdpOg Object class for manipulating E-books        AZED
