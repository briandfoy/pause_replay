The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UDPM
  DSLIP:       RmpOg
  description: Perl extension for User Dialogs
  userid:      KCK (Kevin C. Krinke)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/udpm-list

  similar:
    Curses Curses::Widgets

  rationale:

    Um, well origionally I did not even consider that my coding ability
    would even mature to a state where I could say "someone else might
    be able to use this".

    My main rationale when deciding the name was

    A) it had to be an acronym of some sort (because everything I'd
    thought of that described what I wanted to convey was way too long)

    and

    B) It had to have something to do with the dialog(1) application
    (that I'd origionally coded this for) and with user interfaces...

    thus: User Dialog Perl Module

    If you have any suggestions/reccomendations I'd be more than
    receptive. This name never really stuck well but is definetly better
    than the alternatives I'd come up with:
    DynamicUserInterfaceManipulator or UserInteractOOP...

  enteredby:   KCK (Kevin C. Krinke)
  enteredon:   Mon Dec 23 11:09:44 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

UDPM              RmpOg Perl extension for User Dialogs              KCK
