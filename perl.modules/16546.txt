The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ogg::Vorbis::Header
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: View Vorbis info & comments; edit comments
  userid:      DBP (Dan Pemstein)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=200588

  similar:
    Ogg::Vorbis

  rationale:

    Ogg::Vorbis::Header provides an OO interface to the header fields
    of Ogg Vorbis files. It allows users to view info (bitrate, etc) and
    comment (artist, title, etc) fields, and to edit the comments.
    Essentially, it is MP3::Info for Ogg Vorbis. I initially wished to
    name the module Ogg::Vorbis::Info but the name has been changed to
    accomodate using it with the existing Ogg::Vorbis (libvorbis) module
    which returns Ogg::Vorbis::Info objects for certain operations.
    Although the existing Ogg::Vorbis module allows for viewing of info
    and comments, it doesn't allow for editing (the author says he plans
    to do so but the module hasn't been updated in years and doesn't
    compile on many modern Linux distributions). In addition, I like the
    unix philosophy of one tool per job and think there is good reason
    to have separate modules for different aspects of dealing with
    Vorbis files, as opposed to Ogg::Vorbis' all-in-one approach.

The resulting entry would be:

Ogg::Vorbis::
::Header          adhOg View Vorbis info & comments; edit comments   DBP
