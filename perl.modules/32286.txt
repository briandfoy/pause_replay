Good morning,

I certainly hope I'm sending this to the correct list.... The author and
maintainer of Algorithm::SVM and Algorithm::HMM has left our lab and I
will be taking over maintenance of the modules.  We can't figure out how
to transfer the modules to the account I've just requested for myself.

I will be the long term and permenant maintainer, so hopefully we won't 
have to go through this process again.  If you could please let me know 
how we do this and what he needs to send to the list to authenticate.  
Thanks.
