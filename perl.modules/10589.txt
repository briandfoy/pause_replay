Subject: Namespace advice: Games::TileMap vs. Games::Object::TileMap

From: stwrtpj@earthlink.net (Pete Stewart)

I'd like to have some advice on naming a new module before I register
the namespace. I am the author of a new module I first uploaded back in
January called Games::Object, which provides a base class for writing
games. This is part of a larger project of other modules based on this
one, which will allow Perl programmers to write a variety of types of
games.

One of these modules that I have almost ready for release is a module
that allows creation and manipulation of tile-based maps for games. The
initial interface will be specific for Tk, but will be designed to allow
other interfaces to be plugged in to it in the future.

The question is, which namespace is better, Games::TileMap or
Games::Object::TileMap? This new module does indeed subclass off of
Games::Object, so that might be an argument for the longer name, but
there's lots of examples of subclassing that do not do this
(RPC::PIClient and Net::Daemon come to mind). I prefer the shorter name
since it will have some auxiliary modules under it, and I want to keep
the number of "::"'s to a minimum in my class names.

Does anyone on the list have a particular preference before I register
Games::TileMap? I asked around at comp.lang.perl.modules but didn't
really get a majority opinion one way or the other.

Thanks in advance.

Pete
