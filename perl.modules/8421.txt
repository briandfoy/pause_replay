The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::TagFilter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Fine-grained removal of html tags.
  userid:      WROSS (William Ross)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, perlmonks, mod_perl list (if approved)

  similar:
    HTML::Parser

  rationale:

    Well, it's not a very exciting module, but it does one thing
    reasonably well that lots of people need and nothing else is doing:
    removes html tags and removes attributes from tags, based on rules
    supplied by the user. It has sensible defaults and is easy to use
    and configure.

    it began as a conversation on perlmonks, and I talked it over on
    comp.lang.perl.modules about two versions ago. Gisle Aas has gone
    over it and seems to approve of the module and its tentative name.
    He made a few suggestions, most of which have been incorporated.

    The module is a direct consequence of my work developing CMS for
    amnesty international. i use it all the time and intend to develop
    it further as my needs develop and the needs of its other users
    become apparent.

    I hope you find it satisfactory.

    will
