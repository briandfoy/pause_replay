No, it is not.  It _is_ an occasionally used convention for
implementing a extension of an established function. (eg.: atan2
dup2 exp2 gethostbyname2 log2, etc...)

This convention is used within the perl distribution: eg. IPC::Open2
(creates open2), IPC::Open3 (creates open3).

There isn't a 'System' heirarchy; I don't feel comfortable inventing
a new top-level namespace, just to put something underneath it. :)

_Maybe_ it could be argued that this could live under the 'IPC'
heirarchy.  If the Powers-That-Be want to argue such a change into
place, I guess I could go with that.

But, this module has been available on CPAN for months now, and I
know that some people are using it, so, if nothing else, I plea
that for the sake of running code, I don't change the namespace
spuriously.
