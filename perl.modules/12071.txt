The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  rationale:

    * Description

    Apache::XBEL is an Apache mod_perl handler that uses XSLT to
    transform XML Bookmarks Exchange Language (XBEL) files into exciting
    and foofy dynamic HTML documents. Documents are rendered as
    collapsible outlines and individual nodes may be viewed and
    bookmarked as unique pages, so you don't have to click through a
    gazillion nested leaves to find what you're looking for.

    If you have the Text::Outline package installed on your server, you
    can use it to convert a number of outline(r) formats as XBEL for use
    with the handler.

    Once individual nodes/pages have been rendered, they are cached to
    reduce the load on the server. Cache files are updated whenever any
    of the widgets involved in the transformation are modified.

    * Note

    This package has a long TO DO list. It works fine, but there are a
    number of items that I'd like to tickle. They are, however, pretty
    low on the totem pole so I figured I would share what I've already
    written now.
