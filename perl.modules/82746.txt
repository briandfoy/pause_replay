Which module?  What happened?  Did you get an email message?  Without
more details we can't help you.

I did look here:

http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DG/DGRAHAM/simpleXMLParse/

If that's the one you mean, I notice that the module there does not
follow standard naming conventions, which might cause indexing
problems.

But best would be if you could explain your issue more fully.
