What does this cryptic acronym stand for.
I did a google search for it and I got only 7 results,
whereas the most sensful is perhaps:
http://www.fz-juelich.de/DCE/DFS_Installation.pdf

I'm asking, as a top level namespace should be a common, easy to
understand name.

Or DBD::CSV,
DBD::AnyData,
DBD::Sprite,
(perhaps) DBD::SQLite,
Storable,
Data::Dumper,
...

What is that new to this module=
Storing data in textual format is very common,
database management is very common and
both had also been developed.

I'm asking because you say that it is completely new and had never been
there.
