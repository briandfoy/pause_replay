Subject: PAUSE approvals

I've noticed that sometimes the people able to do PAUSE approvals are all
busy, and since I tend to drive cat/dbic people to request accounts so they
can contribute quite often I tend to be made aware when it happens quite
a bit.

I was wondering if you'd like me to volunteer as somebody who does approvals,
so I can take on some of the workload I'm causing you guys myself and help
keep the "desire to contribute" momentum of the people involved up in the
process. Obviously I'm volunteering to deal with approvals in general, not
only for people wanting to contribute to specific areas.

Would that be possible and/or useful?
