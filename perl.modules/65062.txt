thanks for your willingness to take up maintenance of the module. While
I sympathize with your preference to be able to use an official, fixed
CPAN release, the take-over procedure in case of a missing author
unfortunately takes some time.
The rationale and procedure is discussed at length in
http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover, please have a look.

Given that there have been other module releases from Enrico in the past
year, it is very likely he's still around and simply couldn't answer
your mail yet for some reason. Your best bet to get a fixed release up
on CPAN in time for your internal release is trying hard to reach and
work with Enrico.

Enrico, if you'd be happy to have John do a release of the module for
you because you're too busy, then please let us know so we can grant him
co-maintenance permissions. Alternatively, log into pause.perl.org
yourself and give John co-maintenance status via Change Permissions->3.
Making co-maintainers->3.1 Select->Enter user ID (JINGRAM)->Make
Co-Maintainer.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
