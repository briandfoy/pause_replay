Hi,

is the "GT" abbreviation entirely obvious in the context of finances? If 
  not, would you consider Finance::GeniusTrader instead?

I'm willing to approve the Finance::GT namespace, too, but since 
Finance::GeniusTrader is not abnormally cumbersome and much more 
descriptive (at least to an outsider), I'd prefer that.

Cheers,
Steffen
