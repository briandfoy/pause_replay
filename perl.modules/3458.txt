Well, I have to take time to write these emails, too.  I don't consider it
a price to pay, just something that needs to be done.

Odd.  If time is the issue, you could have done it already in the time
you've spent explaining why you don't want to.

Sorry, but your "precious time" is not all that relevant to me.  I am here
to give my opinion on proper use of the CPAN.  If you had taken more time
up front to make sure your name was a good one -- you admitted you knew
about it and did it anyway, so any time wasted is your own fault -- then
this would not have happened.

We already did suggest other ones.

Sigh.  I wish you would attempt to be reasonable.  Unfortunately, I see
that is not the case.  Every other incident I've seen where the
modules@perl.org list said that a name is bad and should be changed, the
parties involved complied, even if they disagreed, because that's the way
things work.  I guess there has to be a first for everything.
