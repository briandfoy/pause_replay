This is my first attempt at a module submission so I am not
sure how to do it. By copying from other submissions on
modules@perl.org, I have come up with the following.

The following module is proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

modid: Acme::EyeDrops
DSLIP: Rdpfa
description: Visual Programming in Perl
userid: ASAVIGE (Andrew J Savige)
chapterid: 2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
communities: fwp@perl.org mailing list
similar: Acme::Bleach, Acme::Smirch, Acme::Buffy

rationale: 

Acme::EyeDrops converts a Perl program into an equivalent one,
but without all those unsightly letters and numbers.

In a Visual Programming breakthrough, EyeDrops allows you to pour
the generated program into various shapes, such as UML diagrams,
enabling you to instantly understand how the program works just
by glancing at its new and improved visual representation.

Note to Module List Maintainers:

Acme::Bleach and Acme::Smirch are currently in section 3
(Development Support) of http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html
and without the Acme:: namespace prefix. This is an error
because they have been moved into the Acme namespace.

Acme::Buffy is in "Documentation Tools" sub-section of section 2
(Perl Core Modules, Perl Language Extensions and Documentation Tools).

I am not sure what section these four modules belong in,
but they are all similar in that they all encode a Perl
program in an amusing way, while still allowing it to
function correctly as before.

Regards,
Andrew Savige
