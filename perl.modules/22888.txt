The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SDL::OpenGL::Cg
  DSLIP:       cdcfp
  description: Interface to the Cg shader language.
  userid:      MOLT (Paul Golds)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    sdlperl.org mailing list.

  similar:
    SDL::OpenGL (Provides an interface to OpenGL, SDL::OpenGL::Cg
    expands on this to allow access to the shader facilities of newer
    graphics cards).

  rationale:

    It provides a useful functionality by allowing Perl graphics and
    games programmers to take more complete advantage of their graphics
    cards by providing an XS-based interface to nVidia's Cg and CgGL
    libraries. This should allow them to equal the quality of images
    that C/C++ programmers already have access to from the library.

    I personally use SDL::OpenGL for my OpenGL interface, and as such
    whilst SDL::OpenGL::Cg may potentially work with other OpenGL
    interfaces SDL::OpenGL is the one it's being targetted at and
    primarily supported for. This is why I'm writing it as
    SDL::OpenGL::Cg and not OpenGL::Cg or someother such related module.
    As yet I can't think of anything tying it with SDL::OpenGL's
    functionality, but I would be surprised if it remained that way for
    the module's lifetime. The author of SDL::OpenGL has also been
    informed of the choice of namespace and expressed no objections.

    Whilst the module is still only providing a subset of the C API it
    is already useable, and useful, proving that the project can be a
    long-term technical success in marrying these two languages
    together.

The resulting entry would be:

SDL::OpenGL::
::Cg              cdcfp Interface to the Cg shader language.         MOLT
