Brian,

I have done as you instructed, yet the changes do not appear on the module
list. Specifically, I am looking at this page:

  http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html

1) What does it take for the correct author name (Info field) to appear?

::MoonPhase  Rdpf? Information about the phase of the Moon.    RPIKKARA
::MoonPhase  Rdpfp Information about the phase of the Moon.    BRETT

If a user clicks on RPIKKARA, they are taken to an old buggy version of
the module. I have improved Astro:MoonPhase, and I would appreciate if the
module list reflected the current status. RPIKKARA is not the current
maintainer.

If manual updates to the list are time-consuming, why not automate it or
have the list dynamically generated like much of the other CPAN pages?
Has the module list truly not seen an update in over two years:

   $Revision: 3.112 $ $Date: 2002/08/27 23:28:18 $

Please help clear this up. Thanks.  :)
--Brett
