I submitted this module yesterday.  After reading the documentation on 
PAUSE, I wonder if I should resubmit it within a different namespace.  I 
think that at first glance it would seem it should fit into the MP3::* 
namespace.  However, I don't think this is correct, because podcasts are 
not limited to MP3 files.  I think a more appropriate namespace might be 
something like Media::Podcast::Publisher, but there is not a Media::* 
namespace.  I think a Media::* namespace might be good, since there is, 
AFAIK, nothing that would fit media like MP3, OGG, Ogg/Theora.  The list 
of media items will only grow and it doesn't make sense IMHO to have 
each media item have a top-level namespace like MP3 currently has.  Can 
someone please offer me advice on this?  If it is more appropriate to 
install into another namespace, then perhaps my current upload can be 
halted.

Thanks,
Chris
