The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::File::MultiLines
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Reading  multiple lines  from  file handler
  userid:      REDICAPS (徐洲)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    CVS repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    It is subclass of IO::File so that it should be listed under
    IO::File when we want to read some lines into a array, using "@array
    = <fh>" just load all the content into array. We have to define a
    bunch of variables to load these lines. The module would provide a
    method "get_lines" for this situation

  enteredby:   REDICAPS (徐洲)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar  8 03:41:04 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IO::File::
::MultiLines      idpOp Reading  multiple lines  from  file handler  REDICAPS
