Hi,

I have a CDDB search/get script that allows users to search for keywords
on the CDDB CD database website.  The script then returns a list of all
albums/artists that match the search words listed as arguments to the
script.  The user can then choose a single album from the list to have
the tracklisting for that album 'dumped' into a file in the current
working directory.

If this is suitable material for the PAUSE site, I would be obliged to
have an account with the following details:

Name: Jez Hancock
Email: jez.hancock@munkboxen.mine.nu
User-id: jezhanco

Many thanks in advance,
Jez
