The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attribute::Abstract
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: implement abstract methods with attributes
  userid:      MARCEL (Marcel Grunauer)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, london.pm mailing list, vienna.pm mailing
    list

  similar:
    Attribute::Types Attribute::Memoize Attribute::TieClasses

  rationale:

    SYNOPSIS package SomeObj; use Attribute::Abstract;

    sub new { ... } sub write : Abstract;

    DESCRIPTION

    Declaring a subroutine to be abstract using this attribute causes a
    call to it to die with a suitable exception. Subclasses are expected
    to implement the abstract method.

    Using the attribute makes it visually distinctive that a method is
    abstract, as opposed to declaring it without any attribute or method
    body, or providing a method body that might make it look as though
    it was implemented after all.

    RELATED MODULES

    Attribute::{Types,Memoize,TieClasses} also use attributes, but to
    achieve different things. As such, they are related to the
    implementation (and listed here only because Attribute::Handlers, on
    which they all depend, is so new), but not in functionality.

The resulting entry would be:
