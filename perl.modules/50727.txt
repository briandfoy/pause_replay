The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SNMP::Effective
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Effectively queries a lot of hosts by SNMP
  userid:      EIDOLON (Jan Henning Thorsen)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    SNMP::Multi

  rationale:

    The namespace SNMP::Effective: It uses SNMP.pm to do the actual
    work, and it does it quite effectively, by quering a lot of hosts in
    parallell.

    I don't know of any other module that does this. SNMP::Multi does
    somehow the same thing, but not in the same way as I. I'm using a
    callback method which is called asynchronously, which increase the
    speed and flexibility.

  enteredby:   EIDOLON (Jan Henning Thorsen)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep  5 14:56:04 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SNMP::
::Effective       RdpOp Effectively queries a lot of hosts by SNMP   EIDOLON
