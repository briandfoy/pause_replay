The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree::Menu
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Menus as trees
  userid:      PSHARPE (Paul Sharpe)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tree::DAG_Node

  rationale:

    (from the pod)

    As menus are basically trees, Tree::Menu subclasses Tree::DAG_Node
    to provide a class which is useful for manipulating menu structures
    like the navigation on a website.

    The goal was to make it simple to define and manipulate menus in a
    class rich with tree-like methods whilst de-coupling it from any
    presentation. In the case of a website, it is anticipated that you
    will manage the presentation using your favourite templating
    language.

  enteredby:   PSHARPE (Paul Sharpe)
  enteredon:   Mon May 10 07:46:54 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tree::
::Menu            bdpOp Menus as trees                               PSHARPE
