I have a CPAN id (JFITZ) which never had any modules activated under it.  I
don't have the password or access to the email account, but I would like to
try to get my module activated with CPAN.  I'm not sure how best to prove my
identity.

If the original requests for IDs are kept, it would have been in the early
months of 1998.  I had written an XSUB to allow access to the functions in
libwrap from Wietse Venema's TCP Wrappers package.  I don't recall why it
was never registered, but a check today shows that in the nearly three years
since I first wrote the module, nobody has come up with any other offering.

I have seen a number of projects recently that want to centralize access
control with TCP Wrappers (that argument has been well made by others), but
do not have an easy way to check this data from Perl.

Here's the rest of the data for the modlist and such: if someone can tell me
whether I can get the email/password reset or just apply for a new one that
would be helpful.

Name          DSLI  Description                      
TCP_Wrappers  bdcf  access TCP Wrappers ACL functions  

Thanks.
