Hi Ron,

@Ask: Could you add Ron to the new PAUSE admin private mailing list, please?

Sorry that it took such a long time to get back to you. I'm only writing 
real quick before my train arrives to let you know that we finally got 
things sorted (as in: finished discussing and gotten a hold of Andreas) 
to set you up as a PAUSE admin.

In a nutshell, you can now sudo into other people's PAUSE accounts. Have 
a look at the PAUSE menu on the left of pause.perl.org, it should have 
expanded quite a bit.

Just have a good look and experiment a bit (I bet you can sudo into your 
own account...). Your help would be most appreciated in the general area 
of addressing co-maint requests, miscellaneous questions, disputes, 
confusion, and so on. As for co-maint requests, please have a look at 
the "takeover" section of the 04pause.html document. It contains a lot 
of the discussion why we do things the way we do them. In everything, 
please be considerate and respectful (not saying you ever weren't) and 
most importantly never abuse your power. In giving co-maint permissions, 
please be very conservative to get a feel for how chances are that 
things will resolve naturally. We've had very few cases of people 
getting back to us angrily with "You've taken something away from me 
while I was in hospital for four weeks", but it's adamant to prevent 
such trust issues.

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask (and 
possibly CC me directly). Thank you for stepping up. I wish you good 
luck and a lot of patience. :)

Best regards,
Steffen
