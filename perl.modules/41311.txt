The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Skew
  DSLIP:       cdpfg
  description: compute the skew between two clocks
  userid:      AUGUSTO (Augusto Ciuffoletti)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The functionality is related to timing, so it is reasonable to put
    it under "Time". The module aims at measuring a quantity that
    relates two clocks, the skew, and there is not a preexistent
    namespace for this kind of issues. So it seems appropriate to bless
    it with the name of the measured quantity. The term "skew" is
    defined in IETF documents, and should replace former "drift".

  enteredby:   AUGUSTO (Augusto Ciuffoletti)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun 29 08:38:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::Skew            cdpfg compute the skew between two clocks          AUGUSTO
