     why:

    As an active member of the Montreal Perl Mongers, I have this
    irresistible urge to share some of my Perl code. In the near future,
    I expect to make a presentation on Hierarchical State Machines with
    corresponding modules which would fit nicely under the existing
    StateMachine namespace. This is the first module I expect to
    contribute to CPAN.

    I also have scripts which might be of interest but which I do not
    expect to publish on http://www.cpan.org/scripts as of yet. The
    reason is that I must really make sure there is an purpose for such
    scripts before cluttering CPAN needlessly. Here is a brief overview
    of some such scripts:

    http://www.interunion.ca/src/symtab-0.1.tar.gz Tool for building
    symbol tables in C. The code is written in Perl and XS, aiming to
    create optimal tables from a static list of key/data pairs. Among
    other algorithms, this tool can build minimal perfect hash tables.

    http://www.interunion.ca/src/extractor-0.1.tar.gz Tool for
    generating self extracting archives in /bin/sh or PHP. The code is
    designed around the strategy pattern so that other languages can be
    easily added. I'm currently working on adding JScript so that
    Windows users don't feel left out.

    (not available yet) Daemon to persist in memory programs written in
    Perl and perhaps other extensible scripting languages eventually.
    This uses the same idea as FastCGI but is not bounded to a web
    context. Details will have to wait until I get something stable
    working.

    That's it for now, I hope you won't be too disappointed.
