Bingo!

I'm really glad to say that the problem is finally solved. I've released
Git-Gerrit-0.019 without that assignment to $Git::Gerrit::VERSION and it
worked. It's already indexed on
http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html.

Now I'm going to rename the module back to App::GitGerrit and release
v0.020.

Thank you for the attention.
