     why:

    I relay interested with Perl consent. Even throw i am an Embedded
    Engineer, now time being i am assigned with a work to create a tool
    (Using Perl) for Automate 40% of development cycle work. While doing
    this work we come across lot of issues and also found different
    solutions for those issues. I like to create some Perl module from
    my experience And like to share it with every one.

    CPAN.
