Hi there

You are technically able to upload your version, and install it using 
the long-hand form

cpan> install YOURAUTHOR/Digest-MD5-Reverse-1.23.tar.gz

However, because you do not "own" the name in any sense, the CPAN 
indexer will not recognise your version, and so this WON'T work.

cpan> install Digest::MD5::Reverse

(which is what you probably want to happen)

In order for the CPAN to recognise you and use your version, you need 
some level of "ownership" of the name.

Ideally, you can contact the original author, and he will give you 
"co-maintainer permission" which lets you upload new versions and have 
them recognised.

If you CANNOT contact the author after several attempts over a few weeks 
(and via multiple emails and/or phone or other methods) then we consider 
the author to be absent, and in their absence we (the PAUSE admins) will 
allocate co-maintainership rights to you, so you can in effect "take 
over" the module.

If you CAN contact the author, but he actively refuses to allow you to 
make changes, that is another matter entirely. There may be nothing we 
can do in that case.

The normal situation is just that you can't find the author. After you 
have tried for a couple of weeks, let us know and we'll get you permissions.
