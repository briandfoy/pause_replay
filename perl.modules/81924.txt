Subject: Attempt to contact module author Shlomo Yona (SuffixTree module on CPAN)
To: module-authors <module-authors@perl.org>, modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: daoswald@gmail.com (David Oswald)

The module author Shlomo Yona for the Perl Module SuffixTree lists an
email address that is no longer valid.  An email has been sent to this
author's @cpan.org email address as well (I'm hopeful that there will
be a response, but as of now haven't).  There are bug reports in the
RT that include patches ranging from 2 years old to 8 years old.  The
module was first uploaded in January of 2003, with two subsequent
revisions also in January 2003.  No activity since then.

This message is an attempt to contact Shlomo Yona.  If you know how to
reach him please let me know.  If he's willing, I would ask that he
grant co-maint.

Thanks!

Dave
