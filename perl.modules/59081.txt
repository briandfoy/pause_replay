From: geoff@hughes.net (Geoffrey Leach)

I recently had my hand slapped (in the nicest possible way!) by the=20
indexing pass on a new upload for Pod::HtmlEasy

The module had this line, which generated a complaint:

use version; our $VERSION =3D qv("1.0.0"); # Also appears ...

Doing it way was acceptable:

our $VERSION =3D 1.0000;

There's been a lot of discussion about versions, and I don't want to=20
re-open that. My only question here is whether there is a way to use
the version module in a way that satisfies indexing.
