I was fixing up some of the module permissions for the parrot
distribution today since the latest release is marked as
"unauthorized". At various times, Chip, chromatic, or Allison have been
release managers, so there's a variety of first-come and co-maintainer
permissions there. Handing off permissions for everything isn't that
simple. It gets worse as new co-maintainers  get first-come
permissions.


I thought that the PARROTRE mailing list in PAUSE might be able to
handle this, but I haven't done too much with those. What's the thing
we should do in these cases? I know that we frown on virtual users, but
that we've also done it for BBC. Should we do this for Parrot?

I can take care of all of the transfers and whatnot if that's a good
idea.
