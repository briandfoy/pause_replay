Subject: Module submission EBook::Tools

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EBook::Tools
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: E-Book creation, modification, and unpacking
  userid:      AZED (Zed Pobre)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace has previously received approval in a RFC sent to
    modules@perl.org. See:

    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2008/09/msg62397.html

    and followups.

    The package has expanded a bit since that time and now includes a
    fully functioning unpacker for Mobipocket and PalmDoc files, as well
    as extensive metadata manipulation abilties.

    The package is ready for use, and I have already uploaded the first
    release tarball.

  enteredby:   AZED (Zed Pobre)
  enteredon:   Mon Oct 27 09:19:10 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

EBook::
::Tools           RdpOg E-Book creation, modification, and unpacking AZED
