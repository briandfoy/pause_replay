Im a first time donar to CPAN and have a module that emulates
some of the simple assests of PHP and i need a suggestion of
where to put it.

In case you not familiar with PHP, here's what mine emulates:

   PHP has global array that store the GET, POST, COOKIE, and
   SESSION key/values in named arrays -- which act like Perls
   hashes, ie: _GET['usr'] is identical to my $_GET{'usr'}.

   The rest of PHP functionality is the ability to embed PHP
   inline with HTML in any directory. This ability is already
   created with the combination of modperl and EmbPerl.

   Thus with the combination of modperl, EmbPerl and my module,
   you can create pages with identical strengths as PHP has,
   but continue to use all of you're existing Perl knowledge.

I also include some helper functions for web functionality,
called get/set/remCookie() which controls cookies and the
getFormData() which returns a hash that combines all the
environment values into a hash-ref, similar to the CGI::new().

I was thinking of making a PHP::Vars that contains the current
above functionality, and then a PHP::Emulate that would contain
the above and additional functions that would require modperl
and EmbPerl to be loaded as well to fully flesh out the complete
picture.
