The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RPSL
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: RPSL Language Parser (RFC 2622)
  userid:      LMC (Luis Motta Campos)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Whois::RIPE::Object

  rationale:

    RPSL is a declarative language widely used worldwide by Regional
    Internet Registry (RIR) members, and Local Internet Registry (LIR)
    members, in order to create and maintain objects in their respective
    WHOIS database services.

    Being able to generate RFC2622-compliant declarations from Perl
    data structures and vice versa is an important feature for the
    Dorsal Spine of the Internet, can make a lot of people life's easy
    and allow Perl yet another market niche where other languages
    usually don't go.

    As I have the intention of write a complete set of modules to
    implement the RFC 2622 in full detail, grouping all this modules
    under an intuitive, easy-to-find, easy to remember name is essential
    to attract users and to keep this a consistent set.

    Thank you very much for your time and attention. Kind regards.

The resulting entry would be:

RPSL              adpOp RPSL Language Parser (RFC 2622)              LMC
