Subject: Module submission Filter::Template

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filter::Template
  DSLIP:       Rdpnp
  description: Source filter for code templates or macros.
  userid:      RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    module-authors list, poe mailing list, irc

  similar:
    Filter::Include (sort of), Filter::Macro (sort of)

  rationale:

    This module is a renamed POE::Preprocessor, spun off into its own
    distribution because POE no longer needs it.

    I originally chose to call it Filter::Inline, but it was pointed
    out that "Inline" means something else to most Perl people.

    Filter::Macro is already taken, or I would have used that.

    Filter::Preprocessor was considered on POE's mailing list, but
    source filters ARE preprocessors, so I decided that wasn't really
    meaningful.

    Since this module provides a simple source code templating feature,
    I considerede Filter::CodeTemplate. But source filters imply that
    something is being done with code, so I decided that "Code"
    templating was redundant.

    That's how I settled on "Filter::Template".

    By the way, it would be nifty if there were a support level for
    rt.cpan.org, and an interface style that somehow included source
    filters.

    Filter::Template is a unique module as far as I know.

The resulting entry would be:

Filter::
::Template        Rdpnp Source filter for code templates or macros.  RCAPUTO
