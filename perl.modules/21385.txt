The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Mappoint
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Mappoint maps service SOAP access library
  userid:      CGARCIA (Claudio Garcia)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have now changed the module's name to WebService::Mappoint, per
    suggestion from Tim Bunce.

    Mappoint .NET is a Microsoft web service that provides a SOAP API
    for creating maps and other geography related functions, such as
    geocoding (obtaining latitude and longitude for a street address).

    Microsoft provides a WSDL file which describes the service and is
    used by SOAP client libraries to expose its API to programs.
    SOAP::Lite does not support WSDL to the extent needed by Mappoint,
    thus the need for this module.

    WebService::Mappoint provides a perl mapping of the complete
    Mappoint API. It automatically encodes the required SOAP requests
    for each call in the API, and presents Mappoint responses as nested
    data structures that are easy to access.

    Thanks,

    Claudio
