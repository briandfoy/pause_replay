     why:

    This is a perl package base on the framework of Bioperl. It is a
    systematic package designed to integrate common general Population
    Genetics analyses and computations, with a strong emphasis on SNP
    data processing. It currently contains: modules for routine
    processes and manipulation of SNP data, I/O parsers for many
    different formats, a rich collection of Population Genetics
    computations, a queue of wrappers for various third-part programs
    and algorithms, and some graphic tools
