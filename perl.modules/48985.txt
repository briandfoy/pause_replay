Hello,

For the records, I'm forwarding the email I just sent to Steve Hancock,
author of Perl::Tidy, regarding the maintainance of this module.

----- Forwarded message from Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni <saper@cpan.org> -----

     To : Steve Hancock <shancock7078@bigfoot.com>,
          Steve Hancock <perltidy@users.sourceforge.net>

Hello,

I'm writing you this email because I thing you haven't received the mails
from RT to signal you that there are some tickets waiting there, including
one I just made to give you a patch that provides support for the defined-or
operators.

You can see the Perl::Tidy tickets here:
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Perl-Tidy

Alternatively, if you can't or no longer want to maintain Perl::Tidy, would
you agree to give someone the co-maintainer status so it can be updated?


Regards,

----- End forwarded message -----
