It's intended to be a module authoring tool. A way to upstream duplicate
or similar module parts that can't be put into subroutines. Like the
copyright section of pod, or code that is comon across an authors
distributions.

It is also a namespace for other module building include templates like:

    Module::Include::README
    Module::Include::Changes
    Module::Include::OOStuff

It is also meant to complement the new wave of Module::* tools.

So I think the name is exactly what it should be.

Cheers, Brian
