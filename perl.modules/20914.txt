The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Spec::Link
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Methods to read and resolve symbolic links
  userid:      RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The methods in File::Spec::Link are based on File::Spec and extend
    that class. I wanted to create a script that could replace a link by
    a copy of the target of the link (for editing perl source files
    created by ./Configure -Dmksymlinks). This is implemented in
    File::Copy::Link

    There seemed to be no existing modules that would take a link and
    return the name of the linked file, i.e. readlink followed by
    relative to the link's directory. The functionality existing in
    File::Find as PathCombine($AbsName,readlink($AbsName))

    Both File::Spec::Link and File::Copy::Link are in the distribution
    File-Copy-Link-0.02.tar.gz

  enteredby:   RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  enteredon:   Wed May  7 11:09:27 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Spec::
::Link            bdpOp Methods to read and resolve symbolic links   RMBARKER
