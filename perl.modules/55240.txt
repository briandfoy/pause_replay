The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::UWO::Directory
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perform lookups using the UWO Directory
  userid:      FREQUENCY (Jonathan Yu)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    irc.freenode.net/6667, #luminescent

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    There are currently no modules existing that offer this (or
    similar) functionality. It is highly specialized and only works for
    the UWO directory. I plan on using the WebService::UWO::* namespace
    to offer access to other services offered by Western. Also
    WebService::UWO::Directory will aggregate results from
    WebService::UWO::Directory::Student and an upcoming
    WebService::UWO::Directory::Faculty/WebService::UWO::Directory::Staff
    in the future to maximize usefulness of the modules.

    There is already a copy but I ordered it deleted because I messed
    up the documentation. I'm now working on code refactoring.

  enteredby:   FREQUENCY (Jonathan Yu)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul  5 22:01:21 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::UWO::
::Directory       adpOp Perform lookups using the UWO Directory      FREQUENCY
