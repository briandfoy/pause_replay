Subject: Module submission Math::Business::HMA
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::HMA
  DSLIP:       RdpOl
  description: Hull Moving Average
  userid:      JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    email, http://groups.google.com/group/stockmonkey/

  similar:
    Math::Business::EMA, ::SMA

  rationale:

    The Hull Moving Average is rarely used and not terribly popular. It
    was requested for it's low-lag smoothing ability.

    I struggled with the name, flip flopping between
    ::HullMovingAverage and ::HMA, but ultimately decided most sources
    that do mention it call it the HMA -- the same as they would for EMA
    or SMA -- and only expand the name in a full description of the
    index.

  enteredby:   JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul  6 12:21:48 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Business::
::HMA             RdpOl Hull Moving Average                          JETTERO
