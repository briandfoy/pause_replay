I guess the only reason why I didn't go with XML::TEILite is that I 
thought as TEI becomes more established that more people would be 
interested in adding additional tools.  I guess one can't really predict 
the future and if later this prediction becomes true and people do such a 
thing and more 'group'ing namespace can be considered then.  I am okay 
with the namespace XML::TEILite.
