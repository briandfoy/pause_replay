The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Modem
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to modems via standard AT commands
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Device::SerialPort

  rationale:

    Defines a basic, extendable interface for standard AT-compliant
    modems, with methods such as echo(), dial(), restore_settings(),
    hangup(). It uses Device::SerialPort to connect to serial port and
    implements some frequently-used low-level AT commands in a simple
    way, with automatic user request / modem response cycles. It may be
    appropriate to place it under "Device::" because it does not
    implement any type of application over serial links, but only an
    interface layer that (i hope) simplifies the task of talking to a
    modem.

  enteredby:   COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr  9 23:31:02 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::Modem           adpOp Interface to modems via standard AT commands COSIMO
