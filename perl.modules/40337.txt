Hey Friend,

I can remember it like yesterday...my first foreclosure action. Being pretty naive and armed with some bad info (I didn't know that at the time), I figured I was going to go to this auction and walk away with a house for a dollar...you've seen those commercials and then you think you're the only person who knows about them, right??

Yeah RIGHT!

When I walked in the place, I swear it looked like a cattle auction! About 100 people crammed in a hallway of the courthouse so dense I thought the fire marshal was going to break it up! People hootin' and hollering, pushing and shoving; it looked more like a Metallica concert than a "hidden auction"!

Anyway, my reason for telling you this is because chances are your area is just as bad, if not worse. I hear it all the time from clients all over the country. And the sad part is that a lot of them just go back to the day-to-day grind.

Well Friend...

Don't let it happen you...you don't have to let that happen because you have two choices here that a good 99 percent of investors don't know:

Choice #1: Little do most people know that most of the houses at the auctions go back to the bank, not to the private bidders.  And guess what happens next...yep, the bank puts it up for sale as an REO and lists it with a local real estate broker.  Then you can buy it directly from the real estate broker.  Nothing complicated there. Yeah, you won't get the best deal for the house, but you can still make a buck.

Choice #2: You stop chasing foreclosures...and let THEM chase YOU. What I mean is that you start using some simple advertising secrets and get to the homeowner BEFORE the auction. That way you get the best deal and you actually do some good by helping the homeowner out of their mess.

Now I can't get into all the details about attracting foreclosure deals like a ten-ton magnet here, but if you're interested in learning more, I've got a cool site where you can learn some more about adverting secrets that do 99 percent of the work for you.Take a look!

Best,
