The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::STD::STDutil
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: fills in templates, format tables for PODs
  userid:      SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    semi-private email

  similar:

    that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
    "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
    descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
    implements.

    I would recommend renaming them to something closer to your other
    modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as
    some routines do not seem to be specific to the Test::-suite but
    rather general(format_array_table)

    This is favorable response to Mr. Maischein suggestion and
    officially withdraws the request to register the Test::TestUtil
    namespace

The resulting entry would be:

Test::STD::
::STDutil         RdpOp fills in templates, format tables for PODs   SOFTDIA
