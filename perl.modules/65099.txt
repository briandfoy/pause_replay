Subject: Module submission MySQL::Sandbox
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, gmax@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MySQL::Sandbox
  DSLIP:       RmpOg
  description: Install single or group MySQL servers
  userid:      GMAX (Giuseppe Maxia)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://launchpad.net/mysql-sandbox

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    MySQL Sandbox is a tool to install MySQL servers in user space,
    mainly for testing and benchmarking. The scripts that come with the
    installation can install either a single server or a group
    (replication, circular replication, independent group) for different
    versions of MySQL, without clash to existing MySQL servers in the
    same host.

    The base name MySQL already exists, so I make it simple, by adding
    the Sandbox identifier, to make it more recognizable by the users
    who have adopted the package prior to its release to CPAN.

  enteredby:   GMAX (Giuseppe Maxia)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 29 12:28:48 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MySQL::
::Sandbox         RmpOg Install single or group MySQL servers        GMAX
