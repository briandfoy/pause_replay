Hello,

Please cc darren@darrenduncan.net for any of your responses, since 
I'm not subscribed to the modules list.

In regards to a near future update of my Muldis DB framework core 
distro ( http://search.cpan.org/dist/Muldis-DB/ ), I'm considering 
using different licenses for different files, versus the current 
approach of everything being under the GPL license.

This distro has 1-2 files that must always be used by users of the 
framework, and all the other files are only optional to use.

Under consideration is to make the mandatory files, which contain 
between 1% and 5% of the total lib/* code size, and which includes 
the registered namesake module (Muldis::DB), licensed LGPL instead, 
and leave the optional (and yet-unregistered) files 
(Muldis::DB::Validator, Muldis::DB::Engine::Example), which are 
95-99% of the code base, under GPL.

The question then, is what license I should mark the whole distro as 
being, so that there is the least confusion to people either looking 
at the module list or distribution stats, as to what they may do with 
the contents?

Do I pick the license of the tiny mandatory part, or majority optional parts?

Also on a tangent, I wonder if it is worthwhile to separately 
register 3 files that are distributed together, with the Perl 5 
module list:

   Muldis::DB                  - lgpl
   Muldis::DB::Validator       - gpl
   Muldis::DB::Engine::Example - gpl

Note that these could conceivably all be separate works, but that 
they are distributed together to simplify bootstrapping of the test 
suite for the framework core (which requires all 3 parts to test any 
1 of them), avoiding circular dependencies to test anything.

Thank you in advance.
