Hi. Could I please be registered for CPAN access?
My details are as follows:

Name             :Yves Orton
Email            :demerphq@hotmail.com
Preferred User Id:Yves
2nd Choice User  :YJO
Immediate Contributions:
  ex::caution.pm (Pragma)
  String::RegEx  (and related subclasses)

(For some reason I cannot get access to 
https://pause.kbx.de/pause/00modlist.long.html Actually it seems LOTS of 
links on the About Pause page are broken. Of course it could just be me..
so Im not quite sure how to fill out the DSLI list..)

Hope this is what is needed...
Cheers!
Yves/DeMerphQ
