Subject: Module submission sys::MON::Lite

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       sys::MON::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: lightweight pluggable service monitoring
  userid:      JNBROOKES (Jon Brookes)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://code.google.com/p/sys-mon-lite/w/list

  similar:

  rationale:

    'sys::mon::lite' is intended for use:

    * as a framework for managing a system by means of an extendible
    plugin mechanism * to manage single or multiple system checks,
    calculating an overall alert level based on the output of a given
    set of pre-registered plugins * to augment the monitoring
    capabilities of existing monitoring solutions * where use of full
    scale monitoring applications the likes of Nagios, BigBrother etc to
    monitor a systems availability and / or performance may not be
    practical and where a simple, stand alone, Perl based solution will
    suffice

The resulting entry would be:

sys::MON::
