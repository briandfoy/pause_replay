Just to make things complicated, I designed a Number::Words module,
which I never submitted to CPAN, that supports this functionality in
English, Spanish, French, Hawaiian, and Japanese, and can be easily
extended to other languages/locales as well.

It uses an object-oriented architecture with inheritance that makes it
very easy to add new languages, often without even writing any code
(just composing a static data structure which the program uses to
convert numbers into words for that language).

You can download the code, or view a demo, on my website at:
