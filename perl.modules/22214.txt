Confidential

May I briefly introduce myself=2E I am Mr=2E Kalua Bamti 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo =28formerly Zaire=29
and the former aide de camp of the Late President
Laurel Kabila of blessed memory=2E

I am presently living in Europe on asylum=2E In case
you are wondering how I got your contact=2C I got your
contact from a source on the internet at the foreign trade office of
the National Chambers of commerce=2C trade and industry=2E
The events of the past three years in my country has been
very unfortunate=2E The Late president Kabila
successfully toppled the very corrupt government of
the Late Dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and ruled justly
and peacefully for a few months=2E Unfortunately=2C the
Tutsi from Goma=2C the Northern part of the country
rebelled against his government and since then my
country has been at war=2E

I was very dedicated and committed to winning the war
against the rebels until recently when to my shock I
found out that Senior Army Officers and Government
officials were stealing public funds and looting
government treasury and sending them to foreign
countries=2E They have exploited the war situation to
bring back the lawlessness and corruption of the
Mobutu days=2E

After the late President Kabila was assassinated in
very questionable circumstances=2C I knew I was in
danger of losing from both ends=2E Due to this
development and as a way of survival=2C I have joined
the train=2E I have in my possession funds amounting to
US$23million from a hidden bunker vault in the Presidential
Palace in a coded safe in a Security Company in Europe=2E

My problem is that the financial Law of Europe does
not give asylum seekers any financial rights=2E And
because of the economic instability and religious
crisis in Africa =2C I have decided that it will be unwise to
attempt investing the funds there=2E The climate there is
very unfavourable=2E

Now I am seeking foreign assistance to transfer the
funds overseas=2E If you can assist=2C I am willing to
give you 10% of the funds=2C that is US$23Million=2E You
will understand that my entire life and future depend
on this money and I shall be very grateful if you can
assist me=2E The major thing I demand from you is to be
physically available to be able to claim the funds on
my behalf with you name as my Financial Adviser=2E

If you are ready to be of assistance=2C please contact
me immediately by e-mail kaluabamti=40phantomemail=2Ecom =3Cmailto=3Akaluabamti=40phantomemail=2Ecom=3E
so that I can furnish you with the modalities for the transaction 
and what is expected of you=2E I shall be most grateful if you
maintain utmost confidentiality and keep this message
entirely to yourself=2E

Best Regards=2C

Mr=2E Kalua Bamti=2E
