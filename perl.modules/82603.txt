Hello.

I am looking for a name for a module I've spent the last couple months 
writing.  Originally, it was a replacement for something I wrote and used 
for a long time, BerkeleyDB::Lite.  More work than I expected and this 
project took on a life of its own.

   http://pl2sql.tqis.com/

Is there a way to find out if an existing module is still under 
development?  DBIx.NoSQL seems to still be in Beta and I have been unable 
to contact its author.  Quite a number of people whom I've talked to have 
suggested that DBIx.NoSQL would be the best name, if something can be 
worked out.

Otherwise, I've been struggling for some time trying to think of an 
alternative.  The one I dislike the least is DBIx.Storable.NoSQL because I 
think of this module as an RDB equivalent of the Storable module.

In summary... help!

Thanks!

Sincerely,

Jim Schueler - TQISJIM
