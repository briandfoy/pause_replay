No, I have no real strong feelings on it. However, finding stuff like:

Business::PayPal
Business::OnlinePayment::CyberSource
Business::DK::CPR
Business::FedEx::DirectConnect

Got me thinking that it was the best NameSpace. I thought using
IntelliContact was polluting the parent namespace a little,

But I have no real strong feelings. This is my first module submission
to CPAN and I don't feel I have the experience here to argue strongly
one way or the other.

Hence the post to the modules list :)

cLive ;-)
