This is an update on my project to sort out distributions which have two =
or more people with first-come indexing permissions.

When I started this project, there were 547 distributions with mixed owne=
rship. So far I=E2=80=99ve resolved 76% of them, leaving 130 on my hit li=
st.

With projects like this, I start by working through all the easy cases, g=
radually picking off slightly harder ones. This helps me learn a bit more=
 about the problem, refine the wording of emails, and hash out a process =
& tools.

The most common case has been where the original releaser has given co-ma=
int to one or more people who then added some modules. Where the original=
 releaser is still active and has first-come on the lead module, I=E2=80=99=
ve given them first-come on all modules.

Another common case is where the original releaser has handed over the di=
stribution, and all subsequent releases have been by one person. There we=
re some cases where I knew the original releaser has passed away, so I ju=
st transferred perms, but otherwise I email the involved parties, to see =
whether the current maintainer should get first-come (and generally they =
have).

There have been a number of dists where two or more people have worked to=
gether. In all cases so far an email and prompted an easy resolution. Som=
e of these have involved quite a few dists.

Another pattern I=E2=80=99ve seen a few times is where a module has been =
split off from a large distribution into a new distribution of its own, a=
nd then gained some additional modules. The new lead module often has a s=
ignature of indexing perms inherited from the originating distribution, b=
ut the new module(s) reflect the small set of people maintaining the spun=
-out distribution. A related pattern is where a distribution has been abs=
orbed into another distribution, so you end up with two different permiss=
ions signatures.

Of the remaining 130 cases, about 30 or 40 look relatively straightforwar=
d. Some of the rest have fallout from historical cases where =22foobar=22=
 and =22=46oobar=22 were allowed to be different modules. And there are s=
ome which prompted a =22WT=46=3F=21=22 when I had a quick look at them. T=
here are some where I suspect the person was no longer interested, so dro=
pped their permissions on some of the modules in a distribution, but not =
all of them. And then there are P5P ones, which I=E2=80=99ll talk to Sawy=
er and P5P about.
