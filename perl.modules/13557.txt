The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::DifferenceMarkup
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: XML diff producing XML output
  userid:      VBAR (Vaclav Barta)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    XML::SemanticDiff

  rationale:

    An XML diff could use the XML::Diff namespace, but since there's
    demonstrably more than one way to implement it (the implementations
    I've checked differ radically in their output format), I was looking
    for a longer name, matching 'diff' and (hopefully) stressing that
    the output is also XML (as opposed to, say, interactive GUI).

    Implementing an XML diff is a reasonably popular task, but most
    implementations I found were in Java, one in Python and one
    (XML::SemanticDiff) in Perl. XML output (which SemanticDiff does not
    have) is in my view an important feature of an XML diff: if XML is
    good enough structured data format for the incoming data, it should
    also be good enough for the outgoing structured data.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::DifferenceMarkup bdpfp XML diff producing XML output                VBAR
