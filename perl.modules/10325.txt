Greetings folks,

Two weeks ago I've sent you a message as a request for an account to 
contribute to CPAN with my own persistent object's module. The only answer 
I've received about has been an e-mail from a bot the same day telling me 
that I'll have a real answer within a week. So, please, Could you tell me 
something about? Thanks a lot in advance.

This is the related thread, I think this could be useful information:

Hi, and thanks for mailing modules@perl.org.   This is an automated
response to your email.

We get lots of mail, and sometimes it takes us a while to get to yours.
Please be patient, we *will* try and respond as soon as we can gather
enough tuits.

In the meantime, here are some pointers which may help you find your
answer, along with some hints for making your modules@perl.org
experience easier.

modules@perl.org has several roles:

1. creating PAUSE accounts
2. keeping the CPAN module list updated
3. responding to enquiries about modules and especially module naming

[...]

Clipped as this seems to be a bot answer. That was in answer to my original 
ask:

 Hi there,
 
 Recently I've been writting another little framework for persistent objects 
 on Perl. It's mainly feature that's different to all I've seen on CPAN 
 is that it can fetch these objects on-demmand using 'AUTOLOAD' function. For 
 now, the module is available at http://80.26.42.188/projects/phoenix/ and 
the 
 docs generated by pod2html are below 
http://80.26.42.188/projects/phoenix/doc/
 
 I've reading about PAUSE on http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html so I 
 want to be registrered as developer to submit this module and, perhaps, 
other 
 work that I'm doing now when it's stable enough.

There's no more 'til now.

Have a good one,
