The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PAUSE::ApplyMod::Registration::Online
  DSLI:        ampO
  description: Test, do not register. But read rationale.
  userid:      JV (Johan Vromans)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    CPAN pause_1999::edit

  rationale:

    I'm pleased to announce the first public test of the announced new
    functionality on PAUSE: a form to fill in metadata about a module.

    This is better than the writing of emails because it standardizes
    the way the request are being treated. The metadata are stored in an
    Apache::Session object so that they can be entered into the database
    with a single click by the administrators.

    The feature is to be regarded in ALPHA stage and the discussion is
    opened for interface, style, wording, etc.

    I (ANDK) am posting this first request in the name of JV, just to
    see if it works this way. It should come out as a module request for
    JV enteredby ANDK.

    Enjoy,

  enteredby:   ANDK (Andreas J. König)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 16 12:23:15 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

PAUSE::ApplyMod::Registration::
::Online          ampO Test, do not register. But read rationale.   JV
