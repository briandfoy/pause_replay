I think this might belong in Math::, since numbers with uncertainities
are not necessarily statistical values.  a single scientific measurement,
for instance, has an attached uncertainity, and you might have to add
that to another, similar number.

As far as I know the arithmetic rules are the same either way.  

Once you have the modules in math, you could build on them to create
specific modules in Statistics::*.
