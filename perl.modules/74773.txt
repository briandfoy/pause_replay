Subject: Module submission Global::Notifications

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Global::Notifications
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Generic proxy for messages, such as logging
  userid:      SRIEHM (Stephen Riehm)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org

  similar:
    Notification::Center, Log::Dispatch, Log::Log4Perl

  rationale:

    Notifications is a generic message dispatcher which requires
    (almost) no configuration and has no dependencies (other than
    Global::Notifications) - making it light enough for any module to
    use, something like:

    package myModule; use Notficications qw( error info progress ); #
    each name here generates a simple message dispatcher

    # now you can dispatch messages rather than printf's progress(
    'doing that thang...', steps => 5 ); info( 'fuddling the whodicky'
    ); error( 'something went wrong' );

    Essentially, individual modules should NOT know or care how or
    where their logging information etc. is configured. They should not
    have to create logging objects etc, but they should report what
    they're doing!

    The application would then do something like:

    # Set up any / favourite logging object(s!) my $real_log =
    Log::Dispatch->new(...); # Make sure they can get Notifications my
    $logger = Notifications::Observer::LogDispatch->new( log =>
    $real_log ); # or a simple handmade object # and now start logging
    $logger->start();

    and then any modules sending notifications would have their
    messages logged.

    The benefit being that modules need know nothing, leaving full
    control to the application.

The resulting entry would be:

Global::
