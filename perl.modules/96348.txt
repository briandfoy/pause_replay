Peter, is there some reason that you feel your repeated public
proclamations are somehow not "on the record"?  I think at this point your
position is clear.

If you need to retire, you are free to do so.  I've seen no evidence of
anyone forcing you to continue your involvement against your will.  To the
extent you think "scuttling" prevents you from doing so, this is a
constraint of your own devising, not something imposed externally and
certainly not by the PAUSE administrators.

You had numerous invitations and opportunities to engage constructively
with interested parties about your retirement and succession =E2=80=93 firs=
t with
your co-maintainers and later with me as a representative of PAUSE
administrators.  You chose not to do so.  Instead you chose to respond with
hostility, disrespect, denial and deception.

Despite your attitude, actions and repeated attempts to provoke, I feel I
treated you with patience, respect and fairness.

As you insisted, this issue has been discussed almost entirely in public.
In hindsight, I think you were right: having this play out publicly takes
away any mystery as to what happened or how decisions were made.

Given that I, too, am "on the record" throughout, I have no qualms about
how my words and actions reflect on me as a person or as a leader within
the community.

Regards,
David
