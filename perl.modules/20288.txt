I am sorry, this doesn't just make sense, I don't get what you mean 
with intrinsically re-entrant, I also don't get how it can be a problem 
with Tk callbacks, perl variables aren't more or less re-entrant than c 
variables.

With threads::shared, all operations are atomic except ++ and -- which 
are not.
