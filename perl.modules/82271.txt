Subject: Module submission Bytes::Random::Secure

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bytes::Random::Secure
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Cryptographically suitable random bytes
  userid:      DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Bytes::Random, Math::Random::Secure

  rationale:

    Bytes::Random provides random bytes but they're based on Perl's
    default random number generator, and not suitable for cryptgraphic
    use. Math::Random::Secure provides a nice source, but the interface
    could be better suited to generating an arbitrary number of bytes.
    This module combines the user-interface of Bytes::Random with the
    quality of Math::Random::Secure's generator, while also providing
    the ability to get the random bytes in several formats.

    One reason for not wrapping this module into Bytes::Random is that
    it has significantly heaver dependencies than Bytes::Random (because
    of the need for a suitable generator, as well as a strong means of
    seeding the generator).

  enteredby:   DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  enteredon:   Sat Sep 15 07:44:05 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bytes::Random::
::Secure          Rdpfp Cryptographically suitable random bytes      DAVIDO
