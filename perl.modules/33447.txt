A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree. A little boy loved to come
and lay around it everyday. He climbed to the tree top, ate the apples, took
a nap under the shadow... He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with
him. Time went by... the little boy had grown up and he no longer played
around the tree everyday. One day, the boy came back to the tree and he
looked sad. "Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy. "I am no longer
a kid, I don't play around trees anymore." The boy replied,"I want toys. I
need money to buy them." "Sorry, but I don't have money...but you can pick
all my apples and sell them. So, you will have money." The boy was so
excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily. The boy
never came back after he picked the apples. The tree was sad. 
If we were to start judging a man by his words and actions, what would be
the outcome? For me, the outcome would be sweet. I wouldn¡¯t feel
disappointed or used, less na?ve, and more respected. I can say that every
time I¡¯ve valued only the words I heard was the times that I was let down.
