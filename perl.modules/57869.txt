     why:

    Components to build business systems in Perl. Initially we have
    some contributions for POE and later some modules for business
    applications in Perl. The first POE contribution is an EAI Pattern
    called an Asynchronous Endpoint Server. It builds on other POE
    Components and will reside in the POE::IPTk::AES namespace. IPTk
    stands for Integration Patterns Toolkit, and the idea is to later
    release other modules under that same namespace, to keep these
    things related.
