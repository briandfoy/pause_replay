Subject: Module submission Math::RootFind
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, sjo@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::RootFind
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Collection of Root Finding algorithms
  userid:      SJO (Spencer Ogden)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I was unable to find a similar collection of algorithms for solving
    functions for their root. This module implement several algoritms
    which can be used to solve this problem. Math:: was chosen as
    opposed to Algorithm:: because the Algorithm:: namespace seemed to
    suggest tree or graph manipulation to people.

  enteredby:   SJO (Spencer Ogden)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb 18 00:03:39 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::RootFind        bdpfp Collection of Root Finding algorithms        SJO
