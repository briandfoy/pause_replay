Hi,

In response to a question of mine on perlmonks
(http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=419421), it was suggested that I
shoot an email to you for feedback.  The issue at hand has also been
discussed on 
http://www.mail-archive.com/module-authors@perl.org/msg02961.html and
http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/22566.

Basically, I've written a module that easily allows people to use
"short names" for modules.  The behavior is "pragmaish", and the  name
needs to be short.   Assuming I call the module aka.pm, it would work
like this:

  use aka 'My::Company::Namespace::Customer';
  use aka 'My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Customer', 
      as => 'Preferred';

  my $cust = Customer->new;
  my $pref = Preferred->new;

It's not aliasing the namespace.  It merely uses the module, handles
importing (not shown above) and adds a subroutine to the calling
namespace.)

The module-authors list seems to like the name aka.pm and also seems to
agree that it should have a lower-cased name.   However, I have no idea
whether or not it would be appropriate to actually upload the module
with this name or not.  Feedback would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Ovid
