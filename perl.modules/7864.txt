The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::html2results
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Parses arbitrary html to an array of arrays
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    quite a bit at my work :)

  similar:
    none I know of that are really this easy to use

  rationale:

    Very nice for sort of screen scraping. Can take a page like this

    http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/all_time_stats/rosters/american_league/bal/1970_bat_a
    vg.html

    or

    http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?group=conference

    or

    http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=tyc+aol+tenf+orcl+msft+intc+witc+jdsu+t+a&d=v1

    or soon this

    http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=tyc+aol+tenf+orcl+msft+intc+witc+jdsu+t+a&d=t

    or say an inbox page from Yahoo! or hotmail or wherever,

    and return an array of arrays of the data set you request. Requests
    can be made based on number of columns in said set.

    Should pretty well solve parsing problems for most anything that
    can be mapped to an array of arrays.

    I submitted this sometime ago and never heard back. One of my
    co-workers said that once you are a CPAN author as I am, you don't
    get namespace responses. Not sure if that is right or not, but I
    would like to change the case to match my soon to be released
    Data::results2html which goes the other way.

    Thanks, Earl
