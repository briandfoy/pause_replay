Hi Steffen,

Thanks for your feedback.

Actually I agree with you that the category Networking/Device/IPC would 
be better but the reason why it's in Misc Modules  is because the Cisco 
namespace is in Misc. and all the other Cisco modules are in Misc. as 
well.  This module is really intended for Cisco's IP Accounting so, 
unless the entire Cisco namespace is being changed,  I guess it would 
make sense to keep it in Misc.

Regards,
Maarten
