I got several unexpected pause perm problems recently when uploading update=
s.

#1 Filter was created by Paul Marquess (pmqs) and some time ago I took over=
.
Now I see:
Filter MUENALANMurat =C3=9Cnalan first-come MUENALAN

rjbs showed me a 2010 archive with the same content:
https://web.archive.org/web/20100612040035/http://www.cpan.org/modules/06pe=
rms.txt

There is a bug and conflict. Filter::Util::Call from the Filter distro
is even dual-core.

#2 illguts does not exist on pause perms anymore.

I don't care that metacpan is not able to index and display illguts, but
linking to a broken system is bad.

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=3Dillguts
=3D> https://metacpan.org/release/illguts
This queue is for tickets about the illguts CPAN distribution.

RT should link to the standard cpan site, not to some new fancy
and apparently beloved site which is not able display it.
