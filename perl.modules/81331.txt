So, right name, but the code isn't yet quite there (but it shouldn't be hard
to get it there :).

This isn't yet a MooseX::Types library - it doesn't use -declare to declare
any types, and as such doesn't actually export type constants which is how
MooseX::Types libraries are supposed to work. See -

http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/moosex-types-because-typing-is-hard/

for how this should be done - also note that MooseX::Types libraries for
just the classes should not have any but the most minimal coercions, those
should be in a Date::Piece::MoreCoercions or similar to make their use
explicit.

Once you fix that stuff up and ship a release that's a proper MooseX::Types::
module, give me a shout and I'll approve your registration.
