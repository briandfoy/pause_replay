Well, I simply figured the File:: namespace because it was an
interface to a file called 'quotas' (and the file name will be the
same for anybody)

Anyhow, I "deleted" it from cpan until both
we figure out a new spot for it and until I can fix a bug I just found.

I thought about Quotas::raw or something like that,
but I didnt want to put it in Quotas:: because I thought I might be
namespace trampling.

Any thoughts?
