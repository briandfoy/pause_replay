The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::PayPal
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to PayPal
  userid:      MOCK (mock)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Business::OnlinePayment

  rationale:

    PayPal works a bit differently than standard credit card
    transactions. Instead of contacting the payment server and verifying
    that a credit card can be charged, PayPal users are forwarded to the
    PayPal site (www.paypal.com) and then sent back to the site from
    which they came. Verification that payment occured is posted back to
    a special Instant Payment Notification URL separately by the PayPal
    server (www.paypal.com).

    Now that the background is out of the way, my module allows one to
    build PayPal buttons that contain an indentifier (a session) which
    is passed back to one's site when the purchaser returns so that
    their session can be resumed. It also handles the validation of the
    Instant Payment Notification in a secure manner (even checking if
    the ssl certificate returned by www.paypal.com is correct). This
    allows one to build CGI payment forms with PayPal buttons to sell
    things such as software, or in my case, conference registrations and
    instantly determine if the customer has payed or not, and thus give
    imediate feedback to the customer.

    I believe that Business::PayPal is the best namespace choice. While
    the module does do online payment, it doesn't really have any of the
    same fundamental structures as a typical credit card payment module
    has, so it doesn't really fit under the Business::OnlinePayment
    hierarchy. To my knowledge, there are no other modules for handling
    PayPal transactions currently in CPAN.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
