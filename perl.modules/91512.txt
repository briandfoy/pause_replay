The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::YARBAC
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Dancer2 Role Based Access Control Framework
  userid:      AVERNA (Sarah Fuller)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    icr.perl.org #dancer, dancer mailing list

  similar:
    Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible

  rationale:

    YARBAC is a role based user authentication and authorisation
    framework for Dancer2 apps. Designed with security and a medium to
    large user base in mind. This framework was heavily inspired by the
    excellent Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible framework which I'd
    highly recommend as it for your consideration. YARBAC was designed
    to support secure password checking, enforced password hashing,
    multiple authentication realms and the ability to create your own
    backend provider. YARBAC was also designed to to be as flexialbe and
    as feature rich as possible in the hope that I'll never have to
    write RBAC code for Dancer again. :) While similar to Extensible in
    some ways, this framework has some significantly different
    approaches. These differences were born out of my own experiences
    writing RBAC code for various Dancer apps and finding myself always
    having to extend existing modules or starting from scratch or worse
    still, copy/paste my old code then reworking it. The major
    difference with YARBAC is that it tries to be a complete solution to
    the problem. However in order to be a little more flexible and
    feature rich in some areas it is also a little more opinionated in
    others. The main area of opinion in YARBAC is how it achieves
    role-based access control. YARBAC is structed with users, roles,
    groups and permissions. A user can have many roles but it might be a
    good idea in larger enviornments to only allow a user to have one
    role and then assign that role have many groups. Think of a role as
    being a role-group. Then there are groups which have many
    permissions. A user can have one or more roles, a role can have one
    or more groups and groups can have one or more permissions. This
    means when deciding if a user is authorised we could require they be
    logged in, or have a specifc role, or specific group, or a specific
    group with a specific permission and so on. To put it another way,
    this design moves the access control down to the role-group
    relationship thus allowing one to quickly and easily see, assign or
    revoke permissions to a user even when dealing with a fairly complex
    authorisation environment.
