Excellent! There are only three paragraphs where I would tend to draw
a slightly different picture. I'll exaggerate my point below just to
give you an idea. Please don't ake my words, they just flow out of my
tired brains after a long day.

No, our concern is that the code gets carried away, gets scratched,
overpainted, fingertaps everywhere. We enter PAUSE only in socks and
do not touch the palisander.

Politeness is necessary but not sufficient. We want them to bring deep
respect and expect them to breath the aura of the first author.

The really problematic thing is that the guy taking over might not
understand enough of the original work and apply wrong fixes that make
the code more difficult to maintain instead of better and then the
original author loses his good will. Or something like that.
