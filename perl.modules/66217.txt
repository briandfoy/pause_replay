The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RDR::Collection
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Collection and Processing of RDR packets
  userid:      SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Cisco SCE series devices export network and user usage
    information in the form of RDR packets. The SCE series are DPIs(Deep
    Packet Inspection) devices and consequently can reports on all
    activities of traffic flowing through them. The exported packets are
    sent over a TCP connection but have a proprietary format and thus do
    not seem to fit into any other namespace.

    I would like to register this name space to denote this data format
    and collection method.

    I am happy to discuss alternatives should any suggestions be made.

    I have uploaded version 1.0000 to CPAN already, RDR::Collection,
    and also happy to receive comments relating to style and methods
    used ( I know some of the code is dubious at best ).

  enteredby:   SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun  8 09:39:22 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RDR::
::Collection      RdpOg Collection and Processing of RDR packets     SHAMROCK
