Hi Pause Team!

Thanks for adding this module, it'll make a few things easier later.

I'd like to reiterate my offer for help in assigning/accepting module data to 
the list. I understand that it's slow because people are busy, and that not 
anyone can be trusted to help (so I understand if you'd turn help down). It's 
just that if there's a way in which I can help, I'd love to. I certainly owe 
it to the community ;)

Take care,

I'm not a complete idiot - some parts are missing!
