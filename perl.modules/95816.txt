Hello Neil,

This is my second response to your message.

I realized that I could actually do this relevant cleanup myself, so I went to 
pause.perl.org and relinquished some namespace reservations/permissions that I 
shouldn't have.

     Removed primary maintainership of DUNCAND from MyApp::L::Eng.
     Removed primary maintainership of DUNCAND from MyApp::L::Fre.
     Removed primary maintainership of DUNCAND from MyApp::L::Homer.
     Removed primary maintainership of DUNCAND from MyLib.
     Removed primary maintainership of DUNCAND from MyLib::L::Eng.
     Removed primary maintainership of DUNCAND from MyLib::L::Fre.
     Removed DUNCAND from co-maintainers of MyApp::L::Eng.
     Removed DUNCAND from co-maintainers of MyApp::L::Fre.
     Removed DUNCAND from co-maintainers of MyApp::L::Homer.
     Removed DUNCAND from co-maintainers of MyLib.
     Removed DUNCAND from co-maintainers of MyLib::L::Eng.
     Removed DUNCAND from co-maintainers of MyLib::L::Fre.

That should take care of everything relevant to my Locale-KeyedText 
distribution, all of the non-installing example modules.

I will also expunge a heap of other incorrect or obsolete namespace 
reservations/permissions that DUNCAND has, in the near future after I've 
confirmed that the above changes seem to be reflected in the public CPAN 
directories correctly.

It is still on you to give GAAS the "mylib" privilege or whatever you think he 
should have.  I elected not to do a transfer grant myself to keep things simpler.
