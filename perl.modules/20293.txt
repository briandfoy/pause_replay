Hello,

I have written a new module which I want to make public available via CPAN. 
The module will be GPL licensed. For internal developing I choosed 
DBIx::FileSystem as the module name. Now I would like to discuss, if this 
name is ok before uploading the files to PAUSE.

 From the README:

------------ snip ------------
The module DBIx::FileSystem offers you a filesystem like view to database 
tables. To interact with the database tables, FileSystem implements a 
command line shell which offers not only a subset of well known shell 
commands to navigate, view and manipulate data in tables, but
also gives the convenience of history, command line editing and tab 
completion. FileSystem sees the database as a filesystem: each table is a 
different directory with the tablename as the directory name and each row 
in a table is a file within that directory.

The motivation for FileSystem was the need for a terminal based 
configuration interface to manipulate database entries which are used as 
configuration data for a server process. FileSystem is neither complete nor 
a replacement for dbish or other full-feature SQL shells
or editors. Think of FileSystem as a replacement for a Web/CGI based 
graphical user interface for manipulating database contents.

EXAMPLE:
--------

The file pawactl shows the usage of DBIx::FileSystem. It implements
the configure shell of a virtual package warehouse. Sample session:

----------> pawactl sample session start --------->
pawactl (/source): ls
(dest)          acity           factory2        lcity
(source)        bcity           generic
(warehouse)     factory1        kcity
pawactl (/source): cat bcity
#
# Settings for SourceName 'bcity' (defaults: 'generic')
#
# - this is a comment, comments always start in the first column.
# - all lines begin in the first column or are blank lines
# - a unset variable will write NULL into the database column
# - unset variables use the default values
#

#
# SourceID
# Internal source idenficator (4 characters)
#
# default: ----
#
SourceID = CIB

... more file contents ...
pawactl (/source): sum bcity
SourceID     = CIB
Distance     = 2434
Destination  = moon
pawactl (/source): cd dest
pawactl (/dest): ls
(dest)          (warehouse)     moon            venus
(source)        mars            neptun
pawactl (/dest): rm venus
rm: cannot remove: file 'venus' referenced by:
   source/factory2
   warehouse/sx0001
pawactl (/dest): vi venus

    ... vi session ...
    ... save & quit ...



ERROR: line 19: invalid value: valid range: (1..100)
Do you want to edit again ('n' will abort) [y/n] ? n
pawactl (/dest):
<---------- pawactl sample session end <---------

------------ snap ------------

So, what do you think about the name DBIx::FileSystem ?

If you need more info I can send you the ready-to-install module for testing.

with best regards,

	Alexander
