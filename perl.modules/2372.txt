Thanks for this advice.  I have adopted Matt's layout for the Authors and 
Copyright sections, and have written a brief HISTORY section to try to 
explain the situation.  I am not convinced about the wording and will probably 
tweak it a little later, but it will do for now.  (It also ended up being a little 
more than a single sentance :-))

I should be able to upload my revised package later on today.

No problem.  It completely solves my problems, so in most respects it is a 
very selfish move :-)
