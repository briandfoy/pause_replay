I cannot reach the owner MICB of the following B::C modules. (see below)
p5p dropped these modules from core with 5.9.5
I also tried it in January when I started to work on B::C and friends.

Yes, I know B::Debug is core.
I believe dual-living this is better.
Patch to p5p will follow for B::Debug before I upload a non-dev version 
of B::Debug.

Hi Malcom
I want to co-maintain the perl compiler modules, since p5p removed it
from core with 5.9.5.
I've already uploaded a couple of developer releases as B::C -
http://search.cpan.org/dist/B-C/

I'd need:

B::Asmdata
B::Assembler
B::Bblock
B::Bytecode
B::C
B::CC
B::Debug
B::Disassembler
B::Stackobj
B::Stash
ByteLoader
