The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CAD::ProEngineer
  DSLIP:       idhOo
  description: XS interface to Pro/Engineer MCAD API
  userid:      MMETTES (Marc Mettes)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Usergroup meeting:
    http://www.prouser.org/tc/na/toolkits/downloads.html

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    This module is an XS interface to the Pro/Engineer API (aka
    Pro/Toolkit). Pro/Engineer is an MCAD (mechanical computer aided
    design) software package widely used in design and manufacturing.

    There is currently no namespace that nests CAD software API's, nor
    other namespaces that are a direct fit. In the interest of not
    further congesting the root level, I suggest a new top-level
    namespace of "CAD", with "CAD::ProEngineer" as the first member.

    Personally, I'd prefer something at the root level (there are
    endless examples), but I know that's frowned upon.

The resulting entry would be:

CAD::
::ProEngineer     idhOo XS interface to Pro/Engineer MCAD API        MMETTES
