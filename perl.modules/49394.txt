The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::GPS
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Global Positioning System time
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Time::TAI

  rationale:

    The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes as an integral feature
    the dissemination of a very precise time scale. This time scale is
    produced by atomic clocks on the satellites, and is steered to keep
    in step with International Atomic Time (TAI). The GPS time scale is
    thus indirectly a realisation of Terrestrial Time (TT). GPS time is
    one of the most accurate and the most accessible realisations of
    TAI.

    There is also a conventional way to represent GPS time instants
    using day-based notations associated with planetary rotation `time'
    scales. Unfortunately, this convention differs from the similar
    conventions of both TAI and TT (which also differ from each other).
    This module handles the GPS convention.

    This module also supplies an interface to the handling of GPS time
    as a realisation of TAI, but this is just another interface to the
    Time::TAI code. It is Time::TAI which actually knows about the
    relationship between GPS time and TAI. Any further refinements
    relating to GPS time, such as discriminating between the time scales
    supplied by the different satellites, would go into this module.

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::GPS             Rdpfp Global Positioning System time               ZEFRAM
