Subject: Module submission RDF::Trine

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RDF::Trine
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Framework to parse, serialize and store RDF
  userid:      GWILLIAMS (Gregory Todd Williams)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    irc://irc.perl.org/perlrdf and dev@lists.perlrdf.org

  similar:
    RDF::Core

  rationale:

    RDF::Trine aims to provide a full framework for working with RDF
    data including base classes representing RDF data structures,
    parsers, serializers, and graph databases (triple- and quad-stores).
    RDF::Core has the same goal, but hasn't been updated for nearly 4
    years. Moreover, I spent quite a bit of time over the years trying
    to work with and improve RDF::Core but found the developers slow to
    respond and reluctant to apply patches for bug-fixes and feature
    improvements. RDF::Trine was developed in an attempt to address
    these issues: to have a stable RDF framework that would see frequent
    releases addressing bugs and also track ongoing work in the semantic
    web world. Module registration for RDF::Trine seems appropriate as
    it is depended on by a number of other distributions on CPAN, has
    frequent updates, and an active (albeit small) development/support
    community on irc and a mailing list.

    Regarding module list chapter, I've suggested "007
    Database_Interfaces", although it seems the other registered RDF
    modules are listed under "011 String_Lang_Text_Proc".

The resulting entry would be:

RDF::
::Trine           RmpOp Framework to parse, serialize and store RDF  GWILLIAMS
