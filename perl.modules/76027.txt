Subject: PAUSE indexer failed: Decreasing version number
Message-ID: <20110510084035.8eef.abe10f7e5afbbb3a79ce619739541149@cern.ch>
MIME-Version: 1.0

After fixing RT#67227 and putting the package version in each module's
$VERSION, the PAUSE indexer now fails to index my new package
(LCONS/Net-STOMP-Client-1.0.tar.gz) with a "Decreasing version number"
error.

The $VERSION variables are now correct and where wrong before. Is
there a way to force the indexing of this release?

Cheers,
