Someone on IRC suggested something in that direction as well. The big
question here is, what sub-category? Device::Camera:: ? Device::Webcam:: ?
Ofcourse it's a parallel device (well mine is anyway), so
Device::ParallelPort::Camera:: etc would also apply more or less.

I'm open for ideas and have no problem with changing names if required
(well, the module, not my own name ofcourse).

To reply to that i vs R thing, yes indeed, altho I had some discussions on
IRC and in CB about it prior to starting development :) and the time it
took from start to current R wasn't that long.
