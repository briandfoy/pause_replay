Apologies for cross-postings.  I just wanted to use this note to remind you
that the paper submission deadline of IEEE International Conference on
Services Computing (SCC 2005) is approaching. Thank you very much for your great
support. 


2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2005)
===================================================================
July 12-15, 2005, Orlando, Florida, USA
Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society

http://conferences.computer.org/scc/2005
Theme: Bridge the Gap between Business Services and IT Services

Services now account for more than half of the U.S. economy. Services
Computing, as a new 
cross discipline, addresses how to enable IT technology to help people
perform business 
services more efficiently and effectively. As we can see, Services
Computing currently 
shapes the processes of business modeling, business consulting, solution
creation, service 
delivery, and software architecture design, development and deployment,
monitoring and 
management. 

The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2005)
aims to the topics 
of bridging the gap between Business Services and IT Services with a new
ground breaking 
technology suite that includes Web services and service-oriented
architecture (SOA), 
business strategy and design, business process integration and performance
management, and 
utility/grid computing. It is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society
Technical Committee 
on Services Computing and will be co-located with the 2005 IEEE
International Conference 
on Web Services (ICWS 2005).

The theme of this joint IEEE conference on SERVICES is “Bridge the Gap
between Business 
Services and IT Services”. Since Web Services is an IT technology, ICWS
2005 will put its 
focus on all aspects of IT infrastructure services. SCC 2005 concentrates
on business 
services, business solutions, and the bridging technologies such as
Business Strategy and 
Design, Business Process Integration and Management, SOA, and Grid and
Utility Computing.

SCC 2004 was held in Shanghai, China, September 15-18, 2004. A total of 330
papers were 
submitted to SCC 2004. Submissions were from over 30 countries and regions.
37 were 
accepted as full research papers, 9 were accepted as short papers, and 50
were accepted as 
special session papers. 

SCC 2005 has the following major research tracks: Foundations of Services
Computing, 
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Grid/Utility Computing, and Business
Process 
Management and Business Integration.

SCOPE: Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

Foundations of Services Computing 

- Business Strategy and Design
- Services science 
- Services Modeling 
- Service-oriented business consulting methodology and utilities 
- Services delivery 
- Servicesvalue chain and innovation lifecycle 

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 

- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 
- SOA Solution Stack 
- SOA Industry Standards 
- SOA Industry Solutions 

Business Process Management and Business Integration 

- Enterprise Modeling 
- Business process modeling, transformation and integration 
- Business performance management 
- Software architecture design, development and deployment (software as a
service) 
- Application integration services (e.g. Enterprise Service Bus) 
- Service Level Automation and Orchestration 
- Industry solution patterns 
- e-Business Solutions

Grid/Utility Computing 

- Grid Computing 
- Utility Computing
- Utility Business Services 
 

SCC 2005 Special Tracks:

Special Track 1: IEEE SCC 2005 Special Track on Service Provisioning
Strategies
Special Track 2: IEEE SCC 2005 Special Track on Business in the Grid

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS: 

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that
are not being 
considered in another forum. Manuscripts will be limited to 8-10 (IEEE
Proceeding style) 
pages and be printed on 10 or 12 size font. Please follow the IEEE Computer
Society Press 
Proceedings Author Guidelines to prepare your papers. Electronic submission
of manuscripts 
(in PDF or Word format) is required. Detailed Instructions for electronic
paper 
submission, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, and review process can be
found at http
://conferences.computer.org/scc/2005/ . The length of the camera-ready of
an accepted 
paper will be limited to 8 (IEEE style) pages. At least one author of each
accepted paper 
is required to attend the conference and present the paper. The IEEE SCC
2005 Proceedings 
will be collected in EI Compendex. The detailed submission instructions can
be found at 
SCC 2005 web site. The enhanced version of the selected best papers
published in the SCC 
2005 will be invited !
 to publication in the International Journal of Web Services Research
(JWSR) (by Idea 
Group) and possibly other related journals. Some speakers of the keynotes,
panels, and 
tutorials will be invited to submit articles to extend their presentations
for IEEE IT 
Professional Magazine. 

EVALUATION PROCESS: 

All submissions will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
and soundness. 
Each paper will be refereed by at least two to three researchers in the
topical area. 

BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARDS: 

One Best Paper award and 1-3 Best Student Paper Awards will be presented by
SCC 2005. The 
first author of the best student papers should be full-time students.
