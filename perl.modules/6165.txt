The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::DHCPparse
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Module to parse ISC DHCP lease files
  userid:      JSHEARER (John D. Shearer)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    As was suggested to me, Text makes the most sense as a top level
    name since this module deals far more with the handling of a text
    file than it does with the network application that created it.
    DHCPparse just seems simple and descriptive, and there doesn't seem
    to be any other modules relating to the same topic.

  enteredby:   JSHEARER (John D. Shearer)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 19 19:46:07 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::DHCPparse       bdpfp Module to parse ISC DHCP lease files         JSHEARER
