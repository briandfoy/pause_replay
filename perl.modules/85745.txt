homepage: 
     why:

    where possible, co-author or subclass TEXT based modules to step up
    to Unicode.

    Already discussed with Dave Cross to do his Number::Fraction also
    saw Guitartabs that could do with improvements.

    Planning to create a 'Notify' system that will run on te background
    and keep track of many confgurable events from a great variety of
    sources
