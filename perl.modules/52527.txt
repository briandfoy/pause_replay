Sure, of course, no problem. So PARROTRE is it and you and Allison
have procura and should see a "mailing list representative menu" from
now on when you visit PAUSE. Let me know if more people should get the
maintainance rights. And please ask me if anything seems unclear. I
always believe the forms on PAUSE are intuitive but if they aren't,
I'm eager to help and probably we find ways to improve the respective
pages.

So please play with passing permissions over to PARROTRE and then
spray the comaintainer bits onto the release engineers like
fireworks:)
