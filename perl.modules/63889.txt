The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::PDB
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Perl interface to the Protein Data Bank
  userid:      MIOREL (Miorel-Lucian Palii)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Discussed on modules@perl.org in December 2008

  similar:
    Bio::Structure::IO::pdb, Chemistry::File::PDB

  rationale:

    Namespace choice - This interfaces with a web service. WWW::PDB
    therefore seems appropriate.

    Uniqueness of approach - I'm sure I'm not the first to write code
    like this, but I couldn't find it on CPAN.

    Why it should be listed in the module list - Better to have one
    module that talks to the Protein Data Bank rather than make everyone
    write their own client with SOAP::Lite, as straightforward as that
    might be.

    Related modules - Bio::Structure::IO::pdb and Chemistry::File::PDB
    work with files in the Protein Data Bank's format.

  enteredby:   MIOREL (Miorel-Lucian Palii)
  enteredon:   Sun Jan  4 01:30:50 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::PDB             bnpOp Perl interface to the Protein Data Bank      MIOREL
