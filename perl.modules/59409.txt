G'day Lionel, Ilya, and modules folk,

I love Fatal.pm.  I use it in my code, I teach it in my classes, I recommend
it to my clients.  However it's always bothered me that there's been no way
to enable Fatal on a lexical basis... until now.

Perl 5.10 adds the ability to write user-defined lexical pragmata via %^H.
Finally we can enable Fatal just for just a single block, or a single file.
~ The coding and refactoring benefits of this fills me with unbounded elation
and joy, except that to the best of my knowledge, there no lexical Fatal
module exists.

I'm hoping to fix this situation, either by writing one myself, or by
discovering that I'm wrong about the non-existence of the module.  All my
future work on this module depends upon two questions, with which I hope you
can assist me:

	a) Does a lexical Fatal module already exist (or is being written
	   and hence almost exists)?

	b) If not (a), then what do I name it?  The obvious choice to me
	   is 'fatal' (pragmas are lower-case, after all), but this is
	   a recipe for endless pain on Win32 and for typos in general.

	   I was thinking 'exceptions', so one could write:

		   use exceptions qw(open close chdir);

	   which I think is about as obvious as one can get with
	   regards to what the pragma does.

Feedback, comments, questions, arguments, code, drinks and thoughts are all
very welcome.

Many thanks,

	Paul
