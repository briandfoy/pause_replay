The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::EN::SENNA
  DSLIP:       adpOd
  description: Perl wrapper for the SENNA NLP toolkit
  userid:      DGINEV (Deyan Ginev)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  rationale:

    While Python has its vast NLTK libraries for natural language
    processing, Perl is falling behind with supporting state-of-the-art
    NLP tools.

    SENNA (http://ml.nec-labs.com/senna/) is the fastest NLP toolkit
    with state-of-art precision and recall, written in ANSI C. It is
    thus a great candidate for embedding in a Perl tool chain. Since
    this is a NLP toolkit for English, I am suggesting uploading it
    under the Lingua::EN namespace.

    This was my first module that involved writing an XS wrapper, so
    the code may not be perfect (hence version 0.01). However, I think
    the wrapper ended up quite efficient in terms of runtime and may be
    useful to the wider Perl community.

    The one limitation is SENNA's LICENSE, which is limited to
    non-commercial use and only pure verbatim redistribution. This
    should be completely fine for this wrapper, as it does not in any
    way modify/add to the original senna files. I have also requested an
    official approval for this wrapper from the SENNA team, and will
    delete this module if they raise objections.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::EN::
::SENNA           adpOd Perl wrapper for the SENNA NLP toolkit       DGINEV
