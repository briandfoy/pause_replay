As Randy Kobes has passed away, I've updated his PAUSE profile to use
my email address and to note in his name that people should contact me.


We've had to do this more than a couple of times it seems, so maybe we
need a policy on how it works. Some of us have discussed a PAUSE
"orphanage" but never really did anything about it.
