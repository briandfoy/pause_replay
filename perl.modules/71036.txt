Well, after all that, pause doesn't think I own any modules, despite 
being listed as co-maintainer for IO::Stty. I'm not quite sure how to 
proceed. Perhaps pause thinks the primary maintainer for IO::Stty is 
Roland Giersig, though I don't recall having given up ownership of that 
particular module. Any ideas?
