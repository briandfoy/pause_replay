Hello,

I'd like to register to become a CPAN contributor

Name:  Thomas Schuett
Email:   thomas.schuett@munich.netsurf.de
URL:     http://home.netsurf.de/thomas.schuett
ID:        SCHUETT

I intend to contribute a module CGI::Transactor as shown under:
http://home.netsurf.de/thomas.schuett/WWPnWWAC/beispiel/Transactor.txt

For more information about it please read
http://home.netsurf.de/thomas.schuett/WWPnWWAC/english/main.html

I am aware of the Module CGI::Application, but even if it looks similar,
it is not the same after all.

Also I intend to contribute a CGI program (so thats category "script"?). 
Is it the same procedure?

Best regards,
  Thomas

earlier already, please don't understand it as pushing.
