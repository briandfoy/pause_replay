Dear all,
I'm going again to ask for co-mainter permissions on the Gearman module to =
be
able to close open issues. Because some of the issues are opened for seven
years:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=3DGearman

Some of the issues are closed in unauthorized release:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D100594

BR,
Alexei
