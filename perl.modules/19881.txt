     why:

    I'm planning on contributing a module : CGI::FormManager. Its
    functionality is somewhere between the simple form support found in
    CGI.pm (start_form(), checkbox_group(), etc) and the full-blown
    templating system found in HTML::Template.

    In FormManager, forms are created, along with their form elements:
    $fm = new FormManager (); $fm->addComponent (FormManager::Text
    (heading="First Name", name='fname' validate=>'alphanumeric'));

    The form can then be generated with $fm->getFormHtml(), and when
    the form is submitted, the results can be read with:

    $fm->processQuery($a_cgi_instance); $fname =
    $fm->getValue('fname');

    I've found this module to be very useful in large forms where the
    user might make a mistake. FormManager can return the form again,
    with the errors listed at the top of the screen, and all of the
    fields retaining their previous values. It's also a great way to
    make a quick and dirty form that validates its input.

    Hope that qualifies as a "short description".

    Cheers! James
