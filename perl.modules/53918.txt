I seem to recall there was talk at one point about setting up a 
namespace on CPAN for module testing so I could upload something and get 
the index report, but not have the module appear in CPAN.  I don't see 
anything obvious in the newsgroup archive, but they only go back to Oct 
2006 (unless I did something when I subscribed to the newsgroup).

How about TESTING:: (where "TESTING" is composed of UTF characters that 
look similar to the Latin-1 characters but are different code points)? 
<duck>

TIA
