Hopefully now without accidentally hitting the "Send" button.

A few  years ago Flavio and I uploaded the KindaPerl6 compiler to the
CPAN, which had a bunch of auto-generated code that was indexed by
PAUSE by mistake.

As a result the two of us have some combination of owner and co-maint
for namespaces like "BEGIN", "Apply", "Code" etc.

This was never the intention, and KindaPerl6 has now been removed from
the CPAN, so please just remove our ownership of the following
namespaces (usernames AVAR and FGLOCK):

Apply
Assign
BEGIN
Bind
COMPILER
Capture
Closure
Code
CompUnit
Decl
For
Grammar
If
Index
Junction
KindaPerl6
KindaPerl6::*
Lit::Array
Lit::Code
Lit::Hash
Lit::NamedArgument
Lit::Object
Lit::Pair
Lit::Seq
Lookup
Match
Method
Multi
NamedArgument
Native::Buf
P5Token
Pad
Pair
Rule::After
Rule::Before
Rule::Block
Rule::Capture
Rule::CharClass
Rule::Concat
Rule::Constant
Rule::Dot
Rule::InterpolateVar
Rule::NamedCapture
Rule::NegateCharClass
Rule::Or
Rule::Quantifier
Rule::SpecialChar
Rule::Subrule
Rule::SubruleNoCapture
Rule::Var
Sig
Signature::Item
Sub
Subset
Use
Val::Bit
Val::Buf
Val::Char
Val::Int
Val::Num
Val::Object
Val::Undef
While

This is needed for Michael Roberts to be able to upload his "Decl"
module, but most of those namespaces are generic enough that someone
is going to bump into them sooner or later.
