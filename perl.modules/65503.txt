Subject: Module submission Barcode::ZBar

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Barcode::ZBar
  DSLIP:       bdcOl
  description: Read bar codes from images or video devices
  userid:      SPADIX (spadix)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://zbar.sourceforge.net/

  similar:
    Barcode::Zebra

  rationale:

    The ZBar Bar Code Reader is a library for scanning and decoding bar
    codes from various sources such as video streams, image files or raw
    intensity sensors. It supports EAN, UPC, Code 128, Code 39 and
    Interleaved 2 of 5. This module has the Perl bindings for the C
    library.

    This is a project name change for the old "Zebra" library. ref:
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2009-03/msg00240.html

    There are a few loosely related modules under Barcode:: for
    generating or manipulating barcodes. This also seems an appropriate
    place for a reader...

    Note that the Barcode:: namespace currently occurs in chapters 11,
    18 and 23. IMHO bar code reading is not specifically tied to images
    (or text processing), so I opted for "Miscellaneous". Of course I'm
    open to feedback if anyone thinks this is inappropriate.

The resulting entry would be:

Barcode::
::ZBar            bdcOl Read bar codes from images or video devices  SPADIX
