The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perl6::Parameters
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: Use Perl 6-style named parameters
  userid:      BRENTDAX (Brent Dax)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    perl6-language@perl.org

  similar:
    Perl6::Currying

  rationale:

    The naming is straigthforward: it simulates Perl 6's subroutine
    parameter lists, so it's named Perl6::Parameters. It should be in
    the list because several of its brothers in Perl6::* are and it
    seems stupid to exclude just this one.

    Perl6::Currying has some of the basic functionality (named
    parameter lists), but (to my knowledge) it doesn't include types or
    support for arrays and hashes.

The resulting entry would be:

Perl6::
::Parameters      bdpnp Use Perl 6-style named parameters            BRENTDAX
