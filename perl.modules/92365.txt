It's sort of secret knowledge among Perl toolchain maintainers.
"x_authority" is a custom CPAN META key, but PAUSE now respects it (and has
for a couple years, I think).

Google found this blog post about it:
https://jawnsy.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/what-is-x_authority/

And I opened a ticket about it, too:
https://github.com/andk/pause/issues/140
