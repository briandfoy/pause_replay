The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Database::Format::Text
  DSLIP:       RdpO2
  description: Simple text based local database
  userid:      DEVDOS (Devang Doshi)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms

  similar:
    N/A

  rationale:

    I selected new name space. It is Database::format::Text. This way
    any user can imply the functioning of the module. 1st part says it
    is a database, 2nd part says it is defined based on the style, which
    is format. 3rd part says its format is Text. This seems the perfect
    choice of the name space.

    This module should be listed because I did not find "this
    functionality is performed by any other available module". This is
    unique module. I also believe this would be very useful to many
    engineers.

  enteredby:   DEVDOS (Devang Doshi)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 20 01:05:18 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Database::Format::
::Text            RdpO2 Simple text based local database             DEVDOS
