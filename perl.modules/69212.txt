Rob was planning to apply the patches shortly; he's active, was just quiet
over christmas.

I've already spoken to him.

SPROUT - can you please either mail rkinyon@cpan.org or go via the dbm-deep
list - your patches should get applied or you and rob can discuss creating
a branch.

If you have trouble raising rob, ping me - I can hassle him on IRC.
