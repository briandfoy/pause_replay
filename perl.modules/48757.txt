     why:

    Bundle::Modules Bundle::Modules::CPAN Bundle::Modules::Perl
    Bundle::Modules::Perl::Unstable

    Bundle::Everything is a misnomer, as the author admits, it should
    be named Bundle::Acme::Everything. It just didn't cut it as
    "Everything" for me, and the author has rejected my proposal for
    something more complete and more efficient. I'm thinking out of his
    scope, and out of his Bundle::Everything box.

    count{'Bundle::Modules::CPAN'}=41613 count{'PackageDetails'}=38128
    count{'Bundle::Acme::Everything'}=3307 count{'Bundle::Modules'}=0178

    41613 - 38128 - 3307 - 178 = 0

    These bundles are not complicated, and I'll focus on the efficiency
    of loading them completely.

    Bundle::Modules

    all current bundles of modules (in CPAN).

    Bundle::Modules::CPAN

    all current modules in CPAN.

    Bundle::Modules::Perl

    stable Perl first, then all current modules in CPAN.

    Bundle::Modules::Perl::Unstable

    all current modules in CPAN first, then latest Perl.
