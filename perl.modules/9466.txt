The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rcs::Agent
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: OO interface to RCS
  userid:      NICKH (Nick Hilliard)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Rcs, VCS::RCS

  rationale:

    Rcs::Agent provides an OO method library for dealing with RCS
    archives. It provides read/write access to RCS archives, using a
    cleanly structured and well documented API.

    The interface is different to the Rcs-1.x libraries written by
    CFRETER. While Rcs-1.x provides a thinly disguised wrapper for the
    various RCS commands, the Rcs::Agent API is much more
    perl-module-like and provides fully OO methods which correspond to
    the sort of things that you'd like to be able to do with RCS rather
    than just methods which be used to pass command-line parameters to
    the RCS commands. In addition, the internal data structures are much
    better laid-out, and because the methods all use named parameter
    lists, the interface is much cleaner and more extensible than
    Rcs-1.x.

    Unlike Rcs::Agent, VCS::Rcs provides read-only access to version
    control archives. Rcs::Agent is also different in philosophy from
    VCS::Rcs in that it only attempts to deal with RCS instead of also
    trying to be a generic interface for other version control systems.

The resulting entry would be:

Rcs::
::Agent           bdpOd OO interface to RCS                          NICKH
