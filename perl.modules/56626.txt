you received the mail because the registered namespace is "CfgTie", yet
there is no such namespace in the CfgTie distribution. They're all
"CfgTie::SOMETHING". But that's okay. The registration won't be deleted.
If you ever feel so inclined, you can include an almost empty CfgTie.pm
in the distribution so it's correctly indexed, but that's entirely optional.

Good luck with your family!

Best regards,
Steffen
