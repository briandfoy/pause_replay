The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Iterator
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A general-purpose iterator class
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    RPI lily, comp.lang.perl.misc, comp.lang.perl.modules, Mark Dominus

  similar:
    Array::Iterator, Regex::Iterator File::Find::Iterator,
    Class::Iterator, Object::Iterate

  rationale:

    This module is intended to be the definitive implementation of
    iterators as popularized by Mark Jason Dominus. There are currently
    several scattered iterator modules with varying functionality; this
    module is meant to serve as a common ground for others to build upon
    and maintain compatability.

    I have discussed this module with many people on RPI lily's -perl
    forum; the response has been very positive. I have also announced it
    on comp.lang.perl.modules and c.l.p.misc; the response there was
    also positive. I emailed Mark Dominus and asked for his opinion;
    unfortunately I haven't received any formal response from him.

    In addition to this barebones class module, I am offering up
    Iterator::IO, Iterator::Util, Iterator::DBI, and Iterator::Misc as
    general-purpose (and special-purpose) modules based on this base
    module. I plan also to write Iterator::Random (random-number
    generators). I can also foresee other modules being created (by
    myself, or by others). Perhaps Iterator::DataWalk, to traverse a
    hierarchical data structure; or Iterator::DateTime to provide
    functions for iterating over DateTime objects; or Iterator::Net, for
    iterating over data received via a network connection. It would be
    good to make an umbrella implementation for these various iterators,
    so that they can all interoperate compatibly.

    And that's the reason I'm proposing that this be a new root
    namespace: so that there is a clear and obvious path for module
    authors who wish to contribute compatible modules, and for program
    authors to know that a given module or modules work together.

    I don't think it would be necessary to require that all Iterator::*
    modules get approval for me (or even be coordinated by me) (as Tim
    Bunce does for the DBI::* and DBD::* modules), unless the CPAN
    namespace gods think that would be a good idea.

The resulting entry would be:

Iterator          bdpOp A general-purpose iterator class             ROODE
