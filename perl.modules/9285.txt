The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Questionaire
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO questionaire system with callbacks
  userid:      MIKO (Miko O'Sullivan)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Several other questionaire systems

  rationale:

    Term::Questionaire provides a simplified system for asking a series
    of questions at the terminal prompt and collecting responses.
    Term::Questionaire provides an object oriented approach to
    questions. The entire questionaire is an object, and each question
    is an object within the questionaire. Several different object
    classes are available to represent different data types, including
    string, array, hash, yes/no, numeric, and file path. The classes are
    also designed to allow for adding more data types. Each question can
    be marked as active or inactive... inactive questions are skipped
    when the questionaire is run. Several data validation properties can
    be set such as required, minimum, maximum, if the file path must
    exist, if you must have read/write permissions to the path, and
    others. Speaking of "others", list-based questions (array and hash)
    can be set to allow the user to select an "other" option at the end
    of the list and enter their own value. In addition to the property
    based data validation, questions can be set to call a callback
    subroutine which can be used for any complex data validation you
    like, and also to set other questions as active or inactive.
