Thanks Steffen,

I've myself been sort of preoccupied lately since our storage solution 
at the office lost its entire RAID volume due to a misconfig of the 
controller. It was about 3 TB of data, and it took quite some time to 
get the backup restored :-/...

Anyway, I will gather my changes from my own 'dist' used since I started 
and verify the changes needed and send up a version asap.
