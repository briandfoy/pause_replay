     why:

    Potentially some stuff regarding messaging ( as in machine
    readable, application to application stuff ) unless I find something
    out there that already does what I want to do, in which case I'll
    probably do an Acme module that maps a tied hash onto method calls,
    using paremeters defined in the keys of the hash, and possibly some
    bulk mailing support software ( for "good" opt-in mail that is ).
