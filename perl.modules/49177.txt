Daniel, I'm sorry, but I need to step into this talk a little. It's
not very polite to tell others how long some action will take them.
There may be zillions of reasons why your estimates may be wrong, the
other person definitely will know better. You should only try to judge
your own time and should be ready to invest yourself if you want
something to be achieved. This is a simple rule that is pretty well
established in the community.

What you're missing (and what Olivier already told you) is the checkin
of the change into Olivier's repository. If it's not checked in into
his repository, the fix will be lost in version 0.94, you see?

So the above sequence is most probably what you will have to do
yourself (unless Olivier beats you to it) and it would be both polite
and clever to provide a patch and/or accept his invitation to become
writer in his repository.

This being said, I just made you co-maintainer and if things went
correctly, you should now be able to play your role. Thank you very
much for your offer and your activity in this matter to help to save
the world. And I hope you understand that I try to influence the
directions of this whole procedure to reach a quick resolution.

Thanks everybody,
