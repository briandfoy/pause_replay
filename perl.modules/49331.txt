The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       dbwide
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: dbwide
  userid:      ZOHAER (Zohaer Naqvi)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perform SQL operations on all tables in a database, in one shot.

  similar:

  rationale:

    Sometimes we need to perform one kind of SQL operation across the
    entire database. This is seen more often when you wish to remove a
    user from your portal's db or when you simply wish to load all data
    that is associated with one user. And not just that, you also need
    to do this in a secure manner that follows your design protocols,
    what if your db server doesn't support stored procedures? This is
    when dbwide comes into the picture to provide a handy interface for
    performing such SQL operations in the global context. The module
    itself is written in simplest possible OO perl and well commented so
    any user may also add his own functionality specific to his code.
    The name "dbwide" itself says it all! that it allows you to operate
    db-wide.

The resulting entry would be:

dbwide            adpOa dbwide                                       ZOHAER
