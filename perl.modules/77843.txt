     why:

    I am working on a simple relational DBMS implemented entirely in
    Perl 5 and would like to share it on CPAN.

    What makes it different: Compare to other similar sized DBMS
    implementations, it: 1. is entirely implemented in Perl 5 2. is very
    compact and easy to understand 3. data files, log files are all
    human readable and can be easily processed by any text processing
    language. 4. support basic transaction management 5. support
    database triggers

    The project is still working-in-progress. Half of the major
    functions are already completed and it won't take long for all the
    major functions to be completed.

    For more details, please read https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/PerlDB

    Thank you
