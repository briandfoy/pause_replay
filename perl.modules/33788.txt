The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Funlog
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: Nice logging, with fun in logs :)
  userid:      KORSANI (Gabriel Guillon)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::*

  rationale:

    I wrote a module for logging. And I found my logs ... borring. So I
    added fun :P Logically, I called it Log::Funlog It's very useful for
    me and ... my work team! We made a project, using it. Everybody
    found it nice, and useful (even with fun desactivated) It as simple
    as Log::Simple, or Log::Logger, and you can add loglevel, choose
    between logging to STDERR and a file, choose the prefix of the
    lines, see the calling subroutine (and even see the subroutine that
    called the subroutine that called the ... Ok, you see :) ), and, of
    course, add a bit of fun to you logs (between 0% and 100%)
    Basically, it just logs with a loglevel in a flexible way :)

    In a few words: it works, it works well, its flexible, and its fun!
