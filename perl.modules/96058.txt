Hi Guys!

There is this module HTML::Laundry (https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::Laundry)=
=20
which seems to be unmainted for a while and I wanted to ask if it's possibl=
e=2C=20
to takeover the maintenance=20

I tried to contact the author Steve Cook via cpan (email doesn't work anymo=
re)=20
and facebook but no response yet=20

There are some pull-requests in his git-repo to fix open bugs with tests:=20
https://github.com/snark/html-laundry

So is there any way for me to become maintainer?

Cheers=2C
Christoph 		 	   		  =
