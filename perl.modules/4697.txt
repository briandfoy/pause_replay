Stupit question as first(i follow strictly all the instructions)
   Is there anybody out there ??? Sorry, I mean does anybody read
	this list ??? Thanks for response.

So, I want to register so i've looked instruction (huh, i think
	registration could be made more easily, but...) and here is
	what you wanted....

NAME	: Samuel Behan
EMAIL	: behan@frida.fri.utc.sk
HOMEPAGE: (none - under construction ;)
USERID	: SAMSK or SAM_SK

CONTRIBUTION PLAN
   module:
	name : RcReader	
	dsli : bdpf
	desc.: defines 
		    rc_cpp - preprocessor
		    rc_init, rc_set, rc_parse, rc_stop, rc_free
			   - parsing functions
   script:
	passwd_exp - script that checks shadow databse settings and
		warns users of thier password expiration via email (see
		freshmeat)
 
I've not yet discussed any part of my contribution but it looks so,
     that passwd_exp is being used with (for me) many people. In last
     6 or 4 months it has been directly downloaded by about 500(?) people
     and i've got positive feedback about using it.
     Hm, and module was created because (i've not found good one
     for my purposes) i required it in my new version passwd_exp script.


			ok, have a nice day ;-)
