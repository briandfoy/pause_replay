    =head1 What is WebRobot

    WebRobot is a data driven http client heavily based on L<LWP|LWP>.
    It can be used

    =over

    =item

    for automating http requests

    =item

    for a kind of web based unit tests

    =item

    for (limited) stress tests of web servers

    =item

    for analyzing http communication

    =back

    =head1 How to use it

    =over

    =item

    You define your requests in an XML file, possibly with additional
    information like a description or an assertion. This is called to be
    a test plan.

    =item

    You configure WebRobot (proxies, authentification, ...) with a
    simple properties file.

    =item

    You run L<webrobot.pl> with your test plan and configuration file.

    =item

    You inspect the output in text or html form depending on the output
    filters in use.

    =back

    =head1 Some features

    =over

    =item

    The test plan format is XML. The plan to be processed includes a
    list of http/https request. POST requests will be feeded with data.

    =item

    Display of http request/response header.

    =item

    Assertions for http responses: Some predicates and boolean
    operators (extendable).

    =item

    Multiple requests out of a single one, eg. additionally request the
    images and frames (extendable).

    =item

    Linkchecker included (a special module for <i>multiple
    request</i>). Predicates and boolean operators for the links to be
    used.

    =item

    Output listeners (extendable): HTML, Text, Test::Harness

    =item

    Property file for the client configuration (proxy, basic
    authentification, timeout, ...)

    =item

    Cookie behaviour control (on, off, clear)

    =item

    Including test plans: A plan can include any other plans.

    =item

    Plans are parameter enabled (names). The names are set by the
    calling plan or the config file.

    =item

    Single client instance emulating multiple users (deterministic
    access).

    =item

    Multiple client instances for load test (unix like operating
    systems only).

    =item

    Sending mail when the execution of the plan is terminated.

    =back

    =head1 BUGS

    Most bug descriptions are annotated at the desired place. However,
    there should really be more tests.
