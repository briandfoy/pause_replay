The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::SHA
  DSLIP:       Mdhhp
  description: Perl extension for SHA-1/224/256/384/512
  userid:      MSHELOR (Mark Shelor)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, email exchanges with author of Digest module

  similar:
    Digest::SHA1 Digest::SHA2

  rationale:

    This module provides a complete implementation of the NIST SHA
    standard: i.e. it supports all algorithms of the standard, and
    allows for bit-string as well as byte inputs. For this reason,
    newsgroup participants recommended that the module be named
    Digest::SHA. This module conforms to all naming conventions and
    interface styles specified in the CPAN Digest module.

    I submitted a registration request for this module over 7 months
    ago. Brian D. Foy informs me that he was unable to find the
    registration data for this module. So, he recommended that I
    re-submit it, and he would personally attend to getting it
    registered. If you have any questions, please email me at

    mshelor@comcast.net

    Thanks, Mark

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
