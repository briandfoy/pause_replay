     why:

    As part of my undergraduate research I have been building a set of
    modules to facilitate signal analysis, time-series prediction, and
    the associated data management and display. Although the structure
    is not finalized, these currently include:

    Math::Signal - convenient routines for manipulating and
    investigating 1D, 2D data sets (more Ds are coming...)
    Math::Signal::Component - general class for various signal
    components Math::Signal::Component::LoadData - load arbitrary points
    Math::Signal::Component::Function - arbitrary math function
    Math::Signal::Component::Noise - shake things up (also used to
    characterize noise) Math::Signal::Component::Sinusoid - trig
    polynomials Math::Signal::Component::Wavelet - for wavelet
    decomposition (not remotely finished) Math::Integral::Stieltjes - as
    general as legesgue integration but much easier to compute
    Math::Wavelets - perl-only wavelet functions (someday)
    Math::Wavelets::Haar - first steps... Number::Pi::InTheSky - this
    one is fun. In it are gathered about 15 different methods of
    calculating Pi with various degrees of convergence. In addition to
    built-in profiling and error analysis routines, this module features
    historical information about each technique: the context of its
    creation, the effects it had at the time, and a brief
    characterization of its pros, cons, and charms. So you can see for
    yourself why Ramanujan is way better than throwing hot dogs on your
    kitchen floor (both methds are included).

    There are many more in development for more mundane things such as
    collecting and analyzing the results of trivially parallelized
    processing, but the above are some of the sexiest.

    I am quite often distressed by the non-availability of perl
    implementations of standard numeric procedures, regardless of
    whether they're purely perl or simply importing from outside. I have
    quite a lot of sloppy but useful routines which address the gaps,
    but organization (and optimization) consumes more time than I have
    had available.

    Anyways, that's what I plan to contribute.

    Regards, M. Kroh
