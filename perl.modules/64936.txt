    Parallel::Fork::BossWorkerAsync - Perl extension for creating
    asynchronous forking queue processing applications.

    The "Parallel::Fork::BossWorkerAsync" package implements a
    multiprocess preforking server. On construction, the current process
    forks a "Boss" process (the server), which then forks one or more
    "Worker" processes. The Boss acts as a manager, accepting jobs from
    the main process, queueing and passing them to the next available
    idle Worker. The Boss then listens for, and collects any responses
    from the Workers as they complete jobs, queueing them for the main
    process.
