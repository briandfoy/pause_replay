Hello Neil,

I tested, packaged, and pushed current versions of XAO::* modules to CPAN.
That fixed the base.pm vs Base.pm issue, but it still reports indexing
issues because of files in testcases/ overlapping between packages.

I know you said I could move them to t/ to avoid indexing, but at the
moment I would really like to avoid that. I need to move testing code from
obsolete Test::Unit to something better and that might take a while. Using
"testcases" is embedded in a couple of places with the current setup, hard
to change. I am just afraid that if I need to work on that I might not find
time for a while :(

Is there a way to hint CPAN to not index files in testcases/ ?

Thanks!


Andrew.
