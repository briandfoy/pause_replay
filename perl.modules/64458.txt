The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attribute::Imports
  DSLIP:       adppp
  description: Import symbols from other modules.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    Symbol's qualify_to_ref can be used for this, the attribute
    simplifies syntax.

  rationale:

    This is an attribute handler, hence "Attribute::". Explicitly
    importing symbols from other modules helps avoid namespace
    collisions, allows context-specific names for values, and helps
    document where the values came from.

    For example:

    sub basename :imports( '&File::Basename::basename' );

    Makes it pretty explicit where the local package's "basename" sub
    came from.Contrast this to "use File::Basename;" which silently
    pushes "basename", etc, into the local package without any
    documentation about where they came from.

    Now imagine you have a good reason to call the imported sub
    something else:

    sub base_path :imports ( '&File::Basename::basename' );

    which does the deed in one step.

    The module also handles scalars, arrays, and hashes.

The resulting entry would be:

Attribute::
::Imports         adppp Import symbols from other modules.           LEMBARK
