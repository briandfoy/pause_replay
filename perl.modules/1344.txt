the code already exists under the Apache tree as Apache-Wrapper_0.02.tar.gz
(save the list the trip to the archives, which showed buggy code anyway :)

well, it is a content handler - it wasn't really designed to be extensible,
subclassable, whatever.  While there are lots of template systems out there,
I kinda thought this was a popular type of thing to do - uniform content
delivery.  Thus perhaps the need for a module so folks (especially the newer
ones) didn't have to figure out Mason, HTML::Template, or Text::Template to
do something simple.

I also thought that making it Apache::Filter was value-added.

but hey, none of this is novel stuff - if it doesn't belong on CPAN we can
remove it (I uploaded already)

I'm terrible with names - SimpleReplace works for me.  Based on the
response, I'll rename it (or we'll get rid of it :)
thanks for your input...
