     why:

    I wrote module, which can inflect (decline) russian names and
    detect gender of man/woman by his/her name. I want to make this
    module public as Lingua::RU::Inflect (::Name?) and I plan to extend
    its functionality: module will inflect common russian nouns and
    adjectives (declension of names is similar to declension of nouns
    and adjectives).
