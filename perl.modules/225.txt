Thanks for the reminder. It's in the module list naw and you can edit
your ML entry on the PAUSE by entering the menu "Edit a Module".

I have rescheduled your upload and within an hour the indexer will
pick it up and will add you to the various indexes and symlink trees.

 > Many thanks for all your hard work.

You're welcome!
