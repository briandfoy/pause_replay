The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::Buckaroo
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Program becomes Buckaroo Banzai characters
  userid:      KEVINRICE (Kevin J. Rice)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    fwp@perl.org (Fun With Perl Mailing List)

  similar:
    Acme::Buffy

  rationale:

    I liked the Acme::Buffy and Acme::Bleach, but they are kind of
    advanced Perl. I liked the idea better of a highly readable version
    of the program so that everyone knew what it was doing. Sometimes
    beginners don't know how things work so well and a clear and
    documented module would be a help.

    That, and it's FUN !!!

    This module, just like Acme::Bleach & Acme::Buffy, when included at
    the top of a Perl script, turns the rest of the script into words
    relating to the movie, "Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension"
    (based on a book by Earl Mac Rauch, see the IMDB.com listing). This
    includes character's names, actor's names, locations, etc. This is
    done in a different way from the other modules, too (one character =
    one movie character), not by converting to binary and using
    capitalization as Buffy and Bleach do.

    Yes, the script still works as it normally did before the script
    source was changed. But, you get to see all the names of the people
    in what could possibly be the greatest movie ever made! (okay, well,
    Ice Pirates may have been a little better, I'm not sure...) grin :-)
