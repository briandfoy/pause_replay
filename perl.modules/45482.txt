The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DNS::Sendmail
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: SMTP-MTA client using  DNS MX entries.
  userid:      SRIOPEN (srikanth penumetcha)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    http://www.coreunix.com/corebb/index.php

  similar:
    No SMTP module that I know of with auto detecting of MX host.

  rationale:

    I have picked the name space as below: Net::DNS::Sendmail Since I
    have at present only included the RFC821 and partly RFC2821
    functionality. Since I am concentrating on a "work nomatter what"
    model I have not use the namespace Net::DNS::SMTP.

    I Haven't found any pure perl module substitue for the below
    'sendmail' script.

    open (MAIL, "|/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"); ... ... close (MAIL);

    Basically, the layman should be able use it as easy as the above
    perl script, but ofcouse without the need for a MTA server like
    sendmail, procmail etc.

    The next version will be a SMTP/ESMTP client plus a relaying
    server.

    Moto ( in order of priority): work in more than one way. there is
    more than one way to do it.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::DNS::
::Sendmail        bdpOp SMTP-MTA client using  DNS MX entries.       SRIOPEN
