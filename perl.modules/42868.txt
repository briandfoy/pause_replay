     why:

    Different modules that I haven't been able to find in CPAN that I
    have had to custom make that have become very useful to me
    throughout different applications I've built.

    For example: - Different methods of caching database queries,
    returns and connections - Different methods of handling log files
    and configuration files to allow for consistency and control over
    each througout specific applications
