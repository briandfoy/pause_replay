arghh ;-)

Ok, I thought about what you could plug into this proxy module. 
Maybe someone could write a plug-in to remove (nonevil) ActiveX or
JavaScript from HTML files. The question is, does this need the complete
download of the content or could this be handled as a streaming filter?

Back to the names: ProxyFilter sounds to much like URL-Filter and
ProxyPlugin sounds to undefined to me. 
Do YOU have any better ideas? ;-)
