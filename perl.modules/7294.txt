I prefer Math::Calc::Units to Units::Calc.  I also prefer Calc::Units to
Units::Calc.

The first question to ask is, what does this thing provide?  It provides
a calculator.  Hence Calc.  What sort of calculator?  A units
calculator.  Hence Calc::Units.  The primary thing it provides is a
calculator, not a unit.

The issue of whether to put it under Math:: or whether to leave it at
its own top level has to do with:

- would/could there be other calculators under Math::Calc?
    => yes, I can envision Math::Calc::Scientific, etc

- would/could there be other calculators NOT under Math::Calc?
    => perhaps, but it seems odd to me.  I could conceive that a
    hypothetical Calc::Business or Calc::FabricYardage might feel 
    out of place in Math.

- are deeply nested CPAN module names a good or useful thing?
    => *shrug*  People seem to be OK with three-level names.


So, I personally have no firm advice, but perhaps that at least gives
you some ideas.
