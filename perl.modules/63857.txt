Subject: Module submission Finance::NASDAQ::Quote
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, iank@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::NASDAQ::Quote
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Fetch real time stock quotes from nasdaq.com
  userid:      IANK (Ian Kilgore)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    perlmonks, ##turtles

  similar:
    Finance::Quote Finance::YahooQuote

  rationale:

    Finance:: is an obvious choice, as Finance::Quote and many others
    already exist. Finance::NASDAQ::Quote is different in that it
    fetches real-time data from nasdaq.com (afaict this is not one of
    Finance::Quote's many potential sources).

    Also, as much as I dislike '::Simple' and '::Lite' and so on,
    Finance::NASDAQ::Quote is a rather simple, light interface.

  enteredby:   IANK (Ian Kilgore)
  enteredon:   Wed Dec 31 23:51:31 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::NASDAQ::
::Quote           bdpfp Fetch real time stock quotes from nasdaq.com IANK
