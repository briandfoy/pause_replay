Subject: Module submission HTML::ListScraper

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::ListScraper
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: generic web page scraping support
  userid:      VBAR (Vaclav Barta)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Text::Scraper Template::Generate

  rationale:

    Module name is by analogy with Text::Scraper as well as
    HTML::Parser, which HTML::ListScraper extends.

    Other scraping modules available on CPAN are either
    hyper-specialized (Finance::Bank::Wachovia, WWW::Scraper::Delicious
    etc.), or they require configuration in their own mini-language
    (like, for example, Template::Extract), which isn't obviously easier
    to use than scraping directly with Perl. HTML::ListScraper should
    work on all pages showing some kind of list (i.e. all search
    engines), and while the implemented version doesn't work quite out
    of the box, it does give reasonable results for multiple sites after
    customizing just a few properties.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::ListScraper     RdpOp generic web page scraping support            VBAR
