The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::Math
  DSLIP:       inpOp
  description: Mathematical functions for astronomy.
  userid:      QUANACK (Jason R Poole)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Astro::Coords, Astro::MoonPhase, Astro::Sunrise

  rationale:

    The modules list above contain some calculation routines for
    astronomy. My proposed name space allows for more obscure
    mathematical computations for astronomers and perl coders. I have
    been looking for routines for astronomy to calculate planet
    coordinates, moon phases, and sun rise/set as well as other
    astronomical calculation. I think this is a appropriate name space
    because all the functions in my proposed module are mathematical
    and, more importantly, astronomical.

The resulting entry would be:

Astro::
::Math            inpOp Mathematical functions for astronomy.        QUANACK
