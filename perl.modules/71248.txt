VirtualBox:: is a fairly lame namespace anyway - better to find an existing
top level namespace you can sub-namespace - Net:: seems to be common but
others on this list can probably make a better suggestion.

So, basically, "there are ways to get hold of an abandoned namespace but in
this case you didn't want to" :)
