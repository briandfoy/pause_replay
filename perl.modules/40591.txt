Hey Friend,

I was going through some emails yesterday and read one from a client of mine that pretty much knocked me to the floor.

In part, he wrote about how he wanted a refund for the pre-construction course he got from me because, well...he just didn't think it would work.

Now ordinarily, I couldn't care less if someone requests a refund. I just give them their money back. It's actually a GOOD thing in some cases, because it seperates the doers from the whiners.

And you know what?

I don't want a bunch of people on my list who just want to TALK about getting wealthy...no, I want the ones who are hungry...and ready to seize the opportunities given to them to make huge changes in their lives virtually overnight. The average opportunist just doesn't fit into that group and need not apply.

Anyway...this email bugged me a little bit, because in just past two weeks I posted two deals on the private VIP pre-construction website that made some doers incredibly wealthy in just a few weeks.

Want specifics? Well, I posted the NY project...and not 3 weeks later the price skyrocketed...surpassing what I even thought possible. One guy who got in on the deal made over a quarter million in just three weeks.
 
Deals like that don't happen all the time...but I think it's fair to say he was quite pleased with the outcome...wouldn't ya say?

OK; so the next one I posted on the site was the Hard Rock condo project. I posted it on a Friday...and the very next day prices shot up 10 percent...just in one day! Given that the average condo price there is over half a mil, I think ten percent is a pretty impressive amount.

Those two deals I posted were available to ALL my clients (including the one wanting the refund) who have my pre-construction course and could have easily been getting huge returns in a matter of weeks.

Well, I just had to get that off my chest. By the way...I did give him his money back..no big deal, because someone else who's ready and willing is gonna jump on the golden opportunity that stared him in the face...and what they get back in return is going to blow their mind.

So Friend...

Will that be you? Why not? Give it a shot...you won't be sorry.

See ya,

Lou
