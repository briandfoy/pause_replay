Request to register new user

fullname: James Barton
  userid: REVOLET
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.revolet.com
     why:

    I would like to contribute some modules on behalf of my company,
    Revolet, which is a Perl 5 Hosting Platform (www.revolet.com).

    I think some of the modules we have developed for managing aspects
    of hosting Perl 5 applications could be useful to other Perl 5
    developers.

    Some examples include modules to manage Nginx configs, Mercurial
    Server keys and repos, and Linux Containers.
