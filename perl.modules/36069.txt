Hi,

Thanks for this. I'm currently starting up co-maintainance of a module,
OpenGuides, and have run into a couple of problems. I apologise if this
is covered elsewhere; if so and I've missed it, please point me at the
Fine Manual. Otherwise:

KAKE (the former/current primary maintainer of OpenGuides) has, I
believe, set me as primary maintainer of OpenGuides. However, this is
not reflected in PAUSE
<https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=peek_perms>. Searching
on DOM returns no results, while searching on the OpenGuides module
returns only KAKE (as a co-maint). I haven't uploaded anything
yet, so I can't comment as to whether that works; however I can't log
into rt.cpan.org either, and it strikes me that this may be the reason.
Is the account simply not fully active until I do an upload, or has
something gone wrong?

Thanks,

Dominic.
