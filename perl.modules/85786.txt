The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::More::Hooks
  DSLIP:       Rdpfb
  description: This provides before/after hooks of subtest.
  userid:      AINAME (生井 智司)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/ainame/p5-Test-More-Hooks

  similar:

  rationale:

    This reason to name is very simple. Test::More::Hooks provides
    before/after hooks for Test::More::subtest.

    I am generally satisfied that the function of Test::More is a
    simple, but I'm annoyed that the function is not enough. That's the
    setup / teardown process. However, since I don't want to use the
    test framework hard to structured like Test::Class, I decided to add
    functionality to Test::More.

    Test::More::Hooks has some pros. * It is very simple and intuitive.
    * It has no dependency except core modules. * You can write slim
    test code when using setup/teardown process. * You will release from
    t/Util.pm files when you want to use before/after hooks.
