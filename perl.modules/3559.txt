Subject: Request registration as CPAN author
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: kinzler@cs.indiana.edu

Hello, I'd like to register as a CPAN author.

	Name:		Steve Kinzler
	Email:		kinzler@cs.indiana.edu
	Homepage:	http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~kinzler
	UserID:		KINZLER

If appropriate, I'd like to contribute my "vshnu" visual Perl shell
application.  Here's my blurb about it:

	Vshnu is a visual shell for Linux/Unix finally done right.
	Best used as an optional color visual mode to a regular command
	line shell, vshnu is handy for powerful directory listing and
	navigation, Unix command assembly, special actions on file types,
	and fileset handling. Written in Perl for portability and high
	configurability, it also provides the advantages of a Perl
	interpreter as part of your Unix shell environment.

I think it'll be of good interest to some in the Perl development&user
community and so would like to get the word out about it there.

Vshnu's website is at

	http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~kinzler/vshnu

It's been very well received so far as the comments at freshmeat indicate

	http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/vshnu

Thanks much,						Steve
