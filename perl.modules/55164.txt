Hi,
 I created a module called Bundle::Ensembl, I have registered with the PAUSE
too. On reading the FAQ's it is mentioned that one can upload the module
without the need to wait for approval and registration from PAUSE but there
isnt any link as such to upload it, the link provided links back to the
FAQ's again. Can some one help me with this I need to upload this module and
test its installation asap.
Thank you
Ahamarshan.jn
