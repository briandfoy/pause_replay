Damian,

I have applied for a PAUSE id, and have backing from at least one other
Boston.PMer for a regular practicum in module maintenance by the chapter.

If the group agrees on this as a group project, as opposed to just me, we
should have a second Boston.pm person able to promote changes & manage RT
queue, probably one of the usual suspects.

I need to cover my legal behind at the $DayJob office, as I hope to
recommend the module once we have RT up-to-date, and thus might develop a
patch there, and will certainly check RT from there. Should be no problem
since I am on the Open Source Review Board and have my VP's support.

Since PAUSE page says to keep *modules@perl.org *in thzloop when discussing
co-maintaiinerhood, I am Cc:ing them

More news when I have more feedback -- meeting next week. If Federico's demo
isn't ready, this is my new ready reserve workshop topic ...

I'd be happy to pass it on to your care, if you want to take it on.
It shouldn't require excessive effort, since it's supposed NOT to
experience much feature creep. ;-)
