I'm aware of the sad state of SDL_Perl. You've mailed the right place 
for information about how to obtain permissions to upload a new version 
to CPAN. We are, however, not the people who have access to the 
*.perl.org web sites. I hunted down one of the admins and what he said 
was essentially that you can get access SVN repository with the site 
sources once you have permissions to upload a new version to CPAN. 
Here's the necessary steps:

1) Apply for a PAUSE account via pause.perl.org if you have no account yet.
2) Read http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/04pause.html and 
specifically the bit about taking over maintenance of modules.
3) Follow the advice that's given in there: Contact the maintainer of 
SDL_Perl. Additionally, you may want to get in touch with chromatic, 
who's done quite a bit of work on SDL_Perl as well and who mostly put 
together sdl.perl.org.
4) Once you have Dave's blessing for maintaining SDL_Perl, either have 
him mail us so we can give you permissions or ask him to give you 
co-maintenance permissions directly via pause.perl.org.
5) Once that's done, mail to hostmaster at perl.org and ask nicely for 
SVN access to the sdl.perl.org sources so you can update the pages.

I hope this doesn't seem too tedious. This kind of permission handling 
needs to be done with utter care.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
