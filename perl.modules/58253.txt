    Sol::Parser - a .sol file reader

    Local Shared Object (LSO), sometimes known as flash cookies, is a
    cookie-like data entity used by Adobe Flash Player. LSOs are stored
    as files on the local file system with the .sol extension.
    Sol::Parser reads a Local Shared Object file and return its content
    as a list.
