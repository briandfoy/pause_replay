    I'm _really_ familiar with Jabber, honest.  Jabber is much more than
an IM gateway.  I'm saying that there's no call for a top-level namespace
unless the Jabber community is going to populate it with a variety of
internals hooks, in much the same way that the Apache community has.

    AFAICT, the only Jabber-related Perl modules that exist or have
been proposed deal with "the Jabber protocol", from the network level
(moving bits over the TCP) to the application level (building and
parsing the XML).  Ryan Eatmon's excellent and substantial offerings,
for example, live under Net:: and XML::.

    If you're planning on doing something more integrated into Jabber's
core, then I endorse a Jabber:: top-level namespace.  If you just want to
make the point that Jabber is more than IM, then I don't think the PAUSE
namespace is the best forum for that.
