Greetings.  When I log onto pause.perl.org and Edit Module Metadata
I get "Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to PJB."

Well, that's a bit of a surprise, there should be CGI::Htauth,
Term::Clui and Crypt::Tea ...

And yet I am still able to Upload these modules ...

Also, the search http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Crypt-Tea-1.34
says "No data available" for Crypt::Tea, but does present data for
Term::Clui.  Looks to me like a bit of a mess.  What should I do ?

Regards,  Peter Billam
