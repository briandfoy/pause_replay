Sorry... I missed that one. Basically it is a word generation module.
Bovlam is an adjective which is used of something without force and
originallity.
Bovlam::Simple is, as the name says, quite simple and does not pay attention
to e.g. language syntax.
One could imagin a Bovlam::Complex::Danish as well as a
Bovlam::Complex::English module coming in the future, which of course would
keep such things in mind.

Best regards,
Andreas Kryger Jensen
