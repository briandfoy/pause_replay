>*  a description of what you're planning to contribute

Some port to MacPerl. First of all, Digest::MD5.


>*  for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry, 
which is: Development stage, Support level, Language used, 
Interface style (see the modulelist), and a 44 character 
description).

>*  for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send a concise 
description that helps us to categorize the issue so we can 
forward your mail to the maintainers of the corresponding archive 
branch.

It is a port of Digest::MD5 to MacPerl. Is this concise enough?


>*  It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about 
where you have discussed some or all parts of your contribution 
publicly, and if there was at least a little bit of interest. We 
are quite open for submissions, but we owe our users at least 
some rudimentary quality control. If your work has never been 
discussed publicly, then it's extremely difficult for us to make 
our judgement whether to accept the submission or not.

I use MacPerl-Modules (macperl-modules@macperl.org) ML. I 
discussed on the list and with the original porter Chris Nandor.  
Chris is preparing to put my port on his MMP page.
