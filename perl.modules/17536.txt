Hi all,

I'm working on a module to provide an OO-interface to configuration 
settings stored individually in multiple small files within a 
directory or set of directories e.g. /proc directory style configs, 
or qmail environment directories. Multiple directory support allows 
things like distribution settings overridden by global site settings 
overridden by user settings, for example.

Re namespace, I've been thinking about Config::Directory - comments/
objections/suggestions anyone?

In terms of other modules extant, some similar functionality is 
provided by Tie::TextDB and DirDB, but both use a tie interface and 
only operate on a single directory.

TIA,
Gavin
