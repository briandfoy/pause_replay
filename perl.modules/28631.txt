The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::Captcha
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Completely Automated Public Turning Test
  userid:      UNRTST (Joshua I. Miller)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Authen::Captcha provides an object oriented interface to captcha
    file creations. A Captcha is a program that can generate and grade
    tests that: - most humans can pass. - current computer programs
    can't pass Basically, it attempts to authenticate a human element to
    a transaction.

    There are several captcha implementations in perl floating around
    the net, but I haven't found any on CPAN. Further, those I found
    were not structured into easy to use modules, but rather require'd
    into scripts, and were often tailored to specific applications (ex.
    web forms).

    Authen::Captcha includes code from one GPL'd implementation
    (HumanTest 1.0) in an OO perl module which can be used with a
    variety of applications.

    The most common form of captcha is an image file containing
    distorted text, which humans are adept at reading, and computers
    (generally) do a poor job. This module currently implements that
    method, as well as preliminary support for sound files.

The resulting entry would be:
