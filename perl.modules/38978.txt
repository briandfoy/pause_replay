Heh, that fits all the requirements of a good name, other
than the depth. :)

I'd leave off the Validate part and add features to the
module if people want more (sorta like Business::ISBN grew
to be more than just validating ISBNs).

Along the same lines, how about this (or variations):

   Identity::US::SSN

Aside from that particular name, maybe a String::ID module
could use them as plugins.  Just a thought.
