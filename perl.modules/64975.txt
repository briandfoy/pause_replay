The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::PopMX
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: A package for SNP data analyses
  userid:      POPMXTM (PopMX team)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    CPAN

  similar:
    Bio::PopGen

  rationale:

    Bio::PopMX is a package developed under the framework of Bioperl.
    It was originally designed as a complement to the Bio::PopGen module
    which is for general Population Genetic analyses. Bio::PopGen
    integrates many different aspects of Population Genetics data
    analysis, however it is not very suitable for large scale or
    genome-wide SNP data due to its design. Bio::PopMX on the other hand
    use simpler data structures (based on array of array) to contain the
    data, which is more efficient and arguably more intuitive for SNP
    analysis. This package now has developed into a versatile package
    with a big collection of modules dealing with basic data processing,
    modification, IO parsing, statistical computation, wrapping of third
    part analysis tools as well as graphic output.

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
