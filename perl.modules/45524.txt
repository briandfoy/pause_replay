The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Thread::Resource::RWLock
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Read/write locks for Perl ithreads (>=5.6)
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org, www.presicient.com/trwl

  similar:
    Thread::RWLock

  rationale:

    Thread::Resource::RWLock is needed to provide read/write locking
    capabilities to the ithreads environment. The existing
    Thread::RWLock is for othreads, has not been updated since 2001,
    uses obtuse method naming, can easily lead to deadlocks, and is too
    simplistic for robust/complex threaded apps.
    Thread::Resource::RWLock uses clearer method names, (i.e.,
    Thread::Resource::RWLock::read_lock() vs.
    Thread::RWLock::down_read()); supports nonblocking and timed locks;
    the ability to upgrade read to write locks, or downgrade write to
    read locks; supports both an instance object i/f, and a subclassable
    i/f; and eliminates the deadlock possibilities inherent in
    Thread::RWLock.

The resulting entry would be:

Thread::Resource::
::RWLock          adpOa Read/write locks for Perl ithreads (>=5.6)   DARNOLD
