thanks for that info. I just tried to twiddle the permission bits and 
discovered that primary maintenance had already be reassigned to PAUSE 
user GETTY (Torsten, added to CC). Given that he had never done a 
release, I sudo'ed into GETTY's account to give Bron co-maintenance 
permissions. Thorsten, Bron, please get in touch and coordinate.

Best regards,
Steffen
