i think there must be a better name for this, on two counts:

   Tk::MacCopy and Tk::MacProgessBar are Classic Mac stuff,
   so i don't think that name is descriptive enough

   What if other people want to extend these modules for
   other interfaces (Windows, etc?)

how about something like:

   Tk::Copy::Mac
   Tk::ProgressBar::Mac

which leaves rooms for

   Tk::ProgressBar::Win32
   ...

as well as meta widgets, although i don't know how you'd get
this stuff into Tk::ProgressBar.

i'm not sure how you would want to distinguish Classic from
Aqua though, unless you simply make Mac mean Classic and
Aqua mean OS X.

   Tk::ProgressBar::Mac    --> Classic
   Tk::ProgressBar::Aqua   --> OS X
