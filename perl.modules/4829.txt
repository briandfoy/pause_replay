Hi,

I would like to register as an author with PAUSE.  Here is the required info:

Name: David Huggins-Daines
Mail: dhd@pobox.com
Homepage: http://www.pobox.com/~dhd/
Preferred-User-ID: djhd

Stuff I plan to contribute:

Name                    DSLI  Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Festival::Client::Async RdpO  Festival client with blocking and non-blocking modes
Speech::Recognizer::SPX Rdch  Interface to Sphinx-II speech recognition system
Speech::EST             cd+h  Interface to the Edinburgh Speech Tools libraries
Audio::OSS              Rdcf  Interface to Open Sound System audio devices
Telephony::Phonedev     bdcO  Interface to the Linux Telephony API
Data::BinStruct         bdpO  Object-oriented access to binary data structures

The released speech and audio related modules (i.e. the ones listed
with 'R') are available at http://www.cepstral.com/source/.  They have
just recently been released to the outside world, so I can't really
point you to anywhere they've been discussed (although we have shared
them with some people on #perl IRC).
