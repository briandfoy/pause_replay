The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::SkipList
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Perl implementation of skip lists
  userid:      RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    N/A

  similar:
    Tree::* modules

  rationale:

    There needs to be a Perl implementation of Skip Lists.

    Actually, the module is already uploaded but I would like to
    register the name space.

    Even though functionally they look like trees (and the interface
    imitates some of the Tree modules), the Tree::* namespace is not
    appropriate since they are special types of linked lists, not trees.

    Note: I inadvertently submitted this with the name "split lists".
    Bad typo. Very bad. Also, I referred to them as "treeps" which is an
    altogether different structure.

  enteredby:   RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar  1 17:38:24 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

List::
::SkipList        bdphp Perl implementation of skip lists            RRWO
