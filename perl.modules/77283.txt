The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Task::Gtk2
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: install modules for working with the GTK2
  userid:      KIMMEL (Kirk KImmel)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I could not find another Task:: that dealt with the gtk2 libraries.

    This Task::Gtk2 would make developing and setting up Gtk2 with Perl
    that much easier by having to only install one module that correctly
    pulls in the dependencies with their proper versions.

    I got the idea from the ease of use of Task::Kensho

The resulting entry would be:

Task::
::Gtk2            adpnp install modules for working with the GTK2    KIMMEL
