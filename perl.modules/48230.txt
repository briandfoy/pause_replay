Subject: Module submission Catalyst::Plugin::Server
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, kane@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Plugin::Server
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Server extensions for Catalyst
  userid:      KANE (Jos Boumans)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace is meant to hold plugins for catalyst, that let it
    function as a specific server type (XMLRPC, SOAP, etc) alongside the
    traditional HTTP interface.

    Modules you would find under this namespace would include:

    Catalyst::Plugin::Server::SOAP Catalyst::Plugin::Server::XMLRPC

  enteredby:   KANE (Jos Boumans)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 11 10:26:56 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::Plugin::
::Server          bdpOp Server extensions for Catalyst               KANE
