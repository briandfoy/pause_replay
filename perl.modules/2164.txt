*>Feel free to make any changes to the Catalog database. The Catalog module does
*>provide a web interface to do this, but I think it will take a lot of
*>work. I am talking with the Catalog people about an API so we can automate

web interface bad, automation good :)

*>The site does keep a cache of uncompressed files.

Yes, but if I'm remembering right, the files are attached to the pid of
the httpd which gives it appx. 30 requests before dying and spawning a new
process. It doesn't seem to be making the most of these.

*>20k requests a day is not very many really.

No, but not bad performance for an U1/140 since most of the traffic
involves database queries instead of plain html. I've seen sites that do
horrible with less traffic. My point was that it should scale reasonably
well without too much trouble and be fairly easy to manage for mirrors.

*>Yes it probably will. If it really becomes a problem we can put some kind
*>of dynamic restriction on it.

Not a bad idea though it could either be implemented at the web server
level or the database, the latter is probably more reliable and more
portable. 

*>I think there are many ways of approaching this problem. I have just never
*>been able to decide which way to jump :)

The path of least resistance :)
