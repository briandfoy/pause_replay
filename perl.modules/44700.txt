I hadn't seen Perl::Squish, looks interesting (PPI looks really
interesting).

I'm ok with JavaScript::Squish. It'd be nice to have a general Data:: or
Text:: Squish to tie them all together someday, but I'm not too interested
in attempting that right now :-)

I'll get it renamed and back out there tomorrow or so.
Thanks!
