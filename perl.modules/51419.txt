You don't have to declare your attributes ahead of time to be able to
use their accessors and mutators.  Your basic AUTOLOAD setup.  The
modules I looked at all made you declare beforehand.  I don't always
want to do that.  I can't believe there aren't any but I didn't find
any under Class::.

I figured with the several dozen I found at CPAN I'd be in good  
company :-).
