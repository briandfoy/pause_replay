You're in luck.  I was able to connect your current email address to your
CPAN ID from this post from 2013.  :-)

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3D91753#txn-1306843

I've reset your secret email to your gmail one.  You should now be able to
request a password reset.

Welcome back!

David
