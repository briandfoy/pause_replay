is this a DBI driver?  from the description I would have thought it
would be something different.

Also, you can separate the name so the separate ideas show up
at different levels in the name, going from general to specific.
For instance, if this is really a DBD or something built on top
of one, DBD::mysql::Simple could be a good name (and you don't
have to say "mysql" twice).
