Hello, all.

I'm sure it was over two weeks ago that I submitted my original request for the root namespace IRC::Bot.  I recently applied for it again, hoping that maybe I goofed and I had messed up on the application.  Well, I goofed on a spelling error, and thought I was fast enough to stop, and hit back real quick before the POST completed.  I'm not faster than 1.5ghz, that's for sure, so I submitted it again, without coming to that conclusion till later.  So, I thought that I'd submit another namespace that's not root, thinking that maybe I'd get a quicker approval.  Well, I goofed that too, that's not what I wanted the namespace to be.  So instead of screwing something up again, I thought I'd just e-mail you and let you know that I'm an utter fool.  

My apologies, please, ignore the last three submissions from me.  I patiently await to hear your reply about my original submission of IRC::Bot.
