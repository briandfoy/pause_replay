The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Procmail
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Read procmail(1) log files.
  userid:      BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    CVS repository, irc

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module has already been submitted:

    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg10035.html

    It is available on CPAN, with full doc and tests; updates are
    planned RSN.

    I write to modules@perl.org again to ask two questions: - I finaly
    chose to use Log::Procmail, since it was the simplest and most
    straightforward name for this module. I can still change it to any
    of: Mail::Procmail::Log; Mail::ProcmailLog or Logfile::Procmail (see
    the mail linked above for the rationale). Should I?

    - I suppose it's perfectly normal that it's not in the module list
    yet: = Is this just due to a lack of time from the list maintainers
    (which is perfectly understandable, when one looks at the volume of
    mail exchanged on modules@perl.org)? = Or has the module a problem
    (namespace, or chapter maybe?) that prevents its inclusion?

  enteredby:   BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb 19 10:53:25 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::Procmail        bdpOa Read procmail(1) log files.                  BOOK
