Hi,

you may have seen my registrations for a couple of Lingua::Zompist::*
modules.

I'm also considering writing a helper module for those modules, which I
would probably want to distribute in one package with the other =
modules.

Basically what it would do is convert between different representations =
--
for example, Latin-1, UTF-8, etc. However, the "canonical" =
representation
(for the purposes of this module) is the font encoding of Mark =
Rosenfelder's
"Almea" and "Verdurian" fonts, which includes all the characters used =
in
transcribing several of the Almean languages, not all of which are even =
in
Unicode as precombined characters (for example, r-with-diaeresis). In
addition, the quasi-standard transcription Mark uses in his web pages =
uses
sequences such as "<strike>l</strike>" and "<u>s</u>" to represent =
certain
characters, and I would want to reproduce that. (Text in the canonical
representation will, if formatted with one of Mark's fonts, show the =
glyphs
used when writing those languages natively.)

So the conversion schemes would be largely homegrown, which (I believe)
prevents me from using Unicode::String or Unicode::Map8, which would
otherwise seem to be applicable. Therefore, I would like to write =
something
like Lingua::Zompist::Convert (or so), which would map between the
"canonical" representation and various character sets which could be =
used to
transcribe the original.

Now my question is: is that module name acceptable, and can that module =
be
put there? Or would you recommend I try to work with another module =
somehow,
and/or file the module somewhere else? I don't think it can really work =
with
anything else; it's pretty much a utility module only for the Almean
languages, and on the other hand, I don't think I can subvert an =
existing
conversion module which implements standards since this =
"quasi-standard"
character set I will be using is not widespread, and hence not =
implemented
anywhere else.

Cheers,
Philip
