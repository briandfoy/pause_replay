Using SCGI:: in general is fine.

::Server is generally for things that actually _are_ standalone servers 
in their own right. If you are creating a module used to accept and 
respond to requests, but there's isn't going to be some sort of 
SCGI::Server->new->run, then I imagine simply SCGI.pm would be fine.
