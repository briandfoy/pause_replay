     why:

    I'd like to create and contribute a module tentatively called
    "Directory::Fill". The general use case does what it says on the
    tin. It will also provide two abstract base classes:
    "Directory::Fill::Criteria" and "Directory::Fill::Fetcher". An
    example ::Criteria might be 95% usage as reported by
    Filesys::DfPortable and an example ::Fetcher might be an object that
    grabs .mp3 files.

    This module will be a generalization of a script I wrote to fill my
    mp3 player with random songs.
