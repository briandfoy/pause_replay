I've programmed in Perl, C, C++.  Done various large scale projects for Ford
Motor Company and a few in the Financial Industry.

I have a program written in C that parses CSV files (delimeter can be set)
and writes out equivalent XML structured document.  The program is complete
and is being used by mine and other companies in XML development and system
integration projects.  I can create on XS interface to this module.  I will
also be responsible for maintaining and documenting this module.

I've discussed this module with Matt Sergeant and he thought I should
register and submit to CPAN.  Not positive about the naming yet, but
somewhere in the XML namespace.  This module can be used as an extension to
parsing other file formats and generating equivalent XML structure.  I also
discussed with PerlXML mailing list.  In my understanding there are probably
ways around by using three different modules, but this is a base for other
files formats that can be transformed to XML.  I believe that this is very
important for the following reason.  I've worked with system integration
project for a while, and since XML is very much becoming a standard way to
communicate, this module can be used to transform any existing format to XML
without having to rewrite the entire program.  I've used it to link four
systems, each with different standards, buy using this module I was able to
use one single program that in fact used this module to read different
formats, transform to XML, and then use a common interface to update our db.
Please let me know and I can start writting the XS interface as soon as
possible.
