The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Alias
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: Comprehensive set of aliasing operations
  userid:      XMATH (Matthijs van Duin)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    #perlhelp (EFnet), perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Devel::LexAlias Lexical::Alias Alias Variable::Alias Array::RefElem

  rationale:

    It's called "Data::Alias" because it aliases data. No other
    top-level namespace seemed to fit better. "Alias" in various other
    namespace (including top-level) is already in use, and I couldn't
    think of any other name that didn't sound silly.

    There are other modules which do limited forms of aliasing (Alias,
    Lexical::Alias, Devel::LexAlias, Array::RefElem) or which emulate it
    using tie (Tie::Alias, Variable::Alias). However Data::Alias is
    unique in that it has aliasing equivalent for pretty much every
    copying operation in perl, and a simple and uniform interface.

    Given that 'alias' here isn't really a function but behaves more
    like a keyword, but none of the other interface styles match either,
    an option "s -- syntax extension" would have been nice :-)

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Alias           Rdcfp Comprehensive set of aliasing operations     XMATH
