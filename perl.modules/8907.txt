The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Properties
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: persistent properties
  userid:      IX (Brian Moseley)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    p5ee@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    this class is a perl version of java.util.Properties.

    we actually discussed it a couple of years ago on modules@cpan.org,
    and some folks thought Data::JavaProperties was a better name, but
    there wasn't a clear concensus.

    the module has had renewed interest on p5ee@perl.org, and the
    concensus there and privately is that Data::Properties is a better
    name, since we would like the "properties file format" to become
    standard for perl as well as java, to promote interoperability.

  enteredon:   Mon Nov 26 02:01:10 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Properties      bdpOp persistent properties                        IX
