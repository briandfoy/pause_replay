I have just finished polishing off my HTML::Munge module and wanted to check with everyone before I uploaded it.

Munge is designed to read HTML files with special Munge tags and turn them into HTML based on the rules in a translation table.  These tables can be files or one of the internal types.  The intent is to make creating different HTML formats much easier.  for example my work site has a text and graphics version.  I made a text and graphic translation table.  Then depending on how the files are called the user either gets pretty graphics or plain text.

I also included a small module HTML::Munge::Apache that interfaces Munge to Apache mod perl.  Using this module mhtml files can be accessed just like any other html file.

The module can be downloaded at http://members.xoom.com/stinsonl2/munge/

I mainly want to make sure this name space is ok.  I haven't seen it used but I don't want to step on toes.

Thanks.

I surely do hope that's a syntax error.
