    NAME Finance::Loan - Calculates monthly payment, interest paid, and
    unpaid balance on a loan.

    SYNOPSIS use Finance::Loan; my $loan = new
    Finance::Loan(principle=>1000,interest_rate=>.07,number_of_
    months=>36); # 7% interest rate my $monthlyPayment =
    $loan->getMonthlyPayment(); my
    $interestPaid=$loan->getInterestPaid(); my $balanceAfterPaymentn =
    $loan->balanceAfterPayementn(n);

    DESCRIPTION new
    Finance::Loan(principle=>1000,interest_rate=>.07,number_of_months=>36)

    Creates a new loan object. Ensure that interest_rate is a decimal.
    So, a 7 percent interest rate is .07 while a 14 percent interest
    rate is .14

    $loan->getMonthlyPayment()

    Returns the monthly payment on the loan.

    $loan->getIntrestPaid()

    Returns the total amount of interest that needs to be paid on the
    loan.

    $loan->balanceAfterPaymentn(n)

    Returns the unpaid balance on the account after payment n, if no
    additional principle payment on the loan is received.

    EXPORT

    None by default.

    BUGS

    None known.

    DISCLAIMER

    Calculations are presumed to be reliable, but not guaranteed.
