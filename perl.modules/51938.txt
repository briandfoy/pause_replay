The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::LST

  similar:
    Astro-Time

  rationale:

    Time::LST - Convert datetime representations to local sidereal time
    via Astro-Time

    From the POD:

    SYNOPSIS

    use Time::LST qw(filestat_2_lst time_2_lst ymdhms_2_lst); $path =
    'valid_path_to_a_file'; $long = -3.21145; # London, in degrees $lst
    = filestat_2_lst('mod', $path, $long); # or filestat_2_lst('create',
    $path, $long) $lst = time_2_lst(time(), $long); $lst =
    ymdhms_2_lst([2006, 11, 21, 12, 15, 0], $long); print $lst;

    DESCRIPTION

    A wrapper to a number of Astro::Time methods that simplifies
    conversion of a datetime array (such as returned by Date::Calc), or
    time in seconds since the epoch (as returned by time, or stat
    fields), into local sidereal time (in hours, minutes and seconds).
    Give a filepath to get the LST of its last modified time, or see
    what the LST is now. Essentially, you need to know the longitude (in
    degrees) of the space relevant to your time.

    -- Could these methods be incorporated in Astro-Time itself?
    Perhaps it's better for users of the Time pacakages to have their
    own tunnel to Astro-Time, and not complicate an already methodically
    heavy but consistent package.

The resulting entry would be:
