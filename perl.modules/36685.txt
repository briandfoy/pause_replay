Those sound like the words of someone who likes the utility and doesn't 
use Apache.  ;-)   These days, I only use Apache 2 so logmonster works 
great for me.  I'll let someone who is burdened with using those other 
web servers write the patches to extend it.

Heck, it'd be quite simple, just skip parsing apache config file(s) and 
stuff all your vhost info into the right hashref and you're good to go.
