I reported the bug. I discovered it when using this module for testing 
Test::SMTP. Now I see that the subject was incorrect (in the body of the 
message I say that AUTH LOGIN is broken :p)

I can offer to co-maint Net::Server::Mail::ESMTP::AUTH just for 
accepting patches (not active development) if the author doesn't appear. 
The PAUSE maintainers would just need to drop me a mail if there is 
interest :)
