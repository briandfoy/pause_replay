Some place where people are talking about perl or the problem domain,
say a newsgroup, a mailing list, a chat channel, a website where
discussions are going on. We do not demand that we have participated
in the discussion, but it helps to know that somebody besides you has
already spent a few thoughts on your work. In the old times it was
much clearer which places seem reassuring and which not, so feel free
to tell us you discussed it in on a seminar in Bangalore:-)
