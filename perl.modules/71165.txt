Subject: Module submission App::DualLivedList

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::DualLivedList
  DSLIP:       adpnd
  description: Determines if a module is dual-lived
  userid:      SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    I wrote this to end the confusion over whether a module is core and
    whether a module is core and dual-lived. I couldn't find a module
    that could do that.

  enteredby:   SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  enteredon:   Sun May  9 23:21:14 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::DualLivedList   adpnd Determines if a module is dual-lived         SKI
