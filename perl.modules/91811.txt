The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GnuCash::SQLite
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A module to access GnuCash SQLite files
  userid:      HOEKIT (Hoe-Kit Chew)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have considered Finance::GnuCash::SQLite - and will request that
    if GnuCash::SQLite is rejected.

    However, a root-level namespace seems more appropriate because: 1)
    GnuCash is a widely used open-source accounting package with plenty
    of functionality that other developers can add programmatic access
    to e.g. adding reporting functionality (GnuCash::Reporting), tax
    computation (GnuCash::Tax), etc. 2) Hopefully a root-level namespace
    will attract more developers to contribute to provide sorely needed
    programmatic interface to GnuCash.

    Back in 2010, the editor of LWN bemoaned the lack of programmatic
    access to GnuCash. (See http://lwn.net/Articles/387967/)

    As of 2014, little has changed in the Perl world. There are now
    python-bindings but its poorly documented. Hopefully, this may be a
    start for the Perl world.

The resulting entry would be:
