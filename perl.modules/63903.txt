Hi, While working on a Project for a Healthcare Insurance Provider,
    I have extensively worked with related X12 standards. I tried to use
    a module from CPAN a module called X12::Parser. However, I was not
    happy with the performance of the module and some bugs.
    Subsequently, I took initiate to develop an alternative X12 Parser
    which gives much better performance as well as eliminate some bugs.
    I tried to contact the author of the said module so that I could
    contribute the code to be incorporated in the author's or a new
    module namespace. However, I have not received an reply from the
    author.

    What I am proposing is that if some developers working in the
    Healthcare Industry want to own the further development of my work
    (the person needs to be working in Healthcare Insurance Industry as
    the work requires access to all the relevant X12 standards
    documentation which is pricy), I can contribute my code to the
    extent developed which is 90% complete and is debugged. The code
    requires one more higher level module to provide the wrapper and
    interface which is relatively simple compared to what has been
    developed. If someone is interested to take up what is being
    proposed, please contact me. I can collaborate with such author(s)
    to complete the work and make it available to the CPAN community. In
    fact there was a success story about the existing X12 Parser, from
    which the importance of this module to the Healthcare Industry can
    be assessed.

    Thanks
