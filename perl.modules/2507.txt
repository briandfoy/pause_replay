Hi,

I would like to register as new CPAN user to upload a module called
"GPG", which is an interface to gnupg. I know there is already two other
such interfaces for gnupg (GnuPG.pm and GnuPG::Interface), but they are
heavy to use and extend, have a lot of bug (and I get no feedback from
one author), and input/output are possible only throw filehandle (or,
crazy, GnuPG work only with filename...). My own GPG work with standard
$string. Actual version number is 0.01, but only because that's the
first public release, it work fine for me on different systems.


Name : Philippe Froidevaux
email : miles@users.sourceforge.net (or) pf@spin.ch
homepage : none.
user-ID on CPAN : MILES  (or PFRO if MILES is already used)

module description DSLI :
RdpO  -- Interface to gnupg.

Category :
GnuPG (like GnuPG.pm or GnuPG::Interface)
PGP
cryptography


This module has never been discussed on newsgroup or mailing-list, but
that's not my first Perl module (it uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker for
installation and test, has a POD description included, and a little
example). If needed, I will set a public CVS tree on sourceforge to help
maintain GPG.


Thanks !

Philippe.
