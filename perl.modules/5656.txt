Hallo Marcel,

only modules that are already registered in the Module List are in
that select box. A recent and not yet documented addition to the menu
on PAUSE is the item "Apply for namespace registration". It's the
ideal place for you to enter your modules.

Uploading via Neil's script is exactly the same thing as using the
form.

Uploading and registering are only very loosely coupled. You can
choose if you want to register early or late. Registering early may
help you or impede you, it's a personality and/or problem domain
related effect. Registering early has the advantage of early exposure
of the work in progress which may avoid duplication of effort. But
release-early release-often can achieve the same effect.
