Perhaps I misunderstand you.  This is based on DBI, in the sense that
it performs all database access through DBI.  If you mean that the
DBIx namespace should be used for classes that ISA DBI, then no, this
library does not meet that criterion.

While it uses DBI to perform all of its database calls, and the DBI
handle is available to users, this library does have @ISA DBI, nor
otherwise re-export the DBI methods.

What's it for?  Database access, or database administration?  The
perldoc on CPAN for the DBA namespace doesn't say what it's for, or
what DBA stands for in this context.

A search of the modules mailing list archives shows a proposal in 1999
for a DBA namespace in 1999 for database access, but since you said
"recently", I assume that's not what you meant.

The only module currently in CPAN (that I see) is DBA::Backup::mysql,
which would probably support the name "database administration".

But my library has nothing to do with database administration.  When I
said that "you list the columns of your tables/views", I meant that
you do that to tell my library how to operate.  The library itself
does not perform any CREATE TABLE statements or the like; it allows
you to simplify access to the data, not alter the schema.

So would an data access library like this belong under DBA?
