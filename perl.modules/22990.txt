From: tovod-everett@alascom.att.com ("Ovod-Everett, Toby")

I developed a module to make interacting with masks more pleasant (both =
generating masks from a list of constants, breaking the mask back into =
constants, and explaining the mask in terms of a minimal list of =
constants).  It was originally developed for use under Win32, so I named =
it Win32::MaskManipulation.  I'd like to release the code, but it occurs =
to me that there is nothing in it that is actually dependent upon Win32 =
- the code is 100% Perl and the concepts and approach apply equally well =
to any platform that uses constant masks that fit inside a Perl integer. =
 With that in mind, are there any suggestions for where it might fit =
cleanly in the module hierarchy?

Also, I'm working on a set of modules to be termed Win32::Security.  I =
grew frustrated with poorly-optimized or memory-leaking modules for =
doing work with permissions under WinNT/2K/XP, so I started developing =
my own.  I'm sticking to pure Perl code, using Win32::API to do all of =
my API work.  All of these modules (Win32::Security::DACL, =
Win32::Security::File, Win32::Security::Raw, and Win32::Security::SID) =
were developed to support a very useful utility for doing permissions =
enumeration on Win2K/XP machines.  It supports distinguishing between =
inherited and explicit permissions, as well as detecting situations in =
which the static permissions model has resulted in the inherited =
permission getting out of whack.  I'd really like to distribute the =
script with the module (since it serves both as excellent sample code =
and as a useful utility), and if it were a Unix module, I'd simply stick =
it in a Samples directory.  The problem is that most Win32 people use =
PPM to download modules, and that is only going to install code that =
goes into the INST_LIBDIR.  What I'm proposing is to stick PermEnum.pl =
into the Win32\Security directory.  I realize this isn't the proper way =
to do this, but it would make the script available to people who have =
installed the module via PPM without them having to go find the module =
on CPAN, find a copy of gunzip and tar, etc.  Thoughts?
