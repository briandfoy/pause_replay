The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Telephony::CTPort
  DSLIP:       Rd+Ol
  description: Computer Telephony card programming in Perl

  rationale:

    Telephony::CTPort encapsulates the functionality of a Computer
    Telephony (CT) card port in an object. A CT card is a PCI card that
    interfaces your PC to telephone lines. The ports look electrically
    like a regular telephone, but can be controlled via the PC. CT cards
    are used to build IVR systems, voicemail, Voice over IP systems etc.

    For example you can take the port off hook, on hook, record and
    play audio files, and collect DTMF digits using this module.

    The Telephony:: class already exists, and CTPort was the best name
    I could think of for a class that encapsulates the functionality of
    a CT card port.

    I have developed CT systems in many languages (C, C++ etc), but
    have found using Perl to be the fastest way to build CT Apps
