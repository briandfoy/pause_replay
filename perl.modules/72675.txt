How did you tar it though? Doing it within the directory is not the
same thing as tarring a directory. If you did it by hand, it's probably
not right.

If you are using MakeMaker, use

    % make dist

If you are using Module::Build, use

     % ./Build dist

If you still have trouble, send me your tarball and I'll look at it
manually.
