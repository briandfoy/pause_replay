The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Exits
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Preferable exit codes for programs
  userid:      BAT (Тимур Бакеев)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    sysexits.ph

  rationale:

    This is a very simple module, basically it just provides set of
    constants, that can be used as exit codes for programs. This
    constantsdescribed in the BSD standart header file - sysexits.h.
    This codes try to bring some meaning to exit values of the programs,
    and convension quite widely used by BSD programs, but most famous
    example is, of course, sendmail.

    There is a set of Perl modules and scripts, that supposed to
    interact with sendmail and other mailing programs. Right now, to
    indicate temporary failure they use cryptic 'exit 75' statment. More
    clear and verbose would be 'exit EX_TEMPFAIL'.

    Selection of Sys:: prefix is quite strightforward, as exit codes
    are part of system interface, and name of the module - 'Exits' -
    both reflects fact, that it about exit codes, and also, it refers to
    it's origin - sysexits.[hc] files.

    An alternative to this would be Sendmail::SysExits, as interaction
    with sendmail is the most frequent usage of this interface.

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::Exits           bdpfp Preferable exit codes for programs           BAT
