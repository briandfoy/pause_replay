The problem seems to be that brians Netscape-Bookmarks-0.92.tar.gz
does not contain a module Netscape::Bookmarks. So if someone instructs
CPAN.pm to install Netscape::Bookmarks, she gets your module instead.

The easiest solution would be to ask brian to add a
Netscape/Bookmarks.pm to his package. That's why I CC-ed him on this
reply.
