The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bayonne
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Perl interfaces to GNU Bayonne
  userid:      THALAKAN (Jason Spence)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    bayonne-devel mailing list

  similar:
    No similar modules exist at this time.

  rationale:

    GNU Bayonne is similar to other large-scale projects such as
    Festival and Apache, both of which have been granted their own
    namespace. There are several modules which will be interfacing with
    Bayonne using RPC, Bayonne TGI IPC, UDP messages, local files, etc,
    etc. There are also other non-interface modules to assist with
    automating common administration tasks for GNU Bayonne.

    As a result, it will simplify the archive to consolidate all these
    modules within a root-level Bayonne namespace instead of scattering
    them all over the different categories each individual module would
    belong to.

The resulting entry would be:

Bayonne           bmpOp Perl interfaces to GNU Bayonne               THALAKAN
