The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx
  DSLIP:       adhhp
  description: read data from La Crosse weather station
  userid:      ESM (Eduardo Santiago Muñoz)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Lacrosse_weather_stations@yahoogroups.com

  similar:
    Device::Davis

  rationale:

    Factors in my decision to name it Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx

    * There is an existing Device::Davis package for the (much)
    higher-end weather stations manufactured by Davis Instruments.

    * There also exists Device::WS2000::IO but I'm pretty sure it is
    not related to the La Crosse units. In any case I think it's
    important to include the manufacturer name in the module for
    differentiation.

    * The La Crosse 23xx line (2300, 2308, 2315, 2316, ...others...)
    all seem to share the same serial line protocol but the 35xx line
    does not. My module should be usable on existing (and future?)
    WS-23xx products, but will not work on other series.

    I considered the Weather:: namespace, but this module is hardware-
    and device-specific.

  enteredby:   ESM (Eduardo Santiago Muñoz)
  enteredon:   Mon Oct 29 01:24:52 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::LaCrosse::
::WS23xx          adhhp read data from La Crosse weather station     ESM
