  Hi all,
August the 8th I tried to contact Joe Yates by mail using the 
@virgilio.it address listed on search.cpan.org  and have received no 
answer; asking on module-authors, it seems others have tried in the past
and got no answer.

  I recently joined the PerlUNO SF.net project (Joe Yates is a member
of the project, albeit inactive), and we're ready to make the first
release of the OpenOffice::UNO module, so I'd like to be made 
co-maintainer of the module, in order to be able to release it to CPAN.

Best regards,
Mattia
