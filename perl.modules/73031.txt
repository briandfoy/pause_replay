Subject: Module submission HTTP::Sessioniser

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Sessioniser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Rebuild HTTP sessions from pcap streams
  userid:      EDECA (David Cannings)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Internal discussion at work

  similar:
    Uses HTTP::Parser, doesn't compete with it

  rationale:

    This code wraps a number of other CPAN modules (Net::LibNIDS and
    HTTP::Parser) to rebuild HTTP::Request/HTTP::Response objects from
    pcap streams.

    It is useful for all sorts of things including rebuilding webpages,
    summarising HTTP activity etc.

    There isn't actually any useful equivalent. Many tools (Wireshark
    etc) can generate a list of HTTP requests, but very few can tie
    together HTTP requests with the received response.

  enteredby:   EDECA (David Cannings)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 13 12:44:23 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::
::Sessioniser     bdpOp Rebuild HTTP sessions from pcap streams      EDECA
