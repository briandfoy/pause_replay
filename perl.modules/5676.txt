From: andreas.koenig@anima.de ((Andreas J. Koenig))

Today I'm gonna upgrade perl on PAUSE to either 5.6.1 or a recent
bleadperl.

I'll also change the name to pause.perl.org. Thas has been a CNAME for
many years already. But at the time I first dealt with SSL it hadn't
yet been, and that's why we're carrying around irrelevant old
hostnames. This needs to stop. You can start to extinguish the names
{p11,pause}.{speed-link,speedlink,kbx}.de everywhere they are
mentioned. This is even recommended as we can expect more continuity
from perl.org than most sponsors.

The Email address of the PAUSE processes will thus change to
upload@pause.perl.org and I'm trying to correct all references to it.

That will also result in a new SSL certificate and a new fingerprint
for the certificate.

Please be prepared for the changes to take effect shortly.
