Hi Dan,

>>> I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on =
resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.
>>>=20
>>> You are owner of the =E2=80=9Cpragmatic=E2=80=9D namespace, and have =
a =E2=80=9Cpragmatic=E2=80=9D module as part of your wildproto =
distribution, last released in 2003. This now conflicts with the =
=E2=80=9CPragmatic=E2=80=9D module, owned by BINKLEY.
>>>=20
>>> I noticed that your distribution hasn=E2=80=99t worked with any =

CPAN, and then your permissions on the =E2=80=9Cpragmatic=E2=80=9D =

Given I haven=E2=80=99t had any reply, I will go ahead and drop the =
PAUSE permissions at the weekend, but will leave the two releases of it =
in place, unless you say you=E2=80=99re happy for me to delete those as =
well.

Cheers,
Neil
