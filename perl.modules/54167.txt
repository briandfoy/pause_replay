The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Handler
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Catalyst plugin for Log::Handler
  userid:      PEPE (Christoph Buﬂenius)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Dispatch Catalyst::Log::Log4Perl

  rationale:

    This is a logging plugin for the Catalyst web framework. It uses
    the module Log::Handler as a backend. Previously, there hasn't been
    any Catalyst plugin which allows the use of Log::Handler.

    The related plugins Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Dispatch and
    Catalyst::Log::Log4Perl use the backends Log::Dispatch and
    Log::Log4Perl, respectively. In my opinion, if you only want to log
    to a file, Log::Handler has several advantages over the others,
    including support for line-wise flocking.

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::Plugin::Log::
::Handler         bdpOp Catalyst plugin for Log::Handler             PEPE
