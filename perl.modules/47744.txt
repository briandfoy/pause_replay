Subject: Module submission Devel::ObjectCount

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::ObjectCount
  DSLIP:       bdhfp
  description: Count number of objects in memory
  userid:      TBUSCH (Thomas Busch)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    Devel::Leak::Object

  rationale:

    An easy way to detect object leaks is to print out for each
    instantiated class the classname, the number of instances in memory
    and the number references. So far I haven't found any module that
    does just that in a simple and efficient manner.

    I wrote this module primarily for myself but since it could be
    useful for other perl developpers I thought I should make it
    available to everyone.

    Let me know what you think. Any thought is welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::ObjectCount     bdhfp Count number of objects in memory            TBUSCH
