The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LDAP
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Meta-directory interface to LDAP
  userid:      JSMITH (James G Smith)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    none at this time - may consider moving to sourceforge.net at some
    point (internal CVS being used at this point) - developer is a
    somewhat active member of the mod_perl list

  similar:
    Net::LDAP (basic LDAP interface)

  rationale:

    Net::LDAP & co. provide reasonable support of the LDAP protocol.
    However, code making use of LDAP must still be aware of the LDAP
    organization and meta-object types (employees, users, role accounts,
    administrative information, etc.).

    The LDAP::Directory, LDAP::Object, etc., modules (via the LDAP
    package) provide a consistent interface to an LDAP without the
    client script having to know how LDAP is organized - which branches
    people are in, ensuring consistent data across branches, verify
    data, etc.

    The LDAP:: modules are based on logic already written in PHP.
    However, the PHP application is being rewritten in Perl since PHP
    has too many limitations (namely namespace management, anonymous
    subroutines and closures). I would like to translate as many as
    possible of the low-level libraries such as this into Perl.

The resulting entry would be:

LDAP              cdphp Meta-directory interface to LDAP             JSMITH
