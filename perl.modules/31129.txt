     why:

    I have created a plugin for SpamAssassin called spamcopuri
    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/spamcopuri/), which checks urls
    that appear in emails against RBLs. I have been maintaining this on
    sourceforge for a little over a month and now some users are
    requesting I place this on CPAN. I will probably make CPAN the
    default means of distribution since its packaged as a Perl module
    and make installation easier for users as well as finding it easier.
