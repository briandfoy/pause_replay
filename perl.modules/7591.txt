Sure.  That's what I'm more interested in, to be honest.  You've
probably noticed me being pretty chatty since I joined -- I tend to
follow the policy that if I'm not sure whether it needs a response, I
respond anyway so they get a "Hi, I don't have a firm answer for you, 
but at least you heard back from us."

I would find RT useful for this.

OK, so can we recruit people with more tuits?  I realise that we want
people who are experienced in Perl, CPAN, etc, but I'm sure we could
find a couple who could spend an hour a week on it?

(I'm currently spending about an hour a week, usually on Sunday nights,
making a concerted effort to get back to people with opinions etc.  I
think I'm getting about 50% coverage, i.e. ideally I'd like to be able
to respond to twice as many, or twice as deeply.  So two more people
doing similar stuff might cover it nicely.)
