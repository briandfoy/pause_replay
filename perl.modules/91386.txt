I think the most sensible step, if no-one else is working on a similar
module, would be for you to adopt Dancer::Plugin::Passphrase and release
the Dancer2 version along side it.

I think James would be glad to know his work was being updated and used.

Make a request for COMAINT on the dist, I'm sure the powers that be will
grant it given that James is no longer able to "agree" it.

If it helps, as his friend, I agree to it on his behalf ;)

Cheers,
