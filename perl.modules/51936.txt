From CPAN/modules/04pause.html:

  <p>The automatic integration of your work into several <b>indexes</b>
  and directory trees is not always what you desire. If you want to
  <b>prevent propagation</b> to places outside of your directory, simply
  choose a filename that matches <b><code>/\d\.\d+_\d/</code></b>. PAUSE
  will leave such distributions alone: no readme will be extracted, no
  index will be updated, no symlinks will be created.</p>
