The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::vFile
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Parses vCard RFC2426 and vCal RFC2445 files
  userid:      JLAWRENC (Jay Lawrence)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Perl Module Authors, Perl Mongers

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    After several rounds of discussion on Perl Module authors and with
    several collegues we have decided that the Text:: name space is the
    best place for not only the general parser but also for the
    resulting objects it will create.

    We considered Business::, Data::, and Net:: - however the fit is
    significantly better with Text::.

    We will be registering Text::vCard and Text::vCalendar shortly.

  enteredon:   Mon May  5 00:41:00 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::vFile           adpOp Parses vCard RFC2426 and vCal RFC2445 files  JLAWRENC
