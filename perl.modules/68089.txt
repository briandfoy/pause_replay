The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DAIA
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Document Availability Information API
  userid:      VOJ (Jakob Voﬂ)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://purl.org/NET/DAIA and common library developer mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    Among other standard APIs used in library applications (Z39.50,
    OAI-PMH, OpenSearch, SRU/SRW, ATOM, unAPI ...) DAIA is the only
    public standard to encode and query availability information (for
    instance whether a book can be loaned now or later and whether there
    is an electronic edition). It is needed to connect library software
    components and for public lookup of availability status. The name
    "DAIA" is special and unique enough to distinguish as it was not
    used for any other technical systems so there will be no name clash.
    See http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/dist/DAIA for the current version.

  enteredby:   VOJ (Jakob Voﬂ)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct 16 09:29:29 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DAIA              bdphp Document Availability Information API        VOJ
