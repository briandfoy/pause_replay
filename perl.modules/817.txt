Hi,

I would like to participate on PAUSE to upload scripts and
modules following CPAN and GNU.


My name: Wolfgang Wiese
E-Mail: xwolf@xwolf.com
Homepage: http://www.xwolf.com
Prefered User-ID: XWOLF 

I plan to contribute some new perl-modules, like "we.pm", which I
created on my more or less famous webpage "Realm of CGI".

Current Module:
	Name	DSLI	Desc	
	web.pm	SdLpf	Several function in use of handling with CGI-request.

All my modules and scripts are free avaible at http://cgi.xwolf.com.
My module cannot and shall not replace modules like CGI.pm and HTML::Parser,
but they are made newbie-friendly, that means, also those folks
which want to learn out of them can use and learn out of them.
I tried to use no hacker-code.
(Many beginners on CGI/Perl-programming fail on it due to the fact,
that they have no idea of objectoriented programming. So here they find
examples for routines like in CGI.pm but with plain functions.)

Beneath the functions that are similar to cgi-lib.pl/CGI.pm, there
are several new functions that are in need of professionell CGI-Programming,
like a locking-function that works with atomar links instead of
flock(), which is failing accross system-boundaries and several
ckecroutines for Mailadresses, URLs and so on.


Regards,
  Wolfgang
