Yes, it should. Poor phrasing on my part, by "don't need to index" I meant
"don't need to go through the dist looking for files" - at which point
having no_index at all is unnecessary, and no_index-ing lib/ is just weird,
and therefore downstream didn't handle it right.

You didn't do anything *wrong*, you just did something sufficiently *odd*
to surface an insufficiently tested code path.

Now I've explained my mis-phrasing, does that make more sense?
