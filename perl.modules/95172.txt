Hi Ron,

Gearman package originally created by BRADFITZ contained:

lib/
=E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Gearman
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Client.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 JobStatus.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Objects.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 ResponseParser
    =E2=94=82=C2=A0=C2=A0 =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Taskset.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 ResponseParser.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Task.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Taskset.pm
    =E2=94=9C=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Util.pm
    =E2=94=94=E2=94=80=E2=94=80 Worker.pm

Regarding to the comment in
https://api.metacpan.org/source/DORMANDO/Gearman-1.12/lib/Gearman/Objects.p=
m
was Objects.pm not realy usefull at all. Therefore I replaced it by Base.pm=
, a
parent for Gearman::Client and Gearman::Worker. That's only change I actual=
ly
did on the hole Gearman package.

I guess missing permissions are a part of my request about maintainership t=
hree
days ago. See the mail below.

So to get rid of indexer faults I need permissions for all in Gearman packa=
ge
defined modules:
Gearman::Base
Gearman::Client
Gearman::Job
Gearman::JobStatus
Gearman::ResponseParser
Gearman::ResponseParser::Taskset
Gearman::Task
Gearman::Taskset
Gearman::Util
Gearman::Worker

BR,
Alexei
