Planning to contribute a PayPal payment module, and a Net::SSLeay add on
(unless the Net::SSLeay author wants to add my functionality in to his, I've
emailed him about it, but no reply as of yet.)  I've also almost finished a
module which does windowing for normal perl regular expressions on large
chunks of data that doesn't fit in memory.

I have some more code after this stuff goes up that I'd like to add as well 
but it hasn't been broken down into sensible modules yet.
