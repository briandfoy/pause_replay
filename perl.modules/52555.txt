I'd like to apply for co-maintainership of Pod::HtmlEasy.

The last response to a bug report was May 09 2004. There are presently =20
three active bugs reported.

Email to the present owner, GMPASSOS@cpan.org is not answered. I've =20
tried several times over the last three months. Mail to the address in =20
the POD, gm@virtuasites.com.br, is returned, as virtuasites.com.br is =20
returned, as the domain no longer exists.
