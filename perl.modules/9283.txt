Hi,

I've written an expression evaluator that I was thinking of contributing to 
CPAN.
This module has three main objectives:

    efficiency

    extensibility

    user-friendly error messages

It's features include:

    standard data types, arithmetic and boolean operators, conditionals, 
pattern matching

    user-defined data types

    user-defined binary operators and prefix unary operators

    over-loaded binary operators and prefix unary operators

    calls to user-designed perl functions

    a mode for syntax checking only

   optimized re-evaluation of expressions

    multiple symbol tables

I was thinking of something like MATH::EXPR_EVAL as a name, but it's a little 
long.

Thanks very much,
Scott
