I'm sorry for the lack of clearer communication. Yes, David is right but
I also meant the "authors" and "modules" slots in the pause rsync server
which can be accessed more efficiently than with ftp:

  % rsync pause.perl.org::
  PAUSE=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=09=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=
=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20
  authors=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=09
  modules=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=09
  scripts=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=09
  pausedata=20=20=20=20=20=20=09
  pausecode=20=20=20=20=20=20=09

The rrr code was born on pause in the two directories authors/ and
modules/. It was deployed separately for the two directories. The first
incarnation of the code was (and still is) based on hooks in the PAUSE
code such that every (relevent) change in the file system is reflected
in RECENT files. So when some file is uploaded, there is some hook that
cares for the necessary manipulation in some RECENT file. Likewise when
some checksum is calculated on PAUSE's behalf there is some call to a
hook that makes sure that the according RECENT file is updated. Same for
deletions, etc.

Since CPAN is more than the two directories authors/ and modules/ we
needed a different approach on the cpan master site. Instead of having
hooks we opted for an inotify based mechanism as provided by linux.

On the CPAN master site we have inotify running, on PAUSE we have hooks.
If in doubt, hooks are better than inotify but they need more human
attention. Comparing the RECENT files in PAUSE and the cpan master will
help finding out where a bug is coming from.
