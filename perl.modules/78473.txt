Dear CPAN admins,

I would like to start the standard procedure of getting a co-maint status o=
n=20
http://metacpan.org/module/Text::MediawikiFormat . The module has some acti=
ve bugs on=20
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=3DText-MediawikiFormat , =
which haven't been addressed and there hasn't been a CPAN release from the =
author since 2008 (=20
http://search.cpan.org/~dprice/ ) - over three years ago. I tried to reach =
the author on derek@ximbiot.com on 6-November-2011 (over a week ago) and di=
d not get an answer. I'm now trying with his company's contact information =
address ( info@ximbiot.com ).=20

Once I get co-maint, I'd like to work the closing the open bugs, add an opt=
ion
to create more valid and semantic XHTML 1.1, and document the way in which =
the
module can be used to generate XML and DocBook/XML. And naturally, I will
continue to maintain the module into the future, for everyone's benefit
(including my own, because I need to use it).

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish=20
