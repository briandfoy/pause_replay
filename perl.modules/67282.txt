The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Backup::Email
  DSLIP:       cdpOl
  description: Back up configuration files to your email.
  userid:      WSDOOKADR (Petrea Corneliu Stefan)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    http://perlhobby.googlecode.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm writing this module because sometimes I have to re-install the
    OS on my machine and I loose key configuration files and I'm really
    tired of that happening. So what I've decided is to write an
    application that will zip/7z these and send them to my e-mail. Also
    I'm providing a GUI interface which you can use in order to restore
    from a specific point. It works with IMAP email and can be
    configured through a YAML file. It will work under both Linux and
    Windows.

The resulting entry would be:

Backup::
::Email           cdpOl Back up configuration files to your email.   WSDOOKADR
