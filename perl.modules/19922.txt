Why, of course yes.  There are plenty of perl programs nowadays
containing nothimg more than a couple declarations and Inline::C blocks,
and they are still perl.

Correct.  If that is the design goal, then I still think Pod::OO is the
better name for it.

Depends on Mark's objective.  Again, if he allows these PODesque
mark-ups (especially L<>) in OODoc, many people will apply the "if it
looks like POD, and it smells like POD..." argument.

If Mark goes with this route, then OODF or OODOC or MarkDoc are equally
applicable, since it's something that has no relation with Pod, and
(to borrow Mark's C =3D> C++ metaphor) warrants a completely different
name like "Java" did.  So the question is... What does Mark wishes to
achieve: syntactical compatibility, or radical departure?

Thanks,
