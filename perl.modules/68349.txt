The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::AttributeCloner
  DSLIP:       cdpOl
  description: move attributes values to new class
  userid:      SETITESUK (Andy Brown)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    http://github.com/setitesuk/MooseX--AttributeCloner

  similar:

  rationale:

    I was unable to find something relating to doing this. The
    intention is to be able to copy of the populated attribute values
    from a class into another class which has those attributes without
    the need to do the following

    my $newclass = New::Class->new({ attr1 => $self->attr1, attr2 =>
    $self->attr2,... });

    This is primarily coming out of producing a pluggable pipeline
    system where we need ways of propagating through data from the
    initial command line all the way to objects which launch jobs.

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::
::AttributeCloner cdpOl move attributes values to new class          SETITESUK
