(second attempt, as my isp's smtp relay seems to have been blackholed)

hi,

also sent to comp.lang.perl.modules, of course. Now, unless
http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html lies, this is the place to ask.


a quick sanity check here. Am I deluded to think that Net::Nsca would be a
top name for a module that implemented netsaint's Nsca protocol[1]? Is it
acceptable to include 1 or 2 utility functions, e.g. reading the relevant
local config file, because they're integral to the protocol actually
working?

P // just trying do do things right. and get listed in the big famous
module list.

[1] It's a way of sending remote status checks over the network
