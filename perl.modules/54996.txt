You know, that's the sort of information you should have included in
your original message, as my response perfectly illustrates my point
:)

Still, most people are going to associate "library" with "a file of
perl code". You have to give it more context for CPAN. Instead your
world in makes perfect sense, but outside your world it's just a
generic name.

Is there a top-level namespace you could use that would give it some context?
