The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Mail
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Test framework for email applications
  userid:      SKUD (Kirrily 'Skud' Robert)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa, IRC (#perl/#xp on irc.infobot.org)

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module makes it easier to test applications that use email as
    part of their functionality. It's like Test::Cmd or CGI::Test in
    that it provides a domain-specific way of doing standard, simple
    tests.

    Nothing of this kind currently exists in CPAN. This is new
    functionality. The only similarity to existing stuff is that it's
    basically a wrapper around Test::More.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Mail            bdpOp Test framework for email applications        SKUD
