I've found a ownership discrepancy in the dual-life module autodie.=20
1. Fatal is a part of autodie on CPAN.
2. In order to update the module, you have to have ownership of all =
modules it distributes.
3. Paul has given me access to all modules except Fatal, which shows not =
to be owned by Paul, but by P5P.

As a result, Paul cannot give me co-maint to upload autodie because one =
of it's modules are not owned by him.=20

modules@perl.org has been cautious to resolve these sorts of issues with =
modules owned by P5P. They have directed me to the p5p mailing list to =
get a resolution. In this past when it's been brought up, there's been =
no clear consensus on who speaks for the P5P account with respect to =
PAUSE ownership issues.=20

I propose that the current reigning pumpking should be qualified to make =
these decisions. Does anyone have an objection to that policy?=20

Ricardo: I propose that in an event like this, where a dual life =
maintainer clearly has primary on most modules in the dual-life distro, =
that any new modules that accidentally show up as owned by P5P get =
primary ownership transferred to them. i.e. Change PJF to be the primary =
owner for Fatal. This will ease future co-maint grants on these modules. =
Would you be ok with that?

Thanks,
Todd
