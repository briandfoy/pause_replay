Unfortunately, the current OpenGL namespace is legacy - there's not much of 
a chance for me to change it... although I may do so when I port to Parrot 
for Perl6.

In any case, I'm just happy that PDL has adopted POGL (regardless of naming 
convention) as it's standard OpenGL interface - and very appreciative of 
Chris' efforts to help me get 0.57 out the door!

Please feel free to let me know if there are all issues or new POGL features 
you'd like to see - Bob
