These would be for "seeing which dimension is largest":

$img->isvertical() will return true if the image height is larger than 
its width
$img->isvertical(1) will return true if the image's height is larger 
than its width or they are the same.

these would be for "rotation methods of GD" based on the above methods:

$img->vertical() will rotate a horizontal image clockwise so that its 
vertivcal (or do nothing if its already horizontal or square.
$img->vertical(1) will rotate a horizontal image counter clockwise so 
that its vertivcal (or do nothing if its already horizontal or square.

same principles applies to the corresponding horizontal methods

$img->issquare() will return true if height and width are the same

Does that make more sense? I'll have to POD make all of that clear :)

Thanks for your time :)
