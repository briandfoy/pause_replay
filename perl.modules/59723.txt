have you tried other means of contacting the authors than RT? Not all 
CPAN authors use their FOO@cpan.org address. If you did, we should wait 
for some time in case the authors are on vacation or similar. I have 
much older unfixed tickets in the PAR queue, yet I'm still active.

While I'm at it: Back when I contacted you about your many registered 
(or uploaded empty) modules which you never implemented, you said you'd 
upload implementations as soon as possible. That was something like half 
a year ago. Many of the registrations and place-holder uploads are still 
untouched. Please fix that or delete the registrations or place-holders. 
CPAN should not be abused for placeholders for a long time.

Best regards,
Steffen
