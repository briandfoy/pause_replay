The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SMS::API
  DSLIP:       RdpOd
  description: Sends SMS using paid servers eg.Goyali.com
  userid:      GOYALI (abhishek jain)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms, CVS repository, etc.

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will be a common API for distributing the SMS to
    various receipients specified using various servers like Goyali.com,
    Clickatell.com and many more. This module will be different from
    others as this will be distributing only to paid servers, hence
    there is reliability . Also this will perform the additional task of
    getting the delivery report also. NOTE:This combined functions is
    not given in even by the paid Service providers in their API's
    distributes. As this will be easy to use as compared to that given
    by paid SMS providers themselves hence i expect a great use of this.

    NOTE: IF possible please give me a root namespace called 'API' as i
    also intend to add other APIs to the script as well. eg. API::SMS
    for SMS and API::etc for other API of other purposes which i
    develop.
