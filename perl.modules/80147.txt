The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Walk::Prune
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A way to say what should be removed
  userid:      JANDREW (Jed Lund)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jandrew/Data-Walk-Extracted

  similar:
    Data::ModeMerge

  rationale:

    This is a Moose Role that adds functionality to the
    Data::Walk::Extracted Class. The intent is very similar to the
    Data::ModeMerge module but the subtraction work is done by defining
    the difference between to data references rather than using
    functional commands on the data.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Walk::
::Prune           bdpOp A way to say what should be removed          JANDREW
