Johan and/or modules@perl.org,

What is the "official" best way to manage a module which may have
different people acting as release managers over time?  It seems
like the only current way is to just have the release manager upload it
under their own CPAN id.  

This seems bad to me... currently CPAN allows anyone to upload anything
with any name, so I (SKUD) could upload (for instance) an LWP module
with a higher version number than the current one, and it could cause
all kinds of problems.  However, it would be fairly obvious that I'd
done something bad, because someone would fairly rapidly realise that
I'm not actually the maintainer of that module and spank me.  Even that
-- relying on a social fix to potentially dangerous exploits -- is
pushing our luck, but at least it's *something*.

If a module often changes hands, perhaps every couple of versions, then
how will anyone know whether they can trust any given version? 

The situation becomes yet more complex when we have a family of modules,
any of which could be maintained by different people over time.
Wouldn't it be better to go to authors/id/R/RE/REEFKNOT/ and be able to
see all the reefknot-related modules in one place?  (We currently have
Net::ICal, and will shortly have Net::ITIP, Net::IMIP, and a number of
Reefknot::* modules).

Is there any effort underway to address these and other CPAN issues?
Can we expect a "CPAN 2" sometime?  Or do we need to start a push for
such a thing?

K.
