Subject: Rename Module

From: jerry@hedden.us

I would like to rename the module:
     Math::Random::MT::Net
to
     Math::Random::MT::Auto

My original concept was to auto-seed the randon number generator via
data obtained from the net (random.org).  I have expanded on that idea
to auto-seeding from multiples sources including the net (random.org
and hotbits) and local devices (/dev/random and /dev/urandom).
