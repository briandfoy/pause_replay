The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Infinite::Sequence
  DSLIP:       cdpha
  description: Manipulation of infinite sequences and sets
  userid:      SIZUR (Eugene Grigoriev)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    http://code.google.com/p/perl-infinite-sequences/

  similar:
    Set::Infinite

  rationale:

    Infinite::Sequence lets you easily define and manipulate infinite
    sequences and sets. Evaluation happens when you need the elements of
    the sequence -- lazy.

    Infinity part of the namespace is more important as finite
    sequences are already easy to generate and manipulate.

    Optimization is dropped in favor of formality and clarity. For
    example, redefinition of Naturals will affect Odd as (SET Odd) =
    (SET Naturals) - (SET Even) and Even = Naturals * 2. Unfortunately
    this is compounded by Perl's poor arithmetic speed making this
    package good only for rapid prototyping or recreation.

    Set::Infinite does not let you define and manipulate sequences at
    all.

The resulting entry would be:

Infinite::
