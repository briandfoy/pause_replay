The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Mediawiki::Client
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: api and cli for contributing Wikimedia pages
  userid:      MARKJ (Mark Jaroski)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)

    http://www.wikitravel.org/en/article/User:Mark/Wix

  similar:

  rationale:

    Mediawiki is a software package for running a WikiWiki website, and
    is perhaps most promenently used by http://www.wikipedia.org and
    http://www.wikitravel.org.

    There has been discussion for some time on the Wikipedia and
    Wikitravel websites about the need for one or more tools to allow
    contributors to view Mediawiki content offline, to make changes, and
    to contribute the changes back. While a lot of this talk has been
    centered on the viewer I thought I'd tackle the problem of
    downloading and contributing content easily, handling updates,
    conflicts, etc. So I've created a module and a wrapper script that
    provide a cvs-like interface for content from Mediawiki run sites.

    I'm proposing that projects related to Mediawiki live in the
    WWW::Mediawiki, and that this one in particular should be
    WWW::Mediawiki::Client.

    This allows for this and any other contribution related to
    Mediawiki to be easily distinguished from other WWW related
    contributions.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Mediawiki::
