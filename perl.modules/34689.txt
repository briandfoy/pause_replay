The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Process::Perf
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Shows performance counters for a process
  userid:      RPAGITSCH (Reinhard Pagitsch)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32-PerfMon

  rationale:

    I think it is a usefull tool to monitor the performance of a
    process. In the past I searched the Internet about tools to get the
    data and had no success. So I wrote a script which starts the
    process and than I had the problem how I can capture the performance
    via perl. I found Win32-PerfMon, but it was to complicated to me,
    therefore I wrote this module using the XS file of Win32-PerfMon.
    Thank you Glen Small.

    At this time I use a selfmade C-program in my office to get varios
    performance data of a spezific process, but I will rewrite my script
    soon to use the new module.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::Process::
