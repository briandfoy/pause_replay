The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Genezzo
  DSLIP:       adphg
  description: extensible database with DBI and tie support
  userid:      JCOHEN (Jeffrey Cohen)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    SQL DBI

  rationale:

    Genezzo is extensible, embeddable database that supports a partial
    DBI interface and tied hashes for persistent storage. It currently
    supports a limited subset of SQL, but the alpha code already has
    such nice features as indexes, constraints, and tablespace support
    (ie a table, or even an individual row or column, can be split over
    multiple datafiles on disk).

    Jeff Zucker did something somewhat similar a couple years back -- a
    sourceforge project called perldb which combined SQL::Parser and
    DBD::RAM. It seems to be defunct.

    I don't think it belongs under SQL::, because SQL is a particular
    query language, and in principle, the underlying engine could
    provide data storage and query execution support for multiple
    languages, like XQuery/Xpath. I'd rather have parsers as plug-in
    modules.

    It's not really a good fit for DBI/DBD either, since it's not an
    interface to a database, it's an actual database. Though to respect
    that API there should be a DBI::Genezzo module with full DBI
    support, versus the limited support in the prototype now.

    It's a fairly large module right now (about 30K lines, 30+ files),
    and it's not yet complete. The base version is just a
    single-threaded, single user database, but I'd like to place under
    packages under the namespace that you could download to extend its
    capabilities: support multiple users with locking and concurrency,
    transactions, replication, etc. Other modules might be user-defined
    data types, index types, authentication and encryption.
