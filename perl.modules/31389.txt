The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Perfmon
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: A perl interface into Windows Perf Monitor
  userid:      GLENSMALL (Glen Small)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32::PerfLib

  rationale:

    I've used Win32::PerfLib a number of times, but I've found it hard
    to use, and there have been things that I've been unable to do with
    it. I've found getting a single counters value very long winded, and
    it's not possible to get a counters explain string from the OS etc
    ......

    Win32::Perflib is good, don't get me wrong, I just feel that I can
    improve on it, and rather than extending the existing module which
    some people may be very happy using, I'd rather introduce another
    version, which will give people another option.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
