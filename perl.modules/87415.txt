The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HackaMol
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Moose Library for Molecular Hacking
  userid:      DEMIAN (Demian Riccardi)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    none yet

  similar:
    PerlMol and Chemistry::Obabel are two libraries predating Moose with
    narrower focus (cheminformatics) that have some overlap with
    HackaMol. BioPerl has some overlap with Hackamol, but is specialized
    to biological molecules.

  rationale:

    The HackaMol library was originally developed to manage quantum
    chemical studies of mercury chemistry that resulted in two
    publications (one in Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation and
    the other in Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters). The core,
    written in Moose, has been refactored from that work to be made
    publicly available. The HackaMol library enables users to build
    simple, yet powerful scripts for carrying out computational work on
    molecules at multiple scales. This is where this library differs
    significantly from PerlMol which is tailored more to
    Cheminformatics. The molecular object system organizes atoms within
    molecules and seeks to provide intuitive attributes and methods that
    may be harnessed to coerce computational chemistry through a common
    core. By using Moose, I have been able to create a sophisticated
    molecule object system (I think so anyway!) that is surprisingly
    powerful and flexible. Chemistry::Obabel provides C++ bindings to
    the Open Babel library, which is slightly trickier to install than
    typical CPAN modules. HackaMol extensions will use Open Babel and
    may use or port functionality of PerlMol.

    My plans:

    I would like the library to be organized into two regions:
    HackaMol, the core that contains classes for molecules, and
    HackaMolX, the extensions, such as HackaMolX::PDBParser, a parser
    for protein databank files, and HackaMolX::Calculator that use the
    core. The three major goals of the core are for it to be
    well-tested, well-documented, and easy to install. The goal of the
    extensions is to provide a more flexible space for researchers to
    develop and share new methods (that may not be well tested, well
    documented or easy to install). The library will be maintained on
    GitHub and released to CPAN as soon as I can finish writing the
    announcement paper describing it.

    The namespace is inspired by that of Moose itself. So this is a
    request for not one, but two namespaces: HackaMol and HackaMolX
