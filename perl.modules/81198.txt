     why:

    I'd like to upload a module under the namespace Games::Mafia. The
    module will perform the logic necessary for playing the party game
    Mafia (See
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)#Basic_gameplay). The
    main game will be a Games::Mafia object, which will hold all the
    information about the game. The game will also hold information on
    and manipulate (and so depends on) player objects of the package
    Games::Mafia::Player::*, * being whatever the player's role is (and
    Games::Mafia::Player being the base package).

    I searched CPAN for "mafia" and the various names the game goes
    under and couldn't find anything, so I assume I'm not reinventing
    the wheel here (in terms of implementation, anyway).
