I'm not sure if Paul, the author, has emailed in or not. I haven't heard
from him so I wanted to email in and see what the status of things are. I
did send the author an email, but he didn't get back to me. I'm also
including a forward of my message to him.

Thanks!

I'm forwarding you an email I received from Matt Trout after mailing
modules@perl.org.

If you're okay with giving me co-maint on the modules I listed out, he said
that all you'd have to do is reply to him/modules@perl.org with message:
"I'm ok with this being done" and he'll take care of it from there.

If you can get him to simply reply to this list saying "I'm ok with this
being done" then I'm happy enough to go click the buttons.
