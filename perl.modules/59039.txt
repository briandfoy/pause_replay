Request to register new user

fullname: philip r brenan
  userid: PRBRENANA
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I already have a PAUSE account (PRBRENAN) but have forgotten my
    password, and I do not know where the request new password feature
    is sending my requests for new passwords. They are not arriving at
    yahoo.com which is where I think I had them directed. Ple\se update
    my pause account PRBRENAN to my new email address:
    philiprbrenan@gmail.com
