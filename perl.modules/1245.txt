Thanks; everything seems to work now (although I think a better
solution would have been for me to cname lugh to lush - a much cooler
name :).

What should I do to register the following into the module namespace?

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Solaris::ACL   bdcO  access Solaris ACLs			  IROBERTS

It wasn't completely clear to me whether the prefered order was to
first register the module in the namespace, and then upload, or to
first upload, and then register in the namespace.

Thank you,
