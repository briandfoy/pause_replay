I think it does quite well. There is a changed_on date and this is
either the approval itself or a later change.

This would be a second source if we need it.

With low hanging fruits I meant things like "Bleach" which I remember
became "Acme::Bleach" later so can be removed without asking anybody.
There's more that I can resolve from memory.

Good plan.
