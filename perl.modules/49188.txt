You're correct and I apologize for the way that came off.

What i was referring to was that since Olivier said he was extremely  
busy and it sounded like the thought of handling it was going to be  
too much i wanted to outline a quick way to fix it with all info so  
that he wouldn't have to spend any time looking up any info :)

I do very much appreciate everyone's attention to this matter and  
would like to thank Andreas for your help and Olivier for an  
excellent module!

Sorry for not wording my phrases very well, I do that when I'm  
anxiouse ;)
