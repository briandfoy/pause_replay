Personally, I'd either ask the author to work inside the Cometd 
namespace itself with his blessing (something like Cometd::Client) or 
otherwise something like WWW::Cometd or possible event Net::Cometd... 
maybe...

But if you can work with the Cometd author and find a home inside of 
there, it would probably be ideal.
