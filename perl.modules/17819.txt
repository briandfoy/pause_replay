The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::EMI::Client
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Provide a Client to send SMS msgs to an SMSC
  userid:      SCHAFFTER (Gustav Schaffter)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::EMI (Beta - to be discontinued)

  rationale:

    Well, the name already exists. Almost.

    JOCHEN has already uploaded several beta releases of Net::EMI.pm
    and I have helped him with some patches to his module. He never
    formally registered the name space, though.

    Since JOCHEN doesn't have the time to maintain the module, and
    since he no more have access to an SMSC, he has agreed to me taking
    it over. (I'm currently co-maintainer of Net::EMI.pm)

    I propose to name the new module Net::EMI::Client.pm to make it
    possible to implement Net::EMI::Server or some such in the future.
    (Client and server functionality will be very different and should
    be separated. A common 'library' module will exist for shared
    functionality.)

The resulting entry would be:

Net::EMI::
::Client          bdpOp Provide a Client to send SMS msgs to an SMSC SCHAFFTER
