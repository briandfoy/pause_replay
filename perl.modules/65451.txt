The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SnitchD
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: Network monitoring framework
  userid:      AAYARS (Alex Ayars)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    TBD

  similar:
    Jifty?

  rationale:

    SnitchD (Snitch Daemon) is a large OO framework for monitoring
    network services. It began life in house at the organization I work
    for as a configuration wrapper for Nagios, but it grew in scope, and
    is now a fully fledged monitoring application in its own right. It
    no longer has anything to do with Nagios, though it serves the same
    function Nagios once did for us. It has actually assimilated five
    disparate Nagios instances and a plethora of other legacy monitoring
    tools, bringing our organization's network monitoring under a
    unified system.

    SnitchD's codebase is large, consisting of many components. In
    addition to performing the job of network monitoring, a complex
    subsystem for dispatching pager alerts is included. A nice graphing
    frontend is another piece. Overall, it is a complex machine. As
    such, I believe it should reside in its own namespace.

    SnitchD's parent project is OP, which I've also submitted a
    namespace registration request for. SnitchD's various components
    consume lots of stuff from CPAN.

    I mention Jifty because it seems similar in concept, but I have not
    used it. SnitchD has been under development for nearly 5 years
    in-house, and there weren't a lot of other options at the time of
    its creation. Today, it's grown quite a bit, works well, and I've
    been encouraged to open source it.

    Thank you again for your consideration.
