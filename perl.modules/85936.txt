     why:

    I would like to contribute perl society. I am using perl on win32
    over 30 years. I am not a professional programmer, but architect. I
    write a small utility, automated-daily-processing with perl at
    first. And write a lot of tools for work day by day. Of course,
    probably, it's difficult to realize these things without CAPN.
    Although I have recieve many benefits from CPAN, but not contribute
    yet. I would like to carry out requital of a favor. I have the
    self-confidence which has stacked the know-how well using perl on
    win32. I think now the time.
