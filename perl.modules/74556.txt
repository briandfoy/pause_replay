CPAN has no control on uploading it, and it was never "allowed into existence".

Util:: is -not- a sanctioned top level namespace and we don't want it to be.

There is no central control of CPAN - all we can do is ask people to behave
reasonably.

This is me, asking you to behave reasonably.

Util:: is far more egotistical than KAN:: - KAN:: is "i'm not sure what the
best name for this is so I'm going to use my CPAN id to make a unique
proposed name" - Util:: is "I'm going to pollute a different global namespace
on CPAN rather than think about which one is right".

Please also delete and rename the existing ones.

The more modules in Util:: the more likely it is that somebody in future
will make the same mistake of thinking that it's somehow a "sanctioned"
namespace.

I would, honestly, automatically ignore any module starting Util:: on a
CPAN search since if the author doesn't care enough to pick a real name
I don't trust them to care enough to have written useful code.

So I'd suggest that both for our piece of mind, and for a better, happier
life for your contributions, you rename your existing modules.

Once you've deleted the Util:: versions, please feel free to ask this list
or me directly for naming suggestions with a description of the modules'
purposes. Your current descriptions mostly just seem to be slight expansions
of the names you've already chosen which makes it hard to give you
useful suggestions.
