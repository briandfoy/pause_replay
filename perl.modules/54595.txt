I would like to invite comments on a new module,
(tentatively) named HTML::Dashboard.

This module tries to achieve spreadsheet-like formatting 
for HTML tables.

Rather than having to build up an HTML table from data,
row by row and cell by cell, applying formatting rules at 
every step, this module allows the user to specify a set 
of simple rules with the desired formatting options. The 
module will evaluate the rules and apply the formatting 
options as necessary.

The following features are supported:

- User-defined formatting of first, last, even, and odd 
	rows or columns.
- Conditional formatting, based on the contents of 
	each cell.
- Sorting (on any column or combination of columns, 
	with user defined sort-order).
- Pagination of the data set.
- Definition of ``views'', i.e. restriction of the set of 
	columns shown.
- User-defined column captions.
- On-the-fly formatting and collating of the data.

You can view a set of examples at:
	http://www.beyondcode.org/projects/dashboard/gallery.html

and the POD at:

Best regards,

		Ph.
