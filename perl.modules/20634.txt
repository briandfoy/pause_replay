This is incorrect.  To wit:

    require Locale::Maketext::Lexicon;
    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon->import({
	de => [ Gettext => 'hello_de.po' ],
	fr => [ Gettext => 'hello_fr.po' ],
    });

Is, of course, run-time instead of BEGIN stage.

A wrapper around the ->import interface is easy to write, FWIW.

I'd be happy to modify my documentation to indicate the ->import
convention.

*nod* That's among my TODOs.  I'd be happy to see your implementation.

I'm ambivalent.   Sean, any opinions?

You missed that there is no canonical source for that sort of
information.  For example, 'zh-cn' most probably should not map
to GB2312 -- their national standard is GB18030, and the de facto
encoding is GBK.  Also, most en-us documents are written with ISO-8859-1
(or ISO-8859-15) in mind, not us-ascii.  Also, Shift-JIS shares the
usage with EUC-JP, neither are 'best default encoding' in all contexts.

It's already sent.  I was without network connection for a few days.
