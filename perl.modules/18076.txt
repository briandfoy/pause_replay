Hi all,

I'm shortly going to release the source of some of the modules we (Sun) ship 
as part of Solaris to CPAN.  I have the necessary legal approval to release 
these under the Artistic License, and my intention is to ship exactly what 
is in the Solaris source tree - I have written the Makefile.PLs in such a 
way that they will work both as part of the Solaris build process and as 
'stand-alone' CPAN modules.  The reason I'm doing this is so that customers 
who want to install their own perl can still use the Solaris-specific 
modules we ship with the OS.  These modules will be supported by Sun in 
exactly the same way as they are at present, as part of the OS.

The initial set of modules I'm going to release are related to Solaris 
resource management and accounting.  The namespaces below are exactly the 
same as we use when we ship as part of Solaris:

Sun::Solaris::Task		- Access Solaris Tasks

Sun::Solaris::Project		- Access Solaris Projects

Sun::Solaris::Exacct		- Access Solaris Extended Accounting
Sun::Solaris::Exacct::Catalog
Sun::Solaris::Exacct::File
Sun::Solaris::Exacct::Object
Sun::Solaris::Exacct::Object::Item
Sun::Solaris::Exacct::Object::Group

The 'DSLIP' for ::Task and ::Project is:

M - Mature.  Shipped as part of Solaris 9.
m - Mailing list - more on this below.
c - Heavily XSUB-based.
f - Functional interfaces are used.
a - Released under the Perl Artistic License.

The 'DSLIP' for ::Exacct is:

M - Mature.  Shipped as part of Solaris 9.
m - Mailing list - more on this below.
c - Heavily XSUB-based.
h - Both functional and OO interfaces are used.
a - Released under the Perl Artistic License.

At the moment the Solaris-related CPAN modules I have are all under my 
(ABURLISON) account on CPAN, I'm wondering if it might not be better to set 
up a seperate account that isn't tied to me - 'SUN' 'SMI' or 'SOLARIS' come 
to mind as suggestions.  We already have a 'perl-bugs@sun.com' mailing list 
that we could use as the contact point.

Already on CPAN are the Solaris::Kstat and Solaris::MapDev modules.  A more 
up-to-date version of the Kstat module is shipped as part of Solaris 8/9, 
and I intend to release that as Sun::Solaris::Kstat, and decommit the older 
version.
