Subject: Module submission DBIx::Report::Excel
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, dmytro@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Report::Excel
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Creating Excel reports from SQL statements
  userid:      DMYTRO (Dmytro Kovalov)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    DBIx::Report::Excel's goal is to make creating reports in Excel
    from databases easy. It's aimed at SQL developers and/or DBA's who
    don't know much about Perl programming. I.e. most of the information
    needed to create Excel file is provided directly in SQL statement
    (script) itself.

    If SQL script contains multiple statements, resulting Excel file is
    formatted as multi-page spreadsheet with each result set on it's own
    worksheet.

  enteredby:   DMYTRO (Dmytro Kovalov)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr  7 03:21:35 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::Report::
::Excel           bdpOp Creating Excel reports from SQL statements   DMYTRO
