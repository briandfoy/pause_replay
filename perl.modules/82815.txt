Hi Ron,

I think there are two separate relevant topics here. Your volunteering 
for doing PAUSE admin work, and:

As for the specific subject matter, since there seems to be some 
complexity, could you do me a favour and summarize what is supposed to 
be the final, correct state of things? Which of the involved authors 
should have which types of permissions? That would make it infinitely 
easier to fix things up for you.

As for doing PAUSE admin work, please give us another couple of days to 
get back to you. Right now, we have a loose agreement about who handles 
what (seems to be roughly "David Golden handles user registrations, 
brian handles module registrations, I handle co-maint/take-over 
requests, and Andreas handles all the gnarly cases that require the 
mastermind"). We need to discuss a bit internally what changes to make 
if any.

Best regards,
Steffen
