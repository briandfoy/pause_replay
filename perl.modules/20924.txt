Dear Modules

I have two new modules, DBIx::CodeKit and DBIx::BabelKit.

Before 'make test' can succeed the user needs to set up
the database schema for the universal code table that
they use and also set up the database login and password
to access those tables.

As a result, the automated CPAN test always fails and
that looks bad.

Should I:

1.  Leave things the way they are, always failing
    automated testing.  Is this why my modules
    are not yet listed on search.cpan.org?

2.  Make a t/test.t that prints "1..1", "ok 1"
    which will succeed if the module parses
    and move the real regression test script
    to postinstall/test.t ?

Thanks for your advice!
