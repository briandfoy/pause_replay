G'day everyone on modules@perl.org,

I'm currently putting together a module that uses dive tables to 
calculate maximum no-decompression dive times for recreational SCUBA 
divers, which are very useful when planning dive trips.  However, I'm 
having a bit of trouble finding an appropriate name for the module.

Currently there don't appear to be any other diving related modules on 
CPAN, nor even any general 'sport' related modules that I could find, so 
I'm somewhat at a loss as to what the module should be called.

I've been informally developing the module with the name 
Sport::Dive::Tables, but I'm not at all eager to create an entirely new 
top-level namespace (Sport::) on CPAN.  As such, I'm hoping for module 
name advice -- what should the module be called?

Any feedback, ideas, or questions are appreciated.

Many thanks,

	Paul
