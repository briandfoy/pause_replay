Hi modules@,

I've been contacting some authors with distributions for which there are 
patches available but who haven't applied the fixes for a long time. 
I'll CC modules@ with some of those mails so I can make the releases for 
the authors if they are/stay lost.

Note that I'm not overly eager to hijack people's distributions. In 
fact, I wouldn't mind giving away some of my own ;)

Cheers,
Steffen
