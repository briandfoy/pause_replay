The trouble with "abandoned" is that it implies someone can take it over.

In most of the deprecation cases it has been the case that the module is 
cleared dead or broken, and that something else it much better.

So you aren't looking for new maintainers as you are killing it off.

That said, I imagine if someone CAN'T remove a dep on it, maintaining is 
still a better option.
