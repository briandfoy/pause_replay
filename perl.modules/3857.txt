And how do I hook this subroutine into Makefile.PL so that typing "perl
Makefile.PL will insert the needed lines into the Makefile?  Or do I need to
add another step to the normal installation procedure?

I don't like using /usr/local/etc/http-webtest either, but I don't think it
is appropriate to install a subdirectory structure in
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/HTTP - this seems reserved for .pm files.  At
least /usr/local/etc/http-webtest will persist even after an upgrade to perl
v 6.0.  The only problem with that directory would be if another app uses
/usr/local/etc/http-webtest, which seems unlikely.  Or is your point that
even the mere presence of a subdirectory in /usr/local/etc give MYSQL
problems?

HTTP::Webtest only works on Unix and porting it to other OSes is more work
than I (or anyone else, I suspect) would be willing to take on.  Good point,
though, about using File::Spec
