I pondered this in the original submission 
(200404022055.i32KtEF1024122@pause.perl.org). I don't think Net::* is a 
good place for them. Yes, SDP is used in a Networking environment, but 
SDP doesn't actually *do* any networking itself (like MIME for example) 
and Net::* is typically reserved for Internet clients and servers.
