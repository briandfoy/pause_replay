Dear CPAN mongers,

Some time ago I requested a registration for the Net::DNS::Zone::Parser module
namespace (see 
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2004-03/msg00307.html )

I have not yet seen the module being registered. Maybe that is because
a previously registered namespace (Net::DNS::Zone) does not have code
uploaded yet(!). Maybe because the entry was not created yet.

For Net::DNS::Zone::Parser I would aprreciate an entry since it
is a prerequisite for Net::DNS::Zone and for some other software
that I am currently developing (e.g. www.kolkman.org/dnssec/)


The Net::DNS::Zone::Parser code is available via search.cpan.org (see
http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Net%3A%3ADNS%3A%3AZone%3A%3AParser&mode=all
) but it would really be useful if perl -MCPAN -e "install
Net::DNS::Zone::Parser;" and varieties thereoff would work.

Could you be so kind to attend to the registration?


Regards,

-- Olaf Kolkman
