The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Music::Tag
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Music Tag Info and Repair
  userid:      EALLENIII (Edward J. Allen III)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module, and other like it, were designed to deal specifically
    with Music. They use various resources, such as Amazon, MusicBrainz,
    the tags in the file itself, to get information about music. Because
    of this, I wanted to use Music instead of Audio (it wouldn't know
    what to do with a Podcast, for example, except read the MP3 Tags).

  enteredby:   EALLENIII (Edward J. Allen III)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 24 03:52:34 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Music::
::Tag             adpOp Music Tag Info and Repair                    EALLENIII
