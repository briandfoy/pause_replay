The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NLP::Service
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: a RESTful service for Part of Speech tagging
  userid:      VIKAS (Vikas Naresh Kumar)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    https://github.com/vikasnkumar/nlp-service

  similar:
    Lingua::EN::Tagger

  rationale:

    The Lingua::EN::Tagger is not good enough nor does it get updated
    often.

    NLP::Service, internally uses NLP::StanfordParser, which wraps
    (using Perl) Stanford University's Java NLP solution (which is
    GPL'ed). Stanford's NLP solution is one of the best and with the
    most accurate results.

    NLP was chosen for Natural Language Processing. Stanford's NLP
    solution supports Chinese and German as well, which the module aims
    to support in the near future.

    NLP::Service makes loading Java objects a one-time on demand thing,
    and makes requesting part of speech tagging more easily accessible.

    The users can run this as a separate process and make GET/POST
    requests to get part-of-speech tagging for their sentences. This is
    infinitely scalable as you can run as many of these as you want
    since they use the input models in read-only mode.

    It makes it easy for scripts that parse lots of data get
    part-of-speech tagging with minimal effort.

The resulting entry would be:
