The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Parser::Generic
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Generic and very fast XML parser generator.
  userid:      BANG (Andre Garcia Carneiro)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    sao-paulo.pm, perlmonks and others perl comunity sites

  similar:

  rationale:

    The reason for the 'Generic' part, is because the users don't have
    to worry about what paradigm that will be used to parse some XML.
    The user just have to worry about how he wants to configure the
    parser, passing parameters like 'root tag', and 'target tag'.
    Besides, the user have to say to module what is in XML that
    represents the structure that user wants that to be loaded, and some
    particularities about data treatment( after the parsing ). So, the
    system have to load all of this configuration and create a Perl
    structure for each element for tag, then uses Moose + Class::MOP to
    construct the object with the data and meta-data from the Perl
    structure.

    For this, the parser uses 'XML::SAX::ExpatXS' like an 'parser
    engine', and generates SAX handles and other stuff(more details in
    documentation) automatically. This gives to user the freedom to
    choose how he wants to receive the data, without worry about SAX
    works.

    Other reason for the 'Generic' part, it's the fact the XML parsers
    can be easyly added by a plug-in. If you don't like
    XML::SAX::ExpatXS, you can just change the parser by another one.

    It's more a 'parser generator' than simply a 'parser' itself. But
    can be interpretated like an parser because it does do many
    transformations and manipulations on data from the 'real parser
    behind', and returns data in a uniform(but free) way for user.

    The XML part it's auto-explained.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::Parser::
::Generic         cdpOp Generic and very fast XML parser generator.  BANG
