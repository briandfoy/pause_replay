Hi Sebastian, =46red, and Matt,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m tidying up distributions=
 that have shared first-come ownership, since PAUSE tries now to not let =
this happen =E2=80=94 it maintains the permissions profile on the lead mo=
dule, regardless of who releases (in the past the releaser would get firs=
t-come on newly added modules).

You each have the first-come permission on one of the modules in the Clas=
s-DBI-Sweet distribution, and there=E2=80=99s a large number of co-maints=
, again not the same on each module.

SRI did the first release, then MSTROUT did some, then MRAMBERG, and most=
 recently PHRED.

It hasn=E2=80=99t had any releases in the last 9 years, so maybe none of =
you are that interested in maintaining it, but I=E2=80=99d like to resolv=
e the ownership, and I=E2=80=99ll also reindex your last release PHRED (i=
t looks like at some point you didn=E2=80=99t have co-maint on Class::DBI=
::Sweet::Topping, and so the entry for that module in the index refers to=
 an older release).

The two obvious candidates to have all first-comes are SRI, because he di=
d the original release and still has first-come on the lead module, or PH=
RED, because he did the most recent 3 releases. Another option is to give=
 it to ADOPTME, if none of you are interested=3F :-)

As a default, I suggest PHRED, just so the ownership matches the name on =
the most recent release, so if someone does want to adopt it, the person =
they=E2=80=99re most likely to contact can give them co-maint.

Cheers,
Neil
