PRINCE DESMOND OKOTIEBOR ETETE
OGONI PALACE
OGONI  KINGDOM.


I WISH TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU. I AM PRINCE DESMOND
OKOTIEBOR ETETE. THE NEXT HEIR TO THE THRONE OF THE
OIL RICH KINGDOM OF THE OGONI COMMUNITY. I HAVE A HUGE
AMOUNT OF MONEY PRESENTLY IN THE PALACE.THE FUNDS WERE
REALISED FROM OIL ROYALTIES THAT WAS PAID TO MY LATE
FATHER BY THE MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANIES THAT ARE
DRILLING OIL IN OUR KINGDOM.

DUE TO SOCIAL, POLITICAL ECONOMICAL REASONS THE
PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN POWER IS PERSECUTING OUR KINGDOM
BECAUSE OF OUR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, SOCIO-POLITICAL
FIGHTS AND OUR AGITATION AGAINST SEIZING OUR LANDS BY
GOVERNMENT.

AS A RESULT OF OUR KINGDOMS OPPOSITION TO THE PEOPLE
IN POWER, THE FERDERAL ARMY WAS SENT TO OCCUPY OUR
KINGDOM. MY LATE FATHER THE KING AND OUR COMMUNITY
SPOKES PERSON AND ENVIRONEMNTALIST; AUTHOR KEN SARO
WIWA  WAS KILLED IN THE COURSE OF THE ARMY’S BRUTALITY
AND OCCUPATION. CONSEQUENTLY THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS OF
THE KINGDOM HAS AGREED AND DECIDED THAT THESE FUNDS
MUST BE INVESTED ABROAD IN ORDER TO SAFE GUARD THE
FUTURE OF THE OGONI KINGDOM. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
KNOW THAT THIS HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS IN THE PALACE.

I THEREFORE SOLICIT YOUR ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION IN
ASSISTING US IN GETTING THIS FUND OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
YOUR PERCENTAGE SHARE OF THE FUNDS WILL BE MADE KNOWN
TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST TO ASSIST
US. 

YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE, FAX AND MOBILE PHONE NUMBERS
IS REQUIRED SO THAT I CAN CONTACT YOU IN ORDER TO
ADVICE ON HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET THIS FUNDS OUT OF
THE COUNTRY WITH YOUR COOPERATION. PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR
ASSISTANCE AS A FORM OF HUMANITARIAN SERVICE TO THE
KINGDOM. PLEASE SEND YOUR RESPONSE ON THE RECEIPT OF
THIS MAIL. ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP THIS BUSINESS
CONFIDENTIAL.

I URGENTLY AWAIT YOUR E-MAIL.

HOPE TO MEET YOU SOON.

BEST REGARDS,
