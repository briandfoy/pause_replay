The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UWO::Student
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: Represent a UWO Student
  userid:      FREQUENCY (Jonathan Yu)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    User::Identity and related modules

  rationale:

    I will be uploading a series of modules designed for manipulation
    of information specific to students, faculty and staff at the
    University of Western Ontario (UWO). These modules are specific to
    UWO and probably aren't of much use elsewhere.

    For example, we have a directory service for students and faculty
    that was developed in-house. As such, it lacks a standard API. It is
    not currently used by any other college or school to my knowledge.

    I contributed a module formerly called
    WebService::UWO::Directory::Student, which is designed to look up
    students using the UWO Directory system. UWO::Student allows me to
    cleanly represent a student object.

    Currently, User::Identity is not quite a correct fit for
    UWO::Student, because there are many rules for students not
    implemented. For example, student numbers at UWO are exactly 9
    digits long, with most of them beginning with the digits "250 3__
    ___" - I am looking into this to ensure that the module is
    consistent with the conventions at UWO. I will, however, be looking
    into developing UWO::Student as a subclass of User::Identity.

    This will also serve to facilitate easier searching for
    UWO-specific modules, since many of them will not be related to Web
    Services and yet still related to UWO. We have a *lot* of
    nonstandard tools here and there which were developed in-house.

    As noted above, the module is in its infancy (alpha stage), so the
    interface may change (particularly if it begins to use
    User::Identity as a base class).

The resulting entry would be:

UWO::
::Student         adpOb Represent a UWO Student                      FREQUENCY
