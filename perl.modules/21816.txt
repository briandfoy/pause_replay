Butting in as a partisan observer here, you're not being as helpful to
this list as you think you are.  It took me a little time to realise
that you were originally drawing attention to a clashing upload of
Test::Tester (now Test::Tech).  Since you didn't attach an error
report I'd assume that only Crystal was likely to know that with the
context you supplied.

Now, as far as I see a non-conflicting version was released the day
before you sent this second mail, with the small glitch that
Test::Tech still refers to itself as Test::Tester within the pod[0].  Of
course it's hard to tell when any of the other exchanges happened due
to both of your MUAs failing to attribute very well.

I'm glad that the new module is now available and isn't tripping over
anyone else's released code, I now hope that we can get on with
getting on.
