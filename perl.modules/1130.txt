Hi,

I am involved in the PIKT project, which is a powerful
cross-UNIX-platform system for administering, controlling and securing
a heterogenous group of UNIX machines (whew!).  You can read more
about it at:

  http://pikt.uchicago.edu/pikt/

I am about to start writing a Perl module which will facilitate
communication between PIKT and Perl scripts, and give Perl scripts
which include it some extra features native to PIKT's built-in
scripting language.  I have discussed this on PIKT's development
mailing list and people were interested.

This will be my first CPAN contribution, so I need a PAUSE ID.  Here
is the required information:

Name:     Dave Lorand
Email:    davel@src.uchicago.edu
Homepage: http://www.src.uchicago.edu/~davel/

Preferred PAUSE ID: DAVEL
Second choice:      DORJE

DLSI for the PIKT-Perl module: id??
<=44-character description:    a Perl interface to the PIKT system

I would like to use PIKT:: as the package namespace.  If this is not a
good idea for some reason, plase contact me to discuss a good
categorization - PIKT is a little hard to categorize.

Thanks in advance,

Dave
