I tend to agree with the WWW::DHL namespace for the following reasons:
- It's an interface to a web site (seems to be screen scraping).
- It's dhl.de.
- Perhaps it's because I'm German and seeing "DHL" immediately tells me
what it's about.
- Business::Shipping is specific to UPS/USPS as Sebastian said. It's
also *much* bigger. I guess it would be a lot to ask for implementing
anything similar for DHL. Probably impossible because DHL doesn't offer
the same information. Business::Shipping is also not just about tracking
(as you noted above). So putting this more limited module in
Business::Shipping::* would only be confusing since it's unrelated.

I guess something like WWW::DHL::Tracking may be more descriptive, but
most similar web-site-scraping modules don't add further information
than where they're getting the info from.

Just my 2c. I had already approved the namespace (for the reasons
above), let me know if you want me to change the registration.

Cheers,
Steffen
