search.cpan is NOT directly integrated with PAUSE.

Like most of the parts of "CPAN" as a whole it's a standalone system 
that periodically consumes the index and does work.

So once you upload it can take up to 24 hours to syncronise with all the 
various different bits of CPAN.

Think of it like DNS, takes a while to propogate outwards.
