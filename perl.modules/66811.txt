Yes, all registrations before Jul 8 around noon GMT are lost. I have
not identified the bug yet but I'm pretty sure it has something to do
with the resetting of the counter every quarter of the year. Before
Oct 1st I will have to either find the bug or implement a session
backup system so I can reconstruct lost sessions or refrain resetting
the counter at all or whatever I can come up with. It's one of the
highest tasks on my radar but at the moment no tuits.
