Well, screw it. Apparently he's been hit by a bus or something.

It'd be nice if you'd correct the mistakes I pointed out in your description
but at this point, I can't really complain about you uploading.

I don't think DBIx::Lite is a very good name though - maybe something like
DBIx::StructuredQueries or ... I dunno. ::Lite just makes me think "great,
another unimaginative author who can't spell" and having had a quick look
at your docs, you're neither unimaginative not particularly hard of spelling
so that doesn't seem suitable ;)

However, resubmit this under whichever name you think best and I'll approve
it.
