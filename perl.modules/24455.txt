The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graphics::EPS
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Creation of Encapsulated Postscript Graphics
  userid:      WIHAA (Wilhelm Haager)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    PostScript Simple

  rationale:

    The proposed package (version 3.00 just completed, prior versions
    already uploaded but not registered yet) facilitates the generation
    of Encapsulated Postscript Images. it is the basis for other
    packages: - Xyplot for drawing line plots, area plots, scatter plots
    and bar graphs, already completed, proposed namespace is
    Postscript::EPS::Xyplot - a package for easy drawing simple shapes
    like flags (stars, moons, bars,triangles), under development - a
    package for drawing circuit diagrams (consisting of resistances,
    transistors, amplifiers etc.), in planning stage

    Beyond comparable packages, EPS has some additional core features:
    - very flexible, as any method, which is not declared, is translated
    via AUTOLOAD into the respective Postscript Command; thus any
    postscript command can be called as an EPS method - EPS images can
    be drawn into each other; thus, an EPS image can be built up by
    other EPS images or other objects like Xyplots. - Making color
    gradient fills are supported - Any Postscript code can be included
    verbatim with the method 'rawcode'

The resulting entry would be:
