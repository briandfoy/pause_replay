This has been bugging me for a while.  Basically, modules@perl.org seems
like sort of a black box.  I send messages it to it and it seems that they
go to some list of people (Andreas, G. Barr, J. Pritikin, K. Starsinic,
???) and then sometimes I get a response and sometimes not.  Note, this
has nothing to do with the messages I sent earlier today (I'm not _that_
impatient).  Rather, this has to do with messages I sent way long ago
about the Exception & StackTrace namespaces.  I see this sentence,
"Generally a lack of response can be taken as acceptance of the module
name being proposed," on the 04pause page but I really doubt that's what
happened in regards to my earlier request.  Heck, I wouldn't give myself
the Exception namespace so I wouldn't expect anybody reading this to do so
either!

Anyway, what I think would be most useful would be some info on CPAN
(perhaps on the 04pause page) listing the following:

1.  Who reads this list (I know anyone can read the archives but who gets
it mailed to them)?

2.  What do those people's responsibilities consist of (particularly of
interest if different people do different things)?

3.  What to do if we get no response (give up, resend the message with
more information, start our own parallel CPAN where we control all the
namespaces.  Hmm, MyCPAN! ;) )?

Yes, I know everyone who reads this list is busy but then maybe you just
need to get some more help.  I am not the first to grumble about this list
and frankly I think it sometimes is a bit of an impediment to getting more
involved in contributing back to the Perl community, which is why we all
want to put stuff on CPAN anyway (that and the glory of it all, I
suppose).

And finally, would it be possible to enable read-only subscriptions to the
list?

I'd like to follow the traffic as from time to time queries similar to
mine come up (exceptions, to name one) and I'd like to discuss these with
the authors.  For example, maybe everyone interested in exceptions could
form a mailing list, get some standards together and come back with a
better proposal for a CPAN namespace.  However, regularly fishing through
the archives is a terribly inefficient use of my time and generally I
don't see stuff til way too late.  Deleting a bunch of messages is much
easier.


Thanks,

P.S.  If this message generates no reponse at all I'll just have to cry ;)
