     why:

    Sybase::Metadata Now under development is a new perl module I am
    probbaly going to name Sybase::Metadata. Here is a summary of the
    features it will offer:

    * Retrieve objects definitions including existence checks *
    Retrieve table definitions into well defined records for easy
    manipulation * Search through Sybase metadata by object or overall
    by: o Object Type o Overall - through all metadata Note that this
    search includes object/column names AND procedure, view and trigger
    text. So effectively one can supply a pattern to simply 'search
    through all metadata. But the search does NOT reach into any data
    itself at all. * Other functions TBA when the package is
    finalized/released.

    The main point of this package is to allow programmers to perform
    the same functions as are typically available in commercial DB
    browser tools such as DB Artisan, rapid SQL, etc. But it extends
    their functionality with a powerful search feature. One can use this
    module in a normal perl program or use it as a means to construct a
    CGI GUI offering DB metadata browsing and searching features.
