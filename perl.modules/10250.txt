Hello,

  I've uploaded the OpenGL::Script module that provides script
  functionality for OpenGL and I need to upload the patched OpenGL
  module also. How to include these modules into the offical modules
  list? And, how to register as alternative the OpenGL module
  maintainer?  Sorry, if it is described in the 04pause.html. I didn't
  find any clearly description of these processes, just recomendation
  to email to module@cpan.org

Thank you,
