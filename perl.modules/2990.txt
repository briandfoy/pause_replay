PAUSE adminstrators-

I'd like to register. Given your instructions off of www.cpan.org I believe this
is all you need, no?


* your name 

	Stephen J Sprague


* your email address 

	stephen.sprague@msdw.com


* your homepage if you have one 

	http://www.spacelab.net/~sprague


* your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9 characters long, all uppercase, letters only. 
  One dash allowed. 

	SPRAGST


*  a description of what you're planning to contribute 


	Sybase-object_info-1.0     Rdpf    Pull table attributes from sys tables 

	*Simple* module that queries syscolumns and systypes and returns hash with the
	table/field attributes like col order, col type, col usertype, col precision 
	etc.


	Sybase-Xfer-1.0            RdpO    Transfer data between sybase servers
	
	Fairly robust module to facilitate the transfer of data from one Sybase
	server to another. Can supply 'where clauses' and specify to 'auto delete'
	records in target table. Hooks for perl callbacks on errors. 'source' can
	be another Sybase table, any valid SQL string, or a Perl sub.
	
	Uses Sybase::DBlib. 


*  It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have 
   discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was 
   at least a little bit of interest. 


	In an environment where more than server exists, usually at a minimum a
	test server and a production server, but sometimes when it is necessary
	to build a data mart from many different servers it's a boon to have a
	module that can transfer data every which way possible. Plus the capability
	to intercept data and change it if desired and all driven by command
	switches.

	I use it at my company quite often and many people have wished they'd have
	known about it sooner. So I figured I'd share the wealth with the
	whole perl community.

        Yeah, I know. if I'd used DBI we'd be able to transfer data between different
	makes and models of servers. I gotta crawl first before I can walk...
