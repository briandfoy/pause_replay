The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NSR::Server
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Legato Networker Interface Bundle
  userid:      ICK (Ian Stanley)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    will be in comp.lang.perl.modules source currently being developed
    at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lnetworker

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    As far as i can see the modules used for interfacing to and
    supporting commercial software appear to placed as a root namespace.

    Why is it called NSR - this is for historical reasons. All the
    command line binaries are of the form nsr?????

    Modules currently under devlopment include * NSR::Server *
    NSR::Client * NSR::Jukebox * NSR::Device * NSR::Directive *
    NSR::Group * NSR::Pool * NSR::Schedule * NSR::Stage * NSR::Tape *
    NSR::Util Do i have to register these individually?

    The intention is to produce a bundle as well as the individual
    modules

The resulting entry would be:

NSR::
::Server          cdpOg Legato Networker Interface Bundle            ICK
