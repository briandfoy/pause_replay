The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Stream
  DSLIP:       bdhhp
  description: Stream a data dump to a filehandle
  userid:      YVES (Yves)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Data::BFDump Data::Dumper Data::Dump

  rationale:

    Data::Stream is a total rewrite of Data::BFDump. The name change is
    due to a completely new interface, and the addition of functionality
    which streams the output to a filehandle instead of constructing it
    in memory and then returning the total dump, (and user complaints
    that BFDump is annoying to type :-). This means that the memory
    overhead of dumping using Data::Stream is signifigantly lower than
    any of the other perl serializers.

    Data::Stream does a breadth first traversal of the object being
    dumped, but this pass is for analysis only. A second depth first
    pass is required to actually output the structure. This two pass
    approach means that Data::Stream can correctly handle a number of
    edge cases that none of the other existing serialization modules
    currently can. Extra effort was put into ensuring that structures
    with readonly and aliased elements are dumped correctly.

    Other module names I considered were Data::Streamer
    Data::Dumper::Streamer and Data::Serialize and also preserving the
    BFDump name. After discussions with various people from Perlmonks
    the consensus was that Data::Stream was the preferred choice.

    regards yves

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Stream          bdhhp Stream a data dump to a filehandle           YVES
