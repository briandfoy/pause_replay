Hi Mauro,

   (disclaimer: I'm not a member of the modules@perl.org cabal, I've just
been temporary recruited to help with the massive amount of email. So
caveat emptor. :-) )

	I'm not sure what you mean by the perldoc and the class downloadable files, 
but for a pretty thorough step-by-step set of instructions on how to upload a 
module to CPAN, I recommend you to take a look at perlnewmod 
(http://perldoc.perl.org/perlnewmod.html). This document should lead you 
through the process much clearly and easily than I probably would. Buuut if 
you still have questions after having read it, don't hesitate to poke me back 
and I'll try to answer them. :-)


Joy,
`/anick
