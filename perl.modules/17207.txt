it looks like CPAN_VERSION is the problem.  CPAN.pm does not
know which version is which.  the package defines a $VERSION,
so i do not see why CPAN.pm wouldn't see it.

the module is registered to you in the Modules List, but PAUSE
still thinks it belongs to Damian (according to "View Permissions").

Andreas, is this an indexing problem?
