Hi!

Could you please provide me with a CPAN ID?  I have written a collection 
of modules that supoort the creation of mobile agents in Perl and I'd 
like to share the code with the community.  I've already announced the 
software on the perl-agents@perl.org maillist.

Module website: http://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/~scooby/

Preferred CPAN ID: BARRYP (or BARRYPJ)

Other details as per e-mail signature, below.

Looking forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

Paul.
