Request to register new user

     why:

    Net::DNS and Net::DNS::SEC are maintained at NLnet Labs. We would
    like to have a role account for publishing releases and our
    interaction with pause and cpan.

    Yesterday I requested (and was granted) the account NETDNS for this
    purpose. In hindsight we would prefer the account name NLNETLABS,
    because we might maintain other modules than Net::DNS and to
    associate our modules with our foundation, NLnet Labs, more visible.

    Sorry about our second thoughts. I already checked the "Account can
    be removed" checkbox with the NETDNS account.
