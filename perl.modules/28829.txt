The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::IRC::Service
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: an event driven IRC Services module
  userid:      BINGOS (Chris Williams)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    IRC

  similar:
    POE::Component::IRC

  rationale:

    Having used POE::Component::IRC to write several bots I thought it
    was a very good interface for developing into a full blown IRC
    services client. The codebase is borrowed from P:C:I so felt it was
    best to place the module in the P:C:I namespace and have discussed
    via email with Dennis Taylor (P:C:I author) and he is happy with
    this. POE::Component::IRC::Service is a wrapper to submodules which
    I forsee handling different IRCd implementations. Eg. I have
    POE::Component::IRC::Service::P10 for P10 protocol and
    POE::Component::IRC::Service::Hybrid for Hybrid IRCd The module also
    utilises some POE::Filter modules, POE::Filter::IRC::P10 and
    POE::Filter::CTCP::P10.

  enteredon:   Tue Feb 24 22:10:31 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::IRC::
::Service         adpOp an event driven IRC Services module          BINGOS
