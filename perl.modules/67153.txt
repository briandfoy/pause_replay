The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::Private
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: Private subroutines and methods
  userid:      PMAKHOLM (Peter Makholm)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    namespace::clean Sub::Lexical

  rationale:

    Both namespace::clean and Sub::Lexical provides the means to have
    private subroutines and methods. The userinterface of the former is
    a bit obscure and the latter is based on source filtering.

    This module provides a nicer interface and uses namespace::clean
    behind the scenes.

  enteredby:   PMAKHOLM (Peter Makholm)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 13 11:15:50 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sub::
::Private         adpnp Private subroutines and methods              PMAKHOLM
