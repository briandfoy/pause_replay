The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Hookable
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Base class for hook mechanism
  userid:      NYARLA (Naoki Okamura)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::Trigger, Class::Component, Hook::Modular

  rationale:

    Class::Hookable is the module to which a hook mechanism is offered.
    This module was made based on the hook mechanism of Plagger.

    There is something such as Class::Trigger, Class::Component and
    Hook::Modular in a module akin to this module, but Class::Component
    and Hook::Modular also function as all except for a hook mechanism,
    and aren't simple.

    The one closest to this module is Class::Trigger, but

    * the filtering when hook registers * getting or deleting of
    registered hook * dispatch at the time of a calling hook

    are possible by this module compared with Class::Trigger.

    When combining Module::Pluggable::Fast with this module, I think
    they become able to make a pluggable framework or module easily.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Hookable        bdpOp Base class for hook mechanism                NYARLA
