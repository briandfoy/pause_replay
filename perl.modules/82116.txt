Hello Dave Taylor / Perl modules mailing list,

I've been trying to get in touch for about eight weeks about
IO-Callback. See messages below. If you are no longer maintaining
IO-Callback, I'd like to take it over; this can be on a temporary basis
if you don't have time to work on it right now but don't want to
completely relinquish it.

(Also copied b d foy and David Golden, as I don't think my messages to
modules@perl.org have always been arriving.)

Subject: Re: IO-Callback


Since my last message (below) I have released an unofficial patched
version of IO-Callback:

https://metacpan.org/release/TOBYINK/IO-Callback-1.09_01/

The CPAN testers service seems to suggest that my fixes are working on
all platforms and all tested versions of Perl (it doesn't look like
many people are testing on 5.6.x any more).

Could you please adopt these changes, as I wish to release a module
that relies on IO-Callback, but am currently put off by its high level
of test failures.

If you don't have the time or inclination to support this module any
more, then I'm happy to take over as co-maintainer. You can set me as
co-maintainer using the form on PAUSE here:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

... or if you can't remember your PAUSE login, the people on
modules@perl.org (copied) may be able to do it for you.

-Toby
