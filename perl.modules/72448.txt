     why:

    I would like to start contributing CPAN modules to try to give back
    to the community. I've made some contributions to other Perl and
    CPAN projects, and it'd be cool to finally be an author. Plus, I
    have a module that I just created, and I'm ready to contribute.

    Thanks!
