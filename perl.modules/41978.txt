     why:

    I've recently been working on an alternative integration of Maypole
    + FormBuilder (alternative to Maypole::FormBuilder and
    Class::DBI::FormBuilder). It has a custom Model, View, and
    Controller with various improvements over what is currently
    available, such as the possibility of viewing related columns of a
    table along with the table's own columns. It also has a custom set
    of TT templates. The main difference from Maypole::FormBuilder and
    Class::DBI::FormBuilder is that it is more bottom-up, allowing
    greater customization and making fewer assumptions about what sort
    of application is being designed.

    It's not quite ready for release yet, but I'm very close to having
    a usable version.
