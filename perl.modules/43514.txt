Courtesy Notice:  Listing added to scriptworm.com web resource index.

My name is Jonathan Wilson.
I serve as the director of content for the wormsites.com network. I am
sending you this email because our content team reviewed your
information on the internet, and added a listing for you in our
indexed search engine using information from your web site.
 
We gathered the information that was included in our index by
reviewing your web site which is also where we obtained your contact
information. If by chance, you are not the individual in your
organization who would be concerned with the accuracy of search engine
and index listings on Google, Yahoo, MSN, and specialized niche
indexes such as ours, please forward this email on to the appropriate
person in your organization.
 
To take control of your listing, you may login to www.scriptworm.com,
register for a complimentary listing account, and claim the listing(s)
that our content team added giving you complete control over its
content.  

At this time, your listing contains information from content on your
web site and looks similar to a listing in Google or MSN.Â  In
contrast to the major search engines, we give you the full editorial
control over your listing.Â  You may upload a product box shot,
company logo, and/or a screen shot of your website or script to be
displayed with your listing.
 
To do this:
 
1. Navigate to www.scriptworm.com, and register for a complimentary
account.
2. Using the search function, lookup your listings and add your own
new version each listing already in our index.
3. If you can't find your listing, don't worry, Once you add 1
listing, our content team will insure that there are no listings in
our index for your web site (URL) that you do not control. When you
submit your new listings for approval, our review team will delete the
old duplicates in our index.
 
IMPORTANT: make sure to be as complete as possible in your listing.
Include 10-12 keywords in the keywords field (separate keywords by
comas) as these items are used in the headers of your listing detail
pages and get crawled by Google and the other major search engines
every few days giving you greater exposure.
 
OPTIONAL BUT WORTHWHILE:
There is no limit to the number of listings you may have.Â  Please
feel free to add listings in any category you feel is appropriate, and
for as many products or services as you offer. 
 
Basic listings are offered at no charge. For higher visibility and
prominence in our index, take a look at the current rates on featured,
sponsored, and premium sponsored listings. 
 
If you choose not to create enhanced listings, consider including our
small "listed on scriptworm" button on your web site.Â  This will
insure that your listing is shown at the top of category lists and at
the top of search results.
 
Each time you update your listing, it is displayed on our front page
(in the order of most recently updated listings). Â You can also keep
your listings at the top of the index by keeping your listing up to
date.
 
Many thanks for your kind consideration,
Jonathan Wilson.
