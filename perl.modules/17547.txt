From: samuel.k.nelson@verizon.net ("Sam Nelson")

Hello,

I'm a Perl developer, and would shortly like to propose my first module
for CPAN.  It's a small thingy: given a U.S. state, it returns the list
of neighboring states.  I've found it useful in social science research
contexts.  Presumably it could easily be expanded to non-US states (or
countries).

Would Geography::States::Neighbors be an appropriate package name?  Is
there anything else special I should know that's not on the
00modlist.long guide?

Thanks very much,

	
Sam Nelson
