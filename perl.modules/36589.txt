Subject: Module submission Chart::Scientific

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chart::Scientific
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A module to make simple scientific 2d plots
  userid:      KESTER (Kester Allen)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org comp.lang.perl.modules perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Chart::Plot::* GD::Graph

  rationale:

    This is a change of request: after discussing it with Brian Foy, I
    would like to register my module as Chart::Scientific instead of
    Chart::Plot::Simple.

    I chose the namespace b/c it seems to fit with the existing CPAN
    structure.

    I think my module is worth listing in the module list because it
    allows PDL piddles, arrays, or data from a file to be plotted
    easily, which I beleive no other plotting module currently does.
    Other useful features:

    Data sets with unevenly-spaced x-data are handled trivially.
    Residuals between two y-data sets can be calculated and plotted,
    regardless of whether they are plotted against the same x-data.
    Errorbars can be specified, and are correctly calculated for the
    residuals, if applicable. Log-lin, lin-log, and log-log plots can be
    created simply Plot data can be read in from a file, or fed in via
    arrays or PDL piddles.

    Thanks for your time.
