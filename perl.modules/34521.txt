<BR>What right have you to capture vibrations that radiate from private and
secret actions and discover them to others who have no business to know
them? This would be a fine world if every body could peep into every one
else's affairs, wouldn't it? And here is your Character MarkerNice thing for
a decent person to own, isn't it? Any one who would take advantage of such a
sneaking invention as that would be worse than a thief! Oh, I've used them,
of course, and I ought to be spanked for having been so mean and
underhanded; but I'll never be guilty of looking through them again
