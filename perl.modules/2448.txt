Well, according to the readme, the module is quite beta, so I doubt
that its use is widespread.  Thus, if I can get Mr. Goldsmith's
permission, I will continue using this name.  As far as getting
permission, this is exactly why I CCed the original mail to him.  I'm
going to hope that he responds; if he does not, I'll assume that the
project has been abandoned and keep using Net::AIM.

If it turns out that I do have to change the name, it is time to
restart the thread concerning what it should be called.  How does
Net::AOLIM sound?  I'm fairly certain that it's not taken :-)
