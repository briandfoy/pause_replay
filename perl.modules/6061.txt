The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Detect::OS
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: What OS, What Version, Which distribution?
  userid:      SCOTT (Scott Penrose)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Internal functions, eg: $^O

  rationale:

    Modules all over the place work out what type of operating system
    you are using so that they can decide what operations to do or
    support.

    As such the code to detect these operating systems is distributed
    all over the place, and each person has to invent their own methods
    and not share the code.

    I hope to make this module the centre for OS detection and refactor
    other code to use this.

    It goes further than just which OS and Version, it also delves into
    which distribution (very usefull for Linux) and to hopefully point
    out some directories.

    For example, the best way on this OS to find a users home
    directory, or the temporary directory. We mostly write files to
    /tmp, but on Windows it is better to find the temp dir which is
    usually c:\windows\temp There is standards to find this information,
    this module is a repository for that information.

    Following the production of this module I am looking into other OS
    helpers, such as user information/directory, process locking (eg:
    /var/run/pid files on unix, these change directory per distribution
    of even linux, and on other OS it is done a completely different
    way).

  enteredon:   Sat Jun  9 06:37:59 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Detect::
::OS              cdpOg What OS, What Version, Which distribution?   SCOTT
