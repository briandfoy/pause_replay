Hello,

I've noticed that most requests for CPAN accounts are granted within a few days.
I posted the message below two weeks ago and haven't yet received a reply.

In case it slipped down the back of a cybersofa, here it is once more.

Please forgive me for reposting if my case is still being considered;
and please let me know if there's anything I can do to debug my request if
any part of it is causing delays.

Regards,
chocolateboy.

Hi there.

I'm writing to request a PAUSE account.

My details are as follows:

Name: chocolateboy
Email: chocolate.boy@email.com

User ID: CHOCOLATE

Modules I am planning to submit:

Xelig: A Model-View-Controller XML-template toolkit inspired by
Enhydra's XMLC. Unlike XSLT, PHP, ASP, JSP, Struts, Template Toolkit,
ZPT, and the other 5000 template toolkits, Xelig offers a genuine
separation of layout and logic.

Util: A collection of FAQ-ish functions. Util has had the
looks_like_number() wrapper that was recently added to Scalar:Util
for the past two years. In addition, it contains Swiss-Army file-read
and write operators, a handy cross-platform implementation of
Infinity, a fast (XS) clone(), and various math/web/text time-savers.

For a variety of reasons, I'd prefer Xelig to be just plain old Xelig
rather than, say, XML::Xelig. But I'm happy to surrender the Util
namespace (e.g. Acme::Util, Acme::FAQ) if someone has a better claim
to it.

Thanks in advance,
chocolateboy
