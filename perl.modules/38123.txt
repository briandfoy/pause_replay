From: claco@chrislaco.com ("Christopher H. Laco")

I've recently been writing tests like a good little boy, converting my 
modules to SVN, and doing general cleanup.

I've got a few modules at are really MovableType plugins; usually with 
one pm, on pl, pod, and a test ot two.

It seems most, if not all MovableType plugins/modules in the wild start 
with MT* in their names. I've often wondered why there is no MT:: 
namespace on CPAN, or even any MT* plugins; at the very least an 
MT::Plugins namespace. Of course there is http://www.mt-plugins.org/, 
but I'd rather PAN it.

The modules I have are already packaged in a CPAN like manner.
I'd like to upload them to CPAN if for no other reason than they're 
available to all without relying on my servers, or me being alive to 
work on it.

So, I guess my real question is is it worth having a new namespace, 
officially or in practice, and what would be the best namespace/distribs be?
