This shouldn't be a problem, although we like to follow the process we
outline in the "About PAUSE" docs:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about#takeover

Try an announcement in a few other public places, and if you don't get
a response in a week or so, we'll transfer the module.

This doesn't mean that you have to hold off on creating and applying
your patches, though. Usually these transfers are not a problem, but we
want to ensure that we give the original uploader every opportunity to
respond. :)

Thanks,
