The typical way to do this is to set up a :default tag so the user can
choose. I'd stop using a module that didn't let me choose.

I would avoid the word "default" since here it doesn't mean the choice
applied in the absence of input.

How about a name like Export::Always? You have a very particular use
case, so it should have a more particular name. :)
