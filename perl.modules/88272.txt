     why:

    I have developed a Perl module that co-ordinates control-break
    processing. It is designed to be fed a stream of data records in
    hashes with keys for field names and values field values. A
    configuration hash is supplied describing what hash fields are key
    fields. Also function references for routines that will be called to
    do break processing when a key value terminates and when a new key
    value begins. The number of break keys is not limited.

    Also automatic aggregation of data fields for SUM, MIN, MAX etc is
    supported for all the levels of the control fields. The control
    break module stands alone and does not rely on other modules. It is
    written all in Perl code.

    I would like to provide the module to the Perl community because I
    think it is very useful and saves considerable time when one has to
    implement complex control break processing for aggregating data.
