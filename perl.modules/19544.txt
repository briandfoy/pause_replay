Arthur,

    I'm sorry you've been disappointed with the response.  The denizens
of this list are here to provide advice on naming your modules, and
comments about similiarities/differences to other modules on CPAN.

    You can upload your module at any time with no need for permission
from any of us, and you can register the namespace here:

        https://pause.cpan.org/

    Just log in, and click "Register Namespace".

    Again, I apologize that we've left you disappointed.

    Regards,
    Kurt Starsinic
