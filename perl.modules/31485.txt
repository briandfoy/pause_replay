I seem to recall that we have had long discussions on similar issues. 

As far as I'm concerned, it would be realistic to require a working
contact[1] for anyone that puts something on CPAN. I'm even willing to
vote for an automated 'ping' once every XX months. Missing NN replies
means that the module(s) disappear from CPAN, or are otherwise marked
as obsolete. If a much appreciated module risks being removed, someone
else _has_ to take it over.

I guess I can, again, put CPAN on a single CD in the near future :-).

[1] The PAUSE subscribe page could clearly indicate that this is
required, and that the 'secret' address is _only_ used for
administration purposes.
