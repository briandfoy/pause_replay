Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

Please would you comment on the use of the namespace 'Nagios' for Perl
modules related to the Nagios (http://www.Nagios.ORG/) availability
monitoring system.

Modules proposed or written include 

1 Nagios::util

  an exporter of subroutines and data structures useful to those
writing
  Nag service checks in Perl.

2 Nagios::NagConfig

  a Perl class to suck in the Nagios configuration definitions
(Patrick LeBoutillier)

3 Nagios::Web_Trx

  a Perl class, similar to WWW::Automate or WWW:Mechanize in ambit, to
  check web front ends to databases etc (those services that have a 
  number of fill-out forms to use).

Thank you,

Yours sincerely.
