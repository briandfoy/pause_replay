I have more of an issue with "correct" than whether or not you use "range".

Being "correct" or "incorrect" requires a seperate understanding of the 
context of any correctness and what it means to be correct or incorrect.

Perhaps what might be closer is something like ::Normalize?

Would that be right? You are taking various sloppy or shorthand forms of 
range and converting into strictly accurate forms that would be 
considered the ideal expression?

Not entirely sure if Normalize would be accurate enough, but "correct" 
is almost like calling a piece of string "long".
