The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Semantically Disambiguate All Words in Text
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    senserelate-users@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    WordNet::Similarity

  rationale:

    This module supports a method that will assign meanings from
    WordNet to all words in a given text. This module does this using
    information from WordNet::Similarity, which is an existing module
    that lets a user measure the relatedness and similarity between
    concepts as found in the WordNet lexical database.
    WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords will find which sense of a word is
    most related to the senses of the words that occur nearby, and
    assign that most related sense to the word. It does this for every
    word in the text known to WordNet. Word Sense Disambiguation is a
    fundamental problem in Natural Language Processing, and is an
    important building block for any applications that seek to
    understand text.
