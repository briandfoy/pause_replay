You guys both have modules on CPAN called Taint.  If I try to install
Dan's (0.07, just uploaded) I get Tom's (0.09, from Oct 1997).

Tom, if yours is no longer usable (and it fails tests with 5.6.1 & 5.8.0),
may I humbly suggest removing it and giving the namespace registration to
Dan?  Otherwise, Dan, could you change the name of your module?
