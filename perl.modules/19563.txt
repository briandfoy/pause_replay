The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Physics::Unit
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Manipulate physics units and dimensions.
  userid:      KLORTHO (Christopher Maloney)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Convert::Units, Data::Dimensions, Math::Units, Math::Calc::Units

  rationale:

    Though this is similar to a few other modules already on the CPAN,
    we feel that this has significant new functionality, and definitely
    does belong in the Physics::* namespace.

    The related modules that we've investigated are: Convert::Units
    Data::Dimensions Math::Units Math::Calc::Units

    Each of these modules has unique and interesting features. However,
    one big drawback of all of them is a severe lack of documentation.
    I'm in the process of corresponding with each of the authors of
    these modules, to talk about the possibility of merging them all
    under the Physics::Unit module. All of these modules are somewhat
    "stale"; i.e. they haven't been updated in quite a long time.

    An alternative would be to update one of the above modules with the
    new functionality of Physics::Unit. This is not a good idea, IMO,
    because Physics::Unit is already more mature than any of the above
    modules. The documentation and examples are quite thorough, and
    quite a few tests are included (although they haven't as yet been
    integrated in to the "make test" command. Right now the tests reside
    in the eg/ directory.)

    Also, I hope to convince you that the Physics::* namespace makes
    more sense than any of the above, and that's another reason why my
    new module should become the "master".

    The objects of the Physics::Unit and related classes are designed
    to hold data values that represent physical quantities.

    They are not just for doing unit conversions; they can be used in
    any program which simulates or models the real world. Hence the
    Convert::* namespace is not appropriate.

    The Data::Dimensions module is very similar in some respects to my
    module. However, it lacks the nice unit expression parser that ours
    has. We feel that the Data::* root namespace is too vague and
    general for this module. The Data::Dimensions module itself is not
    well-named. "dimensions" could refer to any number of things other
    than physical units.

    Finally, the Math::* root namespace is clearly not appropriate.
    This module has very little to do with pure mathematics.
    Furthermore, we would argue, that since there is a Math::* root
    namespace, it only makes sense that there should be a Physics::*
    root namespace as well. These are two realms of knowledge and
    algorithms, that, for example, universities around the world
    recognize as distinct.

    Thanks for your consideration, and please let me know if you want
    more information, or if there are any other hoops we need to jump
    through to make this module see the glorious light of the CPAN
    module lists!

    In addition, I'd like to suggest a new category (chapter) in your
    module list above: how about "Real-world modelling / simulation"?

The resulting entry would be:

Physics::
::Unit            RdpOp Manipulate physics units and dimensions.     KLORTHO
