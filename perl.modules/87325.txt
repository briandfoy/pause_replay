Hi Chris and all,

I'd like to request for COMAINT (=3D co-maintainenace) for
https://metacpan.org/release/Cache , due to the fact the author did not mak=
e a
release since 2007 ( https://metacpan.org/release/Cache ). My plans for
the short-term maintenance are:

1. Handle and close the tickets in the CPAN RT queue (or at least those tha=
t I
have the tuits for).

2. Fix POD errors (with tests).

3. Add version control information, keywords, etc.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
