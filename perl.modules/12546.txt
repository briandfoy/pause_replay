What I meant (unfortunately not very clearly) but "applications" are 
vocabularies used as such. That is, things like SVG, XHTML, XSLT, etc where 
the fact that they are XML is an integral part of the technology. Obviously, 
something that just happens to use XML doesn't fit there :)

I admit to having judged this almost only on this specific module which is a 
DOM wrapper/extension in a way similar to the way in which, say, the SVG DOM, 
wraps/extends the Core DOM.

Part of what motivated my answer was that "TEILite" didn't seem appropriate 
as it is itself a subsection of TEI. What would you think of TEI::Lite then?
