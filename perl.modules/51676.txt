No, because it usually doesn't make sense to register many namespaces.
They are registered by uploading, it's just a slightly different
flavor of registering.

Yes, if you write a META.yml file with the "provides" attribute, then
the indexer will use that instead. I think, current state of affairs
is that you can do that with both Module::Build and MakeMaker. I'm not
absolutely sure for the latter.
