Hello!

Business::OnlinePayment is a good module,..
But unfortunately a lot of people are using unregistred namespace of 
UkrMoney::API,.. so it would be nice to register it.

As for the Business::OnlinePayment::UkrMoney, I think it would be good 
to make "driver module" for it too. But first, I hope, you allow to 
register namespace of UkrMoney::API with direct interface.

With best wishes,
Dmitry Nikolayev
