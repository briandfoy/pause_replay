    TB> Or Pg::*

Granted this is PostgreSQL-specific, but there is, AFAIK, nothing to
stop someone from developing something similar for, say, Oracle.
That, and it is IO-oriented.  It seems to fit quite nicely alongside
of IO::String, IO::Scalar, etc.  Is there any reason that a generic
IO::Blob couldn't be developed so that people have a common interface
to these large objects stored in a database?

Thanks for your feedback thusfar.

Mark.
