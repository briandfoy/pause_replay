The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Clone
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Subclass & copy a class with code on-the-fly
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    SUPER Clone Exporter

  rationale:

    Class::Clone makes an exact clone of an existing class, whose
    variables and subroutines are not in any way tied back to the
    existing class or it's parent classes. If you change any variables
    in the clone, the changes don't affect the parent class. When a
    cloned subroutine has a call like

    $self->SUPER::do_something()

    the clone class's parents are traversed. This module is called
    Class::Clone because this behaviour lends itself well to creating
    certain types of factory / polymorph classes.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
