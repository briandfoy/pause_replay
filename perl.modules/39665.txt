The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::ManagementSpeak
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Tool to build managerial-sounding documents
  userid:      GRYPHON (Gryphon Shafer)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    PerlMonks.org, SourceForge.net

  similar:
    Inline::Spew

  rationale:

    This module generates grammatically correct, managerial-sounding
    text and full-length documents that mean absolutely nothing. It can
    output sentences, paragraphs, and whole documents with embedded
    structure. The goal is to easily provide filler or lorem ipsen
    content that has the potential to pass as real. This module does for
    geeks what lorem ipsen does for designers. The most commonly used
    method for me, and the reason why I built the module at all, is
    document(). It calls several other methods internally and returns a
    randomly generated document that looks and reads like a real
    document, with internal information architecture and proper sentence
    styles. I picked the name Lingua::ManagementSpeak based on feedback
    from PerlMonks.org and other private conversations. I originally
    thought of putting it under Acme, but the module is less of a pure
    joke and more of a tool. It has practical purpose as well as
    entertainment or joke purpose. I think Lingua is a better place for
    it because the goal is to return grammatically correct and well
    formed sentences and documents.
