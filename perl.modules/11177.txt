The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Which
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Portable implementation of `which'
  userid:      PEREINAR (Per Einar Ellefsen)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    A simple thing as a portable implementation of the command-line
    `which' utility doesn't seem to exist in Perl. This modules has its
    origins in mod_perl 2.0 and the new mod_perl site, which needed an
    implementation of this, and has further been developed to be more
    cross-platform (atleast supports Win32 and Unix now).

    As it deals with executable files, the File:: namespace seems
    appropriate. The ::Which part is pretty self-descriptive too.

  enteredon:   Sun Apr 14 22:33:21 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Which           bdpfp Portable implementation of `which'           PEREINAR
