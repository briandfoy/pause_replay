from what you told me in private mail (and did not forward to this
list), this module doesn't really deal with XML, but parses text
into a Ximple data structure.  beyond that i'm not really sure what
the module is trying to do because the documentation is lean.

it looks like you are doing text transformations though.  in that
case, i think something like

   Text::Ximple

is more appropriate.
