The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Procmail
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Perl extension for rePading procmail logfile
  userid:      BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    http://log-procmail.mongueurs.net/ log-procmail-cvs@mongueurs.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    Log::Procmail is a small module to read procmail logfiles.

    Most of this rationale is pasted from what I submitted on Thu, 7
    Feb 2002. See the following link:
    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg10035.html

    Finding the proper name was the main problem. After browsing CPAN a
    little, I have come up with several plausible names: - Log::Procmail
    - Mail::Procmail::Log - Mail::ProcmailLog - Logfile::Procmail

    But, each name came with a different problem: - The Log:: directory
    looks like it's holding logging tools (like Log::Agent) and not log
    parsing tools. - Mail::Procmail is a procmail-like tool, while this
    module reads logs from the original procmail. They are not related,
    but the name similarity might confuse potential users. And
    Mail::Procmail::Log is quite long for such a small module. -
    Mail::ProcmailLog doesn't sound that good. Personal taste. -
    Logfile::Procmail should inherit from Logfile::Base, as most of the
    other Logfile:: modules do, which isn't the case for this particular
    module.

    I suppose then that the choice was really between
    Mail::Procmail::Log and Log::Procmail.

    So I chose Log::Procmail. Now in version 0.04, which is quite
    stable. It's not very difficult to change the name of the module,
    since to my knowledge, nobody is actually using it.

    Thanks for your help in including this small module in the module
    list.
