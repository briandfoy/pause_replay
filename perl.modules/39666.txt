     why:

    Right now, I'm planning on submitting a module called
    IO::Pipe::producer which has two simple methods that execute either
    a subroutine (supplied as a reference) or a system command in a
    forked process and returns a handle on the STDOUT from the forked
    process (or in list context returns both a handle on STDOUT and one
    on STDERR). Further down the road, I hope to formalize & submit some
    of the bioinformatics modules I've developed and maybe a web-based
    photo album module if I ever get around to finishing it.
