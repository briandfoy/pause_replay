     why:

    Based on some discussion on #perl # freenode, I am working on a
    module which will provide a wrapper to all linux config files. The
    wrapper will have a generic class which will delegate the
    responsibility of manipulating a specific config file to a specific
    class. This generic class will also have introspection capability to
    introspect the config file and present the config options via a
    standard API, without the end application knowing anything about the
    config file. In short the end application will be able to fetch and
    edit all the information of a config file using a standard API.
