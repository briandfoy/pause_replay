WIN32 is a mailing list, I think, and one with no users in it. Andreas
has to manually add them.

However, backing up a bit, maybe we don't need a mailing list for this
if its just Jan. Jan and Adam and the Strawberry Perl folks want to
work together, then it may be a good idea.

I'm not trying to promote any side. The people involved can choose
whichever way they want to go :)
