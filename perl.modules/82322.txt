Hello.

I and several others who depend on Text::Query have tried to contact the 
author over the past several years to no avail. The latest attempt's 
bounce from last year is shown here. I wrote about it to this address then 
but didn't hear back.

There are a couple of patches that fix serious problems with it. I'm ready 
to do a release if I can be allowed to in PAUSE. My username is JONJ.

Can someone authorize that?

Thanks,
Jon

Hello, Eric & Loic.

Thanks for writing Text::Query. It's been useful for many people over the 
years, including me!

Since Perl 5.10 there has been a problem with 
Text::Query::SolveSimpleString, and since Perl 5.14 there are problems 
with the test suite.

I've fixed those and would like to see a new release, either by you if 
you are interested, or myself.

Text::Query failing to install is holding up 
Bundle::InterchangeKitchenSink from installing, and that's used by quite a 
few people so I'd like to help fix the problem.

Please let me know if I can help.

Thanks,
Jon
