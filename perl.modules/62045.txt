The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LWES
  DSLIP:       Rdcfg
  description: Perl API for the Light Weight Event System
  userid:      LUM (Michael Lum)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/lwes/

  similar:
    Spread

  rationale:

    The Light Weight Event System provides a library for
    loosely-coupled, cross-platform communications over the network.
    There are currently implementations in C and Java, and the C version
    has wrappers in Perl and PHP. (Ruby and Python are in development).

    The serialization system could be roughly compared to Protocol
    Buffers or Thrift, however, is different in that it does not require
    any code generation and instead uses an Event Specification File to
    define a contract between sender and receiver. It also only supports
    primitive datatypes in a key-value pair. It also could be compared
    with something like Spread, without the centralized daemons, and
    with a more structured data contract.

    Also, it is typically used for more loosely coupled, lightweight
    communications, such as remote logging or code instrumentation.

    I am suggesting a new root level namespace "LWES" because this
    system is more or less standalone and does not even really fit well
    into any of the module chapters. It provides serialization,
    networking, schema, and parsing methods. It is somewhat similar in
    functionality to Spread, which has a top-level namespace in CPAN.

    Finally, LWES is used very heavily within many companies and the
    code on SourceForge is already using the LWES namespace. Although
    not recognized by CPAN, this would significantly help ease adoption
    and migration to CPAN.

    Thank you
