The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PersistentPerl
  DSLIP:       MmcOg
  description: Persistent perl interpreter
  userid:      HORROCKS (Sam Horrocks)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    speedycgi-users@lists.sourceforge.net modules@perl.org

  similar:
    SpeedyCGI Pperl

  rationale:

    It seems that people don't know that SpeedyCGI is in fact a
    persistent perl interpreter. In an attempt to fix this, I asked the
    SpeedyCGI users their opinion, and the best response was to rename
    it or add an alias. I picked PersistentPerl since it seems to convey
    that this is a general purpose persistent Perl interpreter.

    The plan is to keep SpeedyCGI and PersistentPerl based on the same
    code for a while, then if it all works out, transition to a single
    name only.

The resulting entry would be:

PersistentPerl    MmcOg Persistent perl interpreter                  HORROCKS
