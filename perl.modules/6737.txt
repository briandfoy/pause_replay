To Whom It May Concern:
I would like to inquire into obtaining a CPAN ID for contributing
software.  I am currently working on several modules which I would like to
make publicly available, including an abstraction layer for
Crypt::Blowfish which transparently eliminates the need to do 8 byte block
looping (Crypt::Blowfish currently goes 8 bytes at a time, requiring a
layer of abstraction to properly encrypt strings).  My information is as
follows:
