The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tripletail
  DSLIP:       bmhOp
  description: Tripletail, a framework for Japanese Web App
  userid:      MIKAGE (佐野 拓)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Catalyst, CGI::Application, Jifty

  rationale:

    Tripletail is a framework for Web application.

    In case of developing a software that work with Japanese, there are
    often problems in treating character sets: There are several
    different character sets for Japanese, and a software sometimes
    needs to use some of them without being confused.

    Tripletail works around to those problems which are specific to
    Japanese, and provides many features that are needed to develop a
    web site centers around web applications.

    This framework mainly targets Web applications, but it also has
    features for batch processing, mail manipulation, and the rest. So
    we don't think CGI:: namespace is appropriate for Tripletail, we
    desire the root one.

    Some features like Debug Screen and DBI Wrapper can be used not
    only for web applications, but also batch scripts. The debugging
    utilities provide the following features:

    - Send a mail containing stack trace to the administrator

    - Profile the execution time of SQL statements

    - Watch certain variables and log the content of them whenever they
    change

    In addition, Tripletail has the following features that are other
    than CGI-related:

    - Recognize Japanese holidays

    - Create and parse mails in Japanese

    - Turn a web page to HTML mail

    - Sign a mail with S/MIME

    - Process its own mail queue, and send mails using SMTP

    These would be under Date:: or Mail:: if they were considered as
    separate modules.
