Dear Maintainers,

In the good tradition of the perl community, I kindly request to be 
registered as module author on CPAN/perl. I hope that my code can 
contribute to the ease and functionality of perl/CPAN. The following list 
is set up according to CPAN/modules/04pause.html

contribution:

'Supersplit' is a module that extends the split/ join methods to 
multi-dimensional arrays. From the moment that I encountered the cool 
possibilities of multi-dimensional arraying in perl, I have been thinking 
how nice it would be if such arrays could be read and written out in one 
statement. Well, the methods supersplit and superjoin just do that. The 
standard interface exports 6 methods, and I have written a separate 
object interface just for people who like object-oriented perl better or 
who don't like my namespace choices. 

Another module I would like to contribute is 'CGIPack'. It takes a series 
of scalars, and a size-description, and (un)packs them in a tightly 
packed string. This string consists of only the alphanumeric + 2 
characters, so it can be used in an URL. These compact strings are more 
easily handled in copy-pasting/ e-mail/ handwritten URLs in 'the wild'. 

description in format:

Supersplit      bdph Extends split/join functions to multi-dimensional 
arrays
CGIPack         adpf Packs/unpacks scalars in bit-tight URL compatible 
strings

discussion:

Both modules have been discussed at the perlmonks.org site. Both received 
some realy enthousiastic comments, some as a reply, some in private 
discussion: 'cool function ideas', 'cool module!' etc.. After a 
comment-and-answer discussion Supersplit has benefitted from Ben Tilly's 
ideas. The original Supersplit posting has even reached the top-ten nodes 
(something I am really proud of). 

Merlyn aka Randal L Schwartz also commented on Supersplit in the 
perlmonks chatterbox, he showed concise code that things similar to 
supersplit in two dimensions, but these were quite difficult to follow 
and it even took him a second try to get it right. The HTML-table-join he 
could do with some CGI-code together with two maps, which still was 
complicated. And he agreed with me when I answered that for example a 
LaTeX table took more coding, as no translators are ready. These kind of 
tables are quite easy to code with superjoin.

The CGIPack code originally was written in answer to a monk-request, but 
I extended it afterwards. As described earlier, it received enthousiastic 
private reactions. I know it is similar to the pack/base64 function, but 
it allows compactness of the strings, where base64 only expands them. So 
I think CGIPack is an useful addition.

I would catagorize CGIPack as either Text:: or CGI::, but I wouldn't know 
where to put Supersplit, as it is an Array::/Text:: hybrid.

 
In the hope you will enjoy these modules, 



Jeroen
