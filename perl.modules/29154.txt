The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Silly::Wabby
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Create semi-random sentences based on text
  userid:      POZNICK (Nathan Poznick)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I thought that putting this module in Silly:: was a good idea,
    since it's not really useful for anything but amusing yourself and
    others. The Wabby part of the name is due to the fact that it is
    based upon an earlier IRC bot called 'wabbylegs'. I have greatly
    enjoyed using Silly::Wabby while writing it, and think it needs to
    be shared with the rest of the Perl world.

  enteredby:   POZNICK (Nathan Poznick)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar  5 04:12:07 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Silly::
::Wabby           RdpOg Create semi-random sentences based on text   POZNICK
