The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TransferFromTo
  DSLIP:       cdpfg
  description: Transfers files from one place to another
  userid:      JESSESTAY (Jesse Stay)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    #utah for now

  similar:
    Net::FTP

  rationale:

    I have always needed a program to just transfer files via
    command-line. I am unaware of anything with this function
    specifically on CPAN, and Net::FTP seems a bit too generic and
    seperate in purpose to be a root-level namespace. This program's
    purpose is to take anything anywhere (ftp,http,locally,etc) and send
    it to anywhere. Currently it only takes files locally and sends them
    to an ftp location, but as it is developed and I need more
    functionality I will add to it. I am sure there are a ton of
    security flaws that I haven't noticed but this is pre-alpha. As
    developed I am sure it will become more and more object-oriented
    (it's not currently) which will allow sub-levels of functionality to
    be added in it's namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

TransferFromTo    cdpfg Transfers files from one place to another    JESSESTAY
