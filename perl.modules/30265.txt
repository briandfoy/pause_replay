Subject: Module submission DBIx::SQLEngine

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::SQLEngine
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Extends DBI with high-level operations
  userid:      EVO (Matthew Simon Cavalletto)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perl Monks, c.l.p.m

  similar:
    DBIx::Abstract Alzabo Class::DBI Rosetta SQL::AnyDBD

  rationale:

    The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for the
    DBI database framework. Each SQLEngine object is a wrapper around a
    DBI database handle, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL
    generation and query execution in a single call. Dynamic subclassing
    based on database server type enables cross-platform portability.

    I've selected the DBIx:: namespace as this seems to be the emerging
    standard for DBI wrappers and assistants.

    This module has been on CPAN for around two years and is a required
    dependency of several other packages.
