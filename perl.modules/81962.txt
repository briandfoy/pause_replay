The other part of the hassle is that applicant email addresses don't go to
modules, so responding requires viewing the request, copying the email
address, going back to email, creating the response etc.

If I could just hit "reply to all" and let gmail fill in a template
response, that would be fine, but it's not.

Nothing individually is too much work, but collectively, it pushes me
incrementally towards wanting a more open system or passing the baton off.
