The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::NSP
  DSLIP:       MdpOg
  description: Find Ngrams and Collocations in Text
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    ngram@yahoogroups.com

  similar:
    Text::Ngram

  rationale:

    Text::NSP is the Ngram Statistics Package. It is a relatively
    mature package that allows a user to count and measure the
    association of Ngrams in text, where N grams are just N words that
    occur in sequence. It includes a variety of different measures of
    association implemented in a class hierarchy that encourages re-use
    and development of new measures by users. It is this ability to
    define new measures easily that is among the things that make this
    package unique. Also, this package supports the notion of a
    "flexible window" between words in an Ngram, meaning that it is
    possible to count words and Ngrams that may have some intervening
    words for them in text. Finally, this package uses Perl regular
    expressions in quite a few nifty ways, including in defining
    tokenization schemes and stop lists of words to ignore.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
