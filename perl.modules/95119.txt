Were I you, I'd simply take the evidence as available:

  - At least four people thought your comment was phrased unkindly
  - At least one person thought your comment was phrased fine

and, given that evidence, personally I'd file it under "well, evidently
my phrasing wasn't as clear as it could have been, and being more careful
in future is likely a good idea to ensure my intentions aren't misread".

I've been filing things under that category for a lot of years now, and
I've found that the effort I've made to phrase things more clearly has more
than paid off in terms of reduced misunderstandings.

Either way, I doubt we'll gain much more value out of this thread, so while
you're welcome to have the last word if it makes you happy, I'll be leaving
it there.
