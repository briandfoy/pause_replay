Subject: purging old releases from CPAN author directories

Hi David,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat. The NOC have let us =
know that we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master. =
This is caused by packrats who are keeping lots of old releases in their =
author directory on CPAN.

Looking at your author directory =
(http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DC/DCANTRELL/), there are old releases =
for a number of your dists, but the biggest saving would be from =
deleting old releases of Number-Phone. As a reminder, all releases =
you=E2=80=99ve ever done will always be available from your BackPAN =
author directory (http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/D/DC/DCANTRELL/).

Would you be happy to cull your old releases please? There are at least =
3 ways we can make this happen:
  1. you could use the script written by XDG and RJBS: =
https://gist.github.com/xdg/1739bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38
  2. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
  3. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

The script mentioned in (1) above keeps all developer releases later =
than a stable release, keeps up to 3 stable releases, and deletes =
everything else. Use at your own risk, of course.

If you give me permission, I would delete everything other than the =
latest release for anything older than a year, and the most recent 3 =
releases of anything less than a year old. When marked for deletion, =
you=E2=80=99d have 3 days to check and revert anything you=E2=80=99re =
not happy with, before PAUSE would actually delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil=
