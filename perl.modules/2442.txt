Hello,

It seems in my eagerness to get my version of Net::AIM up, I didn't
ever bother to check whether the name was taken before uploading.
Unfortunately, the name _is_ already taken.  D'oh.

In any case, I now have my version of Net::AIM (0.1, but very stable
and probably ready for 1.0) up.  However, the previous version,
written by Aryeh Goldsmith, is also on CPAN.  It has not been modified
since its initial upload on June 29 of last year and the page
referenced in the readme as containing information as to the state of
the project no longer exists, so I'm assuming it's an abandoned
project.

My question is this: should I just rename it right now, getting the
process over with and avoiding namespace collision, or should I keep
my module named as it is unless asked to do otherwise by
Mr. Goldsmith?
