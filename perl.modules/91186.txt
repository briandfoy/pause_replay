Subject: let's talk about SOAP::WSDL!

Hello,

I would like to take over the SOAP::WSDL distribution.

It's a terrible module, and I'm a terrible module maintainer, so it's
a perfect match.

It looks like the author hasn't appeared in six years (or maybe ever):

https://rt.cpan.org//Dist/Display.html?Queue=SOAP-WSDL

I dropped him an email the other day at his email address listed in
the POD offering to help with a bug fix release.  I haven't heard back
in early 22 HOURS.

I have little intention of turning it into something wonderful, but
I'm pretty reasonable about dealing with requests that come through
github, and I spent a day fixing the bugs that keep tests from passing
on 5.19.9 (which is the version that all of the cool kids run).

https://github.com/scrottie/SOAP-WSDL/commits/master

I even tried not to use too many swear words, though I really wanted
to.  This thing was written with excessive cleverness.

I feel that this is an important module with a lot of business
application that should be kept basically working, and at least the
documentation updated with its problems and limitations.

(I know that 22 hours is pretty preliminary, but I wanted to send a
preliminary email here and then follow up on it later.)

Thanks,
-scott
