The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Distance
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Calculate Distances and Closest Locations
  userid:      BLUEFEET (Aran Deltac)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Geo::PostalCode Math::Trig

  rationale:

    While researching calculating distances I realized that it would be
    useful if I made a higher level API for doing distance calculations
    - especially for finding closest locations. Then I thought the Perl
    community would like it. So far nobodies said 'nay' to the concept,
    but neither has anyone shown great interest. Nothing out there
    Perl-wise does what I've written as far as I can find.

    This module can for the most part do everything Geo::PostalCode
    does. Althought, it still has its place, I intend to add even more
    functionality to actually supersiede and, as I've already done step
    much further in the direction of a general purpose module that can
    do many different things in many different ways when it comes you
    geographic distances.

    The complicated distance calculations are done by Math::Trig.
    Which, in itself, if all you have is Math::Trig, you have everything
    you need to calculate geographic distances. My module takes it quite
    a few steps farther by having pre-defined unit types, ability to
    define your own units, calculate distances for a large number of
    locations and returning the closest (via several method including a
    database connection), and of course other cool things.

    Anyways, I hope you let me use this namespace. I'd consider it an
    honor.

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
