     why:

    I'm a developer at a German university library. I'm developing a
    retrieval-focussed framework dealing with heterogeneous resources
    and data (specialized on the demandings of the library).

    But i'm planning to contribute modules of general interest to the
    community, instead of incorporating the functionality directly into
    my framework.
