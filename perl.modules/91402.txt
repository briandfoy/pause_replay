Hi Eddie,

thanks for your quick response.

You probably also should update your CPAN e-Mail target, 'cause=20

... tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the server for =
the recipient domain cpan.org by cpan.mx.develooper.com. =
[207.171.7.115].

The error that the other server returned was:
554 5.7.1 <cazador@cpan.org>: Recipient address rejected: Access denied

create a github repos so people can help me work on the repo that way.
