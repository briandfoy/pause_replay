     why:

    An HTML template engine that allows: 1) nested definitions, thereby
    making it easier to go from prototype to release; 2) complete
    separation of code from template, reducing common communcation
    problems between designers and developers; 3) thus far, easier to
    maintain code for larger production websites. This module (Chunks)
    has been running in production Web environments since 2001
    (Apache/mod_perl), so it's very stable. Currently working on
    enhancements which make localized content easier to create and
    present. Includes POD, and will have Makefile.pl before uploaded.
    Created and currently maintained by myself and Mark Blythe.
