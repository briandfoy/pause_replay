There's still going to integration work to do later to rebase all of  
the changes which have happened in your git onto the new cvs  
migration (or merge, or whatever strategy appears to work best)..

That's certainly effort, which needs to happen, but won't be made any  
harder by doing pure-perl fixes at least?

To be quite honest, *just* getting an open repository and an updated  
release with repository data in META.yml shipped, and going through  
the RT reports and culling what can be had / asking for test cases,  
even if there are no other fixes - would be great.

It'd at least look like FCGI wasn't dead, and give me the ability to  
yell *patches welcome* at anyone who moaned.. :_)

Cheers
