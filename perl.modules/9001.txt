The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weaving::Tablet
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Tablet Weaving simulation and design
  userid:      HERVEUS (Michael Houghton)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, tablet weaving mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    Tablet weaving involves potentially complex manipulation of the
    weaving tablets. A number of people have crafted tools to work out
    designs with computer assistance. I have taken the Perl way.

    The namespace will include submodules for data manipulation as well
    as user-interface components.

    I could not discern any extant top level names that were really
    appropriate for this. 'Weaving' struck me as a good candidate; a
    query on comp.lang.perl.modules raised no objections (no comments,
    either). Placing my module within that space leaves room for other
    types of weaving that also could benefit from computer aided design
    tools.

    I am not inalterably wedded to this specific name.

    yours, Michael (HERVEUS)
