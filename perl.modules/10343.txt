hello,

I would like to register at PAUSE.

name: Tomas Cerha
email: cerha@brailcom.org
preferred user-id: CERHA

I'm planning to contribute my pure Perl 5 modules.

One of them is my "YET ANOTHER" template parser with nice OO interface. 
Another one is an OO exception handling framework.

Now I'm seriously considering how to advocate the uniqueness of my 
solution among all the others.

Is it the right place here to ask for comments on my code?

Thank you, Tom.
