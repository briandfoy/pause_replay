Hi, Andreas,

Since last November I haven't uploaded to PAUSE and today I am finally
trying to get the fixed release of my Filesys::CygwinPaths (0.04)
uploaded. Unless I am doing something incorrectly, the pause.perl.org is
completely offline. Can you please confirm?

I've been trying for about 5 hours here on US East Coast. The time now is
about 7:10 PM local (ca. 19:10 EDT).

  Thanks,
    Soren Andersen
