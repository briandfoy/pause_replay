Perl gods,
   I have recently developed some modules that I would like to contribute
to CPAN as a registered developer. Per your page at
http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/04pause.html I am supplying you with
the following information:

Name:  Ben Lilley
Email: bdlilley@hawaii.rr.com

Preferred user ID:  BDLILLEY
Description of what I'm planning to contribute:
    First, I plan to contribute a 'Robotics' module.  The module is
designed to interface with a popular serial servo controller board
manufactured by NetMedia Inc, allowing control of up to 8 servos for use in
robotics. I have written this module because the only existing software for
use in robotics is written in Visual Basic.  I also plan to add support in
the module for other similar serial servo controllers used in the robotics
field. My second module is 'Joystick'.  This module will have two flavors.
The first interfaces with game controllers through low-level windows API
calls, allowing for Perl to determine number of devices, how many axis, how
many buttons, etc.  and also can report joystick and button status.  The
second flavor will be for Unix/Linux, allowing the same functionallity with
direct access to the joystick's port.

module list format:

Name           DSLI  Description                                   Info
-------------  ----  --------------------------------------------  -----
Robotics       adpO  Interfaces with servos used in hobby robotics 
Joystick       adpO  Allows input from game controllers

Public Discussion:
    As for the robotics module, I have only discussed this with my peers at
Hawaii Pacific University and University of Hawaii.  The engineering
students and computer programming students here, as well as other robotics
fans, are very interested in the module.  After scouring the internet I
have found software only in the form of Visual Basic, and very little C and
Assembly, and none in my favorite language, Perl.  Given the magnitude of
engineering and copmuter science students that complete projects in
robotics, as well as the number of hobby robotics fans out there, I feel it
would be a welcome module at CPAN.
   Moving on to Joystick - I have not engaged in active discussion with
anyone about it.  However, after searching all the Perl newsgroups myself
for information on reading game controllers in Perl, I did find about 20-25
requests from people asking for information on how they can get input from
game controllers.  That is a pretty good indication that such a module
would be useful - and besides that, most computer languages these days
offer some function or interface to the game ports. (If you hadn't already
figured it out, my specific purpose was to enable control of my robotics
from a joystick, instead of the keyboard.)

I have also searched the modules@perl.org archive and did not find any
emails referencing the above topics.

Please let me know what you think about the namespace ... I think Joystick
is pretty straight-forward, but I think Robotics could have a few other
options - like Servo, Servocontrol, Serialservo, etc..

Thanks for your time!

Ben
