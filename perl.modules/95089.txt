Hello,


I uploaded a new version of XSLoader, to put the CPAN version
on par with the one included in Perl, but the PAUSE indexer
gave a strange message:

> =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

So, the indexer says the primary maintainer is P5P, this is correct.
But I am co-maint, so I should have the right as well.
Yet the indexer yields a "not indexed because permission missing."

However, it apparently successfully indexed the module:

> Status: Successfully indexed

>      module : XSLoader
>      version: 0.20
>      in file: XSLoader-0.20/XSLoader.pm
>      status : indexed

Yet the global status is "failed."

And when I update my MiniCPAN, I can see the new version:

$ zgrep ^XSLoader modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
XSLoader                           0.20  S/SA/SAPER/XSLoader-0.20.tar.gz

That's=E2=80=A6 weird :D
Not very important or urgent, I guess, as long as modules finally
get their way out, but it sure is a bit strange.
