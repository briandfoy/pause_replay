Hi all,

I'm a newly registered user with PAUSE and would like to upload a new modul=
e
that performs W3C html markup validation using the Test::Builder framework.
My proposed module name is Test::W3C::HTML. This would seem to make sense s=
o
that in the future someone could write Test::W3C::CSS, however, I could als=
o
see how Test::HTML::W3C would make sense as well. Any suggestions or
concerns?

Thank you,

-Victor
