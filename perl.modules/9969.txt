Subject: Module submission DBSchema::Normalizer

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBSchema::Normalizer
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: 1st to 2nd normal form DB table converter
  userid:      GMAX (Giuseppe Maxia)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=132513

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Normalizer works with database tables, using the DBI as
    interface. Currently, it only works with MySQL tables, even though
    the algorithm is general, and it could be applied to other DBDs in
    future versions. After previous discussions in modules@perl.org, it
    has been suggested that DBSchema::Normalizer should be the most
    appropriate namespace and I agreee. The Normalizer is a OO module to
    help the Database Designer to convert database tables from 1st to
    2nd Normal form. The algorithm is mostly SQL based, but the Perl
    interface makes the task much easier than manual coding. Using this
    module, fifteen lines of Perl are enough to accomplish most
    normalization tasks. Fine tuning of input/output is also available.

    Future versions will also include support for common tasks when
    converting from 0th to 1st normal form.

    There hasn't been any such utility available so far in the Free
    Software community.
