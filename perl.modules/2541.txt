I'd say, go find the other untainting module and use that. If it
really doesn't exist, I know that mod_perl ships with soemthing like
that.

On the utf8 stuff I can say that recent discussions on the Perl
Conference made it very obvious that most of it is broken and anything
you put in a module now will not work over the long run. So maybe
better keep that module somewhat private or give it a short lifetime
in the manpage.
