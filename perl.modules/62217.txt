The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Number::Phone::Normalize
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: normalize or pretty-print phone numbers
  userid:      CFAERBER (Claus Färber)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Number-Phone-Normalize

  similar:
    Number::Phone

  rationale:

    Hi! I'd eventually like to release Number::Phone::Normalize which
    converts phone numbers to a consistent format. It's quite
    lightweight, as it only does string matching.

    However, I'm a bit worried about the name. Number::Phone::Normalize
    seems to be the best option given that all other modules related to
    phone numbers start with Number::Phone::* but currently,
    Number::Phone seems to be used exclusively by Number-Phone and
    extensions such as Number-Phone-JP.

  enteredby:   CFAERBER (Claus Färber)
  enteredon:   Sun Sep 14 15:52:39 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Number::Phone::
::Normalize       adphp normalize or pretty-print phone numbers      CFAERBER
