Hi Mark,

I just released Cog.pm to CPAN ( as
http://search.cpan.org/~ingy/Cog-0.03/<http://search.cpan.org/%7Eingy/Cog-0.03/>),
and became aware that the module name 'Cog' is indexed by CPAN to your
module distribution CNC-Cog.

I took a close look at CNC-Cog. It installs a module called CNC::Cog, and
does not install a module called Cog.pm. However, since you packaged the
module as ./Cog.pm instead of lib/CNC/Cog.pm, and since you also have the
line 'package Cog;' in the module, your module got indexed as Cog (as well
as CNC::Cog). Most likely this was not your intention.

This means that when people install 'CNC::Cog' (using the cpan installation
tools) they get your module, but when they install 'Cog' they also get
CNC::Cog, instead of my module 'Cog.pm', which is what they would expect.

I am writing this email to ask your permission for CPAN to index your module
as 'CNC::Cog' and index mine as 'Cog'. Is that OK with you?

Cheers, Ingy
