Hi,

I'm cross-posting this to modules-at-perl.org and poe-at-perl.org in
hopes that the author might see it.

Last night I hacked up improvements on POE::Filter::Stomp (which assumed
that a single chunk of data passed to get_one_start() would contain an
entire Stomp message). I'm going to be using Stomp a lot, so I really
wanted to push that fix, so I tried contacting the author, but the email
listed at search.cpan.org bounced.

I see that the last upload by the author is relatively recent, so I'm
sure he's around somewhere, but I don't think he's doing particularly
great job of maintaining his modules (judging from the cpan-testers
logs) -- and on the other hand here I am *desperately* needing to get
the Stomp stuff working.

So please, if the author is lurking somewhere, please let us know.
Also, I'm willing to take up maintainership of the stomp related modules.

--d

P.S. my version of POE::Filter::Stomp can be found here:
