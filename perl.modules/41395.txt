     why:

    - visual data mining application (starfield display, Perl/Tk
    Class::DBI based)

    - mini e-bookstore + shopping cart (based on Catalyst 5.10)

    - web-based database editor(CGI::Application + HTML::Template)

    - (yet another) mod_perl based MVC framework + sample application
    (it was written to teach mod_perl techniques)

    The code is "ready". These are samples taken from my coming book
    (in Hungarian, 'Application development in Perl', to be published in
    late August - early September 2005, by Panem Ltd., Budapest). The
    modules (API: variable names, method names etc) were written in
    English, only the comments were (are, partially) in Hungarian. Best
    regards,

    Zoltan Barta
