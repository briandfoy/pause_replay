Hi guys,

I created the pause ID of JAMESP back when I worked for PC Xperience, =
LLC, sometime in 2003.  We did some releases of the Business::Payroll =
module and then I transferred from St. Louis, MO to Tempe, AZ and got a =
job (working with mainly perl code) where I was only doing internal =
development and didn't need to make any CPAN releases.

Fast forward 13 years and I wanted to restart contributing to the perl =
community and realized I didn't document my PAUSE password and of course =
it's pointing to my old email account which no longer exists.

What do I need to do to prove to you that I'm who I say I am and get the =
email account updated to this email address, so that I can then request =
the password reset token and be able to receive it?  :)

I still have access to the pcxuser SF.net <http://sf.net/> account, as I =
took over maintenance of that code when PC Xperience closed business in =
2006.  You can see the Business::Payroll perl module is hosted under =
that account and that my name is the Display Name.  If you send an email =
to pcxuser@users.sourceforge.net <mailto:pcxuser@users.sourceforge.net> =
that will go to me and I can then provide whatever code you deem =
necessary to prove I received that email, if that's an acceptable =
solution.

https://sourceforge.net/u/pcxuser/profile/ =
<https://sourceforge.net/u/pcxuser/profile/> - to show ownership of the =
Business::Payroll module (among others).
Click on the Activity link (in the personal tools box) and it will show =
my name instead of just pcxuser.


I also just attended the TPC-2018 in Salt Lake City, which sparked my =
desire to get back into CPAN publishing.

Thanks for your help,

--
