That was my first solution, back when I needed an immediate solution to
keep the previous project from grinding to a halt. Others told me it was
a terrible idea to install a fixed version, even locally. There seems to

first. If anyone has a preferred ordering of the list, please let me
know and I'll enqueue it.
