Hi all,

please give me a COMAINT status on https://metacpan.org/release/XML-Amazon -
its current maintainer ( https://metacpan.org/author/HEDWIG ; he is on the
To: to this message as well ) has made no release since 2010, and XML-Amazon has
many failing CPAN Testers' tests.

My plans for it are:

1. Try to fix the failing tests.

2. Convert from Module-Install to Dist-Zilla.

3. Convert from XML-Simple to XML-LibXML or to a different XML parser.

4. Improve CPANTS Kwalitee and best practices.

5. General cleanups.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
