G'day Nandu, Alligator, and the Perl modules list,

For some time now I've been using Pod::Docbook for the bulk of my 
technical writing.  Indeed, most of Perl Training Australia's training 
manuals are now generated with Pod::Docbook forming an essential part of 
the build process.

However, as you are no doubt aware, there are two Pod::Docbook modules 
available on CPAN.  They have different authors, different version 
numbers, and different features.  One is written by Alligator Descartes, 
and the other by Nandu Shah.  I've been using Nandu's module for my 
work, and steadily submitting patches to rt.cpan.org for both extra 
features and bugfixes.

Unfortunately, I don't think that the current situation is very optimal. 
    The mere mention of Pod::Docbook is ambiguous, and 
http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Pod-DocBook allows bug 
submissions for *both* Pod::Docbook modules.

However Nandu doesn't appear to be a queue maintainer, and so presumably 
isn't getting notification of bug submissions.  That's ironic, since all 
the active bugs and patches refer to Nandu's module.

I would love to try and make things sane.  I'd love for users to see 
*both* modules when they search for 'Pod::Docbook' on CPAN, so they know 
they have a choice.  I'd love for the modules to have different names, 
so they can both be installed, and there aren't any conflicts.  I'd love 
for my patches to get into the official release (or feedback to be 
provided on them), so I don't need to maintain a local fork of 
Pod::Docbook.  I don't mind if I have to maintain a module myself, I'm 
doing that locally anyway.  I'm also thrilled if I *don't* have to 
maintain another module.

One potential way to solve all this is for me to grab Nandu's module, 
roll in my changes, and release it as Pod::Docbook::Plus.  That would 
suit me just fine, and fulfils all my requirements, however I'm not sure 
if it's the best way to do things.  Perhaps it is, but I'm writing to 
you in order to find out.  Is there a way that you can think of which 
would resolve the Pod::Docbook difficulties that we currently see?

I'm particularly interested in the feedback of the modules@perl.org list 
here, who may have encountered this before.  I also beg you to respond 
to all parties when you reply, since modules@perl.org is not an easy 
list to join.

Many thanks, and all the very best,

	Paul
