Subject: Module submission Tk::MARC::Editor

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::MARC::Editor
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Tk widget for editing MARC records
  userid:      DCHRIS (David A. Christensen)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl4lib mailing list

  similar:
    Tk::MARC

  rationale:

    The older Tk::MARC (I also authored that) is a Tk composite widget
    for editing of MARC (bibliographic) records.

    Tk::MARC::Editor is a much less complex and more maintainable
    widget derived from Tk::Text, which accomplishes the same thing as
    Tk::MARC.

    Tk::MARC::Editor is *not* a drop-in replacement, however, so I
    don't want to just designate it as a "new version" of Tk::MARC.

    After some discussion on the perl4lib mailing list, as well as with
    Steffen Mueller (via modules@perl.org), this emerged as the logical
    naming choice.

    So... short version: Tk widget, MARC records, editor thereof :-)

  enteredby:   DCHRIS (David A. Christensen)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb 24 21:02:27 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::MARC::
::Editor          RdpOp Tk widget for editing MARC records           DCHRIS
