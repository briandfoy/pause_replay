The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::RunningTotal
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Time-index multi-dimensional running total
  userid:      EFUNNEKO (Edward Funnekotter)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The purpose of the module is to make it easy to throw a lot of
    event based data into the module and have it easy to retrieve totals
    at specified points of time for a point or volume within the
    multi-dimensional space. It seemed like the most reasonable name for
    this is Data::RunningTotal. If there is a better top-level namespace
    out there, please let me know. I am more than happy to change.

  enteredby:   EFUNNEKO (Edward Funnekotter)
  enteredon:   Sat Nov 14 20:22:58 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::RunningTotal    bdpOp Time-index multi-dimensional running total   EFUNNEKO
