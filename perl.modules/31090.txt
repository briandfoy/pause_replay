The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SDP
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: None
  userid:      WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Actually, never mind the "SDP" name. I mapped out the system a few
    weeks ago and it logically divided itself into two subsystems,
    SDP::Parser and SDP::Generator. I started work on them soon after,
    and they're currently in their alpha stages.

    The back end for both the parser and generator is written in C and
    distributed together via SourceForge:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/sinistersdp/.

  enteredby:   WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 22 22:03:19 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SDP               adhOg None                                         WGDAVIS
