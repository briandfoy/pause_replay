 I have several modules I wish to contribute under the namespace 
 Apache::Pageview, and per PAUSE guidance, I'd like to hear any 
 comments on the suitability of the namespace and/or the existence 
 of this functionality elsewhere.  Included will be the 
 following modules:

	Apache::Pageview
	Apache::Pageview::Logger
	Apache::Pageview::Streamer
	Apache::Pageview::Loader
	Apache::Pageview::Aggregator
	Apache::Pageview::Viewer

 Apache::Timeit is similar in spirit but this is considerably
 more involved, supporting logging, streaming off-host, 
 loading into a DB (via DBI), aggregating, and viewing performance
 charts and summaries (via Chart::GD).  Most of the http log 
 analysis tools I've seen to date focus on counting pageviews.
 The focus here is more on 1) precise measurement (via 
 Time::HiRes) of pageview generation times 2) across a large 
 number of apache clusters in a manner that doesn't negatively
 impact those web servers 3) in a modular, customizable
 end-to-end framework 4) in near real-time 5) with easy
 visualization of pageview generation performance on a continuous 
 basis.

Thanks.

Ed
