     why:

    I have several ideas for modules that might be generally useful.
    The one that I am working on at the moment that is finally
    motivating me to get on PAUSE is a generalization of CPAN::AutoINC
    to cover installation with PPM for ActiveState Perl and to allow
    'force'd installation. Before uploading what I have, I plan to talk
    with the author of CPAN::AutoINC to see if he has any thoughts on
    it.

    I'm also working on a module (or set of modules) that would allow
    you to generate a web site based on templates and sets of data files
    to fill in the templates. Key features would be that it would allows
    spreading a single logical web site across multiple real web sites
    (with the URL's modified as needed by the generator, and automatic
    generation of thumbnail index pages for sets of images to create
    online photo albums. It may have some form of automated uploading of
    generated web site files.
