Subject: Trying to contact author of Pod::Pdf module

Hi,

I have been working on a re-write of the module Pod::Pdf [1] to fix
some parsing and formatting bugs. A couple of months ago I emailed the
original author to enquire if I could take over maintenance of
Pod::Pdf in order to release the new version in the same namespace,
but I did not receive a reply.

Would you be able to contact the author on my behalf, or alternatively
could you transfer ownership of the Pod::Pdf namespace?


Regards,

JJ


[1] The new version is currently at http://perl.jonallen.info/projects/pod2pdf
