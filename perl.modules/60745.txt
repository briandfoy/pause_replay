The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POD::Credentials
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: automaticaly pod footer
  userid:      MPG (Maxim  Grigoriev)
  chapterid:   26 (Documentation)
  communities:

  similar:
    POD::POM or Template::Toolkit but this one is more specific and way
    easier to use

  rationale:

    for automatically generated perl modules its necessary to have the
    same template for the footer pod elements, as of SEE ALSO, LICENSE,
    COPYRIGHT and AUTHOR. it could be done with TT of course or any
    other pod OO parsers but having it as a single independed package
    would be much better. And having to say print
    POD::Credentials->new({ author => 'Joe Doe'})->asString; is way
    easier than anything else. That single line will print the whole
    thing:

    =head1 SEE ALSO

    This module was automatically built by
    L<XML::RelaxNG::Compact::PXB>

    =head1 AUTHOR

    Joe Doe

    =head1 COPYRIGHT

    Copyright (c) 2008, Joe Doe. All rights reserved.

    =head1 LICENSE

    This program is free software. You can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the same terms as Perl itself. =cut ----------------
    the SEE ALSO will be automatically generated by using the name of
    the caller's package

  enteredby:   MPG (Maxim  Grigoriev)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun  4 17:12:49 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POD::
::Credentials     RdpOo automaticaly pod footer                      MPG
