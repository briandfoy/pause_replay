Hi,

I would like to register myself on CPAN/PAUSE so I can upload a module I
am working on.

Name: Chris Phillips
Email: phillips@jive.nfra.nl
Homepage: htpp://www.jive.nl/~phillips
CPAN-ID: CPHIL

Module:

Astro::
::Time       cdpf  General time conversions useful for Astronomers
::Coord      cdpf  Telescope and source coordinate transformations
::Misc       cdpf  Miscellaneous astronomical routines

Although I have separated these into three separate modules, I plan to
distribute them together as both ::Coord and ::Misc depend on ::Time
(as astro.tar.gz?)

The routines cover many functions needed when dealing with astronomical
data (and tables). Routines such as calendar day to Julian dayno and
"Modified Julian Dayno" to "Local Sidereal Time". There are also routines
to parse string representations of angles into degrees/radians/turns.

There routines (packaged as a separate module) have been used by me and
about 5 of my colleges for the last 3 years. I am sure other astronomers
will find them useful. There is a significant overlap with Astro::SLA
but this depends on an external library (SLALIB) which is difficult to
obtain and has a VERY restrictive licence.

The final verifying of the module is not quite finished, but I should have
a beta quality version ready in a week or two.

Regards
Chris Phillips
