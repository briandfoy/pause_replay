Hello,

The LCDproc module implements a network protocol for clients to communicate
with the LCDproc server.  This is something I do not see other modules in
the Device::* namespace do.

The objection I have to the Device::Module::LCDproc namespace is
practicality; that is,  LCDproc itself has nested classes, and a programmer
working with a four-level deep name space may get irritated.  I'd like to
make it easier for them.

I notice that in the hardware related modules here is an AudioCD::Mac; with
that naming scheme, LCD::LCDproc would seem to follow.  May I suggest that
as a comprimise? It's two levels deep, and it falls in the Hardware
category.

Thanks for your consideration,
Wayne
