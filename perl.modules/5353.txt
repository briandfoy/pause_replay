Dear Home Owner:

Do you have a real bad feeling in your stomach because your current mortgage rate is over 8%.  I'm Ramses Frangie 
senior loan officer at 
Lenox Financial Mortgage.  If your mortgage is over $140,000 and the rate is over 8% or if you have an adjustable 
mortgage that has just 
matured, or is going to go up, we will refinance your mortgage on another lower fixed rate and pay all of your closing 
costs down to the last 
dime.  We are not going to roll them in to the loan, we actually pay them for you.  We pay for appraisal, credit report, 
attorneys fees all of it.

If you are currently paying mortgage insurance this is a great way to drop it.  If you have a 2nd mortgage this is a great 
way to consolidate it 
with no closing costs.  If you can go from a high rate to low rate, or consolidate a 2nd mortgage, drop your mortgage 
insurance and do it 
completely for free, then that's the biggest no brainer in the history of man.  By the way if you are purchasing a new 
home or need cash out we 
can also pay all of your closing costs down to the last dime.

This deal seems to good to be true but there really is no cach.  If you need to adjust your current loan scenario, please 
do not hesitate to give 
me a call.  (404) 252-7252 Ext. 17

Sincerely,
Ramses Frangie
Senior Loan Officer
