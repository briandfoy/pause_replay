Err... yeah. I thought your goal was: given an installed module (in some
Perl installation), identify which distfile from BackPAN it came from...
You seemed to by trying to look up just this module in your index; I was
suggesting that you might instead look up the whole set of files
installed, as a more reliable way of identifying the correct distfile.

Probably you're way ahead of me, and I should just butt out... :)
