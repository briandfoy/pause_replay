What I plan to contribute:  Currently I am working on an XML based personal financial application using Perl.  I think that many of the modules I plan on creating will be generally useful.  Presently, I plan on submitting a package of modules that will interface with Huntington Online Banking.  These packages will make facilitate personal finance automation for Huntington users.

Let me know if you need any more information,
Chad
