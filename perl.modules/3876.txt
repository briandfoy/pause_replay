To publish the sources will be on top of my Todo list in the next year
or so. I'll try to modularize and publish in pieces. Currently it's
nothing but a mess.

The reason for your problem is that you have no *.pm file that
contains $VERSION. And when you fix that, the second problem will be
the numbering style. Perl modules still need to be numbered as strings
that look like floating point numbers. The latter will change when
5.6.1 or 5.6.2 is out, it depends on how stable that perl will be wrt
Unicode.
