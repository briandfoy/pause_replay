Not sure. Ask on modules@perl.org, perhaps? Or mail one of the PAUSE
admins? Those that I can think of off the top of my head are Skud
(Kirrily Robert), Tim Bunce, Kurt Starsinic, and Andreas K=F6nig.

You'd have to ask a PAUSE admin.

If a request for module registration is submitted through the web
interface, though, there are two links at the bottom that permit PAUSE
admins to process that request fairly quickly, and comment on it if
necessary, from what I gather. Otherwise, I presume through
https://pause.perl.org/ in some admin-only menu option.

It's not? Funny, I thought that's where I had learned it.

It stands for "Copious Free Time", and is often used when the Free Time
in question is not, in fact, Copious.

Volunteers and tuits are perpetually in short supply, unfortunately :(
