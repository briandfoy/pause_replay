The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PHP::Include
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: PHP Hypertext Processor
  userid:      ESUMMERS (Ed Summers)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    use.perl.org for the moment

  similar:
    Acme::Comment perhaps

  rationale:

    My rationale for suggesting the PHP namespace is that it could
    support future Perl/PHP integration. At the moment I have only
    written PHP::Include which provides a facility for reading simple
    PHP configuration files from Perl. The framework inside PHP::Include
    could easily be extended to provide new grammars that parse more
    PHP.

    There is a great deal of opportunity to create Perl libraries for
    interacting with PHP applications/code...and a top level PHP
    namespace would be the logical place to put them.

The resulting entry would be:

PHP::
::Include         bdphp PHP Hypertext Processor                      ESUMMERS
