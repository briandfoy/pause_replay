The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::LogFile
  DSLIP:       adprp
  description: Simple Log Autoformating
  userid:      CREIN (Chris Reinhardt)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Lived on CPAN briefly as Tie::Log.

  similar:
    Log::Logger Log::Simple

  rationale:

    I choose the this namespace, because it is a tied interface to a
    log file. I was tempted to throw simple in there somewhere, but it
    didn't seem needed. As far as I know, there aren't any tied
    interfaces like this for basic logging. At least, none on CPAN that
    I could find.

  enteredby:   CREIN (Chris Reinhardt)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 12 21:59:44 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::LogFile         adprp Simple Log Autoformating                     CREIN
