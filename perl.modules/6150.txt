Name: Aaron J Mackey
Email: amackey@virginia.edu
ID: AMACKEY

Planned contributions: Data::Encrypted (see previous email RFC),
DBIx::Tree improvements (with Brian Jepson, already ongoing), DBIx::Graph
(akin to DBIx::Tree, but more general graph algorithms and utility
functions to help deal with parts-explosion problems, etc).  Also
Acme::Encrypt (source filter a la Acme::Bleach that encrypts your entire
script ... if using RSA private key mechanism, can make it only runnable
by yourself, or whomever's public key encrypted it in the first place;
otherwise, if using some other CBC::* encryption, you'll need to provide
the password to run it.  Think Data::Encrypted meets Acme::Bleach).

Thanks,

-Aaron Mackey
