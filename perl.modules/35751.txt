Sure, I see your point.  I initially reserved the top-level "Workflow" 
namespace, sat on it too long, Chris wrote a module named "Workflow" 
without checking PAUSE, and I, in a fit of being a nice guy, ceded the 
name.  And yeah, Workflow::wftk wouldn't kill me, although I'd have to 
rename everything *again*.  I'm just hoping, is all.
