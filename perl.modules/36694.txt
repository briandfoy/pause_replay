I've added a section to the FAQ:

=head1 Can I use this with web servers other than Apache?

Absolutely. Set up a configuration file with your vhost information in  
it and point logm
ster at it. The format for each vhost is as follows:

   <VirtualHost>
     ServerName www.tnpi.biz
     ServerAlias www.thenetworkpeople.biz *.tnpi.biz
     DocumentRoot /home/tnpi.biz/html
   </VirtualHost>

Create as many vhost directives as you'd like and logmonster will parse  
them all. The file format is the same as Apache's so feel free to use #  
for comments, etc. When you make changes to your web server, update  
this file as well. All the other rules apply equally, you'll want to  
use Apache's ELF with the virtual hostname appended to the logs and  
pipe the logs to cronolog for reasons mentioned elsewhere.

=cut

Now people without Apache can use it.
