The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TeX::Picture
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: (La)TeX code to pictures conversion
  userid:      MRTS (Mart Sõmermaa)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    TeX::Picture converts LaTeX code to images. Mostly intended for
    formula generation in template tools like Template::Toolkit,
    HTML::Embperl etc, but it is obviously useful in other contexts as
    well.It uses currently LaTeX and Image::Magick for conversion
    (future revisions will add support for other engines like mimetex
    and Ghostscript).

    Generated pictures are cached using the MD5 hash of the LaTeX code
    for filenames to guarantee that conversion will take place only
    once.

    There are no Perl modules with this functionality. The module was
    inspired by Wikipedia that uses TeX for maths and by mimetex.

The resulting entry would be:

TeX::
::Picture         RdpOp (La)TeX code to pictures conversion          MRTS
