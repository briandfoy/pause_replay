The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LastFM
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Interface to the Last.FM webservices.
  userid:      JKR (Jonas Kramer)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    If needed, I will create a chat room on irc.freenode.org.

  similar:
    WebService::LastFM WebService::Audioscrobbler

  rationale:

    I think the LastFM as a rootlevel namespace is needed because
    Last.FM provides different kinds of services. Modules implementing
    interfaces to those services should take place in this namespace.
    I'm currently writing a bunch of object-oriented modules
    implementing two of those services:

    LastFM::Post - for posting track data to Last.FM (like
    WebService::Audioscrobbler and WebService::LastFM, but implementing
    the new protocol version)

    LastFM::Post::Track - represents a track that can be posted to
    Last.FM (needed for LastFM::Post)

    LastFM::Radio - represents a Last.FM radio stream

    LastFM::Radio::Session - implements the initial authentication to
    the web service and holds all data needed for further communication
    with the server within the session

    LastFM::Radio::Playlist - implements the playlist of a radio stream
    (LastFM::Radio), including downloading of the XSPF playlist from the
    web service and parsing it

    LastFM::Radio::Playlist::Track - represents a track in a radio
    playlist and implements methods for receiving the MP3 track from the
    web service

    More modules can be written to implement more of the services
    provided by Last.FM, e.g. reading and storing music tags, requesting
    lists of artists and tracks that match given criteria (e.g. artists
    that are similar to artist $foo, etc.), receiving and parsing data
    feeds and so on. Such modules should also be placed in LastFM::
    instead of having lots of variations of WebService::LastFMSomething
    modules.

The resulting entry would be:

LastFM            cdpOg Interface to the Last.FM webservices.        JKR
