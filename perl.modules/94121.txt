Hello,

Today I uploaded to PAUSE a distribution that contained at root level a =
folder called =E2=80=98fakelibs=E2=80=99, which contained fake modules =
intended for testing. PAUSE then tried to index them and I received a =
report informing that =E2=80=98Some::Module=E2=80=99 (one of my fake =
modules) cannot be indexed because it=E2=80=99s already with someone =
else.

Also, the rest of my =E2=80=9CSome:Module::*=E2=80=9D files got indexed =
and I got the namespace for them, which I=E2=80=99ll now have to remove =
from my user id.

I=E2=80=99m using module-starter and adding those files to the manifest =
because otherwise they=E2=80=99re not included in the tar with =
=E2=80=9Cmake dist=E2=80=9D.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Thanks in advance,

Zarabozo @ cpan.org
