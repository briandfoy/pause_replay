Unfortunately, no. I'm sorry for not replying to your earlier mail. I
read it, wanted to reply, forgot it, lost it. Sorry.

However, I still get this:

cpan[1]> i /AFS/
[...]
Distribution    NOG/AFS-2.4.0.tar.gz
[...]
Module    AFS                    (N/A)

and

cpan[2]> install AFS
Running install for module 'AFS'

  The module AFS isn't available on CPAN.

  Either the module has not yet been uploaded to CPAN, or it is
  temporary unavailable. Please contact the author to find out
  more about the status. Try 'i AFS'.


I'm not sure what causes this. Andreas, do you have any further insight?

Best regards,
Steffen
