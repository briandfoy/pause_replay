The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Shm::Simple
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: String data in SysV shared memory.
  userid:      KCODY (K Cody)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    IPC::ShareLite

  rationale:

    This class is the spawn of another, broader IPC::Shm project, which
    aims to provide complete and intuitive access to PERL data shared
    (or bequeathed) between processes.

    That project originally used IPC::ShareLite as its lowest-level
    interface to SysV shared memory. As the code progressed,
    inadequacies in IPC::ShareLite's API became apparent:

    1) Can only use ipckey's. No ability to attach to a shmid from
    PERL, even though the C implementation itself does so. This results
    in severe pollution of a 32-bit integer namespace... unfriendly
    territory to begin with.

    2) The existence of a sharelite_unlock() synonym at this layer
    caused a major bug in sharelite_lock(LOCK_EX) to go undiscovered.

    3) Redundant constructor arguments (create,exclusive).

    4) Obtuse segment removal interface.

    Of course, actually tearing through all the code revealed a few
    more implementation shortcomings:

    1) No real validation that IPC::ShareLite actually created the
    shared memory segment it attached to, just the number '1' in the
    segment header.

    2) Inconsistent / broken error reporting. Even when the C code
    appears to check error conditions, somehow only -EAGAIN ever gets
    back to PERL.

    3) The sharelite_version code doesn't seem to do anything about
    wraparound, and it was coded as an unsigned int.

    IPC::Shm::Simple aims to solve all of these issues, and provide a
    clean and consistent API for IPC::Shm to complete.

    Some of the changes will, of course, break existing IPC::ShareLite
    users, thus are being made in a new module. At some later date, if
    demand arises, a compatibility class would be trivial.

    Namespace rationale: The usefulness of this (and the prior) module
    is to store simple (string or numeric) data in SysV shared memory.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::Shm::
::Simple          adpOp String data in SysV shared memory.           KCODY
