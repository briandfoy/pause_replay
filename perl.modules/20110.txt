It means that the PAUSE indexer does not pick up the namespaces
"threads" and "threads::shared" that are contained in your files
lib/forks.pm and lib/forks/shared.pm respectively. If you visit the
"View Permission" page on PAUSE, you find out that these two
namespaces are co-owned by Artur and Jarkko.

If this is what you want, all is OK, you need not react to this email.

Please let me know how the wording of the notification could be
improved to avoid confusion.

META.yml support is currently in preparation. I don't know when it
will start to influence the indexer.
