Hi Dmitry,

> Last week I tried to reset my CPAN account (DMOW) with =
/pause/query?ACTION=3Dmailpw. PAUSE said the token was in its way, but =
25 hrs after it did't arrive, Then I tried once again, that time I =
received the message about "less than 6 hours", what was considerably =
inaccurate. A few minutes ago I pressed the same button again, yet =
nothing cames.

As mentioned in the off-list email, your account was configured with =
both a public and a private email address.

As requested, I have cleared the private email address, so you should =
now be able to reset your password.

> In fact, all I want is to pass the ownership of my abandoned module, =
Spreadsheet::XLSX, to Mike Blackwell (http://search.cpan.org/~mikeb/) =
who seem to have some energy and new ideas to maintain it.

I=E2=80=99ve transferred ownership of the Spreadsheet::XLSX to Mike =
(MIKEB).

Cheers,
Neil
