Hi... I'm the author of PDF::Labels and Math::RPN.  I have been trying
to
get Math::RPN into the modules list, and I must be doing something
wrong.
I've uploaded it successfully, but when I attempt to modify it's
metadata,
PAUSE doesn't allow me to even select Math::RPN, it only knows about
PDF::Labels.

Perhaps I'm just not waiting long enough, but it's been several weeks
since
the first upload of Math::RPN.  I'm hoping that you can tell me what
I've
done wrong, or let me know how long I should expect it to take between
uploading a module and getting it published.

Owen
