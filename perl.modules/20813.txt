The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::RecordParser
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Read record-oriented files
  userid:      KCLARK (Ken Y. Clark)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://archive.develooper.com/module-authors@perl.org/msg00758.html

  similar:
    Text::CSV Text::xSV DBD::CSV

  rationale:

    I'm calling it "Text::RecordParser" as it was inspired by Text::xSV
    (which itself was an extension of Text::CSV), so it seems to fit
    well enough under the "Text::" namespace. It's designed to read
    record-oriented data (where records aren't limited to
    comma-and-newline-delimited type), so I thought about
    "RecordParser." I don't really see adding the write capabilities of
    something like DBD::CSV (even if I did steal many other ideas for my
    module from DBI), so I think it's safe to just call it a "parser."

  enteredby:   KCLARK (Ken Y. Clark)
  enteredon:   Thu May  1 15:51:02 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::RecordParser    RdpOp Read record-oriented files                   KCLARK
