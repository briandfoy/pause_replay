The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Security::LibPath
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Allows setting of @INC from config file
  userid:      JAMESODEN (James Olin Oden)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Basically, for good reasons perl only allows setuid programs to
    either use "use lib" or the compiled in values for @INC to search
    for modules. This module allows admins and developers to specify a
    config file (or config files) containing library paths, that are
    then used to alter @INC. This is very much in the same vein as ld's
    use of /etc/ld.so.conf. I have written some code that implents this,
    and it seems to work fine, but it obviously needs some more work to
    handle things like taint checking and further checks on the config
    file(s) specified (for instance it now checks that uid and gid are 0
    and 0 respectively and the perms are 0444, but checks on the
    ownership and permissions of the parent directory are probably in
    order).

    So since it is trying to allow for configuration of the search
    module/library search path in a secure way, I choose
    Security::LibPath as its name space (but any other suggestions are
    most welcome).

    Cheers...james
