The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Marpa
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Earley's Algorithm, with improvements
  userid:      JKEGL (Jeffrey Kegler)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Best write it and then do the talking, no?

  similar:
    Parse::Earley, Parse::Yapp

  rationale:

    This module is Earley's algorithm, improved based on recent
    research. Earley's original paper had a bug, and the first fixes
    made his algorithm, already slow, so slow that it was useable only
    in rare cases. In their 2002 paper, Aycock and Horspool outline a
    way to combine LR(0) parsing with Earley's. The result is free of
    the original bug and seems to run at speeds practical for most
    applications. This module will incorporate further improvements to
    the Earley/Aycock/Horspool algorithm, of my own device. I also
    intend implementation features that will make this a very handy,
    general-purpose tool.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
::Marpa           cdpOp Earley's Algorithm, with improvements        JKEGL
