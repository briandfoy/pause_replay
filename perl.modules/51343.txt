The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Traverse::ParseTree
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: iterators and getters for xml-access
  userid:      MBUSIK (Martin Bušík)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    XML::TokeParser

  rationale:

    XML::Traverse::ParseTree - A module for accessing contents of a
    parsed xml document.

    One extreme of xml processing is the usage of a DOM-like API. (The
    whole content is held in memory, each Node has links to parents,
    childs and siblings) The other extreme of xml processing is the
    usage of a SAX-like API (only that is held in memory, what the
    application developer decided. It is less flexible in terms of
    variable structures)

    XML::Traverse::ParseTree offers a way between these two extremes.
    The whole content is held in memory (as a result of a
    XML::Parser-run) Access occurs by means of iterators and getters.
    The access paths are specified by means of xslt (-like) expressions.

    Helpful if cases, when there are no static structures (so xml <->
    data mapping would not make sense) or the access paths are specified
    dynamically, e.g. they depend on the content (so SAX-approach would
    be unhandy to manage)

The resulting entry would be:
