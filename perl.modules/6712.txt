I deleted two borken versions of my module from my directory, and PAUSE
says:

Scheduled for deletion (already expired at Mon, 23 Jul 2001 13:59:43 GMT)

But the files are still there.

Is there something else I have to do?  These files won't work, and I don't
want people to download them.

It seems to have done a partial deletion from some directories (for
instance, the modules-by-name directory) where it deleted two of the four
files I have chosen.

The odd thing is, one of the two files wasn't scheduled for deletion until
Thu, 26 Jul 2001 14:21:18 GMT.

Has PAUSE gone mad, or have I?

Thanks...
