Hi,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where people =
are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

You all had permissions on Aspect::PointCut, which is now no longer used =
(Aspect::Pointcut being the name in use). To remove the conflict I =
dropped these permissions. You also had permissions on =
Aspect::PointCut::{AndOp,BinOp,NotOp,OrOp} and =
Aspect::Pointcut::{AndOp,BinOp,NotOp,OrOp}. Reading through the Changes =
file, I could see that these modules were dropped some years back, and =
are no longer indexed. So I=E2=80=99ve dropped the conflicting =
permissions on these pairs of modules.

You still retain all the permissions you had for the modules that are =
still indexed on CPAN =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ve just dropped permissions on =
old namespaces that are no longer used.

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let these sort of conflicts arise now, so I=E2=80=99=
m working through the cases that remain, to make life easier for tool =
writers. In most cases I=E2=80=99m checking first, but these changes =
seemed obvious and safe, given the history of the Aspect dist. But =
please shout if you see any problems with this.

Cheers,
Neil=
