Hello all,

I'd like to ask to help me with this little failure.
I know the rules for versioning on CPAN, but I think there's a special situation:
Prima modules have no individual version, but this one Prima::DetailedOutline
was imported by a contributor, and had v0.01 for a while until I removed it.
But now it doesn't get indexed because of this.

Can you possibly help resolving this?

Thank you in advance,
Dmitry Karasik
