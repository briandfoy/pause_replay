Specifics about the incident are published at perlmonks.org. There are
no indications that pause.perl.org was compromised but the fact that
many people use their passwords at more than one occasion was reason
enough to warn you.

The fact that your browser warns twice about the certificate has
nothing to do with that. The document modules/04pause.html on the CPAN
has some more to say about the certificate used and how to best deal
with it.
