Hi. I'd like the CPAN ID SRL, or SLANDRUM if you aren't giving out
3-letter IDs anymore.

I'm a release manager for the Reefknot project, which is doing
shared calendaring tools in Perl. for more information on the work
our team's doing, see http://reefknot.sourceforge.net. To see public
discussion about the work we're doing, see
http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/7859/0/ . We're
the current maintainers of Net::ICal (by EBUSBOOM), and we'll be
releasing Net::ITIP and Net::IMIP within a few months, hopefully. 

Net::
::ICal		ampO  	RFC2445 (iCalendar) protocol tools
::ITIP		cmp0	RFC2446 tools for scheduling events
::IMIP		imp0	RFC2447 tools for event scheduling 

Reefknot::
::Server	imp0	RFC2445 calendar server
::Client	impO	RFC2445 calendar client 
::* 		impO	Tools for shared calendar construction
