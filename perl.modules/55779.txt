Test::StubGenerator bdpOp  Automatically generate stub test code for  
your code.    KCOWGILL

Test::StubGenerator attempts to analyze a given source file and  
automatically create testing stubs suitable for unit testing your  
code.  It makes use of PPI in order to parse your code, looking for  
constructors and methods in modules, and subroutines in scripts.

This module gives a nice leg-up to legacy code maintainers for  
creating unit tests more easily where tests didn't previously exist.
