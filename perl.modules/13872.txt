i don't see how "Meta" is better than anything else, especially since
"meta" already has special meaning in this domain (as in meta-data) and
should be available for general use (rather than your specific one).

the big problem is the PAUSE won't let anyone else use it.  i don't
see a problem with that right now though.

other than that, namespaces like Meta::Archive::Tar seem misleading.
it's not a "meta" class---indeed, it's just the opposite, a derived
class. 

i'd rather see you contribute to the projects already out there than
create an entirely new thing.
