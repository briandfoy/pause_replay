The reason why this module was never uploaded (and would most likely 
need an update and maybe an owner who does any Windows administration 
work) is that it depends on my patches to the long long "deprecated" 
Win32::Registry and is incompatible with the curent version of 
Win32::Registry on CPAN.

The patch was "queued for integration into the next release of
libwin32." by Gurusamy Sarathy on 22 Jun 2003.

In either case if there was a chance to get the Win32::Registry 
updated and (if possible) transferred to me, I'd like to finaly get 
the patch (backward, but not forward compatible) merged and would 
upload Win32::FileType and if time permits update with the current 
changes to the way file type (file extension to applications and 
actions) mapping handled in Windows.

The update of Win32::Registry would be great also because the 
Win32::Daemon::Simple (framework for Windows services/daemons) also 
depends on the patch.

The patch is at http://jenda.krynicky.cz/#Win32::Registry2 including 
complete test.
