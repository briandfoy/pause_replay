From: pete@flatline.org.uk (Peter Clay)


I'd like a PAUSE ID, please. I am Peter Clay <pete@flatline.org.uk> (I'd
prefer that that email address not be put on the public WWW), and I'd like
the ID "PJC50" (my userid from Cambridge).

I'm planning to contribute a module which allows people to write programs
that navigate web sites automatically, called something like
WWW::AutoBrowser.

Pete
