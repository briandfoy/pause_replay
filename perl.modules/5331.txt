Over the years we have defended the Rootnamespace territory with knife
and fire in order

- to keep the lib/ root directory tidy

- help people to associate at least a tiny something with a module's name

- overcome the mentality of developers who consider two-letter
  acronyms appropriate in this diversifying world of software. Nobody
  can keep in mind what two-letter acronyms stand for.

- reserve rootnamespace for later use when people have ideas for
  modules that need a couple of namespaces and a rootlevel namespace
  is urgently needed to pull the group together.

The reasoning is still there, but knife and fire are worn out. On the
flipside, most developers nowadays see the advantage of having more
than one hint in the name.

Yes, please take the discussion there. We prefer if we have to tweak
namespaces as little as possible, and when a discussion somewhere else
has found a consensus, we are more than happy to accept it.
