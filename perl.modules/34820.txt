Subject: Module submission Language::Zcode

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::Zcode
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Parse and translate Z-code story files
  userid:      AKARGER (Amir Karger)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    rec.arts.int-fiction, perl6-internals@lists.perl.org (eventually
    perl6-compilers)

  similar:
    Games::Rezrov

  rationale:

    Z-code is the machine language for the Z-machine, the virtual
    machine used by Infocom games (and their later descendants, programs
    written in Inform).

    This module parses Z-code files, and then allows the user to work
    with the pieces. The most obvious work is to translate the files to
    other languages, such as Perl or PIR.

    The module belongs in Language::, because it is an interface to a
    language (Z-code), rather than a way to play games.

    Games::Rezrov is a Perl module that creates an instance of the
    Z-machine and runs Z-code files, aka an interpreter. Language::Zcode
    (which stole lots of code from Games::Rezrov for the parsing and
    Perl Z-machine implementation) is for manipulating Z-code, not
    specifically for playing the games.

The resulting entry would be:

Language::
::Zcode           adpOp Parse and translate Z-code story files       AKARGER
