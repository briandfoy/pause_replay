PAUSE does not yet support version strings and version objects. As a
workaround I would suggest writing 3.000001 which in fact is exactly
the same thing but does not need magic. Please note that PAUSE
evaluates your $VERSION line in a safe compartement which does not
allow disk access and consequently does not work with 'use version'.

I have done extensive studies how the support of version.pm on PAUSE
will work and have not yet found a satisfying solution. But I'm close,
I just need a few tuits to finish the investigations.
