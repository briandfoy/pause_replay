Mighty Module overlords,

	I'm vying to be added as a co-maintainer to the NetPacket module.  I've 
contacted the last maintainer, ATRAK, last February and she agreed to 
pass the torch to me (correspondence is below).  So, if anyone would be 
so kind as to bestow me with the relevant permissions, I'd be eternally 
grateful. :-)

Joy,
`/anick (pause id: YANICK)

Dear Yanick,

Yes, I had to close down _@r4k.net <mailto:_@r4k.net> eventually, since
I got too much spam for even spam filters to handle any more :(

I'm not maintaining NetPacket anymore, as I do very different things
nowadays. If you would like to become the maintainer of Net:Packet that
would be great. I think you can do so on CPAN without my consent. If you
do, just ask me again. Please indicate clearly from which version you
took over maintainership and what things you have changed starting in
this version. Good luck!

Cheers,
Steph

     Hi,

            If you are not Stephanie Wehner, maintainer of
     the Perl module NetPacket, all my apologies for the
     distraction.

            If, on the other hand, you are that
     Stephanie: Hi! :-) Sorry to use another email than the
     one given in the Perl module (_@r4k.net), but it
     seems to bounce.  Please find below the original
     email I sent to you and Tom.  In a nutshell,
     I'd really want to see some patches made to NetPacket,
     and I'm inquiring if there'd be ways to see this
     happen.

     Joy,

     Hi,

            I'm using your wonderful module NetPacket at work.
     Unfortunately, bug 7010
     (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=7010) has
     painfully bit me in the behind.  There is a patch in the
     bug report.  If I was to implement it and send it to you
     wrapped in a new version of NetPacket, would you be willing
     to update the module on CPAN?  Alternatively, if you don't
     work on NetPacket, I'd be willing to become a co-maintainer
     of the module...

     Joy,
     `/anick
