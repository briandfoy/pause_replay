I'm putting the finishing touches on an email obfuscation perl script
that inputs an email address and outputs one of (a number) of
obfuscated email links/images... what category would you suggest?

Thank you,

all can see them. He cannot bury his mistakes in the grave like the
doctors. He cannot argue them into thin air or blame the judge like
the lawyers. He cannot, like the architect, cover his failure with
trees or vines. He cannot, like the politician, blame his opponents
and hope the people will forget. The engineer simply cannot deny that
he did it. If his works do not work, he is damned forever"
