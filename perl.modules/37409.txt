Indeed: "Number" can be in there too.  It could be

   Test::Number::Precision
   Test::Number::Epsilon
   Test::Number::Delta

"Float" isn't really a good descriptor though.  Perl doesn't
have a float data type.  Your module can easily test any
numbers to see if they are within a certain precision of
each other.

It would be nice if your test function had an optional
parameter for the precision, too.  Right now you have it
as part of the import.
