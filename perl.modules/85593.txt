Request to register new user

     why:

    I'm not sure what I want to contribute. I want to help out though.
    Maybe I can eventually contribute something cool, like preaction's
    Beam::Wire, or maybe I can take over maintenance of a module. I'm
    tired of not being part of the community.

    Thanks for reading.
