Bookman Marketing has developed an exclusive list of over 1000 independent
film makers.

Independent artists made films like The Blair Witch Project and Bowling for
Columbine.  This is a unique opportunity to introduce your book to the
people that make movies.

The regular price for this service is $299, but for the month of November
we are offering a 20% discount.  For just $239.20, we will write a powerful
promotion about your book and send it to our exclusive list of film makers.
