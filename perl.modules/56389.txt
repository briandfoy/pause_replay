Hi PAUSE team,

i uploaded a module

http://search.cpan.org/~astiller/dbd_rdb-1_16/

but for some reason it does not appear under the name DBD::RDB. I remember,
that i tried to pack this kit in the documented way using this name. And it
does work if you search for it, but the browsing does not. For me it would
be ok to release the name into the free. But the module itself should be
kept somehow.

Regards
Andreas
