                        URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE.

My name is Dada the Son of late General Robert Guei, the Ex-Military head of =
State of Ivory Coast, who was murdered along with the Interior Minister on =
the 19th of September 2002 (You can visit =
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm for complete report on this =
incident). I contacted you because of my need to deal with persons whom my =
family and I have had no previous personal relationships. Since the murder of =
my father, I have been subjected to all sorts of harassment and intimidation =
with lots of negative reports emanating from the Government and the press =
about my family. The present Government has also ensured that our bank =
accounts are frozen and all assets seized.

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the =
transfer of the sum of Twenty Seven Million United States Dollars =
(US$27,000,000.00) being the very last of my family fund in my possession and =
control, after the murder of my father the Federal Government seized all our =
properties and our accounts both local and international was frozen.

My only hope now is this cash that my father carefully packaged and deposited =
as artifacts with a Security/Finance Company in the Netherlands. The said sum =
can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended beneficiary. The security =
company based on my instructions will release the fund to you and you will be =
presented as my partner who will be fronting for me in area of viable and =
profitable business.

To show my preparedness and appreciation to carry-out this business with you, =
25% of the total sum will be your share and 20% commission of the proceeds =
realized from the investment of this fund will also be yours, also 5% is to =
be set aside for any eventual cost that might arise as the transaction =
proceeds. I need your full support and co-operation for the success of this =
transaction. I plead with you to treat this issue confidential and urgent =
because it is delicate and it demands a great degree of secrecy. I am =
presently in the Netherlands seeking Asylum.
I would want you to reach me through my telephone number or the fax number =
above if you are interested to assist me. I sincerely will appreciate your =
response.

I wait to hear from you.

Regards,

Dada Guei.
