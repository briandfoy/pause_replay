I saw that my earlier requested alias "MAGNUS" was taken, which I
first had missed. New user-id is "BIGMANK".

Description:   I'm planning to contribute the following projects, (if
               and) when they are ready for release. This is depending
               on the interest from others with interest in thoose
               things (like "pod-people" etc...)

  1)  [MAYBE]  An updated perldoc (depending on Jarkko Hietaniemi) (in
               a modularized form with Perl::Doc).
  2)  [MAYBE]  Pod::Pseudo::Handle - Tied handle specialized for
               Pod::Parser-children.
  3)  [MAYBE]  Pod::Meta - Parser of '=3Dfor meta' and '=3Dfor http'
               sections (for charset-info etc...).
  4)  [ONEDAY] Certain swedish modules, like Sv::Sort, Sv::Date etc...

  5)  [MAYBE]  Related modules (and scripts) to the stuff listed above.
