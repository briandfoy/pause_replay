The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Service::Upcoming::API
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple interface to Upcoming.org's API
  userid:      GKNAUSS (Greg Knauss)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://upcoming.org/news/archives/2005/04/18/api_and_/index.php

  similar:
    Flickr::API

  rationale:

    This module offers an easy-to-use interface to Upcoming.org's
    Web-based API. (Upcoming is a public calendar of events with
    comments, event tracking, tags and invitation capabilities.)

    The module uses a new namespace in the anticipation that other
    sites will soon start offering APIs and other Web services, and
    following the "Flickr::API" model would badly pollute the root
    namespace. "WWW::Service" is intended to hold any other simlar
    modules in the future, both for other sites and generalized
    libraries. (Flickr::API could become WWW::Service::Flickr::API. A
    Freetag client library [http://www.getluky.net/freetag] --
    independent of which site was implementing Freetag -- would be
    WWW::Service::Freetag::API. A Freetag work-alike on the server side
    would be WWW::Service::Freetag. And so on.)

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Service::Upcoming::
::API             bdpOp Simple interface to Upcoming.org's API       GKNAUSS
