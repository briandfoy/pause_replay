The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::ArchiveSite
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Automates archiving of entire web sites
  userid:      NICKBAKER (Nicholas C. Baker)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTTP::GetImages

  rationale:

    I named it HTTP::ArchiveSite because it archives websites. The
    uniqueness of my approach is that it modifies the downloaded files
    so that they are browsable locally, by making links to other
    spidered files relative, and links to non-spidered files absolute.
    Without the disclaimer at the top of each page, you'd never know you
    were browsing offline. At least that's the idea, it still has a few
    kinks to be worked out.

    The whole project was inspired by my work for the Internet Public
    Library (www.ipl.org) which links to many outside URLs and suffers
    from the pain of Link Rot. With this program they could provide
    their users with cached copies of the sites they link to.

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::
