Dear Andy,

unless Adam and I are mistaken, you volunteered to take care of handing 
out co-maintenance bits of Nick Ing-Simmons' modules to interested 
developers.

I'm glad Slaven ReziÄ‡ volunteered (well, kind of) to do some Tk 
maintenance. He has several outstanding patches, one of which makes Tk 
compile under win32/Strawberry Perl. He has been tending at least part 
of the RT queue for some time and I am pretty sure that being able to 
close stale tickets will help here, too.

Could you make Slaven (co?)maintainer for Tk, please?

Thank you for taking care of this sad task.

Best regards,
Steffen
