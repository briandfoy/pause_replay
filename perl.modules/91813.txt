The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Backup::EZ
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Easy backups using rsync and hardlinks
  userid:      GRAVATTJ (John Gravatt)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Backup::EZ is backup software that is designed to be as easy to use
    as possible, yet provide a robust backup solution. I haven't been
    able to find an open-source backup solution that worked how I wanted
    it to. There are no shortage of options, but the ones I found store
    the data in a format that isn't straight-forward. With this, if you
    can use ls and rsync/scp, you can do a restore. No muss, no fuss,
    just works.

    I wrote it several years ago and have been using it since then with
    great success. I decided it was time to offer it to the community
    via CPAN.
