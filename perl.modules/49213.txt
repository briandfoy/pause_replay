Eric,

backpan is a kind of read-only memory for everything that went through
the PAUSE: for good or for bad. The rationale can be read on Leon
Brocard's description of Parse::BACKPAN::Packages:

"The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
collection of Perl code. However, in order to keep CPAN relatively
small, authors of modules can delete older versions of modules to only
let CPAN have the latest version of a module. BACKPAN is where these
deleted modules are backed up. It's more like a full CPAN mirror, only
without the deletions."

At least once, I found useful to have access for an older module
version with less dependencies to install - one that the author has
deleted from CPAN, but which Backpan did not allow to go away.

Regards,
Adriano Ferreira
