The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Localized
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Specify which part of your code shall log
  userid:      ERWAN (Erwan Lemonnier)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    between members of Stockholm.pm

  similar:
    Log::Log4perl Log::Dispatcher

  rationale:

    This namespace registration should replace the previous one
    regarding modules Log::Debug and Log::Verbosity.

    After much discussion regarding the module's final name comes the
    following proposal:

    Log::Localized provides you with an interface for logging messages
    where you can decide via which parts of the code will log, and with
    which verbosity. The actual logging mechanism is handled by
    Log::Dispatch.

    Log::Localized provides mechanisms for you to specify which
    programs, modules or even functions or methods should log, how much
    each of them should log, and to which dispatchers. The main
    mechanism to specify those logging rules is via configuration files,
    but they can also be set via global variables or inside the running
    code.

    Log::Localized is designed for simplicity of use and with default
    settings that make it usable 'out of the box'. Yet it's
    configuration system let's you direct your application's logging
    flow in a flexible and very fine-grained way.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::Localized       Rdpfp Specify which part of your code shall log    ERWAN
