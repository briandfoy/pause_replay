Thanks for the heads up! No, it is not related to 5.12.0 RC4. Short
explanation: the upload in February was not indexed because it contained
world writable files or directories. "Spring cleaning" inspired the
author to remove all old versions. Ergo: module gone.

I fixed the problem by rewriting the indexer. From now on it creates a
fixed up version of the tarball without world writables whenever it
encounters such a case. PAUSE ecosystem will then pick up the new file
and index it unless there are other errors preventing that.

Reindexing was tried several times but always failed with the same
effect: pause refused to index based on the fact that there were world
writables in it. The reindexing feature of PAUSE now contains the
fix-it-up part. I have run it and SADAHIRO's directory now contains the
fixed-up file. I expect that the indexer will pick it up during the day
and index the replacement file
(Unicode-Normalize-1.06-withoutworldwriteables.tar.gz)

I gave it the same treatment. If the two files are not indexed in the
next 12 hours I'll have to fix my fix another try.
