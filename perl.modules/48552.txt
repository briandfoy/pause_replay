The Catalyst namespace is currently a tangled mess, due to releases by
different people.
As Catalyst release manager, I need to clean up the namespace permissions, =
I
will therefore
be applying for module registration for various cpan distributions related
to the project. Likewise
others will register their modules and transfer them to me.

Appologies for the flood, just approve them as they come in.
