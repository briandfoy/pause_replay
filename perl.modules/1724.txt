Subject: Request for Namespace: AXDTK

The Apache XML Delivery Toolkit is a new set of modules designed for
delivering XML to clients in a variety of formats using nothing but W3C
standards. The idea is very similar to Cocoon, but AXDTK features a much
tighter binding to Apache, and much more standards oriented (Cocoon
implements some features by breaking the standards).

This is a request for the AXDTK::* namespace. I would like to use this
namespace rather than continue to fill up the already over-used Apache::*
namespace. AXDTK intends to implement many stylesheet languages and each
one will fill another name, so using Apache::* is really not an
option. Apache::AXDTK::* is one alternative, but I think the depth and the
utility of this package deserves its own namespace.

About AXDTK: http://xml.sergeant.org/axdtk/
About Cocoon: http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/

I know modules@perl.org is a mostly read-only list, so if I don't hear
anything back within the week I'll start uploading to CPAN.
