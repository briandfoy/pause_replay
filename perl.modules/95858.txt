As a further update, ...

This exercise also inspired me to make a new Locale::KeyedText major release, 
the first one in a decade, as a revitalization effort of sorts.

http://search.cpan.org/~duncand/Locale-KeyedText-2.0.0/

The new version is functionally equivalent to the prior one, and is "done", but 
the implementation and documentation and testing and metadata are now more in 
line with modern good practices.

Specifically relevant to this thread, I now have an explicit no_index clause in 
the Makefile, which seems to be doing its job.  So PAUSE is now instructed by 
that to ignore modules in t/ and examples/ and only index those in lib/.  The 
above url reflects this.

I don't know if anyone will actually find this module useful in practice when 
contrasted with its peers, but at least now it is more the best it can be 
according to its original reason to exist.
