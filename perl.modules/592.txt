For the PERL4LIB list.

Hi All:

The Perl for Libraries developers have included a simple XML output function
in the MARC module since last summer. But it was an output-only operation.
We have recently explored adding XML input capabilities, and decided to put
all the XML operations into a separate MARC::XML derived class. This new
class needs to use XML::Parser and related modules - although existing MARC
applications have not required them. A user would use either MARC::XML or
MARC based on whether they wanted any of the XML methods.

MARC::XML       ampO MAchine Readable Catalog / XML Extension     PERL4LIB

Like MARC, it is cross-platform and has been run on both Win95 and linux.
