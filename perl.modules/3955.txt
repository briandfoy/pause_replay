Johan,

Thanks for your reply. Let me try to clarify my intent.

I also assume that a rational person would be eager to cooperate with 
the Inline community, and I do not expect many problems. (And my license 
is generic Perl Artistic)

But this is an open development community, and I've seen irrational 
arguments come up in the past. Since this forum (modules@perl.org) has 
the final say in matters of dispute, I thought it best to declare my 
wishes from the start. Now there is a point of reference.

Thanks again for your time, and for the time you dedicate towards this forum.

Sincerely, Brian
