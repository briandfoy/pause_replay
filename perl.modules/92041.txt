The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Parser::Role
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Contains code commonly used in file parsers
  userid:      TORBJORN (Torbjørn Lindahl)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    github

  similar:
    Surprisingly few modules deal with this, havent really found any

  rationale:

    Every time I sit down to write code for parsing files according to
    a particular format, I end up repeating some pieces of code over and
    over:

    * Make Moo accept a one argument filename instead of a { file =>
    hash }

    * check that the file exists and has size

    * make it accept file handles also

    * make it accept references to content

    * have it run the parser method in constructor so i dont have to
    bother calling a parse method every time i create the object. can of
    course turn this off if need be.

    Then, and only then, can I start with the fun bits, which is
    actually writing the code to do the actual parsing.

    All of the above keeps getting in the way. With this module its
    history :)

The resulting entry would be:

File::Parser::
