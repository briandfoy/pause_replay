The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::FormatData
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Functions to format strings and dates on web
  userid:      EFOLLEY (Eric Folley)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    While doing web development work in the past, I noticed that I was
    having to do the same operations time and again: strip HTML from
    form submissions, truncate strings for display as table data,
    URI-encode strings for use in links, translate Unix timestamps into
    mm/dd/yyyy format, etc. Rather than try to keep straight the
    different modules and functions used, I decided to write a wrapper
    with a single, consistent interface.

    While some routines could be useful in other environments, the
    package as a whole was built for deployment in web applications.
    Since it doesn't rely on CGI, I chose the HTML namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
