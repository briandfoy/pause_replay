Hi Andreas,

Oddly, it works fine for me. 0.90 is on ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN, it's in 
02packages..., it's on search.cpan.org (as you write) and it's also 
installable with CPAN.pm here.

If this is still not working for you, then perhaps you need to clear 
your local copy of the packages list? It should be refetched regularly, 
but perhaps if you version of CPAN.pm is really, really old, that 
doesn't work well?

Best regards,
Steffen
