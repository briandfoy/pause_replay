Subject: Module submission Geo::Postcode

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Postcode
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: UK Postcode validation and location
  userid:      WROSS (William Ross)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    various mailing lists, uk perl groups like london.pm, anyone else
    who'll have it.

  similar:
    Geo::Postalcode

  rationale:

    There is no module for handling UK postcode data, and it's a very
    common requirement. Geo::Postalcode provides similar tools for
    working with US zipcodes, but they're very different and the UK
    situation is complicated by the fact that postcode data isn't public
    domain.

    This module handles validation against the relevant British
    Standard, parses postcodes into useful chunks, maps codes onto grid
    references and latitude/longitudes, calculates distances between
    places and comes with a basic set of about 3000 top-level locations
    that lets one get started. It's designed to allow both quick and
    dirty DWIM and easy subclassing, and it's fully documented and
    tested.

    I've taken care to minimise the footprint of the module, and the
    interface for replacing the basic data set supplied is versatile and
    should be very easy to use, but I'm sure both those areas will
    benefit from a few more revisions over the next few weeks. It's
    complete, in other words, but a bit of rough and tumble wouldn't
    hurt :)

    This development has been financially supported by Amnesty
    International UK, but they are very happy for it to be publicly
    released, as usual.

    best

    will
