It depends on what distribution of perl you installed. If it's 
ActiveState's, you'll want to use the "ppm" tool provided to install 
Perl modules. This is *by far* the most convenient way to install 
modules for Windows. If your favourite module isn't availlable, you need 
to get a copy of "nmake.exe" from the Microsoft website and then 
download modules from search.cpan.org and follow the installation 
instructions in the module tarball.

To automate things, you can set up the "cpan" tool that comes with Perl. 
This is the preferred method on *nix systems. That can be problematic 
unless you have a Unix-like environment installed (MSYS or Cygwin). 
Also, you won't be able to build modules that include C code or link 
against dlls unless you have the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler installed 
since that's what ActiveState uses to compile perl.

You can also try PXPerl which is a distribution that works with the free 
gcc/mingw compiler. It's not quite there yet, though. I'm currently 
struggling hard to get it to work.

HTH,
Steffen
