The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Terse
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Terse Representation for XML Documents
  userid:      JSALZ (Jon Salz)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    none

  similar:

  rationale:

    XML::Terse will provide support for reading and writing XML
    document trees represented in Terse XML (tXML). An XML document and
    the corresponding tXML document contain precisely the same
    information (and can be converted back and forth losslessly), but
    tXML is much easier for humans to read and write. I'm using it as a
    configuration file format for some internal projects, and the
    feedback has been quite positive. (People love XML, but they hate
    its syntax.)

    XML::Terse can be used as a drop-in replacement for
    XML::Parser::Expat, so nearly all the XML classes can use its
    functionality transparently.

    The choice of namespace should be obvious I think!

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Terse           idpOp Terse Representation for XML Documents       JSALZ
