     why:

    I wrote some modules that allow you to bind tables on a relational
    database to Perl classes. This originally began as a port of some
    Python modules, but after a year of development has far exceeded the
    original code base. Similar projects also exist for Java and PHP,
    respectively, Apache Torque and Propel. My code and the
    afformentioned projects share a compatible XML format. So, if you'd
    like, this can be thought of as simply part of the Apache Torque
    continuum except for Perl.

    In the GNU Arch repository on Gna! you can find the current Perl
    code (ignore the stuff in the description about Python):
