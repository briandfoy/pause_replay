The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Polynomial::Multivariate
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl class for multivariate polynomials
  userid:      MHASCH (Martin Becker)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Math::Polynomial

  rationale:

    This is a spin-off of Math::Polynomial (a module dealing with
    univariate polynomials only). It gets its own distribution because
    multivariate polynomials have quite different features that would
    not fit well in a common interface for both. Secondly, the code base
    of M::P::M is in an earlier stage of development and should have
    some leeway to mature, while M::P is already quite stable.

    The actual module name was first suggested in the documentation of
    M::P v1.002 (June 12, 2009), among other planned extensions.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Polynomial::
::Multivariate    bdpOp Perl class for multivariate polynomials      MHASCH
