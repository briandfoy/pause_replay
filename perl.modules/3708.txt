Well, h2xs already creates a reasonable module framework, which I think is
just fine.  If people used it, we would not have a lot of the problems we
have, and I don't see people using some external module when they won't use
h2xs.  I am not necessarily opposed to the idea, I just don't know if it
will accomplish the goal you want to accomplish.
