The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Notify
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Remote user notification package
  userid:      MGILFIX (Michael Gilfix)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Email, mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    CPAN does not currently feature any modules to aid developers in
    creating applications that need to communicate remotely with users
    (through mediums such as email or pager) where delivering and
    receiving those notifications occurs asynchronously and may be
    subject to long delays. This module would be of particular value to
    the system administration community, as they often need to be able
    to notify themselves in a reliable fashion from within scripts.

    The namespace was chosen as per suggestion after a series of email
    exhanges with the modules@perl.org mailing list.

    The modules provide the developer with many features for user
    notification, including:

    * Guaranteed messaing (All notifications are written to disk before
    delivery attempts and right after receipt so as to maintain state in
    the event of a crash) * Framework for notification transactions (A
    ticketing scheme so an app can communicate back and forth with a
    user) * Framework for sending notifications through different types
    of transport * Transaction history

    I have often had need for modules that provide this functionality
    and I believe others in the community will as well.

The resulting entry would be:
