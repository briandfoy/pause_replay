Hi Alfie,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins.
> I would like to delete my Pause account (AL=46IE). Is this possible, be=
cause I can't find any link within pause.cpan.org.

There isn=E2=80=99t a =22delete user=22 function, because what=E2=80=99s =
possible / preferable depends on whether you=E2=80=99ve ever uploaded to =
PAUSE, and you have.

You have 7 distributions on CPAN, and although none of them are used by a=
ny other distributions on CPAN, we=E2=80=99ve no way of knowing whether a=
nyone is relying on them for off-CPAN code (aka =22DarkPAN=22).

While it is possible for you to delete all of your files from your author=
 directory on PAUSE, which will remove them from CPAN, if possible we=E2=80=
=99d encourage you not to do this, as it could pull the rug from under so=
meone who=E2=80=99s using one or more of your modules.

There are a number of possibilities, and which one you prefer depends on =
what you=E2=80=99re trying to achieve:

1. Your modules have your name in the documentation. You could do one mor=
e release of each of them, changing the author to just =22AL=46IE=22. The=
n we could change the name and other details on your PAUSE account, so it=
 essentially is left as an anonymous account (though see BackPAN note bel=
ow). So anyone who has saved a reference to AL=46IE can still find your m=
odules that way, but there=E2=80=99d be no reference to your name.
2. We could transfer ownership of all of your distributions to another ac=
count, and have that account do a release of each of them, so that become=
s the latest one on CPAN. You could then delete all the files in your aut=
hor directory on PAUSE without the distributions disappearing from CPAN. =
The AL=46IE account would then be anonymous and empty. There is a JANITOR=
 account that we could use for this purpose.
3. These are all your modules, so if you choose to, you could delete all =
files from your account and blank out the fields of your PAUSE profile.

Please note that all past releases to CPAN are always available on BackPA=
N, so no matter which of the above you choose, your old releases can be f=
ound.

Hopefully either option 1 or 2 would work for you=3F Let me know if you=E2=
=80=99ve any questions on the above, or want to float another option.

Cheers,
Neil
