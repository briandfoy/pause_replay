Well, I didn't think Shell:: would be reserved for actual shell applications. For example Shell.pm itself isn't a shell either, it merely supplies some functionality normally asociated with shells. And this is exactly what Shell::Jobs will also do: provide functionality normally asociated with shells, namely job control facilities.

Secondly, this module actually *is* a shell -really-: it contains a parser for shell script (logic lists, redirections, command substitution etc.) and it can execute jobs; wrapped with ReadLine and maybe a builtin command or two that makes a reasonably usable login shell :)  I'll include a sample script that runs as a simple interactive shell.

... maybe I should come up with something more descriptive for the description string ...
