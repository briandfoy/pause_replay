It's been a pleasure, especially as your request finally revealed a
bug that I have been wondering about for months. Reassigning ownership
was broken when the original owner was registered via module list. The
curious thing about the bug was that the assignement went allright but
all other attributes of that module were lost. This time I caught the
bug in action and squeezed it.

Thanks && enjoy the gained constance;)
