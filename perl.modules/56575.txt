You got the mail about ::Matrics, ::Alien and ::EPC because there is no
actual RFID/Matrics.pm (etc) with an enclosed "package RFID/Matrics.pm"
statement on CPAN. So the indexer thought there was no such module. This
means that the link under "Registered Modules" on your search.cpan.org
author page points to nowhere.

You can, but don't need to, fix this by including an almost empty .pm
file which may serve as a documentation entry point to the distribution.:

package RFI::Matrics; # or ::Alien,...
use strict;
1;
__END__

=pod blah, some introduction to the new user here.

This is entirely up to you. I won't delete your registrations for
RFID::* with the possible exception of RFID::Base, which, if I
understand you correctly, is unused? Should I delete it?

Best regards,
Steffen
