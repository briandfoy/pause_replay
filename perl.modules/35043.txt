Subject: Module submission SQL::Routine

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SQL::Routine
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Specify all database tasks with SQL routines
  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    dbi-dev, dbi-users, poop-group, dbdi-dev, modules@perl.org,
    victoria-pm, sqlite-users@sqlite.org

  similar:
    SQL::Statement SQL::Translator SQL::YASP SQL::Generator SQL::Schema
    SQL::Abstract SQL::Snippet SQL::Catalog DB::Ent DBIx::Abstract
    DBIx::AnyDBD DBIx::DBSchema DBIx::Namespace DBIx::SearchBuilder
    TripleStore

  rationale:

    See the previous few days' discussion about SQL::SyntaxModel, which
    is the old name for this module. But I explain it quite differently
    below.

    SQL::Routine is conceptually similar to SQL::Statement but that my
    module is a lot more capable than that one is.

    SQL::Routine is a container object that allows you to create
    specifications for any type of database task or activity (eg:
    queries, DML, DDL, connection management) that look like SQL stored
    procedures or functions.

    Third party code that uses SQL::Routine can choose to either
    generate actual SQL stored procedures from them, as the RDBMS in
    question supports, or generate client-executed individual SQL
    statements wrapped by Perl code instead.

    Third party code can also choose to use SQL::Routine objects as an
    intermediate representation of SQL that it is translating from one
    RDBMS to another, or it can be used by applications or database
    systems that don't want to use SQL strings, in place of such
    strings.

    SQL::Routine was created in the hindsight of the SQL-2003 standard
    and supports most of its important features. The module should be
    useable with any SQL-supporting database, plus some that are not.

The resulting entry would be:

SQL::
