Subject: Text::Pspell -> Text::Aspell name change

Hi,

I'm the author of the Text::Pspell module.

Kevin Atkinson's Aspell/Pspell package has been rewritten and is now called
GNU Aspell.  The old Pspell library interface has been incorporated into
Aspell, and the C API for the library has been changed (slightly) to
reflect these changes.

T.J. Mather has updated the perl module to work with the New Aspell.

The plan is to release a replacement module (for Text::Pspell) as a new
module called Text::Aspell.  Text::Aspell's interface will be very similar
to Text::Pspell's, with really only one method name changed.  But since
Pspell is no longer supported, it makes sense to change the name of the
module from Text::Pspell to Text::Aspell.

Since this is really a name change I was thinking of continuing with the
version number of Text::Pspell -- that is, Text::Pspell is 0.02, so
Text::Aspell would be 0.03.

Seen any big problems with any of this?

Thanks,
