Persistence isn't good either.

you don't' want to name the top-level after a specific product.
you want to be as general as possible, such as "DB" or "DBIx",
since you deal with databases.

After the top level, you get more specific.  "DBIx::Abstract" still
doesn't mean anything. Abstract of what?  The next part of the
name deals with what you do with databases.

and so on... :)
