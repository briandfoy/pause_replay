     why:

    A collection of modules I have used over the years for various
    projects, including web based applications, command line utilities,
    and quick hacks. These modules were created, and continue to be
    maintained, by me.

    Typically these would be distributed with the software that used
    them. I have decided it is time to split them out and make them
    stand on their own. Especially since different tools, programs, etc.
    would sometimes include different versions of these modules, making
    management somewhat of a pain. Managing modules is what CPAN does
    best, so I decided to see if it would be OK to put them on CPAN.

    Thanks, Greg
