Subject: Module submission Tree::Simple

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A simple tree class
  userid:      STEVAN (Stevan Little)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tree::DAG_Node Tree::Nary

  rationale:

    The other modules in the Tree namespace that implement n-ary trees
    are either quite large (Tree::DAG_Node) or not very OO (Tree::Nary).
    My module, Tree::Simple is a simple generic OO tree. There are other
    tree modules too, outside of the Tree::* namespace, but they are
    usually specifc to their particular usage. I actually go into more
    detail in the module documentation as to how this compares to other
    tree implementations (only in version 0.14 which I just uploaded, it
    should be there before too long).

  enteredby:   STEVAN (Stevan Little)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr  5 01:53:51 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tree::
::Simple          bdpOp A simple tree class                          STEVAN
