Although there aren't a lot of printing-related modules, as your's is a 
fairly pure printing module, and not part of some larger things like 
Gnome::Print, it might be a good idea at putting the PJL-related modules 
into Print::PJL::

If only because printing is an area where people seem to have polluted 
the top level namespace quite a bit, and it would be good to see a few 
more get under their own namespace.
