Hello,

We've found and are happily using the Mail::SendEasy module. However, its 
author / developer (Graciliano M. P.) has last been seen on CPAN in 2005 and 
his mail address doesn't exist anymore.

I have a couple of fixes that would be interesting to the community (I think). 
At least one open bug is fixed, a second one was found and fixed.

What are the options? Should we be registered as co-authors before we can send 
fixes?

With best regards,
Sander
