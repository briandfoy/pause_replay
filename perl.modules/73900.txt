     why:

    Hello. I have written some Modules (using Moose) which can be used
    within Catalyst applications, and which enable a user frontend for
    complex DBIx::Class based searches in an easy to use (and easy to
    configure) way. Entries of any table in a relational database can be
    searched by any key located in any table in that db, assumed that
    these tables are somehow related. To enable this feature, developers
    only have to use the Modules in their Catalyst Controller/Model and
    define a search form (where and what to search). My work is based on
    Catalyst::Example::Controller::InstantCRUD and
    DBIx::Class::ResultSet. Independence from InstantCRUD is planned.

    kind regards, Lukas
