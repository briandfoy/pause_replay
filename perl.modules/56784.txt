Hi Evan,

sorry for the delay.

No, I'm not going to remove valid registrations. It stays. The module is
there alright. There must have been some problem indexing it. I'll
trigger a rerun of the indexer for you. The problem is shown by the
following command in the cpan shell:

cpan[1]> i /Games::FEAR::Log/
[...]
Module id = Games::FEAR::Log
    DESCRIPTION  Log analyzer for the multiplayer game FEAR
    CPAN_USERID  EVANK (Evan Kaufman <evank@cpan.org>)
    CPAN_VERSION undef
    CPAN_FILE    Contact Author Evan Kaufman <evank@cpan.org>
    DSLIP_STATUS bdpOp (beta,developer,perl,object-oriented,Standard-Perl)
    INST_FILE    (not installed)


Now, see that the CPAN_VERSION is undef. This shouldn't be. Please, if
the reindexing doesn't change this within two weeks, send another notice
to this mailing list and we'll try to figure out what went wrong.
Possibly, you need to move the $VERSION statement further up in the
code. But I'm just guessing.

Best regards,
Steffen
