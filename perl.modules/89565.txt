     why:

    I recently wrote a Redis backed stateful IP and host based
    reputation plugin for SpamAssassin with IPTables integration and
    blacklist notification, which I would like to share with the
    community:

    http://inficron.com/resources/Mail-SpamAssassin/Plugin/IPFilter/

    I have been in communication with the SpamAssassin development
    team. Although they have offered to include it in their hierarchy, I
    am unable to sign the ASF CLA. Thus I plan to use a separate
    location and am considering a more permissive license to distribute
    the software. Thanks for your consideration.
