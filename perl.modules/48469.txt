Hi Steffen,

the module does not provide any possibility to model relation-graphs 
itself. It only supplies Objects to create a view-side to existing 
relation-graph models. For an example with 'Graph' and 
'Graph::Layout::Aesthetic' see the included Example topo.pl.

Regards, Christoph


Sorry, it's my first module... Maybe I should have discussed the naming 
beforehand in c.l.p.mod :(
