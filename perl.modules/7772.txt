most immediate submission:

A module which encapsulates the dirty parts of authentication
verification for CGI scripts.  It is a generalization of something
which Luke Sheneman at inktomi cooked up.  It uses an LDAP server for
authentication and stores the intermediate state information in an SQL
database.

Initial authentication is performed against LDAP servers, and
credentials are stored into the SQL database upon successful
verification.  The credentials are then stuffed into a cookie and a
"passkey" (stored in a hidden field) which are then used for
authentication of subsequent pages.

The injection and extraction of the cookie and passkey are
handled by a wrapper around CGI.pm, and there are a variety
of options for determining credential lifetimes and usage
policies.

The current version requires perldap, but it will be fairly
easy to generalize it for Net::LDAP and other authentication
sources.  It will take a little rework, but it should fairly
simple to include a file backed as an option for credential
storage (instead of using SQL).
