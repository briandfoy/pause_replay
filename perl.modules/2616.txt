Hi,

I'd look to register myself as a Perl developer and obtain a PAUSE ID in
order to contribute the script 'refill.pl'.

   name:            Freddy Vulto
   e-mail address:  fvu@fvu.myweb.nl
   homepage:        http://www.fvu.myweb.nl
   preferred ID:    FVULTO
   description:     When you move your site, the 'refill' utility can
                    traverse the directory tree and modify each file to
                    resemble the content of a specified local file, e.g.
                    a file with the contents: "This site has been moved 
                    to <new url>".
   discussion:      The script hasn't been discussed publicly.  Before
                    writing it, I searched CPAN and the internet to find 
                    a utility which would accomplish the task, but 
                    couldn't find one.


Gr & thanks in advance,

Freddy Vulto
