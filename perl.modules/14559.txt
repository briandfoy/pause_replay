This is group of classes which work with HL7 transactions, a standards based

information and clinical data between systems.

This module contains the following functionality.
  *   Parse and assemble a HL7 transaction & tools to work with data at a
field level.
  *   Accept a transaction from a remote system, and send an ACK back. (
sockets based)
 *   Send a transaction to a remote system, and validate the ACK. (sockets
