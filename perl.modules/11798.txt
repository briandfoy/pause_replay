The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::NLP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Natural Language Processing module
  userid:      ALIZTA (Alistair Francis)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    I was required to code a simple, yet effective, Natural Language
    Processing module as I could not find one which is readily available
    on CPAN (or anywhere else).

    The module I have developed is very much in a development stage but
    I, and others, have found if very useful in "decoding" human text
    into "commands" that a module or script can understand.

    It is far from implementing advanced NLP, however, I believe that
    this is a good place to start.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::NLP             RdpOp Natural Language Processing module           ALIZTA
