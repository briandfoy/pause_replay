Hello,
I tried to contact Daemmon Hughes by Email 3 times till now (07.Sept.2006)
at dates 20.Aug.2006 , 24.Aug.2006, 04.Sept.2006
and I got no replay from him.
The email I use is cpan@daemmonhughes.com as it is given into his personal
directory at CPAN: http://search.cpan.org/~rhythman/
The site daemmonhughes.com is password protected so i cant get additional
info about him.
The last version of module PDF::Table was uploaded on 30.March.2006.
Since then 3 people reported a bug and it is not yet fixed.
I found out other bugs in the module but submitting them would not change
anyting (I think) because the  previous is not yet fixed.
For example: The paper size  for tables spanning through more than one
page is hardcoded.(The whole world does not use US-Letter Paper Format)
I will keep trying to contact him. If you have any suggestions I would
appreciate them.
P.P. I have added some additional features
