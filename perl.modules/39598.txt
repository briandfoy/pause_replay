Hello,

I am trying to contribute a module to cpan.org.  However, I am not sure 
exactly which namespace I should use.  The module I wrote is a parser that:

1. Uses only Perl5 regular expressions (no dependency except for a 
utility module of my own, which can be eliminated if I just extract the 
functions and put into the parser module).
2. Parses the NCBI's Entrez Gene files.  These files are text files that 
are in ASN.1 format.  But the important thing is that my parser is not a 
general ASN.1 parser, since it only parses the ASN data definitions used 
by NCBI's Entrez Gene.
3. The parser assembles a data structure from the input file.  In many 
sense, the parser works similarly to an XML parser and also has 
validating and error reporting capabilities.
4. Currently the path for the module is GI::Parser::EntrezGene.  GI is 
an internal project I'm working on, therefore it's not suitable for cpan.
5. The IP issue is already cleared on the module (GPLed and on 
sourceforge already).

Would you please give me some advice on:

1. Which namespace should be suitable for my parser?
2. What should I do to the utility module of mine - upload it, or 
discard it after extracting the functions used by the parser?

Any other suggestion is also appreciated.

Thanks much!
