Subject: Module submission DBIx::DB

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::DB
  DSLIP:       idhhp
  description: DBI Database schemes with perl interfaces
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    dbi-users@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've looked around on CPAN and there doesn't seem to be "one place"
    for distributions that provide:

    - A database schema, and - A perl interface to that database schema

    Instead, people seem to make up their own convention, or even
    worse, bundle their database-driven objects into a much larger
    package (eg; coupling an authentication database to a particular
    server's implementation, or coupling a URL keyword indexing database
    to a particular web spider).

    I'm a big fan of having more smaller pieces, and of knowing where
    to look to find them. Instead of names like "DBIx::UserDB" and
    "CGI::Session::DBI" I'd eventually like to see "DBIx::DB::User" and
    "DBIx::DB::Session". Those examples were contrived for a reason:
    They're two packages that could be very useful when used together!
    but as it stands, there is no DBIx::UserDB distribution, instead
    SearchProfiles and Apache-iNcom both bundle the package in
    themselves (requiring you to install one or the other to use it),
    and "CGI::Session::DBI" only occurs to somebody who has already
    learned about CGI::Session, which might not be the same string
    somebody thinks of when they decide they need a database schema for
    session management.

    Just my two cents... I'm going to be releasing a couple of
    database-object-driven distributions in the near future and it
    occured to me that there's no "standard" place for them to live. Can
    a namespace be registered without a package for this purpose?

    Thanks, Tyler
