Subject: Module submission DBIx::DataModel
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, dami@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::DataModel
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Object-Relational Mappings in UML style
  userid:      DAMI (Laurent Dami)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    cpanforum

  similar:
    DBIx::Class, Jifty::DBI, Fey::ORM ... and many more

  rationale:

    DBIx::DataModel is a framework for building Perl abstractions
    (classes, objects and methods) that interact with relational
    database management systems (RDBMS). Of course the ubiquitous DBI
    module is used as a basic layer for communicating with databases; on
    top of that, DBIx::DataModel provides facilities for generating SQL
    queries, joining tables automatically, navigating through the
    results, converting values, and building complex datastructures so
    that other modules can conveniently exploit the data.

    * UML-style declaration of relationships (instead of 'has_many',
    'belongs_to', etc.) * efficiency through fine control of
    collaboration with the DBI layer (prepare/execute, fetch into
    reusable memory location, etc.) * improved API for SQL::Abstract
    (named parameters, simplified 'orderBy') * clear conceptual
    distinction between ** data sources (tables and views), ** database
    statements (stateful objects representing stepwise building of an
    SQL query and stepwise retrieval of results), ** data rows
    (lightweight hashrefs containing nothing but column names and
    values) * joins with simple syntax and possible override of default
    INNER JOIN/LEFT JOIN properties; instances of joins multiply inherit
    from their member tables. * named placeholders * nested,
    cross-database transactions

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::DataModel       MdpOp Object-Relational Mappings in UML style      DAMI
