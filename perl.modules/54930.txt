This module seems to have been taken over by another author, but he has released
it in such a way that it is invisible to CPAN.  The new author (Dennis Paulson),
needs to release the module without an underscore in the version number, which
is a signal to CPAN that the release is alpha code and shouldn't be
automatically installed.  Once that happens, you will be able to automatically
install it via the CPAN shell.
