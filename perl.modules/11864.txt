Sorry, but there's a little mistake.
The real name is
Imager::Font::FreeType2

I like the idea, but I would prefer the name
Font::FreeType2.

First, I'd prefer Font than FONT because it's the name convention and 
there's already an existing large Font Top Level domain.

Second FreeType2 explains better what it does than FT2.
It's not so well known as Font::TTF.
And to follow the example of the similar Imager::Font::FreeType2 module,
makes it easier for all CPAN users.


Greetings,
