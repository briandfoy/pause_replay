The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Number::WithError
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Numbers with error propagation and rounding
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Number::Format and in general Number::*
    Math::Symbolic::Custom::ErrorPropagation

  rationale:

    Hi module list,

    I chose the top level hierarchy because of the precedence in
    Number::. WithError was chosen because that's what people would most
    likely look for. Just "Number::Error" would be misleading, IMHO.

    I'll quote the documentation:

    This class is a container class for numbers with a number of
    associated symmetric and asymmetric errors. It overloads practically
    all common arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions to
    propagate the errors. It can do proper scientific rounding (as
    explained in more detail below in the documentation of the
    "significant_digit()" method).

    You can use Math::BigFloat objects as the internal representation
    of numbers in order to support arbitrary precision calculations.

    Errors are propagated using Gaussian error propagation.

    Steffen

The resulting entry would be:
