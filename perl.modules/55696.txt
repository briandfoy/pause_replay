I haven't heard back from Phillipe. I asked Joshua Pritkin (co- 
maintainer) if he knew what the status of Devel::TraceLoad was. His  
opinion was that it'd be fine for me to take it over.

I have a new version just about ready to go. Does anyone object if I  
take it over - and if not could someone give the permissions a kick  
please?
