I've put XML::XSLT v. 0.31 on CPAN.  This is a module that a group of
developers on Sourceforge have been working on (at a snail's pace or
worse) for a while.  Brong Gondwana (CPAN id: BRONG) uploaded the last
release, but I haven't heard from him in a while, so I've uploaded v
0.31.

Would it be possible to have this published as the latest version
available via CPAN.pm?

Mark.
