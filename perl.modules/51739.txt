I think, last time around the process was not completed because you
did not answer this email:
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2005-04/msg00445.html

Please re-register with the same form or try to argue with Brian about
the proper namespace.

But it's not only about registration, it's also about packaging.
Please learn how to use ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build and make
a nice .tar.gz as all the other CPAN authors do and things will
eventually fall in place nicely.

Thanks,
