Hello!,

I'm trying to contact the author of the module to release a new version
of the module to work fine on new releases of catalyst since a month or so.

The request for update (and patch) is on RT since long ago:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52099

Today I've cloned the gitpan repo, applied the patch and updated
everything to be ready to hit cpan as the next version (0.04).

http://github.com/diegok/Catalyst-Plugin-Captcha

Then I had sent a message to the author on github telling this same story.

I'm writing here as I'm ok to take care of maintenance for this module.

Best regards,

Diego Kuperman
