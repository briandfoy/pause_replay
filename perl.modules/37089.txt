Request to register new user

fullname: John Alden
  userid: JOHNA
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.johnalden.co.uk
     why:

    Initially some backends for Data::Serializer, WWW:Shorten and some
    backends to some new wrappers shortly to be released by the BBC

    In cases where it makes sense, I'll offer these first to the owner
    of the main distribution to see if they want to bundle it up with it
    (WWW::Shorten would be a good example)
