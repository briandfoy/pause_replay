I have written a module I'm about to submit called
Iff, it reads and writes any type of Iff file (Aiff,
wav, riff, etc).  It just extracts the data, it
doesn't know what do to with it (it assumes the user
knows what to do). I am also going to write another
binary file format I can't tell you about yet.(it
hasn't been approved/released yet).  

The reason I am sending this mail is that I think that
these two modules should fit under a main namespace
(like BinFile::, or Binary::),  or maybe they don't. 
I wanted to get your opinions.

thanks, 

corris
