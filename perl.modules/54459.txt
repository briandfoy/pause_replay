Subject: Module submission GD::3DBarGrapher
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::3DBarGrapher
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Professional looking 3D Bar Graphs
  userid:      SWARHURST (S I Warhurst)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wanted to produce more professional looking graphs but also very
    easy to use/customise and felt existing implementations a bit
    lacking in this respect. My module has XHTML image map output,
    gradient fills on certain objects to enhance presentation and is
    very customisable in appearance. It uses the GD module so should
    nest under there, and 3DBarGrapher sounded like a good name! This is
    my first module, so hope this is enough info!

  enteredby:   SWARHURST (S I Warhurst)
  enteredon:   Wed May 16 23:14:18 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GD::
::3DBarGrapher    Rdpfp Professional looking 3D Bar Graphs           SWARHURST
