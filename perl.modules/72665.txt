Subject: Module submission Statistics::Sequences::Pot
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences::Pot
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Schmidt's test of force-like runs
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil at present

  similar:
    nil at present

  rationale:

    The Pot statistic measures the bunching relative to the spacing of
    a single state within a series of other states, conceived by Helmut
    Schmidt as a targeted "potential" energy (or Pot) that dissipates
    exponentially between states. It's not limited to considering only
    clusters of consecutive states (or bunches), as is the case with the
    more familiar Runs test of sequences.

  enteredby:   RGARTON (roderick garton)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep  7 14:03:47 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Sequences::
::Pot             bdpOp Schmidt's test of force-like runs            RGARTON
