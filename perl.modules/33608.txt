There seem to be two distributions on the CPAN called Pod-DocBook.

There is an older version by Alligator Descartes at

  http://search.cpan.org/~adesc/Pod-DocBook-0.05/

and a newer, improved version by Nandu Shah at

  http://search.cpan.org/~nandu/Pod-DocBook-1.2/

It looks like Nandu took over a previously moribund module at the
beginning of this year and has brought it up to date.

However, PAUSE still thinks that Alligator is the owner of the module
so it is only indexing his 1999 version. This means that CPAN.pm and
CPANPLUS are picking up and installing the wrong version.

Is there anything that can be done to resolve this situation?

Cheers,

Dave...
