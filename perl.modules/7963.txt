Ziya,

I glad you found the Rcs.pm module useful.  I plan to download and test 
the modules you created.

By the way, I just uploaded a new version of Rcs.pm to CPAN - version 
1.01.  Some have complained that Rcs.pm will die if one of the external 
rcs programs returns an error.  The new module can allow the Perl 
program to continue if an external rcs program returns an error.
 From the POD:

  # Use tags to control how the rcs programs handle errors
  # and the use of the rcs -q (quiet) flag.
     use Rcs qw(nonFatal Verbose);

Thanks for your feedback and contribution.
