    Sorry for taking so long to chime in.

    From what I've read, Net::Jabber is still most appropriate.  Jabber
_is_ good for many things, but you're still talking about dealing with
network protocols, no?  Apache is a top-level namespace, but it's rife
with modules that twiddle the innards of Apache.

P.S.  I know a lot about Jabber.  I was the first person to port the
server to FreeBSD.
