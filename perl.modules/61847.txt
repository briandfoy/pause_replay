Subject: Module submission Scalar::Util::Refcount

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Scalar::Util::Refcount
  DSLIP:       Rdcfb
  description: Show an object's reference count
  userid:      JNIXON (Jeremy Nixon)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The functions provided by this module are very similar to what is
    found in the Scalar::Util module. These, however, are mainly useful
    during testing/debugging, and probably don't warrant inclusion in a
    general-purpose module.

  enteredby:   JNIXON (Jeremy Nixon)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug 19 00:56:39 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Scalar::Util::
::Refcount        Rdcfb Show an object's reference count             JNIXON
