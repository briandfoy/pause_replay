Hm, I didn't get a copy of that in my mailbox as I usually had in the 
past, so I just saw it now on the nntp.perl.org archive.

P.S.  If anyone makes further replies, please CC them to my email.

Anyway, brian, thanks for the reply.

I don't think that continuing to use the Rosetta name is a good idea. 
I abandoned that name on purpose for several reasons.

One is that I saw it as too generic in general, and is the same name 
that lots of other things use, even if none of those are on CPAN. 
Also, the nature of the project changed significantly so calling the 
core project a translator isn't so appropriate anymore.  And 
everything I previously released under the Rosetta name never 
actually worked ... it was a bunch of documentation and some partial 
code that couldn't actually be used ... unlike what I have now.

Also, I've already invested some effort in the intermediate QDRDBMS 
name, having discussed it under that name for the last year, and 
having already set up email discussion lists with that name.

Also, while a rewrite, I consider the project to be very much 
pre-1.0.  If I were to continue with the Rosetta name, I would have 
to use versions above 0.724.0 or some such due to legacy matters. 
With a rename, I can start at 0.0.x where this ought to be.

Also, while that's a lot of letters, I picked the name QDRDBMS on 
purpose *because* it looks bad ... though at the same time it is 
still very descriptive (the RDBMS part) ... I don't expect my use of 
that name would clash with anyone ... and it would encourage people 
to switch over when I finally rename it later.

I also already used the PAUSE utility to release my interest on the 
Rosetta name, and did this some time ago.

So continuing my use of the name Rosetta is out of the question.

The other main alternative I can think of is take a risk that the 
long term name I already though of and registered all the TLDs for 3 
years ago is in fact okay, and just rush straight to registering that 
instead.

Or alternately, I can compromise and just not register anything with 
CPAN now, then try and go through the various consultation processes 
earlier than intended, so perhaps to try and move to the new name 
later in this summer rather than at the end of the year.

How would this work for you:  Please register the QDRDBMS name now, 
so that this project can have a listing in the module directory under 
the databases section, and I will try to speed up things at my end so 
that the lifetime of this name is shortened, and a better one is used 
sooner?

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
