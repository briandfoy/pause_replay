Hi, Rintaro!

My name is Michael Roberts and I've been using Iterator::Simple for a
couple of years now with great delight.  It does exactly what I want to
do, with very little overhead, and I love it.

The only problem is that it uses UNIVERSAL::isa, which has been
deprecated since Perl 5.12.  This results in an ugly warning on every
call, and it was first posted on RT in August of 2010.

I've made the necessary (very minimal changes) to eliminate this
deprecated usage and placed the result on Github at
https://github.com/Vivtek/Iterator-Simple - you're more than welcome to
upload a new version, or if you want to grant me co-maintainer status,
I'd be delighted to take it off your hands.  The main thing is to get it
working again, because I really like the module.

Thanks!
Michael
