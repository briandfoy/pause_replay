The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::OnlinePayment::Bluepay
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: Bluepay interface for Business-OnlinePayment
  userid:      CPKOIS (Christopher Kois)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Bluepay is a merchant acquirer
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquirer). There is also a payment
    gateway called BluePay 2.0 which has various interfaces that will
    allow a developer to post transactions, view reports, or set up
    client rebillings. This module will interface with the Bluepay20post
    interface, which allows a user to send a credit card transaction via
    HTTP post over SSL and retrieve the transaction results.

  enteredby:   CPKOIS (Christopher Kois)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 24 13:45:00 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::OnlinePayment::
::Bluepay         bdpfg Bluepay interface for Business-OnlinePayment CPKOIS
