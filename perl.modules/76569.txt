There is a so-called "mailing list" feature that does something like 
allowing multiple people to maintain a particular set of modules 
(==permissions). It basically is a separate virtual user that a set of 
real users can "sudo" to, if I remember correctly. That still requires 
new uploaders to check for any new namespaces and assign maintenance to 
the mailing list user *once*. Others may be able to explain this better, 
but for some reason, this isn't a solution that's preferred by the 
admins, I think. I keep forgetting why :(

No, it's been that way "forever".

No, that's not possible. Our tools can't do that. (The PAUSE code is 
public, though.)
