     why:

    Module for working with SysV / Solaris packages in datastream
    format (possibly as Archive::Pkg) - there are currently two similar
    efforts Solaris::Package and Software::Packager::Svr4 - but both
    only deal w/ packages when they are on system as series of files.
    The implementation that I have been working on is pure Perl, and
    does not use the SysV utilities pkgmk/pkgtrans. Will need to check
    with Chris Josephes and Mark Hershberger before submitting to
    discuss and deconflict.

    Module for working with SSH connections - providing ability to
    automate issuing commands on other platforms using a select
    mechanism to allow management of multiple simultaneous connections.
    Will need to check w/ Dave Rolsky and Ivan Kohler before submitting
    to discuss and deconflict. This code might fit within their existing
    modules, but they may want to keep it partitioned separately.

    Who knows - I may just wind up providing input to other authors'
    code, but I've been playing with Perl long enough that I figure I
    better start trying to get some of my code out to a wider audience
    than just my company...
