The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::File
  DSLIP:       adprg
  description: Audio file abstraction library
  userid:      FLORA (Florian Ragwitz)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Audio::File should be a class that abstracts an audio file. It will
    provide information about the audio properties (rate, length, ...)
    via Audio::File::AudioProperties or equivalent, info about the files
    tag via Audio::File::Tag (artist, album, ...) and probably (at a
    later point of development) also information about the pure audio
    data (through Audio::Data?).

    It'll be independent from the files format. At the moment I plan to
    support Ogg, Flac and MP3, but it'll be extendable quite easy due
    the features of object oriented programming.

    It would be nice if you could CC me (flora@cpan.org) in your
    replies.

    Thank you, Florian
