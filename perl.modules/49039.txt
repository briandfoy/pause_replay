The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ODF::Struct
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Structured Text in Open Document Format File
  userid:      PWD (Philip W. Dalrymple III)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Not sure yet

  similar:
    OpenOffice::OODoc will be used for low level access (a ODF::Struct
    object will contain a O::O::Doc item)

  rationale:

    I need the ability to force a ODF docutment to contain a tree of
    elements and rather that do an add hock solution I though that I
    would publish a module.

    The namespace is seperate from OpenOffice::OODoc for two reasons,
    first this module will NOT support the older non Open Document file
    format and it is not tied to OpenOffice. And the license for O::O is
    GPL only and my company will not allow a release under the GPL only
    (Standard-Perl is OK). The author of O::O had some issues with
    mixing GPL and Standard-Perl in the same distro. (not sure if this
    applies)

    I think that there will be a number of modules tha will deal with
    ODF formats in the near future and a namespace for them is a good
    idea.

The resulting entry would be:

ODF::
::Struct          idpOp Structured Text in Open Document Format File PWD
