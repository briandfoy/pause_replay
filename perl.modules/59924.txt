The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::SenseClusters
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Cluster Similar Words and Contexts
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://senseclusters.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    Text::SenseClusters is a Perl system that takes written contexts
    and clusters them based on their contextual similarity. This can be
    applied to many practical tasks, including email and web page
    clustering, word sense identification, and named entity
    disambiguation. Text::SenseClusters relies on Text::NSP to provide a
    wide range of lexical features, including unigrams, bigrams and
    co-occurrences. It supports the use of Singular Value Decomposition
    to smooth matrices, and uses the Cluto clustering toolkit. While SVD
    and clustering are provided by external C programs, everything else
    is done in Perl, and SenseClusters relies on a number of CPAN
    modules, including PDL, Set::Scalar, Algorithm::Munkres,
    Math::SparseVector, Math::SparseMatrix, Math::BigInt,
    Algorithm::RandomMatrixGeneration. As such Text::SenseClusters
    provides an example of an end user application built on top of
    various Perl modules.
