In lists.projects.perl.modules, you wrote:

I'd recommend against Constants as a top-level name, but you knew that
anyway.

Are you suggesting that it would actually assign the variables using
"use constant"?  If you're not talking about that sort of constant, I'd
advise against using "constant" in the name.

What does QPTE stand for?

Looks like a useful tool and a good approach.  My only concern would be
with the proliferation of yet-another-templating-module.
