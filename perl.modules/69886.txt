17:10 < mst> alester: btw, are you willing to take a patch to reintroduce the 
             old Template::Timer behaviour rather than the new form?
17:10 < alester> mst: I guess.

17:13 < alester> will your patch let me pick?
17:13 < alester> Because I moved them to the bottom for a reason.

17:13 < mst> alester: I would -prefer- that you have to turn that on though
17:14 < mst> alester: the interlaced form is what most of the users I know of 
             want
17:14 < alester> understood
17:14 < alester> I can see the end-of-doc summary being a positive turn-on
17:14 < alester> tha'ts fine.

So how about you submit a patch that restores the original behaviour by
default and allows the new behaviour to be set as an option?

bugs-Template-Timer queue on rt.cpan.org should be fine for the patch.

Cheers!
