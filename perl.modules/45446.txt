ouch... this is both a dangerous name, and an icky problem to choose a 
better one.

My first thought was "Lets you create CODE refs that do more complex 
regex pattern matching that straight regexs".

Even though we don't have a Functional:: top namespace yet, I'd almost 
be tempted to say we create one.

Functional::PatternMatching is longish, but makes it a little clearer... 
you are probably going to want to use a VERY clear abstract too.

Functional::PatternMatching - Implements functional programming concept 
"pattern matching"

or something similar...

Thoughts?
