PAUSE then tried to index them and I received a report informing that ‘Some::Module’ (one of my fake modules) cannot be indexed because it’s already with someone else.

You can add a no_index entry to META.* to specifically avoid your fakelibs
directory - but t/lib is the normal place to put them, and would already
be ignored, so for this case I'd go with 'put them in the standard place'.
