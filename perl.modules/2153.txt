Not really, as I realized in the meantime, or maybe I'm missing something?

    http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Net::FTP

will show me a page with 6 modules, but what would seem most useful to
me, would be a link to this page:

    http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=libnet

But dist=libnet is a concept I cannot quite understand. There's some
logic in between I have no access to. Can you help me out?

I just tried

    http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=^Net::FTP$

which only generated one hit (as expected), but still the interesting
page is one click away.

Do you offer a syntax for "Give me the full libnet page although I
only know that I'm looking for Net::FTP"?

A great feature indeed.
