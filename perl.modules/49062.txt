The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::JD
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: conversion between flavours of Julian Date
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Astro::Time Time::JulianDateTime

  rationale:

    Representing dates as a linear count of days is such a good idea
    that it's been invented several times. This module converts between
    eight versions. Some of them differ about when the day starts and
    about whether they are absolute or timezone-relative; this module
    handles the concept translations rigorously. It allows the use of
    Math::BigRat as an alternative to native Perl numbers, in order to
    achieve lossless arithmetic and unlimited range.

    The name of the module is derived from Julian Date, which is
    abbreviated JD. Julian Dates are the oldest and best-established
    type of linear day count, and the whole class of systems is
    generically referred to as Julian Dates.

    Similar functionality: Astro::Time converts between JD and MJD, but
    no other flavours of JD. Time::JulianDateTime has a description that
    suggests it might do some of what this module does, but it doesn't
    actually exist yet.

    Other modules relating to Julian Dates: Time::JulianDay does
    conversions between JD, Gregorian calendar, and Unix time. It does
    so incorrectly, and is documented as such.
    DateTime::Format::Epoch::JD et al convert between *JD and DateTime.
    They assume a particular model of time-of-day (as does the whole
    DateTime ensemble). They are also subject to floating point
    rounding.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Sun May 28 00:58:53 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::JD              Rdpfp conversion between flavours of Julian Date   ZEFRAM
