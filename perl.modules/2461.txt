Obviously, then, this module is being used and is not outdated.  Thank
you for making this clear.

Mine is actually also an implementation of the TOC protocol.  Since
AOL is not allowing MS et al. to create clients that use the 'real'
protocol, I felt that any module based on it would be quite
unstable--it seems that AOL has no problem breaking everyone's client
by making small changes to the protocol that do not effect their own
code base, as they've done just this many times.

I did check for the existence of similar modules and found that the
existing modules were unsatisfactory (or, at least, their
documentation suggested this to me when I began my project).  That I
decided to name mine Net::AIM is somewhat accidental.  I began by
calling it Net::InstMsg, which was, as you can see in the archives of
this list, objected to (and rightly so) on the grounds that instant
messaging is not limited to AIM.  Forgetting that Net::AIM actually
existed, I followed a suggestion originating on this list and renamed
my module to Net::AIM.  I readily admit that it was pure sloppiness on
my part that I did not first check to make sure that no such module
existed.  I relied on my memory of the names of the modules I had
examined; it obviously failed me.

I'm sorry that you feel insulted.  I meant you no offense in naming my
module Net::AIM.  In fact, with one exception, I did follow the
protocol suggested on cpan.org concerning the creation of modules.
The oversight I committed, not making a final namespace check before
deciding on a name, was unfortunately a grevious one.

I feel that my module was also carefully designed to make instant
messaging easy for the module user.  The fact that my module does not
rely on previous work does not in any way indicate, in my mind, that
it was, as you say, 'slapped together.'  The final project is, to my
eyes, a fairly elegant solution, managing permit and deny lists, buddy
lists, and the like, as well as giving the module user complete
control if necessary while still maintaining the ability to abstract
away all socket communication if the module user wishes to do so.  I
feel that the module is a useful contribution to CPAN, and it is
certainly one that I will be actively using and updating.

I do realize that some of my actions were wrong, and I apologize for
the trouble; I will be renaming my module to Net::AOLIM, so the
namespace collision issue will be resolved within the hour.
