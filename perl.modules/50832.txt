Is mail2nntp an application or a module?

If it's a module, then the naming format is generally something like 
Email::Mail2NNTP, although personally I think something like 
Email::ToNNTP (although I don't like that either) would be better.

Having Email:: and Mail is most likely unnecesary duplication.

If an application, the name might be ok, although perhaps 
Email::App::mail2nntp.

Either way, you should probably talk to the Perl Email Project guys 
_first_ before choosing any pariticular name, and co-ordinate with them 
on this module.

I would talk to Ricardo Signes directly, since he's currently leading 
the Perl Email Project.
