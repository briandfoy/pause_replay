     why:

    Discussing taking over WWW::Dictionary, José Castro suggests I
    write: "Cog managed to persuade me to become the maintainer of one
    of his modules. He also said 'muahahahahahah'"

    CPAN is a wonderful thing and it is what makes Perl truly useful.
    However, some packages can use maintenance and I got some libraries
    (I lie. One "set" with 2 and modifications) I wrote that others
    might benefit from.

    shlomi fish (rindolf) also suggested I get a a PAUSE account...
