The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MaMGal
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: static image gallery creator
  userid:      PORRIDGE (Marcin Owsiany)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a mostly standalone program, though the executable script
    is a two-liner, the whole functionality being enclosed in the
    library modules. Including this in CPAN has the benefit of being
    able to easily: - embed it in other systems - fetch, install and
    resolve its dependencies

  enteredby:   PORRIDGE (Marcin Owsiany)
  enteredon:   Sun Aug  9 15:07:11 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MaMGal            bdpOg static image gallery creator                 PORRIDGE
