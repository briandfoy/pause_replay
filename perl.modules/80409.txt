Request to register new user

     why:

    I'd like to get a PAUSE ID in order to contribute CPAN.

    I am planning to release a new module I have designed for RADIUS
    log file parsing (internet access log files). This new module will
    parse a "rough" radius log file and will convert any found event
    into an XML format. I realized not any module was covering this
    point.

    This module has been designed especially for bigData log file
    parsing (more than 10Gb each log file, 100 files a day).
