    Modules and bugfixes.

    I'm ready to release Regexp::Common::debian (it's far from being
    complete though). Unnamed module to piggiback on APT's file fetching
    engine, unnamed client for Plan9 filesystem, some bells-n-whistles
    progress indicators are on the way. It's still under consideration,
    maybe something called Sort::Versions2 -- alternate (more generic?)
    splitting (if I'll find out that I really need it, that will be
    second).

    (about R::C::d) I really, really, really need access to CPAN
    testing facility. The module uses some nifty RE tricks, and I just
    don't know compatibility level (I can test with 5.10.0, 5.8.8, and
    5.8.4).
