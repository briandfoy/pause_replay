The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tuxedo::Admin
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: BEA Tuxedo runtime administration
  userid:      KBURDIS (Keith Burdis)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    TUXEDO.pm

  rationale:

    Tuxedo is a proprietary middleware product available from BEA
    Systems. It is in the same category as MQSeries, which has a
    top-level namespace, so I think it is reasonable for Tuxedo to have
    one too. Being an interface to commercial software, it doesn't
    really fit in with any of the existing namespaces.

    I'm currently only interested in writing a Perl-only module related
    to Tuxedo administration, so I'd like to use the Tuxedo::Admin
    namespace for this. I expect that additional modules will be created
    under the Tuxedo namespace - in particular Anthony Fryer's (AFRYER)
    recent contributions.

  enteredby:   KBURDIS (Keith Burdis)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun  4 00:22:11 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tuxedo::
::Admin           adpOp BEA Tuxedo runtime administration            KBURDIS
