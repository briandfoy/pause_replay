The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Smoothing::SGT
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Simple Good Turing smoothing
  userid:      BJOERNW (Björn Wilmsmann)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://www.topicalizer.com/bwilmsmann/wiki/index.php/SGT

  similar:

  rationale:

    This Perl module implements the Simple Good Touring (SGT) algorithm
    for smoothing of probabilistic values developed by William Gale and
    Geoffrey Sampson. SGT is an all-purpose algorithm when it comes to
    processing of statistical data and hence should be available for
    Perl as well.

    The algorithm is described in the following article:
    http://l2r.cs.uiuc.edu/~danr/Teaching/CS598-05/Papers/Gale-Sampson-smoothgoodturing.pdf

    The module was originally submitted as Statistics::SGT. However, it
    was suggested that it be renamed to Statistics::Smoothing::SGT in
    order to be findable for someone searching explicitly for smooting
    algorithms.

  enteredby:   BJOERNW (Björn Wilmsmann)
  enteredon:   Fri Dec 22 10:04:18 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Smoothing::
::SGT             bdpOg Simple Good Turing smoothing                 BJOERNW
