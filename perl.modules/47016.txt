     why:

    I use perl daily and wrote a bunch of diverse utilities that have
    proven useful to colleagues (mainly scripts and a few modules). I
    plan to upload them little by little after I have time to write a
    good documentation for them. For example, I have scripts: -
    calculating ion properties (magnetic rigidity from charge and
    mass,velocity from energy per nucleon,...), it just needs inputs and
    calculates every possible parameter from it. - making movies from
    the screen or a window (see
    http://www.tmaterna.com/programs/java/index.php for an example of
    movie made from a java3D applet) - computing how to arrange files to
    be saved in order to minimize the unused space on cds or dvds -
    wrapping a command, getting the output and/or error and sending an
    email when completed with some stats and diagnostics (useful to let
    a code run a few days, it will warn you when completed) - ....

    And also modules like e.g. one enabling the use of the SRIM energy
    loss program from a perl script,....
