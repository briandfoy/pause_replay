The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::CommonModules
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: common Perl modules not in core Perl
  userid:      KEVINRICE (Kevin J. Rice)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    classrooms at major university, chatrooms

  similar:
    Bundle::Bugzilla, Bundle::Everything

  rationale:

    There are many modules now that are not included in the core
    distribution of Perl. Bundle::Everything cannot work because it
    depends on libraries that may not exist. This module will ONLY
    require as prerequisites other modules that are PURE PERL, OR those
    for which libraries are known to exist (and are tested by use of
    __Devel::CheckLib__).

    Much time has been wasted finding out only through trial and error
    that a codebase of various scripts has all the requisite modules
    identified and installed in a new Perl instance.

    This module aims at reducing this liklihood by making it easy to
    just invoke cpan or cpanplus install and watching all the required
    modules be retrieved and installed.

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::
::CommonModules   adpOl common Perl modules not in core Perl         KEVINRICE
