description:

 From an announcement I just sent to the mason-users mailing list:

HTML-Bricks-0.02.tgz

v0.02 of Bricks Site Builder, a DHTML layout tool for Apache + mod_perl + 
Mason has been released. Bricks allows web designers to create a web page 
containing dynamic components without writing code. It will also, once I 
document the programming interface, let web programmers code cool dynamic 
elements that can easily be inserted into web pages containing dynamic 
elements written by others. Wouldn't that be kick-ass?

The code has been significantly cleaned up, the user interface has been 
polished, and a proper perl installation script has been added. While I'm 
hesitant to say that I'm 'proud' of the code in 0.02, it is certainly an 
order of magnitude better than 0.01.

Bricks Site Builder is available from 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bricks
