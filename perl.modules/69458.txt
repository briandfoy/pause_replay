     why:

    I am a student of Czech technical university in Prague. As a
    bachelor project I chose to update CalendarMonthSimple module which
    is used by a plugin for Twiki called Calendar plugin (the update
    consists in overriding the method as_html(), the new method takes
    place in new module called CalendarMonthSimple2, which is then
    called by TWiki::CalendarPlugin). Under the leading of Ciant
    (International centre for art and new technologies) I succesfully
    improved the visual look and feel of the calendar. Our main goal was
    to achieve Google-like calendar style. The results are more then
    satisfying. Thanks to updates made to CalendarPlugin (which were
    made by other student as a bachelor project) we can now display
    multiday event including time, as well as single day events of
    course. Simple javascript is provided to display details about each
    event in a bubble tooltip.
