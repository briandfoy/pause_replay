    I would suggest that there are so many iterator classes because
so many people have half an idea of what makes a useful iterator
class for Perl.  I'm not sure that we want to encourage more of that.

    Also, Iterator isn't really encompassing enough to be worth of a
top-level name (C++ zealots should just sit out this conversation).

    But that's precisely what people can't agree on, and that's why
there are so many iterator classes floating around.  Everybody has
his own idea about what the interface should be.
