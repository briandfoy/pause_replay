The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MojoX::UserAgent
  DSLIP:       adpO2
  description: Asynchronous HTTP user-agent based on Mojo
  userid:      ACAJOU (Pascal Gaudette)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Source Repo: https://github.com/Acajou/mojox-useragent/tree Mailing
    list: http://lists.kraih.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/mojo IRC:
    irc://irc.perl.org/#mojo

  similar:
    LWP is most simillar, but MojoX::UserAgent is based on the
    asynchronous design of LWPng
    (http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/LWPng-alpha-0.24/News) and leverages
    the features of the Mojo Web Framework
    (http://www.mojolicious.org/).

  rationale:

    This module was developed as part of the Google Summer of Code
    2009. The choice of namespace was obvious enough, as many other
    add-on modules to the Mojo Framework are already developed in the
    MojoX namespace. This module should be useful both as a general Web
    user-agent providing advanced HTTP features - like request
    pipelining - in a pure Perl module, and also to Mojo Web-Developers
    looking for additional Mojo-specific capabilities to ease automated
    testing of Mojo-based applications.

The resulting entry would be:

MojoX::
::UserAgent       adpO2 Asynchronous HTTP user-agent based on Mojo   ACAJOU
