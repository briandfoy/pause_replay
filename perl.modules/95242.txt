Hi Marco,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where people =
are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

You have ownership of the following namespaces:

	std
	csv

None of these modules are on CPAN (they may have been in the past). But =
your ownership clashes with the STD and Csv namespaces, which are owned =
by other people.

As a result I=E2=80=99d like to drop your permissions on these =
namespaces, to resolve the conflict. =46rom looking at your releases, I =
don=E2=80=99t think this will cause any problems, but wanted to check =
with you. Are you ok with this?

PAUSE will no longer let situations like this occur, so I=E2=80=99m =
cleaning up historical cases like yours.

Cheers,
Neil
