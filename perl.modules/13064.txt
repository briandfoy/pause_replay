How does one go about annexing a module?

I have, off and on, for several years attempted to contact SRZ,
(CPAN address, and various addresses I tracked down with google)
the author of Net::Interface and never received a reply.

The official version in his account is broken it

   does not return proper MAC address

   does not compile under 5.6 w/o user intervention

   contains commas in a qw (not yet patched)

I have a version which I have patched as these issues have come
up, and some people still manage to find it. But it would be
nice to prevent back experiences by others.
