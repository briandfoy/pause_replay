Having BOTH of Tournament and Schedule does seem to be a bit duplicative 
though...

If you created Tournament:: what modules would be likely to exist OTHER 
than things relating to rosters and scheduling?

Personally, I like the idea of a Games::Tournament API for doing this 
stuff, with Games::Tournament::RoundRobin/Swiss/etc implementations

The only thing there is Games::Tournament::BlackJack and I don't think 
that clashes with you much.

Your thoughts?
