Howdy!

I'd like to set up a PAUSE id. Here is the information requested in 04pause:

Jim Flanagan
jimfl@tensegrity.net
http://jimfl.tensegrity.net
pref-id: JIMFL
I plan to contribute, initially, a module called ExceptionHandling.pm
ExeptionHandling    RdpO    Java/C++ Style Exception Handling   JIMFL

This module has been available for over a year on my personal web site, and
every email I get about it asks: Why isn't this on CPAN? I have had some
improvements fed back to me, as well as queries as to whether or not it can
be distributed with commercial products.

Regards,
