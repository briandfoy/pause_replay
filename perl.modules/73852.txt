Agreed on the leaking.

I've had a quick look through what is there at the moment and have
concluded that I'm best to start by refactoring the test suite.

The current test suite has two separate copy and pasted test scripts
for the XS and pure perl cases. If I diff between the various
releases, it appears that they are being synchronised largely by hand
and in a fairly patchy fashion.

So I've created a t::lib::Test module and I'm extracting the test code
for each function into it's own test_uniq, test_whatever function, and
changing both test scripts to use the common testing code.

Once that is done, it should simplify the process of adding new tests
for the various problems in only one place. After that, I might look
at re-applying some of the simpler fixes that don't require XS-fu and
expanding the tests for the relevant functions to test against more
cases.

There's also at least one CPAN Tester throwing out-of-memory errors in
the tests, so I'm going to audit the size of the lists it uses to test
with to try and reduce that problem.

I'll assume that early in the new year you'll swoop in and do the hard
stuff, hopefully the house will be clean and ready for you by then.
