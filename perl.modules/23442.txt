The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gtk2::PodViewer
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A POD document widget for Gtk2-Perl
  userid:      GBROWN (Gavin Brown)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    #gtk-perl IRC, gtk-perl-list mailing list.

  similar:
    There is a Tk POD widget called Tk::POD. However it's not so useful
    for Gtk2-Perl applications :)

  rationale:

    Gtk::PodViewer is a custom widget based on Gtk2::TextView so I
    think the choice of namespace is reasonable. I've been working with
    the developers of Gtk2-Perl who are quite happy with it.

    The distribution includes a POD browser application that's quite
    useable although it's really an example. The idea behind the widget
    is that it can be used to display help documentation in a Perlish
    way.

The resulting entry would be:

Gtk2::
::PodViewer       bdpOp A POD document widget for Gtk2-Perl          GBROWN
