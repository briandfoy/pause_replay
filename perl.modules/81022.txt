Subject: Module submission Sew::Color

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sew::Color
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: rgb colours <=>  embroidery thread colours
  userid:      MARKWIN (Mark Winder)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Image::Embroidery

  rationale:

    This module is a compact module that does little more than
    encapsulate information that programmers often ask about - where can
    I get the rgb value for this particular embroidery thread, and what
    is the closest embroidery to this particular rgb value.

    There is a lot more that could added into the Sew namespace
    particularly with respect to reading and writing the formats that
    control embroidery machines. These machines are often owned and used
    by people whose only experiance of software is and designs is closed
    source. Which in itself is a bit depressing.

  enteredby:   MARKWIN (Mark Winder)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 15 15:16:37 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sew::
::Color           bdpfp rgb colours <=>  embroidery thread colours   MARKWIN
