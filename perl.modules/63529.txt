The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::Detect::CJK
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: detect charset of EastAsia string
  userid:      FOOLFISH (錢宇/Qian Yu)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/Encode-Detect-CJK

  similar:
    Encode::Detect

  rationale:

    This module is used to detect charset(encoding) for any binary
    string,optimized for web text and EastAsia( Chinese ,Japan,Korea)
    language. The accuracy is up to 99.94% much better than
    Encode::Detect in EasyAsia language.

    It has been published as CharsetDetector
    (http://search.cpan.org/dist/CharsetDetector/) for two years,works
    perfectly well.

    because the namespace of "CharsetDetector" is not good,so i rename
    the module name to "Encode::Detect::CJK".

    "Encode::Detect::CJK" has been uploaded and published at "
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Encode-Detect-CJK/ "

    This module is really very good,and widely be used in many project
    to detect charset. e.g. http://www.extmail.org/

    Thanks very much
