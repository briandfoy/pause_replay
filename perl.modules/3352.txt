Note from Andreas J. König:
Hi Rob,

as I'm taking over all entries from Doug's Apache Module List into the
main perl Module List, I have to register a few users that were listed
in Doug's list. If this is not what you want, please let us know and
we'll delete your entry immediately. Otherwise I'm happy to welcome
you on board.

Regards,
