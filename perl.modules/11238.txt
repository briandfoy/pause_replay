The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RPM::Update
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: compares installed packages with repository
  userid:      SHARRISON (Scott Harrison)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It will be located at.
    http://cpan.valueclick.com/authors/id/S/SH/SHARRISON/RPM-Tools-0.1.tar.gzls-0.1.tar.gz

    I think RPM::Update is a good choice since it is simple and relates
    to the purpose of usage.

    Uniqueness of approach: RPM::Update provides a lot of well-used
    options to compare, download, and upgrade RPMs on a system compared
    to a repository.

The resulting entry would be:

RPM::
::Update          adpfp compares installed packages with repository  SHARRISON
