Hi, Bradley.<br>
<br>
You&#39;ve run afoul of some very recent changes to tighten security of<br>
PAUSE. =C2=A0Specifically, you need to &quot;own&quot; the namespace<br>
&quot;Convert::Pluggable&quot; to be able to upload a distribution starting=

 that you<br>

&quot;Convert::Pluggable&quot; and assign permissions to you on the fly. =
=C2=A0So I<br>
suspect there might be a bug in the recent change to PAUSE and I&#39;ve<br>
copied the relevant people.<br>
<br>
That said, the Convert-Pluggable-0.014.tgz you uploaded looks very<br>
odd. =C2=A0The directory inside is not &quot;Convert-Pluggable-0.014&quot; =
and it<br>
contains a &quot;blib&quot; directory, a &quot;Makefile&quot; and &quot;MYM=

looks like you just tarred your development directory and that&#39;s<br>
