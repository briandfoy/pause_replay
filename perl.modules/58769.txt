Subject: Module submission VoiceXML::Client

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VoiceXML::Client
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Parse/interpret VoiceXML to control a TUI
  userid:      PDEEGAN (Pat Deegan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    VoiceXML::Server

  rationale:

    We were in need of a Perl VoiceXML parser and interpreter and none
    could be found.

    This module acts as a user agent that fetches voicexml documents,
    parses them and then executes the instructions therein by playing
    prompts and collecting user DTMF input/voice recordings through a
    handle to some type of telephone interface.

    This module's focus is on the client side--the XML documents are
    generated by a distinct process, unrelated to the module who's
    purpose is to control the audio interface according to the dictates
    of the VoiceXML content retrieved.

    We have been successfully testing this module as part of the next
    release of the VOCP voice messaging system (which uses voice modems
    to interface with land lines). The module can currently handle
    enough of the vxml specs to execute complex programs written in
    VoiceXML, and can navigate through vxml pages and jump between pages
    by submitting user data to a remote voicexml generator.

    It is our belief that this module might be of use to the community,
    so we'd be happy to share our work here under the terms of the GPL.

    Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

    Regards, Pat Deegan
