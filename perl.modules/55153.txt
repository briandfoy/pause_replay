The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Act
  DSLIP:       MmpOp
  description: The Act! conference management system
  userid:      BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://act.mongueurs.net/

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Act conference toolkit has already been used to manage 18 Perl
    conferences since 2003, and is now being studied by other groups
    outside of the Perl community for their own workshops.

    The recent discussions on module-authors seem to indicate that big
    apps should have a top-level namespace. We think that Act is now a
    big app. :-)

  enteredby:   BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul  1 16:51:43 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Act               MmpOp The Act! conference management system        BOOK
