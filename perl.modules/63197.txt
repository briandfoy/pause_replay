Hi,
Both modules are owned by Neil Watkiss (neil dot watkiss at sophos dot com).

I've contacted Neil and he's happy to give me co-maintainership of 
Inline::CPP and Inline::Struct. Only problem is that neither he nor I know 
precisely how this is achieved.

Can one of the PAUSE administrators attend to this for us ?
Alternatively, is there somewhere that spells out what needs to be done (and 
how to do it) ? If the task is not too laborious, I can probably coerce Neil 
into making the necessary changes himself :-)

Cheers,
Rob
