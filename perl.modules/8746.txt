ACK.

But I'm afraid, that there will be thousands (:-)) DTDs creating more
and more top level namespaces.
I agree that for important, well known DTDs a top level namespace is the
right way to handle them.
I agree, too, that XML namespace is the wrong place for modules taking
care for special DTDs.

Perhaps it's an idea for the future to create the top level namespace
DTD !?
