Hi all,

I got this failure email from the indexer for a dist I recently 
uploaded, and I'm confused as to what is wrong.  The META.yml in this 
distribution has a lot of things listed that it provides.  What's the deal?

Rob

Nothing in this distro has been
                      indexed, because according to META.yml this
                      package does not provide any modules.
