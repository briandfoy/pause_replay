The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gtk2::Ex::DBI
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Bind a Gtk2::GladeXML to DB server via DBI
  userid:      DKASAK (Daniel Kasak)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    gtk-perl-list@gnome.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The namespace part is easy. This module goes hand-in-hand with the
    Gtk2 module, and the Gtk2::Ex::DBI namespace was suggested by the
    Gtk2 developers in their mailing list.

    <sales pitch> Gtk2::Ex::DBI basically automates the process of
    database interaction when building Gtk2 apps with Perl. It handles
    querying, inserting and deleting records when given a DBI handle. It
    also 'paints' the data onto the form, supporting most of the Gtk2
    widget types. It detects changes made to a record, and handles
    passing those changes back to the DB server. It's recently had a
    major rewrite in the querying logic that makes it practically
    infinitely scalable with respect to recordset size ... it now pulls
    records in small 'slices' ( size is configurable ) when needed,
    maintaining very snappy performance on low-powered and low-memory
    machines even when running queries that return millions of records.
    I suppose this last part is the most innovative, but then again I
    assume others have trodden the same path before me. I'm the first to
    do it for Gtk2-Perl though :) </sales pitch>

The resulting entry would be:
