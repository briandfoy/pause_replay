     why:

    Hi. I work with perl about 4 years in Mail.ru Group search engine
    team. Not so match, but i have created quite a few useful modules
    that i hope to contribute some day. Now I'm working on different C
    level Algorithm and Math modules that a want to wrap in perl
    bindings and contribute it. I hope it will be useful for perl
    community. At first I'd like to contribute K order statistic
    algorithm and some machine learning features. A found some on CPAN,
    of course, but some of my implementations will be more faster.

    Another reason - i want to help with development of some existing
    modules. Sometimes at work we find some bugs in existing CPAN
    modules and i think, it will be rather nice to communicate with it's
    authors.
