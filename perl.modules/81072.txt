The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::AnyEvent::Time
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Time-related test on AnyEvent async routines
  userid:      TOSHIOITO (Toshio Ito)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::More

  rationale:

    Test : because the module is for tests and is based on
    Test::Builder. AnyEvent: because the module uses AnyEvent as an
    asynchronous programming framework. Time : because the module tests
    asynchronous functions in terms of their execution time.

    This module helps test user-defined asynchronous functions based on
    AnyEvent by providing easy-to-use time-related testers with a
    time-out mechanism. Usually asynchronous functions start some
    operation and kick a given callback when it is done. During
    development, however, you cannot be sure that your async function
    will kick the callback correctly. To prevent dead-lock in testing,
    you need a time-out mechanism to continue (or abort) the test when
    it takes too long time, which is why this module is created. In
    addition to the time-out, this module also provides functions that
    test execution time of an asynchronous function.
