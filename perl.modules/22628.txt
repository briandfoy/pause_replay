I've uploaded an update of Text::GenderFromName, originally
by Jon Orwant. Quick philosophy questions:

- This module is not (entirely) backward compatible. The
  lists it uses for matching are complete rewrites, and the
  base case logic is entirely new. That said, it now accepts
  user-supplied lists and includes the original matching
  routines, so the user could theoretically run it in a
  backward compatible manner. Is this sufficient?

- This update now has a prerequisite: Text::DoubleMetaphone.
  I believe in my heart of hearts that requiring this module
  is the Better Way to match, but again, it's a new
  requirement for the end user. Should I rewrite the module
  to make Text::DoubleMetaphone optional?

Thanks in advance. This is my first CPAN module, so your
brutality is appreciated.
