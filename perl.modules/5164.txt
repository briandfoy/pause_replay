The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Peep
  DSLI:        bdpO
  description: Modules for Peep:  The Network Auralizer
  userid:      STARKY (Collin Starkweather)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    The above module is based on the Peep network monitoring tool
    written by Michael Gilfix (I recently rewrote the clients as Perl
    modules), which was recently covered in USENIX's ;login magazine and
    was the winner of the LISA 2000 best paper award (for a copy of the
    paper, see the link at http://peep.sourceforge.net/intro.html).

  similar:

  rationale:

    Please discuss your reasoning about the namespace choice, the
    uniqueness of your approach ================ The namespace choice is
    the name of the monitoring tool itself. The namespace is
    sufficiently different from either any existing modules or any known
    item or function that it is unlikely to conflict with either any
    existing or pending submissions or any future submissions.

    Please discuss why you believe this module should be listed in the
    module list ================= It should appear in the module list
    because it is a highly original implementation of a network
    monitoring scheme, something that will be of interest to the
    significant portion of the Perl user base who uses Perl for systems
    administration duties. It also serves as a fully functional systems
    monitoring client library, for which there are currently no similar
    modules on the CPAN.
