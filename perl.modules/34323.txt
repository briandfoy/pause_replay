Request to register new user

fullname: Brian Kaney
  userid: BKANEY
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.vermonster.com
     why:

    I applied a while ago and apparently my account have been removed
    due to inactivity.

    I finally finished and ASCX12 EDI module I'd like to share and am
    re-requesting an account.

    Thanks in advance, Brian
