The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::MultiCat
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Build files from simpler files
  userid:      MBSTE (Michael B Stevens)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    perl.modules

  similar:
    none found -- perhaps a vague relation to File::Butler

  rationale:

    This module opens an input file. Each line of the file is parsed.
    First files mentioned on each line are concatinated to make up the
    last file mentioned on the line, and that file is written to disk.

    The module is mainly used for preprocessing the pages of a website
    when each page has common elements like menus, headers, and footers.
    It differs from most preprocessing programs -- most use a macro
    language. Instead, this module uses a single file which tells it how
    to construct every page in the website from smaller text files.

    A script based version (as opposed to this proposed module) can be
    downloaded from:

    http://www.mbstevens.com/preprocessor/index.html

    It is the "mcat.pl" script from that download. The functionality of
    the proposed module can be used in conjunction with other macro
    based preprocessors.

    Since the module can be used for any kind of construction of files
    by concatination, I thought it best not to put it under html:: or
    text::. I have also done a search under "preprocessor" and found
    nothing that functions like this module -- all that I found perform
    more like macro processors. I welcome suggestions.

    Thanks, mbs
