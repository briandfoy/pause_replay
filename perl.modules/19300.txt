The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::DirSize
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Calculates total size of a Win32 directory
  userid:      ARICH (Adam Rich)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    None that I know of... File::Find can be used, but its very slow

  rationale:

    There is currently no module for calculating directory sizes under
    Win32. The workaround is to use File::Find but it's not best suited
    for this task, as it is very slow and resource intesive. I've
    created this Win32::DirSize module based on Win32::API that is 2-8x
    faster. I also plan on releasing an XS-based solution soon that
    should improve speed by a factor of 10-20x.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::DirSize         adpfp Calculates total size of a Win32 directory   ARICH
