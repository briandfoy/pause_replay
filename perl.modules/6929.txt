Hi,

It would be nice if anyone could help me to make
decision to create new module to 
test some functionality of our product separately.

The software module should responsible for the HTTP
header parsing, the HTTP 
header compression, the HTML filtering must support
standalone tests. We are 
having separate file for each of the above methods.
Now we need a module which 
will separately tests each of the above functions. May
be by autoload each of the 
above functions file.

My question is how can I auto load the file separately
and how can I interface and 
test as well. it would be nice if anyone could provide
example of source code also.

I hope I will get help soon and can start to create
the module successfully.

Best regards,

Karim
Software Designer.
