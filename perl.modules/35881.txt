Subject: Module submission Algorithm::Knapsack

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::Knapsack
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Brute-force algorithm for knapsack problem
  userid:      ANDALE (Alexander Anderson)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.announce newsgroup and email the author

  similar:
    Algorithm::Bucketizer Algorithm::BinPack

  rationale:

    The knapsack problem asks, given a set of items of various weights,
    find a subset or subsets of items such that their total weight is no
    larger than some given capacity but as large as possible.

    Algorithm::Bucketizer and Algorithm:BinPack target the bin packing
    problem, which is different in its definition to the knapsack
    problem, depite the two problems being related in their solution.
    Even though theoretically the problems can be reduced to one
    another, each problem has special cases, for which its algorithm can
    be optimized towards a better computational complexity.

    Algorithm::Knapsack v0.01 solves the special case of the 0-1
    knapsack problem when the value of each item is equal to its weight.
    In future, the module perhaps will be extended to solve the general
    knapsack problem and other special cases of the problem.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
