Hi!

I'm a heavy user of Inline::Python and as such have found quite a few memor=
y=20
leaks and segfaults and already fixed some of them (patch postet on the RT).
I tried to contact the author Neil Watkiss (NEILW) about them, but I cannot=
=20
find any email address that works. They all bounce with "User unknown in=20
local recipient table". I posted on the inline mailing list at=20
inline@perl.org and got an answer indicating that Neil may not have time=20
anymore for his modules.

I already posted at perlmonks.org asking for any contact information for a=
=20
possible change of maintainership as I'm interested in continued work on th=
at=20
module and publishing a new version when I'm done.

So any help in contacting the author or transfer of maintainership would be=
=20
greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Stefan Seifert
