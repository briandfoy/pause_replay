     why:

    1. The worlds greatest ssl tunneling script. Major selling point is
    its ability to tunnel through a series of proxy hosts e.g. if your
    local proxy restricts the ports it allows, or injects return chars
    that would break ssh (this is quite common), and to forward TCP/IP
    without needing ssh and an ssh daemon. Also supports proxy auth...

    2. Perhaps a modularised version of 1.

    3. Got a vague urge to revamp CORBA::ORBit to work with ORBit2 -
    I've got commit on the orbit-perl CVS so this really just requires
    copious free time.
