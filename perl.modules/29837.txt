The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::PatternMatching
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Functional languages' Pattern Matching
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Params::Validate

  rationale:

    Sub::PatternMatching implements "Pattern Matching," a programming
    idiom often found in functional languages like Haskell or OCaml.
    Pattern Matching refers to functions that do different things for
    different arguments. It is often referred to as polymorphism as
    well.

    The syntax is currently a bit convoluted taking away much from the
    benefit of readability by replacing nested if-else constructs with
    pattern matching. This is supposed to be fixed in a later release,
    but maintaining backward-compatibility.

The resulting entry would be:
