     why:

    I am currently working on a set of perl modules for inputing and
    querying data in Solr, an open source lucene based search engine
    developed by CNET. I've been authorized to release my work to the
    open source community and having taken so much from CPAN in the
    past, it'd be an honor to have a chance to contribute.
