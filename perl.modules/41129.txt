     why:

    I have an OO DBI module that I wrote during development of an
    application for my company that I think others would find
    particularly useful. I know there are already a ton of DBI-wrapper
    modules out there, but I find myself going back to this module over
    and over, as it's incredibly simple and easy to use.
