The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Carp::Clan
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: blame errors on callers of "clan" of modules
  userid:      STBEY (Steffen Beyer)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    email with author

  similar:
    Carp.pm

  rationale:

    Module has been online for years now. Would like to give co-author
    access rights since I cannot maintain it anymore (lack of time).
    Need formal registration for that.

    Short summary:

    This module reports errors from the perspective of the caller of a
    "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp.pm" itself.

    But instead of giving it a number of levels to skip on the calling
    stack, you give it a pattern to characterize the package names of
    the "clan" of modules which shall never be blamed for any error.

    So these modules stick together like a "clan" and any error which
    occurs will be blamed on the "outsider" script or modules not
    belonging to this "clan".

The resulting entry would be:

Carp::
::Clan            Rdpfp blame errors on callers of "clan" of modules STBEY
