Request to register new user

fullname: Adrian Hall
  userid: AHALL
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.mirapoint.com
     why:

    Mirapoint hosts have an Administrative API which talks over TCP. I
    have developed a Perl module that deals with talking to this
    protocol in a nice familiar manner to the Perl folks. I will be
    uploading this module primarily, but will also be uploading other
    Mirapoint related modules (particularly access modules to the
    address book and calendar functionality that are currently in
    development)
