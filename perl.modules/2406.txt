Hi,

Please let me know if I am doing this wrongly!

This is the *third* attempt I have made to register a new Tk module I have
written. I have uploaded the module onto CPAN, but would like it to be
mentioned in the CPAN list of modules and have access to edit the account
detail through pause.

Module: Tk::Pgplot
Description: A Tk interface to the Pgplot plotting library
DSLI: bdcp


At the same time I would also like to register another module name which
I would like to put on CPAN:

Module: Astro::IRAS
Description: A perl interface to the IRAS point source catalogue
DSLI: cdpf

Cheers
Chris Phillips
