From: stwrtpj@earthlink.net (Pete Stewart)

I registered Games::Object way back in January or February and have 
uploaded various versions since then. The module is approaching beta 
status and I would like to be able to update the metadata for this 
module to reflect this (it is currently listed as alpha) but the pause 
server still tells me I have no modules registered.

I'd really like to get this module registered, please. If this is not 
possible, please at least reply to tell me this.

Thanks in advance.

Pete
