	I've thought about it some more and having XML as the
	base category for XML::MDS2 is shortsighted.

	I'm reluctant to propose another top level category, but I
	don't see anywhere this module, and others that are expected
	to follow, really fit.

	Here is my list of possible categories, in my preferred order.

	1) Security	(broad category, surprised it's not already used)
	2) MedSec	(short for Medical Security, somewhat cryptic)
	3) Healthcare	(greater than 8 chars, but likely unique)
	4) Medical	(ambiguous)

	I like #1 because Security::MDS2 fits my needs right now,
	yet it's reusable for other modules as well.

	Comments?
