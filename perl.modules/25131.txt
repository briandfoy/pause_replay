Greetings,

I am aware of the backlog of work for the modlist maintainers, but I'm 
becoming a bit concerned that the registration of Digest::SHA has 
dropped through the cracks.  This is causing some problems.

Due to lack of permissions enforcement, there have been two unauthorized 
publications to the Digest::SHA tree that are causing confusion.  
Specifically, these are the "3.1-alpha1" and "4.0.2" versions.  I would 
like them removed.

My understanding is that once the Digest::SHA is registered, the 
permissions will be strictly enforced so that only the author can 
publish to this tree until others are explicitly allowed.

I appreciate your kind and thoughtful attention to this request,

Mark Shelor
