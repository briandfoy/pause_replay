Hello,

Through a series of missteps, I uploaded a version of the
Bio::DB::Das::Chado module that was given as 2.0.  I've scheduled that
for deletion (I think pause said it would be deleted on Monday).  When
that file is gone, will reindexing this module work?  Also, is there a
way to speed that scheduled deletion up?

Thanks much,
Scott
