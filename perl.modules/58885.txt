I'll speak up here (CSJEWELL @cpan) and say that there are worse things 
than just going on holiday that'll cause people to go away temporarily - 
I've been in hospital for almost a month's time (27 and 29 days, as I 
recall) twice in the last two years (the second time was for a surgery that 
should deal with the problem for a few years)...

I'm not anywhere near in authority, but if there is no rush, 4-6 weeks 
would probably be polite, I think!
