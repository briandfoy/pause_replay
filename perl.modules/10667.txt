Hello,

This is Brian Richardson, brian@cubik.ca, URL http://www.cubik.ca/. I
have written the beginnings of a Perl Chess engine. Currently, it is
capable of validating the legality of a game of chess. Plans will expand
to writing a skinnable user interface in Perl/GTK+, and a rudimentary
(inasmuch as I'm not a great chess player!) AI. I've spoken with the
author of Meta (who began a Meta::Chess module) and received the
go-ahead to do this development. I'd like to release this module under
the namespace Chess, and under the CPAN ID of BJR.

Thanks,
Brian
