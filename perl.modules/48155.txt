The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Trigger::Ordered
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Class::Trigger wrapped module
  userid:      BOXPHERE (Satoshi Ohkubo)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::Trigger Module::Pluggable::Ordered

  rationale:

    Class::Trigger is very convenient to develop by object-oriented.

    However, it is also true that the room for the improvement still
    somewhat remains. And I paid attention to the control of the
    processing order and made this module.

    You may think one of cases enhanced in Class::Trigger in the
    future.

    It would be greatly appreciated if becoming your help.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::Trigger::
::Ordered         bdpOp Class::Trigger wrapped module                BOXPHERE
