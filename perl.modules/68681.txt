I trust you meant Net::Wave?

Now, I have to admit, I'm not familiar with Wave. Let me note, though, 
that if it's a rather high-level protocol that builds on HTTP or SOAP 
and friends, it may be better off in WWW::Wave or WebService::Wave. If 
it's lower level than this, then Net::Wave may indeed be a good choice 
of name.

Cheers,
Steffen
