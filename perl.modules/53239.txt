The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Farm
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Distributed software testing framework
  userid:      JWU (吴健源)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    None

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Test::Farm is a general software testing framework. It works in a
    Client/Server module, where the server can receive tasks and
    dispatch tasks over a set of testing clients, the clients execute
    tasks and report the results to the server.

    When specified, a certain tasks can only be run on clients that
    meet the constraint. Tasks can also be scheduled based on work load
    or certain priorities.

  enteredby:   JWU (吴健源)
  enteredon:   Mon Feb 26 17:36:41 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Farm            adpOp Distributed software testing framework       JWU
