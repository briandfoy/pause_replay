> I getting ready to release a new module to the CPAN that has a recommended dependency on Win32::IPC and Win32::Semaphore. Both of these modules do -NOT- reside independantly on the CPAN, but rather are part of the large bundled  libwin32-0.191  Bundle. The problem is, my new module will have a dependency on Cygwin in the Windows environment, due to the need for a working IO::Pty module installation. The full suite of libwin32 DOES NOT COMPILE using gcc under Cygwin - but Win32::IPC and Win32::Semaphore -do- and work as expected.

It should - look at http://search.cpan.org/src/JDB/libwin32-0.27/Changes
  . If you have problems with it - submit a bug to
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=libwin32

Also check
http://cpantesters.perl.org/show/libwin32.html#libwin32-0.27
For Cygwin: one FAIL (dll locked) and one PASS.

> QUESTION - is it possible, in addition to the libwin32 bundle, to have separate copies of IPC and Semaphore in the CPAN?? I'm attempting to put a CPAN installation together now, but there appears to be no easy way have a dependency on these modules without compiling and installing the entire Bundle.
You should write to Jan Dubois about this.

P.S. 2PAUSE admins: libwin32-0.27 by Jan is marked as UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE.
