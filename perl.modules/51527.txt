The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CFEngine::CFPerl
  DSLIP:       bdpha
  description: cfengine parser and extender module
  userid:      TEODOR (Teodor Zlatanov)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    cfengine mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    cfengine is a multi-use server configuration tool. See
    cfengine.org. cfperl is a Perl-based tool that extends and
    understands cfengine configuration files. See
    http://lifelogs.com/cfperl/ for more information.

    The CFEngine::CFPerl module will provide:

    - a multi-purpose parser based on Parse::RecDescent - crontab
    parser - useradd/usermod/userdel functionality - better file editing
    than cfengine

    I could not find a better namespace root. cfengine does a lot of
    things in one package, so it does not fall neatly under any of the
    existing namespaces (and it only fits in the "Miscellaneous"
    category as a module). If you can think of a better namespace, feel
    free to suggest it.

The resulting entry would be:

CFEngine::
::CFPerl          bdpha cfengine parser and extender module          TEODOR
