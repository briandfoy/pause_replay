    Tie::EncryptedHash, perhaps?  There's nothing secret about the hash,
is there?

    Could you say more about this?  What is a `generic' cryptographic key?

    While the algorithm is particularly useful for PKC applications, it's
not exclusively applicable to cryptography.  I suggest Math::PrimeGenerator,
perhaps.

    This sounds right on to me.

    Cool.

    It sounds specific to the current implementation of Mail::Internet, and
it doesn't explain itself.  Could you say more about what it does, and
perhaps why it shouldn't be folded into Mail::Internet?
