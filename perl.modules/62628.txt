Subject: Module submission Business::3DSecure
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, drfrog@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::3DSecure
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: ED Secure Protocol interface
  userid:      DRFROG (Clayton Cottingham)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    none so far

  similar:
    Business::OnlinePayment

  rationale:

    There is a need for a 3D Secure interface to support the handling
    of Verfified by Visa etc at my work.

    We decided to implement a solution based off the
    Business::OnlinePayment model

    If this Module is approved i will be approving our initial
    processor for this, which supports the Cardinal 3d secure
    authentication as has been running live for at least 3 months by now

  enteredby:   DRFROG (Clayton Cottingham)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 14 00:19:02 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::3DSecure        RdpOp ED Secure Protocol interface                 DRFROG
