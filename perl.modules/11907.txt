PLEASE transfer Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet from JKOHLES to IVAN

I know you are busy, but please please please take care of this transfer
as soon as you can.  I have been trying for over six months to get this
transfer to go through.  The original author concurs, the updated version
is available, and I am getting exasperated supporting users who download
the old version from CPAN and cannot get it to work.

PLEASE transfer Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet from JKOHLES to IVAN

Thank you.

I haven't used or really maintained the onlinepayment modules in quite a
while, if you would like to take them over, be my guest, I'll try and
answer questions the best I can if you have any...
