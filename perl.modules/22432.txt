Hello "Modules",
is there any reason why the "Perl 5 Module List" has not been updated 
with HTML::TagReader for such a long time now?
I started HTML::TagReader in Oct 2001 and it is still not part of
the module list. 
Personally I think that HTML::TagReader is a very cool thing and
much more users could benefit from it if it was part of the official
index (the Module List). 

Regards
 Guido
