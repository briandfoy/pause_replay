Subject: Module submission CGI::Application::Structured

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Application::Structured
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Structured MVC for CGI::Application
  userid:      VANAMBURG (Gordon Van Amburg)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Titanium CGI::Application

  rationale:

    This is a web framework based on CGI-App similar to Titanium, but
    with a different focus. Puts more focus on developer productivity
    and standardization of project strucuture, while maintaining
    adequate performance under CGI for moderate use apps.

    This project was previously accepted to the module list by Matt S.
    Trout. At his recommendation I have changed the name from 'Attanium'
    to 'CGI::Application::Structured'.

    More thanks to Matt for the name suggestion.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Application::
