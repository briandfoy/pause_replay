*	a description of what you're planning to contribute     

	I am planning on uploading a perl package. Currently called PDFCGI
which allows the creation of PDF files from within a perl program. It works
	on text and allows font,  size and color with page size currently A4
or Letter. It was developed to produce Business reports which were required
in PDF. 
	It deals with the text on a line by line basis.  There is a complete
demo system and documentation of all aspects of this package.

	This package has been created for Jaguar Cars with the aid of the
technical manuals provided by Adobe and obviously conforms to the Adobe
standard layout of the file.  It has been written completely from scratch
with no other developers or perl code used.

	Hope this is of interest.
