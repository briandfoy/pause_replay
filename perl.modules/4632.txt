Preferred username: NWILLIAMS
Planned contributions:
    sqlbrowser, script which frontends (via perl/Tk) to any DBI driver
allowing users to run queries, view results and view the schema of the
database (so far, schemas only implemented for db2, sybase, csv). Aim is
to produce a user-friendly interface, instead of the typical DBA-like
access which tries to mimic traditional CLI implementations and hence
are not particulary friendly or
    ErrorCatalog, a class providing a registry of errors which can be
generated from an application. Registry is in XML format, provides
varying levels of description/cause/fix/etc. Written in such a way as to
check for duplicate errors, to provide the ability to breakpoint
whenever an error is generated, etc.
    CLI, class to derive from which wraps readline/cmdline into system
for eval'ing arbitrary commands. Useful for writing quick scripts with
varying functionality, but with a consistent interface.
    Enhancements to HTML::FormatText, HTML::Stylesheet allowing
ANSI colour-code markup and better parsing, based on an HTML::Stylesheet
object...

Above modules/scripts NOT discussed outside company yet, first planned
release externally. If anyone would like to query about any of the
above, then I'm happy to discuss.

Nick
