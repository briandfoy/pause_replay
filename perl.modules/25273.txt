Greetings:

In the near future I'd like to submit a module for inclusion on CPAN.  I need
some advice on the appropriate namespace, however, since I don't want to
pollute top-level namespace.

Unofficial module name (as it's being developed):  PerlDBM
Synopsis:  Pure-perl implementation of a dbm engine.  Supported only on
           platforms with 64-bit platforms.  Database files are portable (all
           data is stored in network-byte order), with record-level locking
           and transactions.  Has it's own API for low-level control, but also
           will support tied hashes.

I did notice that most of the XS wrappers for C-based implementations were all
in top-level namespace, though.  Any suggestions/preferences?
