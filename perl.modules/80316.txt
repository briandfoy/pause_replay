The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MCDB_File
  DSLIP:       adhrl
  description: fast, reliable, simple, 64-bit constant mcdb
  userid:      GSTRAUSS (Glenn Strauss)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    on github already; plan to discuss in mailing list in future

  similar:
    CDB_File

  rationale:

    mcdb (mmap constant database) is originally based on the cdb
    package, a: "fast, reliable, simple package for creating and reading
    constant databases." mcdb is almost 33% faster, provides support for
    use in threaded programs, and supports databases larger than 4 GB.

    CDB_File module is based on cdb and has the limitations of cdb (max
    4 GB database, not thread-safe). This new module, MCDB_File improves
    the speed and removes the limitations, but mcdb databases are *not*
    compatible with cdb so this module could not be an enhancement to
    CDB_File.

    Please consider this request for a top-level namespace in order
    that this module follows the naming convention of other Database
    *_File modules (AnyDBM_File, CDB_File, DB_File, GDBM_File,
    NDBM_File, SDBM_File, etc.).

    Cheers, Glenn
