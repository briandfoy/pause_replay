     why:

    I'm beginning to collaborate with some co-workers on developing
    some modules related to batch system processes, typically the kind
    done on *nix platforms and run from cron - they receive >1 upstream
    inputs, process these inputs on a time interval (when they come,
    daily, weekly, monthly), possibly do some transformations and then
    make them available to some downstream sink (typically the same box
    and into a database). Very ETL'ish, but not necessarily data
    warehouse/mart specific.

    Again, this is just in the beginning stages of anlysis and some
    design work.
