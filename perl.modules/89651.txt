Hi, Bradley.

You've run afoul of some very recent changes to tighten security of
PAUSE.  Specifically, you need to "own" the namespace
"Convert::Pluggable" to be able to upload a distribution starting with
"Convert-Pluggable-*".  However, PAUSE should be able to see that you
are the first person to upload "Convert/Pluggable.pm" with the package
"Convert::Pluggable" and assign permissions to you on the fly.  So I
suspect there might be a bug in the recent change to PAUSE and I've
copied the relevant people.

That said, the Convert-Pluggable-0.014.tgz you uploaded looks very
odd.  The directory inside is not "Convert-Pluggable-0.014" and it
contains a "blib" directory, a "Makefile" and "MYMETA.*" files.  It
looks like you just tarred your development directory and that's
wrong.  You should run "make dist" and the makefile will create a
proper tarball for you and that's what you should upload.  I don't
think that's the problem, but I mention it both to help you do it
better next time and to help those who can look into the bug to rule
it in or out as a cause.

So... please be patient and let us try to resolve the bug.  You can
follow along on a ticket I opened here:
https://github.com/andk/pause/issues/108

Apologies for the problems but thank you for being persistent in
asking for help.

Regards,
David Golden
