The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Domain
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Allows local setting of textdomain
  userid:      JSMITH (James G Smith)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    Locale::gettext provides a Perl interface to the C libraries -
    Locale::PGetText offers similar functionality with only Perl code,
    but does not support domains

  rationale:

    The namespace is chosen for the mnemonic qualities:

    { my $domain = new Text::Domain q: domain :; # effectively the same
    as `local textdomain q:domain:;' # do stuff } # old domain restored
    here

    The idea behind the module is to allow applications using the
    gettext routines to have their dictionaries while other code added
    later or by other developers, even distributed separately, can have
    their own dictionaries without affecting already existing code. This
    module takes care of most of the housekeeping.

    A functional (vs. OO) interface is also included: pushtextdomain
    'domain'; poptextdomain;

  enteredby:   JSMITH (James G Smith)
  enteredon:   Thu Dec 13 21:29:37 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Domain          bdphp Allows local setting of textdomain           JSMITH
