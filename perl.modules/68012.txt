     why:

    An OO wrapper for real and tied hashes, following in the footsteps
    of Hash::AsObject, Hash::Inflator, Data::OpenStruct::Deep,
    Object::AutoAccessor, and probably others. The main difference
    between my class and its forebears is that it supports tied hashes,
    in addition to regular hashes. This provides nice modularity: the OO
    wrapper is generic; all special semantics come from the tied hash.

    I'll also be contributing a series of subclasses that provide
    special semantics (via tied hashes, of course).
