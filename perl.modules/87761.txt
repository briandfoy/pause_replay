The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Mock::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple way to mock all or parts of a module
  userid:      TANK (Erik Tank)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::MockObject

  rationale:

    Test::Mock::Simple is a bare bones (contains no helpers) way to
    mock an object by only replacing a name space's method that you
    specify.

    There are several Mocking object, however, they all have a specific
    purpose or attempt to help you out; thereby getting in the way (at
    least for my needs at the moment).

    Simple is a word which we wish to avoid, however, since this does
    nothing else but over ride methods the only logical alternative is
    Test::Mock. However, I do not think it appropriate to claim that
    name.

The resulting entry would be:
