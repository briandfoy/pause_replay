Subject: Module submission Image::ValidJpeg

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::ValidJpeg
  DSLIP:       adcfg
  description: A simple module to validate JPEG image files
  userid:      SANBEG (Steve Sanbeg)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a simple module to parse JPEG files to check for
    corruption; I recently needed this functionality to check my own
    image library.

    This is the C version; I also implemented some of this in perl, but
    that was significantly slower. There are a few different methods to
    trade off between speed & accuracy.

    It doesn't decode the image, but just parses it according to the
    spec, so it's just standard C with no extra libs.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::ValidJpeg       adcfg A simple module to validate JPEG image files SANBEG
