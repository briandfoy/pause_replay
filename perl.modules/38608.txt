Hello,
i am registered user at pause.perl.org as "ondr".
Have 2 questions:
1. I can't found information about module AZ::Splitter at section "Edit module metadata". Maybe something wrong?
2. I had uploaded new (0.60) version of AZ::Splitter today. Should i do something more for replace old version?

ps: sorry my bad english..
