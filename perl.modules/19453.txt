     why:

    I'm developing modules to communicate with the J1850 data bus. All
    automobiles sold in the US that are 1996 and newer use a variation
    of this bus for communication between the embedded controllers, and
    to diagnostic tools.

    I'd like to put it on cpan so I can gain interest in this project.

    I also have modules to communicate with the 94-95 Camaro, Firebird,
    Corvette and Impala. They can be extended to any 1987-1995 General
    Motors car or truck. I might upload this so that someone else may
    take it and maintain it.
