Dear Bayanzul,

welcome to CPAN and the Perl community!

Instead of quoting all the documentation on this subject in detail, 
allow me to point you to it.

See
perldoc perlnewmod
perldoc perlmodstyle
perldoc perlmodinstall
perldoc perlmodlib

and http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/04pause.html

In principle, there is no specific qualification to upload to CPAN. The 
short list of things is:

1) use the command "h2xs -AX Your::Module::Name" to create a 
best-practices template CPAN distribution. Other tools exist. From the 
top of my head, I can only point you to Module::Starter, but there are more.
2) Put your code into the distribution. Modules under 
lib/Your/Module/Name.pm. Scripts go into bin/foo.pl or script/foo.pl.
3) Edit Makefile.PL to reflect some of those changes (like registering 
the scripts). You could use Module::Build instead of 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker. (see perldoc Module::Build)
4) Register as a new user with the Perl Authors Upload Server (PAUSE) at 
pause.perl.org and supply a potentially secret contact mail address 
where your USER@cpan.org mail should be forwarded.
5) Run the following commands to generate Your-Module-Name-X.YY.tar.gz 
for upload to PAUSE/CPAN:
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make dist # that creates the tar.gz
6) Upload the distribution to PAUSE.
7) Optionally try to register the (main) module name with 
modules@perl.org. There is a registration form on pause.perl.org for 
that. This gives you the benefit of getting feedback on the namespace 
choice from us.

Off the top of the hat, I'd suggest looking at the Lingua::* namespaces, 
but I might be wrong with that.

Best regards,
Steffen
