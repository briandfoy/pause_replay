The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::UTCFileTime
  DSLIP:       bdcfg
  description: Get UTC file times from stat() on Win32
  userid:      SHAY (Steve Hay)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    perl5-porters@perl.org, perl-win32-porters@listserv.ActiveState.com

  similar:
    File::stat, Win32::FileTime

  rationale:

    This module is intended as a fix to perl bug id #18513: Last mod
    time from stat() can be wrong on Windows NT/2000/XP.

    In response to that bug report, Slaven Rezic found a website
    (http://www.codeproject.com/datetime/dstbugs.asp) which explains the
    problem (Perl inherits the bug from a quirky Microsoft C
    implementation of stat(2) that doesn't always correctly report the
    file times (last access, last modification and creation) in UTC),
    and gives a C library that works around it by providing a function
    that retrieves correct UTC file times.

    It was suggested on p5p that the bug was unlikely to be fixed any
    time soon in the Perl core, so writing a module to workaround it
    would be a good stop-gap solution, and may even galvanise people
    into action to apply the fix to the Perl core in due course.

    This module uses the above-cited C library function to provide a
    replacement for Perl's built-in stat() function which now reports
    correct UTC file times.

    The C library itself was posted with a GNU GPL licence, so that is
    what this module itself must be for now. I have contacted the author
    of that C library with a view to making the code available under the
    usual Perl licence (GNU GPL / Artistic): he is currently
    investigating the purity of the code and will reply to me shortly.

    Lastly, there is already a Win32::FileTime module on CPAN, but that
    has nothing to do with this bug: it simply provides an OO interface
    for retrieving file times, much like the standard File::stat module,
    in fact.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::UTCFileTime     bdcfg Get UTC file times from stat() on Win32      SHAY
