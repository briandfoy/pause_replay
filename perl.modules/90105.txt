Between twice and four times a day sounds fine. IMHO, the scripts section
needs some attention before it's worth tweaking it any more. In particular:

It doesn't index scripts uploaded via FTP
It doesn't index scripts in tarballs
It is one freakishly-long and continuously-growing page

I hope to address some or all of these issues soon, at which point it may
make sense to revisit the indexing scheme. Or, if anyone else wants to take
a whack at it, it's Open Source, after all. :)

Kurt, what would you suggest for a good cronjob scheduling? The old<br>
