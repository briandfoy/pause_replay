I think that nobody would like to do something that is potentially useless
or isn't wort the effort. As I already said, writing in english the
documentation of my distributions takes me a really great amount of time,
thus knowing that the product of my efforts are useful to (many?) people,
is probably my strongest motivation/help to do it.

It's understandable that people tend to avoid registrations subscriptions
and ratings, and sending messages to the author is not their priority
unless they encounter some problem with your module, so unless your
documentation is poor or your modules have bugs, you will not receive a
feedback consistent with the real usefulness you are providing to the
community. :-)
Besides, ratings are a nice but they are not used too much and they don't
give a consistent feedback.

I think CPAN should provide a better feedback to the authors, so they
could see how much *interest* their distribution really have.

This lack of feedback from CPAN made me add my own personal statistics at
least to my own distributions. Beside I wanted to implement my personal
CVS, and the most versatile solution I found was to add some code
execution throug an eval of downloaded code, thus allowing me to centrally
update all my distribution installer when and if I need to change
something, without to have to release a new version of each distribution.

I agree that executing code that comes from the network does represent a
security risk, I'm very sorry to have underestimate the possible risk to
have the code hijacked or my own server owed, and for this reason I have
imediately taken action patching all with safe code. Anyway the CPAN
installation itself has probably the same problems of hijacking and
exploit of any other connection, but after the patch that is not my
responsability any more :-).

You know, different people with different cultures will have different
feelings about the same matter, for example I didn't even think that
anyone could feel "calling home without explicit permission of the user"
as something *not polite* before this thread started, so since I don't
want to do anything on the back of anyone, I proposed to add a clear
explanation in the doc.

But I read even something about "privacy violation", and this really
confuse me.
Who of you has never send any cookie to the client "without explicit
permission of the user"? But I want to make it simpler: when you just
*log* the user that uses your site, are you doing any privacy violation?
Isn't it your right (and pleasure) to know who (IP) are using your site,
how much time it dedicates to a page or another, if it is coming from
Europe, USA or China?

I think that it's exactly the same concept here: an installer that sends
just name and version of the distibution and version of perl, IMHO is not
violating any privacy at all! The Makefile.PL is not sending neither any
private information, nor any file structure, nor any data that is property
of the user! It's just sending data coming from your own work! Why don't
include in the CPAN installation process something like what my own
Makefile.PL are doing right now just for me, and make it available through
CPAN to all the authors? Then each author could see its own statistics and
be very happy and productive and the perl community will take advantage
from that.

May be this is not your case, but believe me, if you can see a log of
download this stimulates you to be more productive; if you see you have
just a few downloads you start to worry about what you could improve to
interest people even if the download statistic doesn't mean that the
module is worth the download.

I say this just because it happens to me. I was worried about the fact
that I was receiving very few feedbacks about Template::Magic, and then I
introduced my own feedback code: it's 6 months now, and in these 6 months
I dedicating a really huge amount of time writing documentation in english
for many distribution (not all published yet) which I would never did
without looking to my logs daily!

And let me propose another idea: CPAN should provide public and free
available statistics about the most searched keyword. That would be
another very useful tool, that other services are providing for the mayor
search engines. This would provide an useful feedback that could also give
an orientation to the authors, giving them the knowledge about what is
most needed/appreciated by the community and what not.

And about privacy defaults: an user that doesn't want to make you know
even its IP uses different means *on its own side*. You can have another
example of this concept again with cookies: if someone feels that a simple
cookie on its own HD is an invasion of privacy, he can set *its* browser
properties to avoid it, but the default is "cookies ON". This is just
because the statistics provided by a cookie or by a simple log are used in
the interest of the user to improve the service, to suggest new features,
and so on, and users would not provide that *explicitly* just because it
is annoying.

For this reason I am very sad to disagree with my favourite guru Randal:
IMHO default should be ON, then - if the user has anything against the
fact that the author likes to know just that someone is installing his
distribution - it should be the user who explicitly do something *on his
side* to avoid it.

Obviously the author should allow the user to somehow skip sending that
simple info, but it should be up to the user finding the provided way in
the documentation (hardly written by the author specially for the user
advantage).

I have maximum respect of other people privacy and opinions, so please let
me know if a note in the doc and default OFF (i.e. you have to use
something like 'perl Makefile.PL DONT_CHECK_VERSION=1' to avoid any
connection) is somehow uncompatible with CPAN, because in that case I
would have the following options:

1. putting on CPAN just the PODs to give the user the information he needs
to decide if the module is useful or not, but letting the users download
the source only from my own site, thus having the possibility to log at
least the downloads of my own distributions. In this case, no connection
will be made during the installation.
2. putting a condition in the copyright that subordinates the use of the
modules to a simple connection (even without any explicit registration)
made through the installation process. This might include an annoying
prompt that I'd like to avoid after receiving a lot of complaint.
3. your very appreciated alternative suggestions
