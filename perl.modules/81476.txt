The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perlmazing
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Amazing fast and useful Perl functions
  userid:      ZARABOZO (Francisco Zarabozo)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    Perlmazing mailing list and website

  similar:

  rationale:

    Perlmazing was created over more than 15 years of working on all
    kind of Perl projects. It extends Perl functionality with a set of
    very well thought and tested functions that save time and are hard
    to leave after using them.

    It doesn't reinvent the wheel. It uses several external useful
    modules from CPAN to accomplish things in a very intituive and
    simple way. Most Perl experienced developers would know what each
    function does and probably will find their syntax completely
    familiar/logical to Perl itself.

    Perlmazing doesn't load hundreds of things in memory. In a lot of
    cases, it loads sub modules on the first function call so it doesn't
    spend unecessary time, processing or memory with things that were
    never used in a program.

    Most functions in Perlmazing are functions that any kind of script
    could benefit from, as they are very commonly recurred features and
    have most common tasks written in a very tested and optimized way.

    Perlmazing benefits from its own namespace by separating all its
    functionality in submodules and keeping clean root namespaces where
    it needs to export symbols into other spaces and submodules.

    This module is a working module in most of the companies I've
    worked for. It's been amazing helping me develop and improve things
    anywhere. I also know that what is really amazing is Perl itself,
    this is just good Perl work. That's why I called it Perlmazing.

    I hope this name gets approved. It's not a name that colides with
    anything else or that gives the wrong impression on what it does.
    Also, I already have the domain perlmazing.org for it and another
    CPAN project heavily using it.

    Thanks,

    Francisco Zarabozo
