I'm not a geograph,
but a module calculating distances of the earth,
could have the name
GEO::Distance

But do you really calculate the distance on the earth,
or the distance on a sphere (as the earth seems approximately to be) 
between two coordinates ?
In that case I would suggest:
Math::Sphere::Distance

(That could also have the advantage,
 that this module would be used by non-geographs)


Cheerio,
