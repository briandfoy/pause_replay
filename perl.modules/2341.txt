I've not been following this but I'll make one observation:

Regardless of any constraints/conventions/procedures etc relating to
the "CPAN" archive and "PAUSE" upload software, the "Perl Module List"
is a publication produced by Andreas (and nominally myself) and we have
ultimate control over what's in it.

The original conception was that CPAN would be open for uploads of
pretty much anything (we would not want it any other way) but that
entry into the "Perl Module List" would require that the module name,
at least, met some very basic informally (ill)defined criteria.

I hope that's helpful in some way.

Tim.
