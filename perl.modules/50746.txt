Someone subscribed me to pause6@lists.cpan6.org and
tools@lists.cpan6.org . I'm not sure what's going on with that, but I
figure we already have enough lists to handle all of this stuff. If
we're going to talk about PAUSE, I'd rather do it on this list.

But, it doesn't really matter to me because I won't really have that
much time to pay attention to it. I'm content with the little amount of
work it takes to do the admin stuff without adding more to my plate. :)
