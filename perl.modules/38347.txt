Hello,
	Last night I uploaded Test::Output version 0.01 to PAUSE and it was 
indexed under my name. Today I uploaded a new version and it was placed 
under JPRIT.
	I had searched through CPAN to make sure there were no other modules 
with the name Test::Output before I uploaded. So I'm not sure why this 
revision's owner has been changed.

Thanks for your help.
