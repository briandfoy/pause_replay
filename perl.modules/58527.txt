The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::FeatureFactory
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Raw data to data frames for machine learning
  userid:      SIXTEASE (Oldřich Krůza)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Lingua::Phonology::Features

  rationale:

    The module aids by evaluating features on data samples (hence
    Data::Feature) but doesn't provide the features themselves, rather a
    way to simplify creating them (hence Factory). The name pattern is
    inspired by XML::SAX::ParserFactory.

    Lingua::Phonology::Features mentioned as a related module has a
    similar notion of features, including distinguishing between binary
    features, scalar features etc. but serves a completely different
    purpose: defining a hierarchy of features.

  enteredby:   SIXTEASE (Oldřich Krůza)
  enteredon:   Fri Jan 11 13:26:32 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::FeatureFactory  adpOp Raw data to data frames for machine learning SIXTEASE
