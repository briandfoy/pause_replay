Dear Sir / Madam,

I would like to submit a set of modules on CPAN called the VPDMf (standing
for View-Primitive-DataModel framework). These are modules that perform
forward- and reverse- engineering with Rational Rose (and will be able to
use XMLSchema in the future). This is object-oriented code with a number of
scripts to run certain

Basic description:

VPDMf

Object oriented UML support for PERL based on Rational Rose's REI
interface. Upload facilities from Rose (using OLE) will be combined with
ODBC links to provide engineering capabilities to and from different
database and object oriented programming applications (including Perl,
XML, ODBC, JDBC).

DSLI: cmpO
(not sure I fully understand what 'support level' means here)

One thing: due to the interaction between this software and Java, I'm trying
to
use a java-like package tree (i.e., edu.usc.kmrg.vpdmf). Will this be OK to
implement on CPAN?

Thanks

Gully
