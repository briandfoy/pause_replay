     why:

    Good Morning,

    we have developed a Perl Module with some scripts, which can
    analyze and check Pro Engineer (or now Creo) configurations. Since
    we decided to release it under the GPL license, the best way to made
    this module available to others is upload it to cpan. That's why I'm
    asking for an account.

    Kind regards,

    Joachim Langenbach
