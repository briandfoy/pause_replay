     why:

    I've been writing in Perl on and off for the last few years. I
    stepped on the train back in the day when 5.6 was still hot and
    happening.

    Wrote a bunch of simple tools, wrote a bunch of larger projects to
    help me keep track of my music and movie collections. Wrote an IRC
    bot (hey, everyone needs their own IRC bot, right?), then another
    one where I avoided the mistakes I made while writing the first,
    then wrote a framework for a third bot that was even more Best
    Practices Compliant.

    I think that I even started a Wiki-esque project some time, which
    made me explore how templating system works and had me look at MVC
    design models.

    But all of that was just a bit of toying around. Now I wrote
    something that could be useful to Perl hackers around the world.

    JSON::Simple - a simple to use module that can produce and parse
    JSON. Mostly out of discontent with the interface to the existing
    JSON modules out there, but also as an exercise and to see if I
    could do it.
