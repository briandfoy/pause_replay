The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graphics::EPS::Xyplot
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Creation of various xy-diagrams
  userid:      WIHAA (Wilhelm Haager)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    PostScript-Graph, Graphics-Simple

  rationale:

    The proposed package facilitates the creation of various
    xy-diagrams, - line plots - scatter plots - area plots - bar graphs
    in a very flexible way.

    Only one object type is needed for all kinds of plots, type of
    plot, colors, line types and widths, symbols, grid, labelling,
    background, size, scale (lin or log), etc. ars controlled by
    properties. Not much knowledge is needed for making simple graphics,
    as all (of the 60) various properties have useful default values.

    Xyplot heavily depends on (and requires) the package EPS. An Xyplot
    object is a child of an EPS object and inherits all its properties.
    Beyond, any Postscript command can be given as a method name (which
    is translated into Postscript via AUTOLOAD). Thus, any Graphics or
    Texts can be added to a diagram (like legends, explanations etc.)

The resulting entry would be:

Graphics::EPS::
::Xyplot          RdpOp Creation of various xy-diagrams              WIHAA
