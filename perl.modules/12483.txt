I asked about this on comp.lang.perl.modules, but I didn't get any
useful responses, so I figured I'd try here.

I'm looking for a simple, lightweight perl module to do intelligent
handling of command output for automated system maintenance scripts
that run out of cron.  In particular, I'd like it to unconditionally
save the output of each command to a log file, but also to be able to
do other things with the output based on arbitrary criteria.  The most
common use would be to email a copy of the output to a specific email
address if the command exits with a non-zero return code.

I didn't see anything similar to this in the perl module list, but I
might have missed something.  If a module already exists to do this,
please point me at it and disregard the rest of this note. ;)

Assuming that no such module currently exists, I'll probably write one
myself.  If I do, should I contribute it to CPAN?  I was surprised by
the lack of responses on c.l.p.m, but this seems like the sort of
thing that other people would find useful, so I'm not sure if it's an
appropriate contribution or not.

Also, I'm not sure what name to use for the module.  Whether or not I
contribute it to CPAN, I'd like to use a name that doesn't
unnecessarily pollute perl's namespace.  The two ideas that I've come
up with are:

   AutoJob
   Batch::Output

I'd like to know what you think about these ideas, or if you have
other suggestions.

Thanks in advance for any information!
