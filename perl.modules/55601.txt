Subject: New co-maintainership of Net::Ping requested

From: steve@fisharerojo.org (Steve Peters)

Over the past month, I have attempted to contact Rob Brown, the 
current maintainer of the Net::Ping to either include various bleadperl
updates to the module or to get co-maintainer rights to added so that
I could do it myself.  Unfortunately, I have not gotten any response
from him.

In my first email, I sent the email directly to the email address listed
for him on CPAN.  I did not receive any failure message and my email
logs show that the email was received without problems.  Hearing no
response, I sent an additional email a week later.  I also sent the
email to an additional email I found on Rob Brown's website <rob@roobik.com>.
I have also posted a patch of the accumulated bleadperl fixes to the 
CPAN RT without any response <http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=28348>.

Despite being a core module, Net::Ping has had no updates to the module
distributed through CPAN in over four years.  This means that several
of the fixes distributed with bleadperl are not currently available to 
users of earlier versions of Perl directly through CPAN.  Also, the 
CPAN RT queue has several bugs and, more importantly, bug fixes that
have not yet been applied that would benefit users of all Perl versions.

With this, I respecfully ask that I be granted co-maintainter rights to 
Net::Ping in order to accomplish the tasks needed to get the module 
moving forward again.

Thanks,

Steve Peters
