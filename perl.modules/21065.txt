     why:

    I am planning to create newer versions of modules Tcl and Tcl::Tk
    to make them compilable using more modern perl, make them robust
    (currently they do crash often). This allows perl to be connected to
    existing Tcl installation, and this has advantages to existing
    perlTk scheme, where current stable version does not supports
    Unicode. Currently I have working version of module that proves the
    concept. (Also I explained my ideas at URL
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=250229 but currently I
    have working version of modules) I sent letter to author of module,
    Malcolm Beattie, and received respond that mail server is not
    available.

    Also during following two months I am planning to create a module
    that will provide necessary support for cross-compiling modules for
    WinCE platform.

    PS. Also I sometimes participate in discussions and sometimes bug
    fixing in perl5-porters list.
