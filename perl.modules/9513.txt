What is SZTime?  Why not Time::HiRes, which is going to be included with
perl 5.8?

__RE__

Time::SZTime implements another time format than Time::HiRes

But it makes use of Time::HiRes at the moment, i am thinking about
making it independent of Time::HiRes.

SZTime is miliseconds since 1.1.1986

and for good for more precision than unixtime but less than HiRes

i thought it some people could be interested in it.

And I am using it in most of my programs yet.
Instead of adding the functions to each of the modules
a central module is easier to handle.

I hope you understand my position.

Greetings.
