Hello,

I would like to submit a module that calculates CVSS (common vulnerability
scoring system - https://www.first.org/cvss/faq/) values to CPAN but I am
unsure of what namespace to put it in. I looked through a list and also did
a search for ones that I thought might be appropriate but could not find
anything that seemed to fit. Right now in my sandbox I have it as just
'CVSS'. Looking for either confirmation or recommendations.
