I have created a new Perl mod_perl Apache module that I have called,
Apache::FileMan.pm.

FileMan provides a file manager for a web sites through a web browser. It
is a extensive rewrite of the Apache::AutoIndex.pm module (written by
Philippe M. Chiasson), which in turn was a remake of the autoindex Apache
module. FileMan can provide the same functionality as AutoIndex.pm and can
be used to both to navigate and manage the web site.

I would like to release this to CPAN when the time is right.  I have never
done this before, so I will probably need some help.  I believe that the
mod_perl@apache.org list will give it a good look before I release it.

Here is some of my information:
