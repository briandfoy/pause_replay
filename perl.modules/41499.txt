     why:

    I'm just thinking about Documentations for Catalyst (which doesn't
    fit in their distribution) and some light plugins (also for Cat).

    I also have some utility classes that aren't by any chance good
    enough for cpan by now, but rewrites based on a
    ExtUtils::ModuleMaker structure are very high in my list if i get
    more free time.
