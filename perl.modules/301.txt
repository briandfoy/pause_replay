Yes, I do also think 23 is too mish-mash to put the module, but
this module does not provide interface to any kind of OS or hardware.

It offers methods to handle (and manage) pattern-based schedule
structure, and since there's no category like "Time Related Modules",
I think this should belong there (#23), at least for now.

I thought about putting this to "Data Types and Data Type Utils"
category, but since I wasn't sure what data type it really meant
(is is limited to data held in certain database?), I decided to
put it into Misc category.
