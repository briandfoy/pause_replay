The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::NeedlemanWunsch
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: sequence alignment with configurable scoring
  userid:      VBAR (Vaclav Barta)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::LCS HTML::ListScraper Bio::*

  rationale:

    Algorithm is the root namespace of Algorithm::Diff and
    Algorithm::LCS (which Algorithm::NeedlemanWunsch generalizes),
    author's names specify which sequence alignment algorithm the module
    is about (the name could use 3 levels, but Algorithm::Diff and
    Algorithm::LCS don't, there's no Algorithm::SequenceAlignment and I
    don't think there'll ever be enough modules in that category to
    justify an extra namespace level).

    I'm pretty sure the algorithm is implemented in various
    bioinformatics libraries, but even if those implementations are
    usable from Perl, it's overkill to install large frameworks just to
    do something as well-defined and independent of everything else as
    aligning sequences (especially since I have in mind a usage quite
    far from biology).

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
