The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Marpa::R3
  DSLIP:       imhOl
  description: Experimental version of Marpa, #3
  userid:      JKEGL (Jeffrey Kegler)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    "marpa parser" Google Groups mailing list, Ocean of Awareness blog

  similar:
    Marpa::XS, Marpa::R2

  rationale:

    My current experimental branch of Marpa (Marpa::R2) has significant
    value added at this point, and may soon need to be stable-ized. In
    particular, Marpa::R2 is the only XS-powered version of Marpa that
    does not depend on Glib, and therefore is far more portable than the
    current stable version. When Marpa::R2 is stable, I will need a new
    experimental version of Marpa, and I therefore am requesting
    Marpa::R3.

    The practice in the the past has been to treat the entire Marpa::*
    namespace as reserved for the Marpa project.

The resulting entry would be:

Marpa::
::R3              imhOl Experimental version of Marpa, #3            JKEGL
