The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LRpt
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Toolkit for csv files comparison
  userid:      PKALUSKI (Piotr Kaluski)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    lreport.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a toolkit for comparing csv files. Rather then doing line
    by line comparison, it compares column by column. Where diff reports
    only the fact that lines are different, LReport will show exactly
    which column is different. LReport can compare files of unlimited
    size. LReport is a name which I have chosen for some personal reason
    when I was developing a tool for helping me in testing. Later, I
    realized that I can encapsulate it in a set of perl modules. LRpt
    seamed the most natural name for the module.

  enteredby:   PKALUSKI (Piotr Kaluski)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct  3 18:20:38 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

LRpt              bdpOp Toolkit for csv files comparison             PKALUSKI
