The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DataWarehouse
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl Data Warehouse Toolkit
  userid:      NFERRAZ (Nelson Ferraz)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Perl is an essential but often invisible tool in many companies,
    specially in the Data Warehouse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
    process. However, if you search cpan for "data warehouse" you won't
    find many modules clearly dedicated to that.

    In YAPC::Europe 2010, I presented some common data warehouse tasks,
    and proposed a generic set of tools to deal with Data Warehouses -
    the Perl Data Warehouse Toolkit.

    At first I wanted to use "DW"; but I think "DataWarehouse" is a
    better namespace for that. (Data::Warehouse is not a good option,
    since "warehouse" is not a specific type of data; "data warehouse"
    is a concept per se.)

The resulting entry would be:

DataWarehouse     adpOp Perl Data Warehouse Toolkit                  NFERRAZ
