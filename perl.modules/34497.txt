<BR>They were his nearest and dearest friends on earth, and in his boyi=
sh heart he loved them all and believed in their goodness and sincerity
The possibility of finding a bad character mark on any of their familia=
r faces made him shudder, and he determined then and there never to use =
the spectacles to view the face of a friend or relativeHad any one, at t=
hat moment, been gazing at Rob through the lenses of the wonderful Chara=
cter Marker, I am sure a big W would have been found upon the boy's fore=
head
When the family circle broke up, and all retired for the night, Rob kis=
sed his parents and sisters with real affection before going to his own =
room
<BR>But, on reaching his cozy little chamber, instead of preparing for =
bed Rob clothed himself in the Garment of Repulsion
Then he covered the glittering Garment with his best summer suit of clo=
thes, which effectually concealed it<BR>He now looked around to see what=
 else he should take, and thought of an umbrella, a rain-coat, a book or=
 two to read during the journey, and several things besides; but he ende=
d by leaving them all behind

to civilized countries, this time, where I can get anything I need<BR>Ho=
wever, to prevent a recurrence of the mistake he had previously made, he=
 tore a map of the world and a map of Europe from his geography, and, fo=
lding them up, placed them in his pocket
He also took a small compass that had once been a watch-charm, and, fin=
ally, the contents of a small iron bank that opened with a combination l=
ock<BR>This represented all his savings, amounting to two dollars and se=
venteen cents in dimes, nickles and pennies
