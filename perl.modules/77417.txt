Perl 5 Porters,

Tie::File has not been updated on CPAN since 2003. P5P has since then =
made multiple patches to it in core. During the release of 5.12 and =
5.14, I emailed Mark to attempt to get him to update or give me bits. I =
was unable to reach him as all of his emails are bouncing as =
unreachable.

I propose Tie::File be moved out of cpan and into dist in source, with =
p5p registered as the owner of the module.

Does anyone see a problem with this?

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
