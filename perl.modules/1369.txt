Hi all,

I've written a state-machine parser of e-mail Received: headers which
adheres to RFC822 except for cases where a significant number of MDA's
deviate from it.  I would like to make it available on CPAN.  What
should I call it?  It's currently Mail::Header::Received.

For anyone who's interested, the module is available at

  http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/parp/Mail/Header/Received.pm

(For the even curiouser, I wrote it as part of a Perl replacement for
procmail I'm writing, which has added spam fighting capabilities.  The
filter is at

  http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/parp/

.)
