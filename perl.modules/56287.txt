The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SWF
  DSLIP:       bmhOl
  description: wrapper for ming, a SWF generating c library
  userid:      LISCOVIUS (Peter Liscovius)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    ming-devr@lists.sourceforge.net, ming-users@lists.sourceforge.net,
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/ming/

  similar:
    SWF::Builder SWF::File FLV::ToSWF

  rationale:

    Ming, a SWF (ShockWaveFlash - file format of Adobe Flash) output
    library written in C, has an existing perl wrapper (beside others).
    This lib and the wrapper are maintained since 2001 and project is
    hosted on sourceforge.

    The library has its own chapter in an Oreilly book: Perl Graphics
    Programming Creating SVG, SWF (Flash), JPEG and PNG files with Perl
    By Shawn Wallace First Edition December 2002

    SWF is a root namespace, but the intuitive and quick usage of

    use SWF;

    exists for long time.

    BTW: The library is used in the creation of generating swf
    testfiles for gnash, a free player for the flash file format
    encouraged by GNU.

    But it is still not available on CPAN.

    Looking the existing SWF modules on CPAN I see no module name
    clashes. The overlapping with SWF-Builder and SWF-File is tolerable
    in my mind.

    Ming contains following modules too:

    SWF::Action SWF::Gradient SWF::SoundInstance SWF::TextField
    SWF::Bitmap SWF::DisplayItem SWF::Morph SWF::Sound SWF::Text
    SWF::Button SWF::Fill SWF::Movie SWF::SoundStream SWF::VideoStream
    SWF::Constants SWF::Font SWF::Shape SWF::Sprite

  enteredby:   LISCOVIUS (Peter Liscovius)
  enteredon:   Fri Sep 14 02:15:34 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SWF               bmhOl wrapper for ming, a SWF generating c library LISCOVIUS
