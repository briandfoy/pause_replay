Subject: Module submission PayflowPro

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PayflowPro
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: Perl PayflowPro payment gateway interface
  userid:      VKHERA (Vivek Khera)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Paypal Developer forums

  similar:
    Business::OnlinePayment::PayflowPro

  rationale:

    This is a drop-in replacement for the proprietary binary-only
    distribution of the old PFProAPI perl interface Verisign (former
    PayflowPro owners) distributed. This version uses the new HTTP based
    interface created by Paypal (current owners of PayflowPro). I use a
    different name to distinguish it from PFProAPI and so that both can
    be installed at the same time for transition.

    The Business::OnlinePayment plug-in seems to still use the old
    PFProAPI underneath. My module is intented to be feature and bug
    compatible with the old one, making migration trivial.

The resulting entry would be:

PayflowPro        Mdpfp Perl PayflowPro payment gateway interface    VKHERA
