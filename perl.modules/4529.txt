Before uploading this perl module, I wanted to post something here
to see if anyone had any objections.

Embedix::DB is a database abstraction layer for a system that keeps
track of what distribution has what packages.  That's oversimplifying
things a bit, but I don't want to bore anyone with the details.  If
you really want more info, you can go to:

    http://opensource.lineo.com/~beppu/perl/Embedix-DB.html

It's meant to work with Embedix::ECD [0] which I have already contributed
to CPAN.

DSLI        => bdpO
description => 'persistence for ECDs'


Unless anyone has any objections, I'll be uploading it to CPAN
in a few days.  Thanks.
