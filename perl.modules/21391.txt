The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Calendar::List
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Provides a list of calendar dates
  userid:      BARBIE (Barbie)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://use.perl.org/journal.pl?op=display

  similar:
    Calendar::Simple

  rationale:

    A poster on a technical board wanted some code to provide a list of
    dates, where there was some choice as to the format and exceptions.
    I wrote an initial wrapper around Calendar::Simple, but quickly
    realised there was a wider use for this module and wrote a more
    generic module.

    The module was split in two, Calendar::List and
    Calendar::Functions, both to be included in this distribution.

    The Calendar::Functions module provides some basic Calendar
    functions, together with some wrapper code around DateTime,
    Date::ICal or Time::Local depending upon which one is installed.

    The Calendar::List module exports two functions: calendar_list and
    calendar_selectbox. The former returns a reference to a hash of
    dates in scalar context and an array of dates in list context. The
    latter function returns an HTML code snippet in a text string that
    can be placed in a HTML page for a dropdown Select Box Form Field.

The resulting entry would be:

Calendar::
::List            bdpfp Provides a list of calendar dates            BARBIE
