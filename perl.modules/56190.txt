Hello,

We use the Net::MAC module, and in Jan 2006 I worked with the author, 
Karl Ward, on some feature patches for his next release.

We corresponded until around November 2006, and he sent me a copy of the 
latest development version of the module.

Since then I have not heard from Karl, despite emailing in February, 
March and July of this year (2007). None of those emails bounced.

As Karl has neither responded to me, nor shipped a new release of that 
module, I can only assume he has gone away from the CPAN for a while.

It's a very useful module, and I don't see any value in forking it. 
Please could someone allow my PAUSE Id "OLIVER" to be a co-maintainer of 
Net::MAC? I promise to be faithful to Karl's intent for the module, and 
of course not mess with the licensing or copyright.

I would plan to merge my patches, which answer some of the BUGS section 
in the current release's documentation, with the CVS tree Karl sent me, 
and release that.

regards,
oliver.
