The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Mining::AssociationRules
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: Compute frequent sets and association rules
  userid:      DFRANKOW (Dan Frankowski)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wrote a little association rule miner for fun. It calculates
    frequent sets and association rules. It is functionally complete,
    though could be improved (of course). In particular, the API could
    be better, and the docs are not yet strong. :-) However, I'd like to
    put it in CPAN before I forget entirely how to do that (!).

    To that end, I ask you:

    *** is it appropriate to put this functionality in
    Data::Mining::AssociationRules ?

    I looked in some other spots (e.g., Algorithms) and nothing felt
    quite right. Moreover, I can imagine Data::Mining::TemporalSequences
    or other things, so maybe there's room for growth there.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Mining::
::AssociationRules adpfg Compute frequent sets and association rules  DFRANKOW
