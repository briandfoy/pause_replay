The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::Auth
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Enterprise Level Digest based Authentication
  userid:      AVITARNET (David Peter Smith)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    Sourceforge, My website and blog

  similar:
    Digest::MD5 Javascript::SHA1

  rationale:

    There have been a few attempts at open source modules that fill
    this role, however they seem to have fallen short for heavy
    commercial use.

    While the intended use is CGI via the internet/intranet the module
    is robust and independent enough to be used for nearly any type of
    Perl application or script.

    This modules approach is to be specifically just the authentication
    via hash digests and leave the other stuff to the people that know
    how to do it right. For example:

    The module attempts to be Digest independent (Although Digest::SHA1
    is the default module).

    The data storage is handled by the DBI; at the very least they can
    use the DBD::CSV or DBD::SQLite if they cant get a high performance
    database like MySQL.

    The configuration is flexible, allowing for it to fit the needs of
    enterprise applications, but with realistic default configuration
    choices to tailor it to your specific needs.

    Lastly with this module you have flexibility in using cookies or
    not, using client side javascript applications in conjunction with
    this module or not, and automated security to prevent/ban usage from
    repeated authentication failure.

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
