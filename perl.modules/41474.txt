Subject: Module submission Sub::Timebound

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::Timebound
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Timebound execution of subroutine
  userid:      MVR (Ramana Mokkapati)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Proc::Reliable

  rationale:

    Timebound Subroutine execution is important for gracefull error
    recovery as well as for extracting reliable service from unreliable
    components. The "signal" handling approach for timebound execution
    implemented here works on Win32 as well as Unixish systems. This is
    nifty module that eliminates recurring code in many applications.

    Proc::Reliable handles similar situation for exernal process. The
    current module deals with in-process situations without fork() -
    this is useful when subroutine returns Perl structures.

  enteredby:   MVR (Ramana Mokkapati)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul  7 04:15:07 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sub::
::Timebound       Rdpfp Timebound execution of subroutine            MVR
