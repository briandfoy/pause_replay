I'd like to propose a new entry in the modulelist: 

modid:       Win32::ExchDistList

DSLIP:       adpfp

description: MS Exchange Distribution List Maintenance 

userid:      KEVINRICE (Kevin J. Rice) 

chapterid:   22 Microsoft Windows Modules

similar:     No similar modules.  Win32::AdminMisc does NT account
maintenance.  My 'Win32::ExchDistList' will do MS Exchange Distribution
list maintenance, a different thing entirely.

rationale: 

There are plenty of Visual Basic scripts available at the Microsoft Site
to do things with Exchange Distribution Lists.  Many are quite
confusing.  Almost no _Perl_ code exists to do creation, deletion, etc.
of MS Exchange Distribution lists.  I've recently had to confront
creating 1500 distribution lists BY HAND for a medium-to-large MS
Exchange installation (conversion).  This could have been automated, and
the frustration level prompted me to solve this problem.  I can't be the
only person dealing with this issue, so the module will hopefully be
widely useful / valuable. Note, a major impediment to translating MS VB
to Perl is the undocumented nature of MS Exchange OLE transactions.
I've figured out how to do most of these (and have an extensive test
program to exercise this module).  

Functions included in this module are:  is_valid_dist_list,
is_dist_list_member, create_dist_list, delete_dist_list,
get_dist_list_members, set_dist_list_members, add_dist_list_users,
remove_dist_list_users, print_proto (prints all module function
prototypes). 

Note:  This is not an OO module.  I'll convert it to be such as a
subsequent module revision.

Other Module names considered were:  ExchDLAdmin, AdminExchDL,
AdminDistList.  Since distribution lists exist on other mail servers,
including 'Exch' in the name seems proper.  'ExchDistList' is a good
shortening of MSExchangeDistributionList, I think.

I'm a little worried about how to go about testing the module at other
installations, but I have a good generic test program to run, and
someone on the Perl NT Admins discussion list will be able to provide
another testing environment for me.

This is my first module to submit to CPAN.  Please be frank if you have
suggestions.

Cordially,
-- Kevin
