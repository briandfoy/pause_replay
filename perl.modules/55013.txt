Hi,

I am polishing off a module I wrote to make web app/service
prototyping easier (well it seems easier for me anyway).

The gist of it is a module that lets you create a server and mount
code refs to uris, much like Ruby's WEBrick. In fact that was the
inspiration for the name:

HTTP::Server::Brick

HTTP::Server::Brick is not a clone of WEBrick - it's "in the style of"
WEBrick like
those movies in the discount VHS bin are "in the style of Lassie": The good guys
get saved, the bad guys get rounded up, but the dog's never quite as
well trained...

Anyway, I thought I should check if there were any objections to the name etc.

I know it's a somewhat 'polluted' area with many similar modules, but
nothing that quite hits the spot. HTTP::Daemon and
HTTP::Server::Simple aren't as simple/terse and HTTP::Daemon::App is
geared towards a single app mounted at root. A very short synopsis is:

my $server = HTTP::Server::Brick->new( port => 8888 );

$server->mount( '/foo/bar' => { path => '/some/path/htdocs' }  );

$server->mount( '/test/proc' => {
	handler => sub {
	    my ($req, $res) = @_;
	    $res->add_content("<h1>Foo</h1><p>$req->{path_info}</p>");
	    1;
        },
        wildcard => 1,
});
$server->mount( '/favicon.ico' => {
	handler => sub { RC_NOT_FOUND },
});

Cheers.
