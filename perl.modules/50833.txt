In general the best naming pattern is

1. If you are scraping their website, use WWW::

2. If you are using a published web service, use WebService::

3. If talking to them involves their own protocol, or strange 
connection-level complications, then use Net:: for the base layer, and 
then consider building the rest on top of that in a seperate namespace.

Some older modules (Net::Flickr) etc have been a bit dubious, and 
ideally we'd like to move away from that to a more regularised naming 
scheme.

This naming trend is emerging as being more and more important as the 
number of web services grows...
