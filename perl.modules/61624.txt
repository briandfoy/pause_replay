The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Lazy
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A simple webdev framework extending CGI.pm
  userid:      VAYDE (Nik Ogura)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    www.nikogura.com/svn/CGI/trunk

  similar:
    CGI.pm

  rationale:

    CGI::Lazy was designed to simply abstract some of the more common
    cgi scripting tasks because the author finally got sick of writing
    the same code by hand for every new site or client that comes along.

    It is my attempt to extend the wonderful CGI.pm with things that
    just about every modern website needs or wants, and to do it in a
    fairly portable manner.

    There are plenty of webdev frameworks out there, many are far more
    full- featured. Often these solutions are so monstrous that they are
    overkill for small apps, or so optimized that they require full
    admin rights on the server they run on.

    CGI::Lazy was intended to be lightweight enough to run on any given
    server that could run perl cgis. Of course, the more power you have,
    the fancier you will be able to get, so Lazy was written to be
    extensible and to (hopefully) play nice with whatever magic you have
    up your sleeve.

    In short, it was made to easily do things for which the author has
    had need, while not getting in the way of things that the author
    hasn't thought of yet.
