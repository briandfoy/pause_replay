The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Custom::Log
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Basic and custom logging
  userid:      JCONERLY (James Conerly)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    Where ever

  similar:
    File::Log Log::Logger

  rationale:

    (Straight from my POD)

    Yet another darn logger? Why d00d?

    Well...

    I wanted to write a logging module that developers could use in a
    way that felt natural to them and it would just work.

    I wanted to write a logging module that was adaptable enough that
    it could be used in dynamic, ever changing environments.

    I wanted to write a logging module that was flexible enough to
    satisfy most logging needs without too much overhead.

    Custom::Log still has a ways to go, but the direction seems
    promising. Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

Custom::
::Log             adpOp Basic and custom logging                     JCONERLY
