Hi,

I'd like to request a CPAN id.

Name:          David Chan
Email Address: david@sheetmusic.org.uk
Homepage:      http://www.sheetmusic.org.uk/
Preferred id:  DIVEC

What I plan to contribute:

To start with, a module to validate ISINs (which are like ISBNs for stocks
and shares), hopefully called Business::ISIN.  Various other ideas too!

DSLI for Business::ISIN: RdpO
Description            : Validate International Securities ID Numbers 


Where this was discussed:

I posted "PROPOSAL: Business::ISIN" to comp.lang.perl.modules a few days
ago - recieved 1 response proposing some changes and saying it was a good
idea.


Many thanks!

David Chan
