Subject: pause account for an organization

My company is a heavy user of Perl and we'd like to start
open-sourcing some of the components we have build in-house, as a way
to help give back to this great community.  I was hoping to setup an
"organization" account, so that we didn't unnecessarily burden an
individual as the maintainer of everything we release.  Doing a little
searching, it looks like the BBC has such an account:

http://search.cpan.org/~bbc/

Is there any extra work I need to do to setup an organizational
account vs an individual account?  Also, I'd like to be able to setup
individual accounts but allow them to deploy cpan modules as part of
the "company" account.  Is that recommended?  I poked around in the
documentation and it sounds like I can ask for someone to be a
'co-maintainer'.  Can I do that through the PAUSE interface, or does
it require a manual request?

Thanks guys!
