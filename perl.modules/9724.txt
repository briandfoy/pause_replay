Subject: Registering module name space for Grade book Plus parser.

I few weeks ago, I wrote a parser for a Gradebook Plus class 
report.  Gradebook Plus is a program that many k-12 schools use to keep 
track of their grades.  Although the module will probably be of limited use 
(how many k-12 school districts do you know of employ web programmers?), 
when it is used, it works extremely well.

Requested namespace is either Gradebook, GradebookPlus, or Gradebook::Plus.
Module code is at:
