We'd have some of the same problems regardless of whether they were 
alpha or numeric. It's not so much about the name of the AUTHOR id, but 
the actual name of the author. We'd have the same problems if author id 
5123 was "MailChannels Corporation".

The underlying problem is that people are relatively stable, unless they 
die, in which case there are no issues with control and modules are 
recycled as needed to other authors.

With companies, things get much more complicated... Say MailChannels 
gets bought by Sophos, who then gets bought by Google, who goes bankrupt 
and sees their assets end up with liquidators, who sell off the 
copyright of the modules to Microsoft, who then sells those rights on to 
Sun. What happens to the AUTHOR names, and who controls the namespaces?

While the code may be open source, there would seem to be some level of 
property/ownership issues relating to both the author accounts, and the 
control of the APIs and namespaces themselves.

It would seem to me that we could make some level of exception to the 
"only people" rule for stable long-term non-human entities, such as the 
Apache mod_perl mailing list, and give them co-auth, as long as a person 
held the primary ownership of the namespace.

In fact, more generally you could probably deal with exceptions for all 
non-human entities, as long as we prohibited them from having primary 
control. That would seem to work reasonably well...
