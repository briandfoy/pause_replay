You posted the snippet of the M in question, which says nearly 
unequivocally that "humans" expect to see one date format.  You 
shouldn't expect busy people to go spelunking through your 
documentation, just to find out if you oversimplified your abstract 
(people in datetime are reaching the same conclusion as Philip and I).

I too have a hard time understanding why one would use a niche 
conversion module when such a wide range of date/time tools already 
exists (as you already know, having based your work on the redoubtable 
Date::Calc).  Just because tmtowtdi doesn't mean I'd hope to see a 
battery of RDBMS-specific *date* modules cropping up.  And though I've 
rarely seen a problem installing Date::Calc, XS is something of a 
heavyweight prerequisite for such an avowedly minimal task.

The logical extension of that argument is to include everything.
