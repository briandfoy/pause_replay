Hi Adam!

Thanks for your reply and sorry for my late response. I'm not sure how non-subscribers are meant to communicate on here (is there some form of interface beyond the archives through which to see if there are replies? :).

*nod* I thought so. :)

SynchroEdit is a server/client system written to be a seamless bridge between apps and users, allowing them to edit whatever simultaneously. That could be a wiki page or a word doc or whatever.

The perl modules (I actually split them into 3 separate modules, to remove their dependency upon each other, which seemed a little dumb) provide three classes with methods for manipulating the response service of the SynchroEdit server.

The response service is specified here: http://wiki.synchroedit.com/index.php/SessionProtocol

The modules e.g. allow a user to connect(), to query() and to fetch_result()/fetch_status()/fetch_map() from the response service. There is a PHP class out there which I based these modules on.

In other words, the modules are helpers for communicating with a SynchroEdit response service.

I think that about sums it up. :)

-Kalle.
