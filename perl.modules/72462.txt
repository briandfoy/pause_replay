Hi everyone,

I was going to submit a new module to PAUSE, but first I'd love to get any and all feedback from those more experienced than myself. 

The module currently resides at the URL below - please have a look at the readme, the POD documentation inside the module, and, of course, the code itself and let me know if you have any suggestions before I upload. If you think the module should be renamed, please provide your suggestions.

Thanks in advance!
