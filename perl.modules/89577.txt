The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Conversion
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: convert between various units of measurement
  userid:      ELOHMROW (Bradley Andersen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/pull/356

  similar:
    Convert::Temperature

  rationale:

    I wrote a conversions goodie (zero-click answer) for duckduckgo
    (DDG). After struggling to find existing Perl modules to #include, I
    came up with a neat way to convert between any two units. I want to
    re-factor my DDG code for use on CPAN.

    Right now, my code can do conversions for these types: mass,
    length, time, pressure, energy, power, angles, force, and
    temperature. It is trivial (requires adding an array) to add new
    unit types. In fact, today I plan to add support for digital storage
    (bits, bytes, etc.) and cooking (cups, tsp, etc.)

    As for the one module I found, Convert::Temperature - it relies on
    a large set of pre-defined functions to convert between various
    temperatures. My method is simpler, requiring simply converting to a
    base unit, then converting from that base unit to any other unit via
    a lookup.

    I'll try to get this uploaded by EOD tomorrow.
