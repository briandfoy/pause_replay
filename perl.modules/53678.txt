This means that the module Nagios::Plugin::Config now is known to have
the $VERSION = "undef":

Using the cpan shell I see:

cpan[4]> m Nagios::Plugin
Module id = Nagios::Plugin
    CPAN_USERID  GAVINC (Gavin Carr <gavin@openfusion.com.au>)
    CPAN_VERSION 0.15
    CPAN_FILE    G/GA/GAVINC/Nagios-Plugin-0.15.tar.gz
    UPLOAD_DATE  2006-12-18
    INST_FILE    (not installed)


cpan[5]> m Nagios::Plugin::Config
Module id = Nagios::Plugin::Config
    CPAN_USERID  GAVINC (Gavin Carr <gavin@openfusion.com.au>)
    CPAN_VERSION undef
    CPAN_FILE    G/GA/GAVINC/Nagios-Plugin-0.16.tar.gz
    UPLOAD_DATE  2007-03-22
    INST_FILE    (not installed)

Which means that whoever is looking at only this single file cannot
determine its version.

Just to state the obvious: Humans tend to expect that in a package
called Nagios-Plugin-X.YZ.tar.gz they will find a module
Nagios::Plugin with the version number X.YZ. This is not necessarily
the case though. In your current package they find Nagios::Plugin
version "undef" or, depending how they try to find out the version
number, some numerical version. If they only look at the file
Nagios/Plugin.pm, they find out nothing, if they let perl look with
'use Nagios::Plugin;' and everything is setup correctly, they find
0.16. If something went wrong and they have an older N:P:Functions
installed, they find that older version.

PAUSE has no concept of a main module. It has found at least one file
that was either new or had an not decreasing version number and
indexed it.

Give all files a version number higher than the one that is most
recent according to the indexer. Make it so that the version is
contained in the first $VERSION assignement. You are not required to
ever update a version number but your users will certainly expect that
you make Nagios/Plugin.pm contain the same version as the one in the
tarball. Feel free to keep all other files at arbitrary version
numbers (but higher than what they already have reached at some point
in time.

You might also want to read the file
ftp://ftp.perl.org/pub/CPAN/modules/04pause.html available from any
cpan mirror or click on "About PAUSE" when logged into PAUSE.
