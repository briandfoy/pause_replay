It's not much what you can see on PAUSE immediately.

But at least for us admins there's now a form that lets us edit the
modules database directly.

That's all alpha and please do not use it for editing just now, but
this step allowed me to produce a *last* module list with my old
scripts. New scripts are waiting to write other module lists in the
next days.

Thanks to Kurt for the clean advice he had for me how I should switch
the modes.

I expect more complaints in the next days, because people will see
that a new module list is out and their changes are not in. That's
unfortunate but I feel positive about the next days nonetheless.

Be reliefed now:-)
