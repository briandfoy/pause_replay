Welcome to Sunoasis 2004! We've been here since November of 1996 detailing the ways the Net can help writers. There are several things we try to focus on.

1) To provide the best resources for writers   whether they are professional, literary, or just starting out.

2) To provide writers and readers the best writing
on the web through links and published  material.

3) To provide access to Sunoasis Jobs where writers, editors, and copywriters can find job leads on a daily basis.

Sunoasis 2004 focuses on electronic publishing and will continue to do so in the near-term. Of late, we've been looking at the phenomenon of blogging. So glad you're with us! 

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me at 
sunoasisjobs@earthlink.net.

You should receive last month's issue shortly if you haven't already. Look it over and drop a suggestion or comment if you wish. We try to keep it under 2,000 words per issue.

The archives are freely available from Topica at:

See you next issue!

David Eide, editor
Sunoasis 2004
