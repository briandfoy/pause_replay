Good Day,

My name is Lee Engel and I've recently applied for a login to the PAUSE
server. While I await the maintainer's reply I'd like to ask your advice
on namespace.

I've created a module, Module Net::SMS::2Way, which implements the HTTP
API of BulkSMS. BulkSMS is an SMS provider in South Africa
(http://bulksms.2way.co.za)

I would like to make this module available via CPAN. It's been tested and
has been stable in a production environment for some time now.

When I get my PAUSE password, may I upload this module which uses the
Net::SMS::2Way namespace ? I've checked and it does not seem to clash with
anything else.

Your help will be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Lee Engel
