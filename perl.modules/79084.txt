The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::PAM::Module
  DSLIP:       bdcOp
  description: Base Class for writing PAM modules in Perl
  userid:      BHILDRED (Ben Hildred)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    pam-list@redhat.com perl-xs@perl.org

  similar:
    PAM Authen::PAM

  rationale:

    The Pam APIs were written in c. This translates the module api into
    perl.

    The rationale for the module:

    Excerpts from some emails I sent:

    So the problem began with browsing my Linux distro's repository
    looking for a pam module to create home directories on demand. I
    found one that works almost like I want. Almost, not quite, so onto
    the source code. It is written in python. I have a severe
    Pathological and Eclectic aversion to python. It reminds me of the
    Rubbish Lists i turned in in my hi-school COBOL programing class.
    I'd rather try to transcend dental medication.

    so... I've been looking for a project to brush up my c skills,
    maybe embed a interpreter for practice... so announcing version
    0.0001. Write your own device driver days here. It is about 75% to
    theoretically functional level.

    About The namespace:

    was my reason for doing so. I have not run this by the folks pause
    yet, but my thoughts on the namespace would be as follows: my main
    module would be PAM::Module or Authen::PAM::Module, Internal (not
    intended for public use sub modules would be ...::Module::_foo,
    framework modules such as test cases and pragmas which would change
    the behavior of the main module would be ...::Module::foo and actual
    authentication modules would be ...::Module::Foo. I would welcome
    any comments or criticism of this thought.

The resulting entry would be:
