Subject: PAUSE permissions clash between "Qt::Base" and "Q::base"

Hi Ashley & Germain,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

Ashley (AWIN) has ownership of Qt::Base, which is on CPAN in =
PerlQt-1.04.tar.gz, and Germain (GGARAND) has ownership of Qt::base, =
which is on CPAN in PerlQt-3.008.tar.gz. To resolve this conflict, I =
propose dropping AWIN=E2=80=99s permissions on the older Qt::Base, and =
also deleting all of the older releases of PerlQt from Ashley=E2=80=99s =
CPAN author directory (there are a number of older releases of PerlQt =
appearing in the CPAN index, because various module names were changed =
across a number of releases. As a result someone could (theoretically) =
accidentally install the wrong version of PerlQt).

Are you happy for me to make these changes? I don=E2=80=99t think =
they=E2=80=99ll cause any problems, but wanted to check you=E2=80=99re =
happy for me to do this?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m tidying up the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
