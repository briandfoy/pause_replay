Subject: Module submission DBIx::DBIWrapper

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::DBIWrapper
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: DBI Wrapper - Makes setting up DBI easier.
  userid:      JAMESP (James A. Pattie)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://dbiwrapper.sf.net/

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module started out as DBIWrapper and was opensourced about 3
    years ago. At the time I created this module there was no equivalent
    module on CPAN, though there might be at this time.

    We would like to get it included into CPAN and thus want to change
    the name to DBIx::DBIWrapper since DBIx::Wrapper is already taken.

    This module provides a standard interface to setting up DBD::MySQL,
    DBD::Pg, DBD::ODBC (though I don't use the ODBC code personally) and
    provides read/write methods that do the work of preparing and
    executing your SQL statements.

    There is an XML output mode available.

    To see a list of the projects that we are creating that use the
    DBIWrapper module, goto http://dbiwrapper.sf.net/

    I have done a CPAN search for DBIx::DBIWrapper and did not find
    anything.

    Thank you for your consideration.
