There is no such thing as "natural". Ask five programmers what is
natural and you'll get seven answers.

I think that all of these are covered by Log::Log4perl. I'm not saying
that you can't reinvent the wheel, but that you can save yourself a lot
of pain and misery by using something that already exists. I know. I
invented a logging module too, but finally gave it up because it
started to look more and more like Log::Log4perl. :)

I'd be curious to hear how Log::Log4perl doesn't meet your needs or
satisfy any of these requirements.
