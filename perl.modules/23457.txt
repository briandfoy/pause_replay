The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::FEC
  DSLIP:       adcOb
  description: Forward Error Correction (Vandermonde Matr.)
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    modules-list

  similar:
    Convert::FEC

  rationale:

    Please disregard my earlier request for Convert::FEC.

    I decided to rename it to Algorithm::FEC, for the following
    reasons:

    Convert and Algorithm being equal in "correctness", Algorithm is
    more specific (less crowded) and FEC sounds mathematically complex
    to most people.

    I do feel that Algorithm::FEC is lacking some configurabilty to be
    named Algorithm, but so far it's the only FEC module.

    Thanks in advance.

    (Maybe Digest::Hashcash should have been in Algorithm::Hashcash,
    too, but I think that's going too far, Digets::Hashcash is quite
    fine :)

    PS: the form says Algorithm is also Chapter 6 (Data Types ..). I
    think Algorithm as a whole does not belong into chapter 6 :)

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
