     why:

    I have a module providing a simple interface to bit operations,
    making it nearly as easy as an array. There are other modules here
    that do similar things, but they also do a lot more- mine is the
    bare essentials, so if thats all someone wants, they don't need to
    throw in the kitchen sink too.
