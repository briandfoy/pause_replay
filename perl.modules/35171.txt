Oops. I first sent this to modules@perl.org, then realized that it
wasn't really what I was thinking of, and re-sent to
module-authors@perl.org. Oh well, I seem to be getting good responses
from both.

Fair enough. IM doesn't bother me personally all that much, because it
stands for a long yet meaningful term "instant messaging" that is
neither cute nor associated with any corporation. 'Chat' is not quite as
good since I kind of think of that as the "other" use of IM from what
this library does.

That said, I'm fine with Net::Chat. Though I still wonder if Net:: is
the right place, or if this should be in a different area like
Application::Chat (or Application::IM).
