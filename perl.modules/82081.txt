The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XDI
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Client for XDI graph database
  userid:      HORST (Mark Horstmeier)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    XDI is a protocol and format for "semantic data exchange". It is in
    the draft process with OASIS
    https://wiki.oasis-open.org/xdi/FrontPage

    XDI shares some elements of RDF; ie: triples and URI (It used to be
    called XDI RDF Model) but it requires that every element in the
    graph be addressable. There's much more to XDI which is described
    here:
    https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/45708/xdi-graph-model-2012-04-12.pdf

    Because of the concious act of distinguishing XDI from RDF by the
    OASIS TC, I can't recommend placing it in the RDF namespace.

    I considered the Graph namespace, but XDI has it's own syntax for
    expressing nodes and vertices, traversing the graph and CRUD.

    I'm open to suggestions for a candidate namespace

The resulting entry would be:

XDI               adpOg Client for XDI graph database                HORST
