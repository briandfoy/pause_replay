     why:

    IO::DB A module that provides a simple but amazingly useful
    frontend for the DBD set of libraries. Functionaltiy includes
    automatic connection to database, but only when needed, returning
    entire rowsets without having to loop through the sth resultes.

    My Web Application Framework Yeah, there are a few out there
    already. This one provides automatic session management, security
    via groups, basic skinning, arbitrary authentication (Currently DB
    or Windows LDAP are already supported). With this framework, you
    find yourself writing web pages and not worrying about the
    underlying functionality.

    Arbitrary Record Readers/Writers A set of libraries useful for
    reading/writing to files and database tables. Parses CSV, Delimited,
    and fixed field. Simply provide a description of what you're reading
    or writing, and the libraries take care of the rest.

    Rocco of POE fame suggested that I contribute this stuff to CPAN
    quite a while ago. Finally following up.
