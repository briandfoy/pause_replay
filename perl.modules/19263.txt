The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Object
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Provide a base class for game objects
  userid:      PSTEWART (Peter J. Stewart)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have seen in other languages similar sets of common code or
    libraries that provide some low-level functionality and structure
    for the design of games, but have not seen any of the same kind of
    thing in Perl, at least not in the CPAN namespace. By providing this
    module, I hope to encourage more game development using the Perl
    language. I have other ideas for modules to be based atop this one.
    Games::Object is designed to be highly OO-oriented, encouraging the
    creation of subclasses that augment Games::Object functionality.

  enteredby:   PSTEWART (Peter J. Stewart)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar  6 00:20:19 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Object          adpOp Provide a base class for game objects        PSTEWART
