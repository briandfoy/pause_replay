Hi,

When carefully adding a new user using [Insert with ... care], the
list of potential conflicts show users and a.o. email adresses.
Is this the public or secret email address?

I sometimes notice users that have filled in their cpan email address
(e.g., userid@cpan.org). If this is the secret address, I would think
that this must always be a real (outside) email address since I assume
that email to userid@cpan.org will be forwarded to this address.

If so, the form that allows the user to change his email address
should very clearly indicate so, and disallow entry of a @cpan.org
address.
