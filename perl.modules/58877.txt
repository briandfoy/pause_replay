Instead of this infighting why not just upload a development version
of the module with something like this in the pod:

"This is an unnofficial version of module X::Y::Z till the original module
author reappears or till I get official maintainership of the the module."

Send another nice(!) letter to the author making it clear that you will be
happy if he continued the maintenance of the module or if he passed it
to you. Then wait for another few weeks before asking the CPAN
maintainers again.
In the meantime both you and the users can already use your not official and
development versions of the module.
