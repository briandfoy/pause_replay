Hi Tom,

What is it that you do not like about MP3::ID3v1Tag? I did not get an
e-mail from you, so I did not know you had particular requirements.

Let me know to what you need and maybe we can collaborate. The biggest
reason Chris has a different module is cause his is non-OOP and wanted
to keep it that way.

Also realize that this tagging is not limited to MP3 files. You might
also want to talk with Matt DiMeo about ID3v2 Tags.

What is it you would "expect" that either one of the modules doesn't 
offer?

Having even more modules to do this is kinda silly don't you think?

Cheers,
