The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TEILite
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: TEILite Document Library
  userid:      DHAGEMAN (David Hageman)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  rationale:

    This library package is not the most easiest to classify. The Text
    Encoding Initiative is a group that has defined a schema originally
    SGML based for the generic mark-up of documents. It is slowly
    starting to be adopted by libraries and electronic document centers
    (even more so now that an XML version of the specification has been
    produced). The TEI specification is quite large as it is designed to
    be able to markup from everything to songs to poetry to technical
    papers to novels. Since the full TEI specification is quite large a
    'Lite' version was made that is a subset that allows a person to
    markup over 90% of the type of documents one would encounter. The
    goal of this library is to implement the TEILite specification that
    is based on XML as this seems to be the most common path that
    libraries and such are using. It might be better to make a generic
    TEI root node and put this under TEI::TEILite or possibly
    XML::Schema::TEILite. I think I would like to stay away from the
    XML::Schema::TEILite as the XML::Schema might provide the wrong
    impression (as in modules for building XML schema models).

The resulting entry would be:
