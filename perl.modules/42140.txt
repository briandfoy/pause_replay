The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Number::Theory
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Number-theoretic
  userid:      BARUCH (Baruch Ben-David)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, comp.lang.perl.announce

  similar:
    None known to me.

  rationale:

    My intent is to create a grouping of objects that will facilitate
    investigations into number theory. Some of the possible methods will
    include creation of the fibonacci sequence (which I realize already
    exists elsewhere), various other number-theoretic functions,
    continued fractions, tests of primality, and so forth. Most likely
    I'll base the objects on Math::BigRat, as many of the functions in
    number theory create enormous integers quite quickly.

  enteredby:   BARUCH (Baruch Ben-David)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug  1 01:29:53 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Number::
::Theory          idpOp Number-theoretic                             BARUCH
