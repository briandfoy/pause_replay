I suppose those simple fishermen will never forget this wonderful
occurrence, and they'll probably make reg'lar heroes of the two men who have
crossed the Pacific through the air
He followed the coast line, keeping but a short distance above the earth,
and after an hour's swift flight reached the city of San Francisco
<br>
<br>His shoulders were sore and stiff from the heavy strain upon them of
the previous day, and he wished more than once that he had some of his
mother's household liniment to rub them withYet so great was his delight at
reaching once more his native land that all discomforts were speedily
forgotten
Much as he would have enjoyed a day in the great metropolis of the Pacific
slope, Rob dared not delay longer than to take a general view of the place,
to note its handsome edifices and to wonder at the throng of Chinese
inhabiting one section of the town
