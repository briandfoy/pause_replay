Hello,

I'm planning to contribute a couple of modules for *fast* bulk database
import and export operations. The interface can be pretty much universal
to any DBMS, and I'm planning to contribute MySQL and Oracle
implementations.

I can pollute the module namespace by adding yet another module category
(e.g. BulkDB::MySQL and BulkDB::Oracle), but I think this is a great
opportunity to add a much-need bulk operation interface to the DBI
standard. I'd like to find the appropriate group to review and refine a
proposal such as this:

DBI::Bulk - bulk operations for databases (dump tables, load files, etc.)
DBD::Bulk::MySQL - bulk database driver for MySQL
DBD::Bulk::Oracle - bulk database driver for Oracle

Can you point me in the right direction?

Thanks!
Yuval
