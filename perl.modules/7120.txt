The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Oak
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Oak Perl Compoment Tree
  userid:      DRUOSO (Daniel Ruoso)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/perl-oak

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is the base for a entire object tree, the idea is to implement
    a structure similar to Borland Delphi's VCL, and we actually read
    their documentation to get more ideas. The name Oak was choosen
    because it's a short name, and it's a kind of tree. It's in the root
    because it's an entire new project, and it's not directly related
    with any other project in CPAN. It will probably use many, but all
    the modules in this tree will be a descendant of Oak::Object (see
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/perl-oak for details) and
    implement a common API. The final target of this project is to
    develop top-level components to GUI and Web Applications, turning
    Rapid Application Development possible in Perl.
