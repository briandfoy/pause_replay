Modules:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Data::
::FixedFormat  adpO  converts between buffers and hashes          pfaut
VMS::
::FlatFile     adpO  merges Data::FixedFormat w/VMS::IndexedFile  pfaut

These were brought up for discussion on the VMSperl mailing list on
July 28, 2000.  I have used these to port a web site from NT/IIS/Cold
Fusion/Oracle to VMS/OSU/Perl/RMS.  Members of the vmsperl mailing
list have expressed interest.

I'd be more than willing to rename these modules.  These are my best
guess as to where they might fit in.

Data::FixedFormat allows a program to declare a record layout using
field names and pack/unpack descriptors.  Arrays are supported within
the record layout.  Variant record layouts are also supported.
Methods exist for converting a record with fixed length fields to a
hash and back.

VMS::FlatFile combines Data::FixedFormat and VMS::IndexedFile.  This
module provides get and put methods.  Get reads a record from the
file and returns a hash.  Put converts a hash to a record and writes
it to the file.

The modules and documentation are available at
http://www.eclipse.net/~pfau/perl/.
