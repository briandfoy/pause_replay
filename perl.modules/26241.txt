The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Systems
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Solves Systems of Equations
  userid:      WILL (William Gunther)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Nowhere

  similar:
    Math::Matrix

  rationale:

    It's important to solve systems of equations, and this module
    solves systems of equations. There really isn't much else to say.
    It's object oriented. It can be used for many important things that
    require... systems of equations solving I suppose. They don't teach
    us this stuff in Algebra for them not to be Perl Modules, right?

  enteredby:   WILL (William Gunther)
  enteredon:   Tue Jan 27 04:21:56 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::Systems         bdpOp Solves Systems of Equations                  WILL
