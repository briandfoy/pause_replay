			Who offers the most compact, high-density, industrial control relay on the market? ASI!!! You can 
			now get a relay package from ASI that has 8 industrial control relays in just one inch of panel 
			space. This very unique relay package, the CR and CRE, is available in a 4 and 8 position unit, with 
			pluggable or soldered in relays, with indication, pluggable wiring connections, fused contacts, 
			a wiring diagram on the package, and a ribbon cable connection for use with PLCs and controllers. 
			And the 8 amp relays are industry standard, so you can get replacements anywhere! The complete 
			information on this space saving package can be found at

			ASI offers a complete line of relay packages that have been designed specifically to be used with 
			controllers, such as those offered by Siemens, GE Fanuc, Telemecanique, and others. Relay packages are 
			available from 8 to 40 positions, in SPDT or DPDT, as input or output modules, and with features such 
			as LED's, fuses, pluggable connectors and more. If you do not see what you need at 
			<a href="http://www.asi-interconnect.com/products_and_solutions/relay_modules/multi_channel/">
			www.asi-ez.com</a> then contact ASI engineering and we can design a specific input or output module to 
			meet your requirements. Our engineers have years of control design experience and can turn around design, 
			prototypes, and production units in volume from 10 to 500 in very little time.
