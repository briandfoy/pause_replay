Well.. the Hook module provides a way for users to intercept routines & add
arbitrary code to calls. This module does intercept calls, but it provides
no way for users of the module to intercept the calls. I think using Hook
would definitely be naming it for "how it does it" rather than "what it
does".

I saw there being great similarity between this module and the Carp::Assert
module. Carp::Assert, exports 'assert', this module exports 'typecheck'.
Similar to 'assert', the type-checking can be turned off for "production
code". And clearly in spirit, both 'assert' and 'typecheck' are tools for
programming in the same style .. with explicit code to verify the state of
the program environment at the time of execution.

		In general, a module's name should reflect more what it
does,
		rather than how it does it.

		To me, this module sounds like a an sub argument
typechecker.
		Properly, it throws an exception under certain conditions.

		There is something on CPAN which this reminds me very much
of:
		Hook::PrePostCall.  Maybe this should be Hook::TypeCheck,
then.
