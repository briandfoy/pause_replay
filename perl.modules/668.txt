Hello,

I am planning to release a new set of modules in the GD:: name space.
Since Lincoln Stein is the sole inhabitant of that space at this
moment, I have asked his opinion on this first, and he sees no
objections or potential name clashes in the future.

The first set of modules is a set of Text utilities to use with the GD
drawing package, namely:

GD::Text
	base class for font-type independent string handling
GD::Text::Align
	draw aligned strings, inherits from GD::Text
GD::Text::Wrap
	wrap long strings in a box, uses GD::Text

I may add one or two others in the future in the GD::Text name space.

Furthermore, because of the removal of GIF support from the GD
package, I want to create GD::Graph

GD::Graph
GD::Graph::bars
GD::Graph::lines
GD::Graph::linespoints
GD::Graph::lines
GD::Graph::pie

This is basically what GIFgraph is now, but will be rewritten to
support many of the newer GD features, and to be more
output-independent. They require GD::Text::Align

GIFgraph will become a wrapper around these classes, and will very
likely try to convert the png output of newer versions of GD to GIF
with the help of Image::Magick or other tools.

Are there any problems with any of these plans, or should I go ahead?
I know about the Chart:: name space, but there are a few potentially
conflicting, or almost conflicting names there already, and since this
is closely tied to GD, I'd rather like to keep it there.

Martien
