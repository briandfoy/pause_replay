     why:

    I'm writing yet another CMS, and while that is entirely useless for
    others on CPAN it does use some bits and bobs that can be quite
    useful on their own.

    For example, my first contribution is likely to be Minecraft::RCON,
    a module that takes care of talking to a Minecraft remote console.

    I have a working prototype, and by the time you're done processing
    me it should be all cleaned, documented and ready to install.
