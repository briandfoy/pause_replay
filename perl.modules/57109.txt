The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Clui
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: A Command-Line-orientated User-Interface
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Term::Clui

  rationale:

    Term::Clui is not in the modlist; but it's mature, tough and
    functional. It offers functions ask, ask_password, choose, confirm,
    edit, inform and view. As each question/response is completed it is
    summarised onto one line, and remains on screen, so that the history
    of the session gradually accumulates on the screen and is available
    for review, or for cut/paste. It handles window-resizing,
    screen-overflow, and multi-line questions. &choose uses arrow keys
    and return, or q to quit, or space for multiple-choice. Term::Clui
    includes Term::Clui::FileSelect which has options compatible with,
    but more than, Tk::FileDialog and Tk::SimpleFileSelect. Term::Clui
    is my favourite module.

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::Clui            Mdpfp A Command-Line-orientated User-Interface     PJB
