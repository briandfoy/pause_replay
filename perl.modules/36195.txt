     why:

    I have written a perl module+script that builds a text file from a
    template and a configuration. It's kind of like XSLT, but the
    configuration syntax is a little less verbose and the embperl-style
    templates are a bit easier to write. It does not use embperl,
    because embperl depends on apache.

    Main purpose of this script is to generate configuration of several
    interdependent programs from one source. Eg. configuration of a
    firewall, DNS and dhcp server. But may be used for anything else
    equaly well.

    It shall be called Config::Maker (I am willing to change is if
    there are objections). I'll put up a manual page and the tarball on
    my website at latest tomorrow (Tue 9 Nov 2004).
