Welcome Andy Walker,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

    WALKER

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      Andy Walker
  email:     CENSORED
  homepage:  http://whereisandy.com
  enteredby: Matt S Trout

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
if you want to protect yourself from SPAM. If you want to do this,
please visit
  https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred
or
  http://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred

If you need any further information, please visit
  $CPAN/modules/04pause.html.
If this doesn't answer your questions, contact modules@perl.org.

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Matt S Trout:
Welcome to PAUSE! Please before you upload think carefully about the namespace for your new module - the name is often how people will discover and remember it and CPAN already has a common system of namespaces that people will use.

I guess things like Net::, Sys:: etc. might be most suitable for your code, but I don't know the details so make your own decision - if you're not sure, mail modules@perl.org and we'd be happy to help (especially me - I'm more known for web and db stuff these days but my background's in systems automation :).
