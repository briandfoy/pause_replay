The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::SMS
  DSLIP:       Smphg
  description: A Perl framework for sending SMS messages
  userid:      EIM (Ivo Marino)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, chatrooms, CVS repository, Website

  similar:
    NET::SMS GSM::SMS

  rationale:

    WWW::SMS has being developed since the last years by a growing
    community and it's being used in as core part in many Perl projects.
    Now I'm taking over the WWW::SMS as new mantainer and one of my main
    aims is to allow users to easily locate and use WWW::SMS,
    registering a namespace brings the project a bit close to this
    objective. Thanks.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::SMS             Smphg A Perl framework for sending SMS messages    EIM
