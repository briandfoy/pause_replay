Hi Rutger,

> I'll do my best to fix this but I can't get to this immediately. I =
made an issue which I'll resolve once I have a bit more time: =
https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo-beagle/issues/1 =
<https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo-beagle/issues/1>
This is just a gentle reminder. I=E2=80=99ll send you one roughly every =
month, as I=E2=80=99m working through similar issues in other =
distributions.

Cheers,
Neil
