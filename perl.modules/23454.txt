I would be uncomfortable suggesting the new top-level namespace of BEEP,=20
seeing as there is only one module for it.  A closer analog to this module=
=20
might be HTTP::Lite, rather than SOAP::Lite.

Net::BEEP::Lite would be fine, however. =20

Although BEEP has been defined for 2 years, this is the first non-vaporware=
=20
perl implementation of it that I'm aware of.  I would hope that at some=20
point a more comprehensive implementation of BEEP (one that supported the=20
complex peer-to-peer and channel multiplexing) to be implemented at some=20
point.  It would seem to make more sense to call that Net::BEEP rather=20
than BEEP for BEEP::Full or something like that.
