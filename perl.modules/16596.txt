              <p>Web Lightning is a revolutionary program that speeds up your
              Internet connection in two ways. First, it optimizes your registry
              settings to make your computer's software work at it's fastest
              potential. (Yes it's Geeky technical talk but there really are no
              laymen's terms for that.) Second, Web Lightning turns your
              computer into it's own DNS (Domain Name Server).

                <li>Increase Your Internet Connection Speed Up to 220%!!

              <ul>
                <li>NETSONIC: This is the program that will DRAMATICALLY
                  increase the speed that you surf the internet, especially if
                  you currently have a 56k or less modem. RAM BOOSTER: This one
                  frees up your RAM constantly, without you having to attend to
                  it, so your PC runs faster. The reason why your PC runs slower
                  and slower is because Windows 95/98 puts needless info into
                  your RAM memory over time. This cleans your RAM of all that
                  stuff that it practically never needed. No more unnecessary
                  boot-ups.
                <li>WATERFALL: Decrease your CPU temperature up to 20C!
                  Waterfall is a wonderful little program that uses advanced
                  instructions found in Intel, Cyrix, and AMD to make them run
                  much cooler, without any loss in performance or stability!
                  Instead of replacing your fan/heatsink combo, give Waterfall a
                  try!
                <li>ISPEED: This modifies your settings to improve throughput
                  online!
                <li>CACHE MAN: Cache Man is a utility which tweaks the disk
                  cache settings and prevents frequent swapping of the data to
                  disk resulting in an improved performance and stability.
                <li>GOZILLA!: This is a FANTASTIC download manager, that will
                  speed up your surfing even more!!! Gozilla lets you schedule
                  downloads and surf at the same time. Gozilla is a must have
                  for anyone who takes advantage of the great downloads on the
                  web. If you have ever experienced bad downloads due to
                  internet traffic and a slow internet connection, you know the
                  frustration of repeated downloads due to loss of connection.
                  This utility will monitor your connection and ensure a quality
                  download .
                <li>GATOR: Free online tool that helps fill out forms and
                  remember passwords. Gator stores all your information in an
                  encrypted file for extra security.</li>
