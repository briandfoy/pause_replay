The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::AMaMP
  DSLIP:       amcOp
  description: Perl binding for the AMaMP audio engine.
  userid:      JONATHAN (Jonathan Worthington)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    amamp-development@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    AMaMP is a Free software/open source cross platform audio engine
    (available from http://amamp.sourceforge.net/). It provides features
    including mixing of source files into a single output file,
    soundcard output on Win32 and Linux, an IPC mechanism and more -
    development continues.

    This module provides an OO Perl language binding for the AMaMP
    audio engine, providing methods to start the engine with a given
    instruction file and exchange messages with it.

    The name Audio::AMaMP was chosen on the basis that:- - It's an
    audio engine, it won't branch into any other area (e.g. video, etc)
    so Audio seems like the most sensible root level namespace. - It's
    unlikely that there will be another open source audio project called
    AMaMP, so using the initials rather than the full name of the
    project (Audio Mixing and Manipulation Project) is most likely safe.

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::
::AMaMP           amcOp Perl binding for the AMaMP audio engine.     JONATHAN
