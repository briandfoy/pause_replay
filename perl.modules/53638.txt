Hi,

The thread below is a couple months old, and as I haven't seen any response 
I'm stíll unsure of if this is normal...:-)

So, if 'you' happen to have info on my request for the plain root namespace 
'ProgressMonitor' I'd be happy. In the meantime, if anyone wish to review 
it, a 0.03 version is in my cpan dir...

TIA,

ken1
