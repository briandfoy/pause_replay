|Just FYI, CPAN isn't seeing Archvie::Zip.  It's not in the
|02packages.details.txt index file.

|Subject: Archive::Zip still not indexed properly
|
|Hi,
|
|People are still writing me saying that Archive::Zip isn't being found in the 
|indexes by CPAN.pm.
|
|Can this be fixed?
|
|Thanks,

Hi Ned, Michael,

thanks for letting me know. Since the package was uploaded back in
January, I do not have the logfile anymore and cannot say why the
indexer failed. I just reran the indexer on Archive-Tar-0.11 and it
did succeed, so it is again in the 02packages.details.txt file. Please
report to me immediately when such an error occurs again. I'll archive
the logfiles for a longer period from now on to find the error
condition.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
--
