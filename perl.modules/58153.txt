I was wondering why you wanted to build yet another Memcached module =20
given there is already Cache::Memcached::XS, but now I understand: =20
you want to do something similar to what Paul Marquess did with =20
Compress::Zlib when he splitted it between a high-level Perl frontend =20=

(Compress::Zlib) and a low-level driver (Compress::Raw::Zlib), which =20
allowed him to provide bzip2 support (Compress::Raw::Bzip2).

It's also similar to the Win32 situation: Win32API::* modules provide =20=

low-level API, while Win32::* provide high-level API.

IMHO, "Lib" doesn't carry as much information as "Raw" or even "API", =20=

given the already existing modules. So possible namespaces are: =20
Cache::Raw::Memcached or CacheAPI::Memcached.
Or, if you don't want to be related to the Cache:: namespace, =20
Memcached::Raw or Memcached::API.
