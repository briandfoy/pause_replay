The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Signature
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Convenience automated testing of SIGNATUREs
  userid:      SPOON (Iain Truskett)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    Module::Signature lets one use digital signatures with
    distributions. Test::Signature lets you include the signature as
    part of your test suite. This helps point out when one's signature
    is not accurate when you're doing this final tests before uploading.

    Its main benefits are that (a) it works fine with Module::Install,
    and thus can be painlessly included with a distribution if desired,
    and (b) it can happily "work" without Module::Signature being
    installed. It takes care of checking that the signature checking is
    possible.

The resulting entry would be:
