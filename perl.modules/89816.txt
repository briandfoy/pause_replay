     why:

    After 20 years of perl dev it seems like time to come out of the
    closet. There must be *something* here I can get into good enough
    shape for CPAN while the epoch still fits in a dword.

    Inspired by a couple of recent posts on blogs.perl.org I might try
    to get my journal/task-list text file management utilities into
    acceptable shape to start with.
