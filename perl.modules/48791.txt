Hi again,

I don't think I am able to subscribe to this list, but I keep reading I 
should send an email here and ensure you guys are fine with the 
namespace choice I make.

After reading up on the topic a bit, I'd like to use 
Net::SynchroEdit::Service and Net::SynchroEdit::Session as the two 
module names.

Does this seem appropriate?

I can of course give you a bit more detail on what the modules actually 
do if you feel that would help.

-Kalle.
