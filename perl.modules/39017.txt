The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::RIFF
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Resource Interchange File Format/RIFF files
  userid:      STURM (Paul Sturm)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    Audio::Wav

  rationale:

    I intend to write a module for manipulating "RIFF" files. This is a
    pretty simple file format whereby a file is split into "chunks", and
    each "chunk" contains a four-byte "type" field, a four-byte size
    field, and a "size"-byte data field. It gets a bit more complicated,
    but that's about it. See:

    http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000025.shtml

    ".wav" and ".avi" are two kinds of RIFF files. The Audio::Wav
    module implements .wav files specifically, but is not suitable for
    other types of RIFF files. My module would be more general, and
    could even be used to re-implement Audio::Wav or deal with .avi
    files and so on.

    I picked "File::RIFF" because it seems pretty obvious that's a good
    place for it, although I'm certainly willing to put it wherever
    y'all might think works best.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::RIFF            idpOp Resource Interchange File Format/RIFF files  STURM
