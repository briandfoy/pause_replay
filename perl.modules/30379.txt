The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::ID::Exim
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: generate Exim message IDs
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    UUID Win32::Guidgen

  rationale:

    There are already two ID generators in the module list -- UUID and
    Win32::Guidgen -- but there is no clear place for such modules in
    the namespace. (Data::UUID also exists, but not in the module list.)
    I think collecting ID generators together into a single part of the
    namespace is worthwhile. I suggest Data::ID:: for this purpose;
    String::ID:: is another possibility.

    Aside from Exim message IDs being quite a neat type of unique ID
    (they're rather concise), making the generator of general use,
    programs that interact particularly closely with Exim may need this.
    My need for Exim message ID generation is in a mail handling system
    that uses Exim a lot, and uses Exim message IDs for indexing, but
    also generates some messages that are not touched by Exim. It's also
    not unreasonable to stick messages directly into Exim's spool
    without telling Exim; for this one needs to generate a message ID.
    With so many potential uses, I believe that an Exim message ID
    generator should be included in the module list.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::ID::
::Exim            Rdpfp generate Exim message IDs                    ZEFRAM
