Subject: Module submission Test::WWW::Accessibility

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::WWW::Accessibility
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: test web pages for accessibility
  userid:      BDFOY (brian d foy)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Some places have to take into account local regulations about web
    page accessibility for users who have trouble reading a computer
    screen or other limitations. There are various things designers can
    do with HTML to mitigate this, such as using ALT fields in IMG tags.
    This module tests for those things.

    I'm not an expert in this area, but I volunteered to start the
    module while at the Higher Ed Web Dev conference. I can add more
    things on request, or even add co-maintainers. :)

The resulting entry would be:

Test::WWW::
::Accessibility   idpfp test web pages for accessibility             BDFOY
