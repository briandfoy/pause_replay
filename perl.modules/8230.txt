The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::QuizTaker
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Create and take your own quizzes and tests
  userid:      TSTANLEY (Thomas Stanley)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    For my choice of namespace, I felt that the Games namespace suited
    it, as this module could be set up as a game easily.

    My overall approach to this module was to develop a simple working
    interface to read a set of questions and answers from a separate
    file, and allow the user to answer all or just a subset of those
    questions, and to make the questions as random as possible. I also
    wanted to give some leeway to the overall format of the question
    files, by letting the user set the delimiter type of the
    question/answer file.

    To my knowledge, no one has done a module that allows for taking
    small tests, and this module would be a first in that category.
