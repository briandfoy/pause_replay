choose something a bit more specific unless this is a general 
framework for all tutorials.  as the first person to do this
in this namespace (there are other Tutorial modules out there),
you can easily set precedent. :)

for instance, you might have

   Tutorial::Perl::Lists

which leaves room for

   Tutorial::XML::*
   Tutorial::Test::*

and so on :)
