The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FrameMaker::MifTree
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A MIF Parser
  userid:      RST (Roel van der Steen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  rationale:

    There used to be a MIF parser module on CPAN once, but this seems
    now discontinued. I wrote a new object class and parser. The RFC for
    this module got several "thumbs-up" when posted on the FrameMaker
    list at www.adobeforums.com.

    The MIF object is implemented as a Tree::DAG_Node tree object, the
    parser uses IO::Tokenizer to process the MIF file. It's a pure-perl,
    clean object-oriented implementation.

    MifTree not only knows the MIF syntax, but it also has some
    understanding of the allowed structures (within their contexts) and
    attribute types. This is a unique aspect, as there is no faultless,
    formal description of the MIF syntax available to the public. The
    current module supports MIF version 7.00.

    MIF (Maker Interchange Format) is an Adobe FrameMaker file format
    in ASCII, consisting of statements that create an easily parsed,
    readable text file of all the text, graphics, formatting, and layout
    constructs that FrameMaker understands. Because MIF is an
    alternative representation of a FrameMaker document, it allows
    FrameMaker and other applications to exchange information while
    preserving graphics, document content, and format.

    I believe this module can really add to the standardisation of MIF
    file processing (outside of FrameMaker), and its implementation in
    Perl makes it possible to write e.g. a MIF to XML convertor.

The resulting entry would be:

FrameMaker::
::MifTree         adpOp A MIF Parser                                 RST
