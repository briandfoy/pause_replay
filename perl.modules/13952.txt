Please cc me on your replies.  I have to find your replies on the web
archives otherwise, since the modules mailing list is not open to public

 First, just to be clear - there is no marketing involved.  This software is
 not being sold or anything like that.  It's completely free.

 The name change to PersistentPerl is an attempt to reduce the amount of
 confusion over this software, not increase it.  So, please consider the dual
 package idea for the following reasons:
    
    - If the package is immediately renamed now, then people who only know
      of this software under the name SpeedyCGI will no longer be able to
      find it on CPAN.

    - The two packages use completely different names for packages and
      binaries.  If the switch is made immediately to PersistentPerl and
      SpeedyCGI dropped, then all existing scripts that use SpeedyCGI will
      have to be converted to the new names in order to get future updates.
      By having two packages, users can install the new one (there are no
      conflicts between the two) and migrate scripts whenever they want to.

 Sam
