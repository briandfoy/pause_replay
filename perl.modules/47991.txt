Subject: Module submission Graph::LibIgraph
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::LibIgraph
  DSLIP:       adcOa
  description: Perl interface to the igraph library.
  userid:      GRAY (gray)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Graph

  rationale:

    igraph is a c library for handling large graphs efficiently.
    Looking at existing namespaces for library bindings for examples,
    the logical choices were either Graph::LibIgraph or Igraph::Lib.
    Since I plan on making the API similar to the existing Graph module,
    the former name makes more sense.

  enteredby:   GRAY (gray)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar 23 02:21:50 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::LibIgraph       adcOa Perl interface to the igraph library.        GRAY
