All,

	I have just finished writing a module for creating simplistic bar
charts using Image::Magick. While developing, I have been using the name
Image::Magick::BarChart. I favored this over Image::Magick::Chart::Bar,
as the latter seemed rather long. I have not been able to get in touch
with Kyle Shorter, the developer of PerlMagick, to get his permission to
invade the Image::Magick namespace. Obviously, I'd like to go through
all the appropriate channels before uploading the code. Please advise
regarding the choice of this module name.

	-- Alex
