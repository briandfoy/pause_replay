Good afternoon,

I'm writing to express an interest in taking over a module on CPAN:
Device::VantagePro. The steps I have followed so far are:

1. Raised a patch request:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=91709

2. Emailed the author twice. Once on 1st January 2014, asking whether he
is still maintaining the module. Once on 19th January 2014 asking him
whether he would be interested in me taking over the module. I have
received no reply.

As per the CPAN FAQ, I have obtained a login for PAUSE, and am now
emailing this address to express an interest in taking over the module.

I have just posted the following message on perlmonks, so am happy to
wait to see if there is an answer there, but thought I'd email and
express interest anyway:

http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=1080331

Thanks,

Andy
