Subject: Module submission URI::Obfuscate

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URI::Obfuscate
  DSLIP:       idpOg
  description: Visually obfuscate a URI
  userid:      DDF (Derek Fedel)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Well, I think that URI is a good namespace choice because this
    module deals directly with the formatting of a URI. Also, I believe
    this module should be listed because I think it could be a big help
    to anyone who is trying to obfuscate the appearance of a URI.
    Personally, I use it for account activation links on a couple of my
    sites and mailto links in the body of some of my html.

  enteredby:   DDF (Derek Fedel)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 23 16:59:44 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

URI::
::Obfuscate       idpOg Visually obfuscate a URI                     DDF
