     why:

    I've been a Perl developer for ten or so years, with scripts posted
    to perlmonks.org; one of my scripts
    (http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=318105) was put into use by JPL;
    they told me I should get a CPAN account and upload it. I think I
    could contribute a lot to CPAN, and finally start giving to a
    community that has given so much to me over the years. Please give
    me an account, I promise I'll give back as much as I can :-)
