Data::BitMask perhaps.

 of these modules (Win32::Security::DACL, Win32::Security::File, Win32::Sec=

detecting situations in which the static permissions model has resulted in =
the inherited permission getting out of whack.  I'd really like to distribu=

e and as a useful utility), and if it were a Unix module, I'd simply stick =
it in a Samples directory.  The problem is that most Win32 people use PPM t=
o download modules, and that is only going to install code that goes into t=
he INST_LIBDIR.  What I'm proposing is to stick PermEnum.pl into the Win32\=
Security directory.  I realize this isn't the proper way to do this, but it=
 would make the script available to people who have installed the module vi=
a PPM without them having to go find the module on CPAN, find a copy of gun=
zip and tar, etc.  Thoughts?
