The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Dir::TreeBuild
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Perl extension for creating directory trees
  userid:      RGRAHAM (Ray Graham, Jr.)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    The purpose of the module is to provide an easy to use interface
    for building directory trees -- thus the reason for the name
    Dir::TreeBuild. To build a directory tree, the user (at a minimum)
    needs to create a new Dir::TreeBuild object and define a hash of
    hashes that define the structure of the directory tree; the
    directories are then created once the 'build' method is called on
    the object.

    Since all engineering projects that I have been involved in require
    projects to be organized in a predetermined project directory
    structure, it becomes tedious when creating a new project to
    manually build the directories at a command prompt by hand. This
    tediousness can be eliminated by creating a script using the
    Dir::TreeBuild module to build the directory tree(s).

    This module also allows the 'umask' to be modified for the object
    and also has a 'deltree' method that will delete the directory tree
    (if it is empty).

    I believe it should be listed in the module list because the task
    that this module solves is a tedious task for engineers working in a
    corporate atmosphere where set project directory structures are a
    requirement.

The resulting entry would be:
