14:10 <marcus> isn't it easier if you just move them over?
14:10 <marcus> I can't give them over to you and retain comaint anyways?
14:12 <mst> ok. I'll assign them to me, we'll leave it a month, if you get 
            bugged more I'll hand them back
14:12 <mst> you can do it but it's probably as easy for me to do it as to 
            explain it :)
14:13 <marcus> yepp

Hence the changes being entered by me rather than him.

Just thought people might be wondering :)
