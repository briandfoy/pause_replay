    ORM - Object relational mapper (ORM) for Perl

    ORM is Perl library that implements object-relational mapping. Its
    features are much similar to those of Java's Hibernate library, but
    interface is much different and easier to use. Also you can think of
    it as of alternative for Class-DBI.

    Features: * Inheritance of persistent objects * Transaction support
    * No SQL statement writings needed * Full-featured search of objects
    in DB using perl expressions * Objects statistics (utilizes GROUP
    BY) * One-to-many and many-to-many links between objects * Use
    objects of custom classes as properties of persistent object *
    Automatic methods for get and set object properties * Internally
    uses DBI interface (currently supported only MySQL database)
