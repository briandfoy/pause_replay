Thanks for your suggestion.

I would have hoped delegation would be okay, since it's very similar to
the idea of object delegation. Script i chose because its for scripts,
but then again so are the Getopt modules.

My only concern about using Getopt would be that it's not really getting
command line options and i wouldn't want a user to think that they
couldn't use this along side their favourite Getopt module.

I'll give it some thought... it's already starting to grow on me...=20

thanks for taking the time to respond with your suggestions, it is
appreciated.
