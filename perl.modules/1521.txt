From: andreas.koenig@anima.de ((Andreas J. Koenig))

The new add_mod utility for registering namespaces for the module list
has done a valuable job for me these days and seems stable. I'd like
to put it in your hands.

I found the optimal working environment with this form is to have the
following windows open:

- a browser to fill in the form (obviously:)
- a CPAN shell
- a shell with CWD being CPAN/authors/id/
- a mailreader to read the modules@ mailing list

With these windows I could answer rather quickly most questions that
came up during the registration.

The tool is not extremely fast (that's why I prefer the CPAN shell in
the second window instead of putting in more features), but by making
extensive use of the "Guess the rest" button, one can actually get
some work done.

Enjoy,
