The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Coderef
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Emulate file interface for a code reference
  userid:      PUBNOOP (David Taylor)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    IO::String IO::Scalar

  rationale:

    I choose the name IO::Coderef because it provides the same
    interface as IO::String, but using a callback coderef as the backend
    rather than a string.

    This module is primarily useful in situations where one would like
    to use IO::String, but the volume of data is potentially so huge
    that it can't all be loaded into a scalar in one go.

    IO::Scalar is similar to IO::String, I failed to find any existing
    module that does all the filehandle stuff for you but gives you full
    control via a callback.

  enteredby:   PUBNOOP (David Taylor)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 27 17:40:58 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::Coderef         bdpOp Emulate file interface for a code reference  PUBNOOP
