If by "evict" you mean takeover and reimplement so it works, we have a
process for that. I'd like that namespace over something else. If it
never worked for anyone, you'll probably have no issues making a
completely new interface that works.

However, we tend to defer to the DateTime mailing list on names in case
they have plans for something in that namespace. You might ask them
what they think you shoudl do.
