Ah, duh. It's not used, so it doesn't matter. I say go for Config::INI.
Stefan is handling any purging though, so you have to talk to him or
Andreas about that.

I don't agree with that. When speaking, I generally let a slight pause
stand in for "::", so I would say "Business , ISBN" instead of
"Business colon colon ISBN". I'd end up saying "AppConfig" and "App ,
Config", then have to explain the difference. I actually talk about
this module in Perl classes, and I know that the two will confuse
people and I'll have to point out which one I mean (and then they'll
get the other one). That's just my opinion though.
