The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::SimpleUnit
  DSLIP:       bdpfa
  description: Simplified XUnit-style Testing
  userid:      GED (Michael Granger)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    irc://irc.openprojects.net/perl

  similar:
    Test::Harness, Test::Unit

  rationale:

    This module is similar in intent to the Test::Unit module, which is
    why it is similarly named. I believe it to be an easier way to do
    XUnit-style testing, and it is contained in one standalone module in
    contrast to Test::Unit's nearly 40 modules. It is also relatively
    small in size, which could allow a module author to easily include
    the module with her code instead of requiring the user to install it
    just for testing.

    It can run in conjunction with Test::Harness (via 'make test') or
    stand-alone.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::SimpleUnit      bdpfa Simplified XUnit-style Testing               GED
