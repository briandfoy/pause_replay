planning to contribute: various modules: immediate ones are QIF.pm (parse
and process QIF format files), ftpparse (perl frontend to DJ Bernstein's
ftpparse library, Apache::RequestStats (This name can and probably will
change. A module to emit various statistics about requests as they are
handled). In general, I will contribute useful modules that don't already
exist and which I happen to write.
