I'm including modules@perl.org because Robert Brown has more or less
disappeared.=A0 I've sent messages to two of his emails, called the
phone number listed for his whois, and called the phone number that is
listed for his business.=A0 One of the emails (rob@roobik.com) bounced
saying that the directory the mail is stored in is full.=A0 The other
one (bbb@cpan.org) never replied.=A0 The first phone number was an ISP
and couldn't help me, and the second was disconnected.=A0 If anyone
knows how to get in touch with Rob *please* let me know.

Hey fellas,

So you may or may not have noticed that File::NFSLock doesn't work at
all in windows.=A0 There are two reasons for this:

1) pids in windows are negative numbers due to them actually being threads
2) your tests use fork which windows perl doesn't fully support

The first is easy to fix, and there's even a patch on RT to take care
of it: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3D40185

The second is trickier, and (I think) stems from the fact that windows
perl emulates forks with threads, so memory is not shared.=A0 What I
think you should do is just skip tests 200, 220, and 300 in windows.
I'd gladly furnish you with a patch for this if you would be willing
to release it.

I also got started on a renovation of the code to use some more modern
features (lexical filehandles and our, for example) with the hopes
that that would solve some of the problems.=A0 I think it may have, but
often people aren't willing to force their users to upgrade to 5.6, so
I'll give you that code if you are interested, but I am not sure that
you are.

I look forward to hearing back from you.
