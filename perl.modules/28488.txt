The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PurpleWiki
  DSLIP:       bmphg
  description: Wiki, PurpleNumber, Transclusion processor
  userid:      CDENT (Chris Dent)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://purplewiki.blueoxen.net/

  similar:

  rationale:

    PurpleWiki is a set of libraries for processing text that is
    centered around the generation of PurpleNumbers for granular
    addressability of web based content. PurpleNumbers also allow for a
    form of Transclusion. The system originally started as a wiki
    (included) but has been extended to allow wiki formatting with
    purple numbers in other systems including mail archives, weblog
    systems, text repositories. Examples of how it is used can be found
    at the wiki URL above and at
    http://www.burningchrome.com:8000/~cdent/wiki.cgi

    The primary goal of requesting a namespace is so the module can be
    discovered and installed via CPAN. I assume this is necessary for
    that. If not, someone please correct me.

    Having PurpleWiki as a top level namespace is because it does not
    seem to adequately fit into one of the others, although it has
    aspects of many.

The resulting entry would be:

PurpleWiki        bmphg Wiki, PurpleNumber, Transclusion processor   CDENT
