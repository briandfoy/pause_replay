The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SNA
  DSLIP:       cnhOg
  description: Social network analysis Module
  userid:      WSDOOKADR (Petrea Corneliu Stefan)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I don't think there is any other module on cpan that has this name.
    I am building a project that is closely related to the field of
    Social Network Analaisys and all that is connected to it and I want
    to implement different algorithms and upload the modules of common
    use here.

  enteredby:   WSDOOKADR (Petrea Corneliu Stefan)
  enteredon:   Sat Jan 19 23:37:05 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SNA               cnhOg Social network analysis Module               WSDOOKADR
