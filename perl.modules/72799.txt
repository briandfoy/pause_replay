Hi Todd,

no problem with me, I'm glad that someone starts cleaning up the
backlog. I've added you to the sourceforge project, I hope this is all
that's needed to give you access to SVN.

If you want to keep the git repository for development and share it with
others, please put a link to it on the SF page. You don't need to sync
every commit back to SVN, just be sure to import your CPAN release
versions in SVN.

Welcome aboard! :-)

Roland
