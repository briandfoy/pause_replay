I'm working on a project to write some new perl modules that will =
automate retrieving online banking statements and bills.=20

The originator of this project would like to use 'Paperless' as the base =
name for the module. As far as I can tell, it is available.=20

I searched for similar functionality and here are my findings (also =
posted here: =
http://www.reddit.com/r/paperless/comments/2d7rnt/a_couple_nottoo_similar_=
cpan_modules/):=20

> I did a somewhat brief search on CPAN to see if there already were =
other perl modules with similar functionality. I couldn't find modules =
that do exactly what Paperless is aiming for, but there are a couple =
similar modules.
>=20
> Finance::Bank::* is a series of modules for interacting with bank =
websites through perl (e.g., Finance::Bank::HSBC). On my cursory glance, =
I didn't see the ability to download PDF statements, but these modules =
aim to let users download their banking info (e.g., checking account =
balances). So there is some overlap in functionality, and at least there =
might be login methods that can be adapted/adopted.
>=20
> I also found Data::BT::PhoneBill which lets users parse their BT phone =
bills. Again, it doesn't seem to download PDF statements, but there is =
some overlapping functionality.

Are there other similar modules that we should instead focus on =
extending? Can we expect to be able to use the name 'Paperless' on CPAN =
(assuming we're able to get that far with the project)?=20

Thanks for any guidance --

Kind regards,
