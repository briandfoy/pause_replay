In preparation for my talk at YAPC, I was trying to figure out what day of the
week a given date was on, and could not find a simple module to do this. Yes,
I'm sure Date::Manip does it somewhere in there. It does anything. But I was
looking for something a little more lightweight and easy to talk about.

I just uploaded Date-DayOfWeek, which contains Date::DayOfWeek and
Date::Doomsday, which calculate the day of the week of any given date, and the
doomsday of any given year, respectively.

doomsday is an idea invented by Dr John Conway, which makes it really easy to
figure out the day of the week of any date, by calculating a doomsday - a
particular day of the week - which is somehow "special" in a particular year.

More information at http://www.interlog.com/~r937/doomsday.html in case you
care.

I uploaded Date::Doomsday earlier this evening, but will probably be removing
it here shortly, since it is included in this other distribution.
