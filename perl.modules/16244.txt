OK - So when should I use ice vs. heat?

This is a question many ask when suddenly experiencing sudden onset 
of pain, for example after playing sports, or doing chores around the 
house. Timing is everything. As soon as possible, using ice is best since 
the goal is to reduce inflammation. Typically applying ice within the first 
24-48 hours is recommended. 

For acute injury and within the first several days, follow the rules of RICE:

R = rest
I = ice
C = compression
E = elevation

One of the more effective and inexpensive ways to apply cold is to 
place cubed or crushed ice into a plastic bag. Make sure to wrap the 
bag in cloth or a towel to avoid direct contact with the skin. By the 
way, crushed ice conforms to irregular contours of the body and may 
work best. Check your freezer for bags of frozen vegetables. That can 
work nicely, as well. 

Applying ice "off and on" for 15-20 minute intervals often works best 
during the initial 24 hours following injury. If you are icing your hands 
or feet, up to 10-minute intervals will work better. Keep close track of 
time though, especially if you have problems with circulation.

If you have any questions or concerns, be careful and check with your 
healthcare professional.

Applying heat can also be effective, but not following acute injury. This 
type of application promotes circulation and delivers healing nutrients to 
areas injured. Sounds like a great idea, but applying heat should not be 
done right away because it's important to reduce swelling, and doing 
this is counterproductive. You can consider applying warm moist 
compresses following 2-3 days. That usually works nicely.

Hot and cold application-type products are very effective and can be 
purchased locally. 

If you have any questions, give our office a call or check with your 
local healthcare professional.
