Subject: PAUSE Source Code?

Is the source to PAUSE available online somewhere??

The reason - it looks like since version 2.0, CGI::SpeedyCGI is no longer
being symlinked under /by-module/CGI - CPAN still thinks 1.8.3 is the
latest version.  I think this is related to the re-organization of the
source code took place in CGI::SpeedyCGI 2.0.  I'd like to track it down
and come up with a fix, and looking at the source code for PAUSE would
probably be the easiest way.

Thanks,
Sam Horrocks
