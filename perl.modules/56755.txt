I've transferred these modules, which are in the NTLM distro

Made BUZZ primary maintainer of Auth::NTLMdes.
Made BUZZ primary maintainer of Auth::NTLMmd4.
Made BUZZ primary maintainer of Authen::NTLM.
Made BUZZ primary maintainer of Authen::NTLM::DES.
Made BUZZ primary maintainer of Authen::NTLM::MD4.

I've also scheduled NTLM-1.03.tar.gz for re-indexing.

Thanks.
