Hello people,

I need your help by CPAN and PAUSE because I have some 
trouble on it.

At 2007-02-04 I uploaded a new module called Log::Handler 
to pause. After this the trouble begins. At first I saw
some CPAN-Testers informations with "no reports".

>> 0.30 (No reports) 
>> 0.31 (No reports)

But I startet with 0.01 and I don't know where this
reports comes from. I wrote a mail to acme@astray.com and
leon@astray.com with the pleasure to fix this problem, 
but I didn't got any response or help.

Then I tried to upload a new version with some fixes (0.03)
and receive the error message:

>> PAUSE has not succeeded to get the URL
>>   Log-Handler-0.03.tar.gz,
>> requested for upload as
>>   B/BL/BLOONIX/Log-Handler-0.03.tar.gz
>> after the maximum of 16 retries.
>> I give up now.
>> 
>> I have extinguished B/BL/BLOONIX/Log-Handler-0.03.tar.gz from the 
>> database,
>> so we can pretend it has never existed.
>> 
>> I have renamed the local file
>>   /home/ftp/incoming/Log-Handler-0.03.tar.gz
>> to
>>   /home/ftp/incoming/Log-Handler-0.03.tar.gz~1~

I don't know what happend there, but I would be very happy if
someone could help me to solve this. Could it be that Log::Handler 
is an old namespace and should be cleaned? I don't know.

Best regards,
Jonny (BLOONIX)
