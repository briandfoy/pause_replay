Hello,

I have been looking for a Perl module which would allow me to use the
Net::FTP functions. I came accross your modules list
(http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/00modlist.long.html) which pojnted
me in the direction of Graham Barrs home page. Unfortunatly, when I tried to
navigate through this site, the links did not work (particularly the
Net::FTP) one. This was very dissapointing as I am looking forward to
writing FTP scripts. Could you please point me in the right direction?

Thanks ever so much,

Simon Dewey.
