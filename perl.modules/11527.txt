So we are not alone:-)

It's simple: Code that does solve a problem is better than no code. It
really depends on the competition. If there is something that is
unambiguosly better, don't publish. If there's something of similar
quality, publish and tell the people where you see your potential and
where you see your code positioned. If the error handling is bad,
document it.

Quite often your users will judge your module better than you
yourself. Let them do so. Maybe one of them will take over what you
have started and will win a day or more of preparation.

Let us know if we can register you.

Good luck,
