That's about the size of it. :-)

Of the many hundreds of my users that I know about, half are fleeing=20
from Exchange or some similar package that runs on Windows. By making=20
it easy  for them to get a great mail system up and running (something=20=

most hadn't achieved on their own), I'm doing the internet a great=20
favor by getting rid of Exchange and thus Windows systems.

The other half are honest sysadmins, who understand the term "toaster.=20=

They certainly don't "need" to use it, but already have enough work to=20=

do and thoroughly appreciate finding a well tested, well engineered,=20
battle proven solution to their email needs. I wrote the Mail::Toaster=20=

for them, back when I was doing their job.

Those are the guys that best appreciate my work, but the Windows admins=20=

are the ones I make my living off, because they don't have a working=20
knowledge of Unix and need me when something breaks.
