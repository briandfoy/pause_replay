The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sandgrains
  DSLIP:       cdpOo
  description: Classes representing biological concepts
  userid:      MGODINHO (Miguel Godinho)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://github.com/miguelgodinho/p5-Sandgrain

  similar:
    BioPerl

  rationale:

    The modules to be part of this namespace are mostly used by a web
    application (under development, namespace not yet registered) called
    'Sandblast' (blast = to most well known genomic sequence alignment
    tool). As they are just the datatypes to be used by Sandblast, it
    seemed to me that 'sandgrains' would make sense.

    'Sandgrains' are not nested in 'Sandblast' because they are being
    reused on a application that should be kept completely independent.

  enteredon:   Thu Dec  8 20:11:58 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sandgrains        cdpOo Classes representing biological concepts     MGODINHO
