Names used in X-Windows. Also HTML/SVG standard names. And there 
are names used in Windows (minor differences with HTML scheme).

I'm sympathetic to that for functions. It's a simple alias. But along that 
lines we should have French, Spanish, German, and Chinese and various 
sub-dialect names for functions. And it's awkward to have a 
Graphics::ColorNames and separate Graphics::ColourNames module.
