I wouldn't bother the list with this, but since I'm on the cusp of
uploading a module in a root-level namespace with a lower-case name, I
think it's warranted for me to be a bit cautious.

After quite a bit of discussion on use.perl, the module authors list
and Perl Monks, the general opinion seems to be that my "class name
shortening" module can be called "aka.pm" and deserves to be treated as
a pragma.

  use aka 'My::Company::Namespace::Customer';
  use aka 'My::Company::Namespace::Preferred::Customer',
      as => 'Preferred';

  my $cust = Customer->new;
  my $pref = Preferred->new;

I suspect that those who wish to use this will appreciate the short
name and will quickly cease to notice that "aka" is not a word.  Of
course, the POD will explain the acronym for those who don't understand
it.  Also, I'm not planning on changing the implementation because
Rentrak, Inc. (who has graciously allowed me to reimplement their
"Aliased.pm" code) has been using similar code for years with
enterprise-class systems (pardon the buzzword) with nary a problem. 
The implementation is quite natural and has stood the test of time.

Barring some strenuous objections, I'll upload this sometime on
2005-01-05.  Also, as I sometimes note in work related email, "silence
implies agreement" :)

Cheers,
Ovid
