Hi, folks,

I've been developing some PDL-related modules and also have some
patches to other modules (such as Math::Units) that are apropos to
PDL.  I'd like a PAUSE ID to submit them.  Here's my info:

Name:          Craig DeForest
email:         cpan@deforest.org
homepage:      http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~deforest
Preferred UID: zowie [or drzowie if zowie isn't available]
Contributions: Patches to some scientific-computing-related modules;
	       goodies for the PDL:: tree (I've been discussing said
	       goodies on the appropriate PDL list).


Thanks,
Craig
