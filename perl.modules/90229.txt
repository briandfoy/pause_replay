The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Validate::Perl
  DSLIP:       bdpf2
  description: validate in-memory perl data using spec file
  userid:      DONGXU (Dongxu Ma)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    prePAN

  similar:
    Data::Validate::Struct

  rationale:

    This module was originally intended for YAML data validation. As a
    powerful (and yet simple) mark-up language, YAML has been very
    popular, one thing which is missing to me is schema validation, like
    XML DTD. In this module, I introduced a simple language to describe
    a YAML data structure, then use a script to translate it into a
    Parse::Yapp grammar, finally generate a parser to traverse the
    loaded YAML data. Since it validates against in-memory perl
    structure, it is not limited to a single type format (as YAML
    itself). It becomes a generic validator for any data that can be
    loaded into perl.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Validate::
::Perl            bdpf2 validate in-memory perl data using spec file DONGXU
