The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Simple
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple object oriented access to files.
  userid:      ERICJH (Eric Hodges)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:
    IO::Any IO::File Fatal

  rationale:

    I wanted a simple way to wrap up file operations. This module will
    provide a similar OO interface as IO::All or IO::File as well as
    making open, close and print fatal (optionally), auto chomp, and the
    ability to slurp files. These are all simple operations but I'm sure
    I'm not the first tired of looking up how to slurp or typing 'or die
    "...."' every time I open a file.

    Placing it in an object will also allow for clearer errors and
    delayed open of files (optionally) with the ability to use the
    correct mode based on the type of operation being performed. It also
    allows for nicer errors than are provided by the more generic Fatal
    module.

    I wanted to use IO::All but its numerous dependencies and its
    amount of magic make it to complex for my needs, hence my Simple
    alternative.

    Suggestions for better names are certainly welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::Simple          adpOp Simple object oriented access to files.      ERICJH
