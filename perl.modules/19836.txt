The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Project3D
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Project vectorial function from 3D to plane
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace registration was sent last year and I have not yet
    received any comments about it nor has it been approved. Recently,
    someone asked on the modules list about what to do in that case.
    Arthur Bergman suggested reregistering:

    Given a function of three components and of an arbitrary number of
    parameters, the module allows you to project any point of the
    function (specified by its function parameters) onto an arbitrary
    plane in R^3 along any vector.

    Math:: was chosen because, well, it is Maths. Vector geometry.
    Project3D was chosen because ology suggested it on #perl and I could
    not think of a more appropriate name. I'm open for suggestions at
    mail at steffen-mueller dot net.

  enteredby:   SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::Project3D       RdpOp Project vectorial function from 3D to plane  SMUELLER
