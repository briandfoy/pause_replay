     why:

    I have recently given a "lightning talk" at the Italian Perl
    Workshop 2011: http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ipw2011/index.html
    about an application in Perl for Automated Reasoning, that I have
    written with colleagues of the University of Torino, Italy.

    As I said in the talk, I would like to make this software freely
    available, and since it's in Perl I think CPAN is the best place for
    publishing the SW.

    I would like to split my contribution in two distinct CPAN modules:
    - a simple module that consists of a C library and a Perl wrapper
    around it; the module exposes to Perl "Ordered Binary Decision
    Diagrams", a data structure heavily used in Artificial Intelligence
    and other areas - the specific reasoning application, all written in
    Perl but depending on the above module
