For reference, the Mobipocket, Microsoft Lit, and EPub containers are
all based on the IDPF standards (and the Kindle format is just
Mobipocket with a serial number change).  I do intend to write
unpackers for all of those at a minimum.  The iSiloX .ixl build
description containers are XML files, and can probably be supported in
the future at least in one direction.  Plucker is a one-direction
assembly from HTML, which can almost certainly be linked in.  PalmDoc
is just a single text file, and will be supported in both directions
before Mobipocket because I have to learn that one to deal with the
more complex .prc database.

The only major formats that I know of that I'm not going to be able to
handle easily are eReader, because it uses a completely separate
markup, and I'll have to come up with a converter between that and
HTML, and Sony LRF, which is completely undocumented but for which
some reverse-engineered code exists in Python that I can attempt to
learn from.

There are a few book formats that I have no intention of attempting to
handle simply because their readers are no longer being produced and
they are completely proprietary with no available documentation (this
includes the REB1100, Franklin, and hiebook devices).  By the same
token, however, I very much doubt anyone else is going to attempt to
work on them, either.

That said, my intention was to use the EBook class as the base handler
for all book metadata and generation, and put all of the unpacking
code in EBook::Unpack, anyway.

With this said, do you still object to my claiming EBook?  If so, I
plan to use a still-general EBook::Tools (and put the unpackers in
EBook::Tools::Unpack).
