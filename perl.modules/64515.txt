The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Modbot
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Automated spam moderation on the Web
  userid:      MICHAEL (Michael Roberts)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a toolkit for automated spam moderation of forums and
    similar Web-based venues. It defines a ruleset and some standard
    tools for judgment of the spamminess of posts, provides for upload
    to an archive, and provides a convenient shell-based interface.

    It's currently in use for several forums and online lists I
    operate.
