The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Shipping::UPS
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: A UPS price and package tracker.
  userid:      JWHEELER (Justin Wheeler)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    none.

  similar:
    Business::UPS

  rationale:

    This is a rewrite of msolomon's original Business::UPS module. His
    last update of it was in 1999, and since then, UPS has pretty
    drastically changed their system, such that it doesn't work anymore.

    After requesting msolomon's permission to just upload a new version
    of Business::UPS to use the namespace the current one is in, I
    didn't receive a response, so I chose a new namespace for it, which
    I think is a good one.

    It has the same functionality and syntax of Business::UPS, and it
    is essentially, a newer version of it, just in a different
    namespace.

  enteredby:   JWHEELER (Justin Wheeler)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 13 12:12:54 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::Shipping::
::UPS             Rdpfg A UPS price and package tracker.             JWHEELER
