The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SWF::ForcibleConverter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Convert SWF into version 9 format forcibly
  userid:      HWAT (WATANABE Hiroaki)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://github.com/hiroaki/SWF-ForcibleConverter

  similar:

  rationale:

    I named this module because it is a utility which operates a SWF
    file and forcibly conversion process is performed.

    Although this is a thing for a niche demand, as long as SWF of a
    sieve version that is not seen latest Flash Player exists, I think
    that it is useful.

  enteredby:   HWAT (WATANABE Hiroaki)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar 30 19:05:14 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SWF::
::ForcibleConverter bdpOp Convert SWF into version 9 format forcibly   HWAT
