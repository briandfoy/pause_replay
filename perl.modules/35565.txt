Thanks for the feedback, but we've decided that it's just not worth the hassle
of doing a re-name, partly because of the naming issues, but mainly because of
the bulk of code we have using this module.  We'll upload it as is to CPAN, but
are not pushing for the inclusion in the Module list.

Personally, I've looked at the module list twice in my life and have found all
the modules I'm looking for via the CPAN Search page. :)

We were just looking for official status to get more coverage than SF and
Freshmeat have already provided.
