The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::DMIDecode
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Interface to SMBIOS under using dmidecode
  userid:      NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl modules mailing list, IRC, talker.tfb.net

  similar:
    Could not find any other interfaces to SMBIOS or dmideocde

  rationale:

    This was briefly discusses on the perl modules mailing list with
    input from Adam Kennedy. It was originally going to be named
    Linux::SMBIOS, but dmidecode is actually supported and works under
    other operating systems.

    Since it is specifically parser for the dmidecode command, rather
    than a specific custom inferface to SMBIOS, the Parse:: root seems a
    rather obvious location to place it. It is solely a read only
    interface to extract the data from a single command DMIDecode.

    I needed an interface to SMBIOS information for one of my own
    projects. As far as I can see there are no other interfaces to
    SMBIOS or dmidecode on CPAN, which is why I wrote this in the first
    place.

  enteredby:   NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  enteredon:   Sun Oct 22 13:16:01 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
::DMIDecode       RdpOo Interface to SMBIOS under using dmidecode    NICOLAW
