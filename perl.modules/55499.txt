The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Smart
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Automate human verification tests
  userid:      TRIZOR (Edgar A. Bering)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    In working for a Weather data company I've found myself asking the
    meteorologists from time to time when implementing new functionality
    "Is this meteorologically sound?" and as part of our system we have
    human checkers verify the data. I wanted a way to build human
    verification into test reports and get the output as a part of a
    standard make test (or maybe a separate target since people can be
    slow) to minimize face-time with the experts to discussing new
    functionality and actually understanding bugs, not just "is this
    right? yes".

  enteredby:   TRIZOR (Edgar A. Bering)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul 24 23:37:47 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Smart           adphp Automate human verification tests            TRIZOR
