pursuant to form 2174E9-041.Z41, subclause 19, paragraph b, I am hereby requesting a pause id.

If it is agreeable to your situation, i would enjoy having the pause id of SUNGO, tied to the email address of eek+cpan@eekeek.org.

i intend to use this pause id to further my dominance of the world using POE modules and XML parsing.

Many thanks for your attention and sharp fashion sense.

sungo.
