I've just uploaded Mail-Field-Received-0.20.tar.gz to PAUSE (my userid
is ASPIERS).  It contains a new module Mail::Field::Received which
slots into Graham Barr's Mail::Field suite as an RFC822-based parser
of Received headers in e-mails.  I hereby make a humble request to the
CPAN gods that it be registered as follows:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Mail::Field::
::Received     RdpO  Parses Received headers as per RFC822        ASPIERS


The README now follows.  Please also read the P.S. at the bottom!

README for Mail::Field::Received

                           Mail::Field::Received
                           =====================

Mail::Field::Received is a parser of `Received' headers in e-mails.


Uses
----

Any program which requires detailed information about the journey an
e-mail took in order to arrive at its present location should find
this parser very handy.

See <http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/parp/> for an e-mail
filter which uses this module as part of its spam detection heuristics.

Prerequisites
-------------

This suite requires Perl 5.005 or higher.  Mail::Field::Received also needs
Mail::Field.

Installation
------------

See INSTALL.

Documentation
-------------

POD-format documentation is included in Received.pm.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.

Support
-------

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
Mail::Field::Received should just be sent to me at <adam@spiers.net>.

Availability
------------

The latest version of Mail::Field::Received is available from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).  Visit
<http://www.perl.com/CPAN> to find a CPAN site near you.

P.S. I'm still waiting for a response to my queries regarding
namespace issues over my URI::Bookmarks suite.  See
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-03/msg00140.html
for the last e-mail I sent on this matter.
