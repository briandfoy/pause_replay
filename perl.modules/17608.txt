The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32:SimpleProcess
  DSLIP:       RnpOn
  description: Launch, kill, and list processes by pid.
  userid:      TEDK (Edward C. Kubaitis)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32::Process Win32::IProcess

  rationale:

    I thought I'd offer a simple, lightweight, object-oriented, less
    problematic, and less "featured" version of Win32::Process called
    Win32::SimpleProcess. The existing modules are very cumbersome to
    use and often require mixing OOPerl with regular Perl which makes
    for ugly code and in a few places the existing modules are buggy.

    kudos to CPAN

The resulting entry would be:

Win32:SimpleProcess RnpOn Launch, kill, and list processes by pid.     TEDK
