Using made-up abbreviated words also makes it harder for anybody to find
your module in the first place.  Yes, when presented with the name
Net::Pkt I instinctively pronounced "pkt" as "packet"[*0].

But it doesn't work the other way round: if I'm in need of a module to
generate network packets, I'm going to search for "packet"; I'm not
likely to think of searching for "pkt" (or "pckt", or whatever).  The
thing about using a real word is that (almost) everybody can agree on a
spelling, whereas omitting letters is somewhat arbitrary and is likely
to be done differently by different people.

Exactly -- so make the change now while there's only one user that will
be hurt by this!

In the short history of computing there are far too many incidents where
an early design of something wasn't improved on the grounds that doing
so would inconvenience the few people already using it, and therefore
the initial, inferior, design has been inflicted on many, many more
people for years afterwards.

Thank you for thinking about it!

Though I see another downside to renaming the module is that it wouldn't
look as neat in your signature!

  [*0]  Though there's a part of me that's desperately trying to think
  up a ruse for a plausible reason to have networked parakeets, so as to
  prove brian's point.
