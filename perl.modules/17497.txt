The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::CNMap
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: enhanced Chinese encodings
  userid:      QJZHOU (Qing-Jie Zhou)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Encode::HanConvert Encode::CN

  rationale:

    Encode::CNMap provides enhanced Chinese encodings, which can do
    bi-direction Simplified-Traditional mappings automatically by
    standard Encode::encode, Encode::decode, Encode::from_to methods.

    Encode::CN provides stadard encodings and cannot support
    automatically mappings. Encode::HanConvert provides perl functions
    to support Simplified-Traditional mappings.

    Encode::CNMap can be viewd as an enhanced version of Encode::CN,
    and a new realization of Encode::HanConvert.

    In addition, Encode::CNMap provides two command-line utilities to
    support file and recursively directory convertions.

  enteredon:   Thu Jan 30 09:25:39 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::
::CNMap           adpfp enhanced Chinese encodings                   QJZHOU
