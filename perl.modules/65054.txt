The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Community
  DSLIP:       idphp
  description: Community information modules
  userid:      SJN (Salve J. Nilsen)
  chapterid:   26 (Documentation)
  communities:
    #perl_events @ irc.perl.org,
    http://github.com/rblackwe/perl-events-on-cpan/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've always wanted a module called Oslo.pm. :)

    Can't have that, so why not Community::Oslo.pm? Why not make
    Community.pm into a base class usable for other Perl Mogers groups?

    Ideas include making a common API for finding out when the next
    meeting is, where it is, what topic, and also find room for larger
    events like hackathons, workshops and YAPC's.

    Add geo info, and just download the modules that are in your
    vicinity to get an up-to-date info on what's going on in your local
    Perl community. :)

    I'd like the top level module just to make sure we get a sensible
    API. My ambition is to let anyone in a Perl Mongers group add their
    own info in their own distribution/module.

    I think there are some possibilities here worth exploring. :)

The resulting entry would be:
