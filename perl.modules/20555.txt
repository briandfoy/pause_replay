Don't panic, 0.19 also got uploaded just fine. What is new is the mail
from the indexer that is being sent to explain some of the work that
it is doing.

I don't think, it is a bug. You are doing something in the namespace
RequestAgent, so it's only fair to inform you that this namespace is
not going to be indexed for you. As you seem to be using this
namespace as a scratch namespace, I'd recommend you call it something
like Finance::YahooQuote::RequestAgent to avoid namespace clashes.
