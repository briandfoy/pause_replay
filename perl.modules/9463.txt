The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Curses::UI
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Curses based user interface
  userid:      MMAKAAY (Maurice Makaay)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Curses::Widgets

  rationale:

    I first wanted to use Curses::Widgets, but that namespace is
    already taken by another module which implements widgets using the
    curses library. Since the internals of my widget system are
    completely different from Curses::Widgets, it's not possible to mix
    with the existing namespace. That's why I started out developing
    Curses::UI. At start it was Curses::MWS (MWS = Maurice's Widget
    Set). I changed it to Curses::UI just recently. Especially since I
    wouln't want other people developing widgets which would come in
    "Maurice's" widget set. Other ideas for the namespace are, of
    course, welcome!

The resulting entry would be:

Curses::
::UI              adpOp Curses based user interface                  MMAKAAY
