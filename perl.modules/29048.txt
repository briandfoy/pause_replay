The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::DBI::Factory
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: factory interface to Class::DBI classes
  userid:      WROSS (William Ross)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Class::DBI mailing list.

  similar:
    Class::DBI::Loader, Apache::MVC

  rationale:

    There are a few initiatives to build an application framework
    around Class::DBI, but most are low-level toolkits and none that I
    know of is on the factory model, and most are at a very early stage.
    There has been no objection from the cdbi list (Nor any very vocal
    excitement either, but perhaps quiet approval will turn into more
    active appreciation if it's actually up on cpan.)

    the module is actually quite mature and has been in use here for a
    couple of years, but I'll label it beta until it has survived in the
    open for a while.

    there are three other modules with it but they're all within the
    namespace (eg Class::DBI::Factory::Handler).

    ta.

    will

The resulting entry would be:

Class::DBI::
