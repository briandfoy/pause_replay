The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPDR
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: IPDR Protocol collector module.
  userid:      SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    IPDR collection code to act as a client/server for one specific
    vendor and a generic implementation.

    IPDR is a specific protocol allowing the transmissiong/collection
    of billing/usage data from a variety of systems ranging from
    Telephone to CMTS.

    Specification for IPDR can be found here

    http://www.ipdr.org/public/DocumentMap/SP2.3.pdf

    I believe having a high level namespace is warranted due to the
    nature of the protocol/name.

    The code currently supports two specific implementations, same
    generic interface to the end user,

    Cisco and Client

    Cisco is different all other implementations as it is the most
    basic and keeps to the spec as losely as it can.

    Client is a generic IPDR collector and acts as a client to a IPDR
    server. It has been testing with Motorola and Aris equipment and
    appears to work correctly.

    IPDR::Cisco IPDR::Client

  enteredby:   SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)

The resulting entry would be:

IPDR              bdpO2 IPDR Protocol collector module.              SHAMROCK
