     why:

    I plan to contribute modules related to openlaszlo documentation
    which is currently represented as unstructured html. My module
    parses the docs and makes it available as a data structure in perl
    as well as xml. I will be extending off this module with the
    capability of creating a Dreamweaver extension which installs
    language support for laszlo.
