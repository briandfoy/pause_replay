Hello,

I am writing to apply for a contributor account, CPAN ID so that I can
upload to CPAN.

name		   Soren Andersen

email address	   somian@pobox.com

homepage	   http://home.att.net/~perlspinr/browse_site.html

preferred user-ID on CPAN:  SOMIAN


I am writing a module to extend the options available in how one builds
Perl modules. It works with the ExtUtils:: modules (MakeMaker) to allow
the user to build a module from a distribution tree that is located in
another directory ('external' build, as is commonly done in GNU-style
builds of C, C++ and other kinds of source code packages).

The module is to be named "ExoBuild". I've been advised by
ExtUtil::MakeMaker's maintainer to place it in the Module:: namespace
instead of in ExtUtils::, so probably it will be called
"Module::ExoBuild" by the time I upload (release) it.

  Thank You,
    Soren Andersen
