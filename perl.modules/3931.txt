Hi

Sorry to trouble you but I sent an email detailing a perl module I uploaded
into my area on Pause.

The area is Twibbler.

This was about 4-5 weeks ago I was hoping it may have been included but as
yet I cannot find it.

I can get to it if I know where to go but cannot find it on cpan.

Could you let me know if you have received my email and if so what is
happening ? or not as the case may be.
Or am I looking wrongly ???.

I am only on this email address for the next few days Xmas you know. but you
can get me on

trevor.r.ward@btinternet.com.

Well have a great xmas and alcoholic new year
