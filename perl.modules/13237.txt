The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::CheckbuttonGroup
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: widget displays and manages a group of relat
  userid:      JANNINO (Joseph Annino)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perl/TK NewsGroup <ptk@lists.Stanford.EDU>

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module groups together several checkbuttons in a frame, and
    associates their state with a single list reference. Groups of
    checkbuttons are commonly needed in user interfaces, but Perl/Tk
    provides no easy method to create them.

    I also have a similar Tk::RadiobuttonGroup widget I would like to
    add.

    I am uploading this module to my user directory.

The resulting entry would be:
