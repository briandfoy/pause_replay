Please excuse this interruption, but I have become desperate. My name is Thomas Jones. I am a web developer with over 9 years of experience using ASP, VB, COM, JavaScript, and many others. I have a job, but the company is experiencing "cash flow" problems and I have not received a paycheck in over 6 weeks. This is a problem, as I have 3 children to support and am worried about coming up with rent for March.

You can view my resume` online, download copies in various formats, and read more about my story here:
http://tommy.digi-one.com - Please pass it along to anyone you feel may be able to help.

What I really want is a job, but, if you are not in a position to hire me, but would like to help me feed my children, please make a donation of any amount by following this URL:
https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=digi@digi-one.com&item_name=Help+Tommy&item_number=5000&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD 

Thank you for your time. Any help is appreciated.
