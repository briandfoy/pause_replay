The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OWNet
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Light-weight owserver access (1-wire OWFS)
  userid:      ALFILLE (Paul H Alfille)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    owfs-developers@lists.sourceforge.net http://www.owfs.org

  similar:
    Hardware::1Wire

  rationale:

    OWNet talks (via tcp/ip) to owserver using a disctint protocol.
    owserver in turn provides a complete encapsulation of the Dallas
    1-wire bus, devices, and adapters.

    owserver is part of the OWFS (1-wire file system) suite. The 1-wire
    protocol is powerful but low-level and quirky. owserver provides a
    file system metaphor, multiplexing, caching, error-handing, and
    network communication.

    This module, OWNet, is a light-weight perl script that allows
    simple access to owserver with just the owserver ip address and a
    consistent (filesystem-like) naming scheme. Although it could be
    part of the Hardware::1Wire namespace, it seems distinct. It is more
    a network protocol method than pure 1-wire.

    Note: owserver is registered as an mDNS service (_owserver._tcp)
    and the owserver protocol has been submitted to IANL for a
    well-known port number.

    The name OWNet is also consistent with the heavier-weight OW module
    (not included) that incorporates the owserver library internally,
    and the similar ownet modules for PHP and python.

The resulting entry would be:

OWNet             bdphp Light-weight owserver access (1-wire OWFS)   ALFILLE
