     why:

    Working implementation of a Callerid module to interpret raw caller
    id codes as reported by a data modem. I don't have access to enough
    modems to be able to say that it's totally portable. I also have an
    application that's built off of the module that provides a "works
    for me" implementation of a passive answering service (i.e. phone
    rings, program can trigger instant messaging, email reporting... i
    have a web interface to the caller log so the user can do their own
    reporting, etc.)

    I've done lots of programming across the board but not much
    contributing, so I figure this is the logical second step (first
    step being writing code to publish, of course)
