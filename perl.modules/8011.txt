No, RT's in that category of "complex applications with lots of modules"
that makes sense to have a top-level namespace, and it's been going
under the name of "RT" for years and years and years.  It's pretty well
known and has quite a following in the Perl community.  I think this one
is reasonable, as the "RT" is the name of a well known application
rather than just a random acronym.
