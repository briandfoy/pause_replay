I don't have an issue with it, the reasoning behind this to choose the name 
were:

SNMP  Is used by the original Net-SNMP package 
(http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/). This module integrates with the package 
but from an external point of view (working with NetSNMP::MibProxy). So this 
could be a valid option.

Net::SNMP Seems to be a complete rewrite for the SNMP protocol (completely 
independent of the  Net-SNMP package. O don't think that the MibProxy will 
fit into this...

I used NetSNMP as a base name space, based on the extension of the SNMP 
package by using as an example NetSNMP-Agent (which interacts also the 
net-snmp agent but externally, in this case using AgentX). 

So the proposals are either sticking with NetSNMP or rewriting it to use SNMP. 
Please let me know which one would be preferable....
