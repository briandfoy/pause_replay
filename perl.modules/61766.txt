Request to register new user

fullname: Marco Wise
  userid: MARCO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I'm almost done with a web-based form builder that allows one to
    use an HTML form to build other HTML forms which can then be
    managed, edited, rendered, processed and their value stored in a
    database. I'd like to upload the modules I created for the
    application.

    If MARCO is not available (it seemed to be), can I have MRMARCO?
    Thanks!
