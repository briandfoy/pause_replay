The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LittleORM
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: ORM written in Perl with Moose
  userid:      EUGENEK (Eugene Kuzin)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    ORM DBIx::Class

  rationale:

    Good day. This is ORM I developed and used in my work for more than
    a year of intensive web-development in IT company in Russia. In the
    process of seeing our ORM become more powerful and complex I started
    to think it might be useful to someone besides me or my company.
    LittleORM is the name, it contains my desired keyword (ORM that be),
    and ORM:: ns is already used with actual collision at ORM::Filter (I
    have LittleORM::Filter myself). Hope you let me in :)

The resulting entry would be:

LittleORM         RdpOp ORM written in Perl with Moose               EUGENEK
