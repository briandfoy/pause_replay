The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Getopt::XML
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Use an XML Doc as input to Getopt::Long
  userid:      RGLAUE (Russell E Glaue)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is directly related to Getopt::Long, in order to load
    input into Getopt::Long from an XML document as opposed to the
    user's command line.

    The major benefit with this module is an application can load
    default arguments from an XML document, and then accept the same
    arguments from the user's command line to override the defaults. In
    this way, an application can store user preferences or preferred
    default values (perhaps based on the application's installation),
    while only having to use Getopt::Long for the CLI argument
    methodology.

    Additionally, Getopt::XML relies on XML::TreePP which has the
    ability to fetch an XML document from an HTTP/Web location. So the
    preferences could be stored centrally, and even within a data system
    that utilizes REST as a data accessor for the XML data.

The resulting entry would be:

Getopt::
