The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::sudoers
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to the sudoers database
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    unknown, lots of modules to check in File::

  rationale:

    I am not sure if this module should go into the File:: namespace,
    In some sence this is an interface to a database (chapter 7), but it
    is in fact an interface to a single configuration file, although an
    extremely common one.

    This module will read and create and manipulate a sudoers file. It
    will be guided by the same rules in the sudo parser to cancel out
    security problems. As well, it will be able to convert from one
    version of a sudoers file to another; including the new 1.7 source
    tree.

    Any thoughts on the namespace choice are welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::sudoers         adpOp Interface to the sudoers database            CMORRIS
