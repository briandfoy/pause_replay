I have a few module ownership correction requests.  I'm going to be
handing off ownership of a bunch of modules soon and it would make the
transfer much easier if all PAUSE ownership questions were resolved
beforehand.

Test::Harness is listed as being owned by P5P.  It should be owned by
myself (MSCHWERN).  I've been maintaining the module both on CPAN and
within the Perl core for over a year now and have released 15 versions.

Test::Simple isn't in the module list at all.  I remember putting in a
namespace registration a while ago but it doesn't appear to have been
processed.  I'll submit another one shortly.

Thanks.
