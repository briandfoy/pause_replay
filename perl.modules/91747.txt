Request to register new user

fullname: Daniel Packer
  userid: OBSCURITE
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://danielpacker.org
     why:

    Have written many scripts and modules over the years that could be
    good candidates. For example, I recently wrote a nice script to
    export formatted text data from Excel 2007 files. I have some
    bioinformatics modules that could be useful. Have been a
    professional perl programmer since 1997 and always wanted to
    contribute -- better late than never?
