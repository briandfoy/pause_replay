Hi modules@perl.org,

I'd like to register as a developer, and get a module to CPAN.

- your name

    Martin Vorlaender

- your email address

    martin@radiogaga.harz.de
    mv@pdv-systeme.de

- your homepage if you have one

    http://www.pdv-systeme.de/users/martinv/

- your preferred user-ID on CPAN.
  It must be between 4 and 9 characters long, all uppercase, letters only.
  One dash allowed.

    MVORL

- a description of what you're planning to contribute

    A module containing a perl-only implementation of the crypt(3) function.

- for modules a description in module list format

    Rdpf  Perl-only implementation of crypt(3)

  (DSLI entry, which is:
  - Development stage,

      R - Released
      (or a/b - Alpha/Beta testing  until the cpan-testers have looked at it?)

  - Support level,

      d - Developer
      (or u - Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.perl.modules ?) 

  - Language used,

      p - Perl-only, no compiler needed, should be platform independent

  - Interface style (see the modulelist),

      f - plain Functions, no references used

  - and a 45 character description).

      Perl-only implementation of crypt(3)

- for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send a concise description
  that helps us to categorize the issue so we can forward your mail to the
  maintainers of the corresponding archive branch.

    N/A

- It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you
  have discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if
  there was at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for
  submissions, but we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality
  control. If your work has never been discussed publicly, then it's
  extremely difficult for us to make our judgement whether to accept the
  submission or not.

    clpm, subject "encryption and crypt() ?"
    triggered by a mail/post by Tom Phoenix
    recently also clpm, subject "'Crypt' function on CPAN"


The module currently is available for download at
http://www.pdv-systeme.de/users/martinv/Crypt-UnixCrypt-1.0.tar.gz
I'll upload it to the PAUSE server as soon as I can.

cu,
  Martin
