     why:

    i am in the process of writing a perl cross platform gui toolkit
    that utilizes xul/html rendered with firefox/xulrunner. the initial
    concept is similar to XUL::Node/POE::XUL::Node, however the
    execution is quite different. the gui uses a dynamic transparent
    proxy layer between perl and javascript, allowing direct use of
    javascript functions and variables, with some hopefully convenient
    shortcuts. my module is pure perl and only dependent upon core
    modules, making it trivial to install applications based on it into
    a wide range of systems.

    the high level proxy dynamically translates and passes code from
    perl to javascript without any knowledge of or binding to the
    underlying mozilla implementation (beyond a runtime extensible list
    of known xul and html tag names). the proxy is a direct link to
    javascript's properties and methods, allowing developer.mozilla.com
    to serve as the primary gui documentation.

    my current name for the module is XUL::Gui, which is not currently
    taken. the module encourages a design pattern that mirrors the
    nested nature of xml, for a compact yet descriptive syntax

    use XUL::Gui;

    # a simple hello world server Label 'hello, world!';

    # and a richly extensible syntax *hello = widget { GroupBox(
    Caption( label=>'perl would like to say' ), Button( label=>"hello,
    @_!", oncommand=>sub{ shift->label = 'ouch' } ) ) };

    server Window title => 'XUL::Gui demo', map {hello($_)} qw/world
    cpan PAUSE/;
