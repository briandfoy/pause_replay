The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CopyTree::VendorProof
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Vendor independent recursive copy module
  userid:      DBMOLESTA (LL)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    SharePoint::SOAPHandler, CopyTree::VendorProof::LocalFileOp

  rationale:

    CopyTree::VendorProof is one of a three part module that provides a
    copy interface analogous to the unix cp -r command for remote file
    systems which cannot be mounted. The Shared Documents directory of
    Microsoft Sharepoint is one such 'remote file system.'

    The module CopyTree::VendorProof offers objects that handles the
    copying of a directory tree, while SharePoint::SOAPHandler and
    CopyTree::VendorProof::LocalFileOp (which simply uses perl's
    filehandles) offers objects that deals with basic vendor-specific
    copy commands such as uploading / downloading a single file and
    creating / deleting a single direcotry.

    Module extenders only need to provide the methods for simple file
    manipulation, and CopyTree::VendorProof will provide recursive
    copying functionalities.

    A person who wishes to copy files from the local computer to a
    sharepoint file server, would establish an instance of
    SharePoint::SoapHandler and an instance of
    CopyTree::VendorProof::LocalFileOp, and hand these instances over to
    CopyTree::VendorProof. The user then tell CopyTree::VendorProof the
    source and destination file /dir names as she would with the unix cp
    -r command, and the CopyTree::VendorProof will copy the files using
    the appropriate protocols defined by
    CopyTree::VendorProof::LocalfileOp and SharePoint::SOAPHandler.

The resulting entry would be:
