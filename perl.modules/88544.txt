You can do this in the PAUSE interface:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

In the second multiple select box, you can highlight the modules you
want to transfer and choose the "2.1 Transfer primary maintainership
status to somebody else (you become co-maintainer)" action.

Good luck, :)
