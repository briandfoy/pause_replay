     why:

    I am hoping to contribute random wrappers I find interesting that I
    donâ€™t see already available.

    One such thing that I have already completed the basic core of
    using swig is a small wrapper for the flite speech synthesis engine
    that allows developers to use its speech capabilities in interactive
    perl scripts that I and a blind friend am working on. Currently
    after 15 minutes of development it works great, however I hope to
    work on and expand it for greater versatility.. But I thought that I
    should get this account registration set in motion as soon as
    possible.
