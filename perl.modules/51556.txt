From: brian.d.foy@gmail.com (brian d foy)

I intend to take over Crypt::Rijndael from DIDO unless anyone
complains. My mail to him bounces, and most of the tickets in RT say
the same thing.

The module was last updated in 2001, but I'm going through the motions
anyway. I won't have time to work on it for a couple weeks anyway. :)
