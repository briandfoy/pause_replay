The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::MySQLClient
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A graphical client for MySQL via CGI
  userid:      DEEPCREEK (Kai Diefenbach)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    In almost every LAMP Application is the need for database
    add/modify/delete-actions (at least for admin businesses).

    This class will provide an very easy access for this actions with
    several possibilities to configure the HTML form: from simple
    labeling to table lookups and basic (at the moment) possibilites for
    referential integrity.

    I ask for this namespace because the module is a MySQL Client and
    it uses the CG-Interface. (Should there a better ideas or
    suggestions I would appreciate, of course).

    I experience a very ease with using this module and I would be glad
    if I could make this module available for everybody who needs it. Of
    course, not at least to get and use response to improve it for my
    own usage

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::MySQLClient     bdpOp A graphical client for MySQL via CGI         DEEPCREEK
