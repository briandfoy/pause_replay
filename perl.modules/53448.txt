A collective name for a whole family of modules is not typically how we 
would allocate a ::Simple namespace.

It will probably come down to the unique factors of your modules.

For example, there are already a number of email validation modules on 
the CPAN, so there's need to be something that makes yours stand apart.

For example, the standard email validation API Email::Valid appears to 
be pretty simple already.

Email::Valid->address($email_address)
