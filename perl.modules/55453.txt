Request to register new user

fullname: Colin C. O. von Heuring
  userid: URSUS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: divitu.com
     why:

    "Simple Dynamic Hypertext": a Perl web server that treats (most)
    executable files within the document root as Perl subroutines and
    executes them. Because I think there's somewhere within Perl that
    lies between PHP and Perl's CGI.

    If the username URSUS is unavailable, CCOVH is my second choice and
    CVHEURING is my third. If you had a 10-character limit (hint hint),
    my second choice would be VONHEURING.

    Thanks for maintaining the CPAN (and its PAUSE). -CvH
