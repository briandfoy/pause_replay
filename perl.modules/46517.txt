This adds a _tiny_ amount of convenience, saving people doing

use Clone 'clone';

or

use base 'Clone';

And in exchange creates all of the problems of action-at-a-distance 
created by the other modules.

This is the least-useful-yet example of the (already detested by me) 
UNIVERSAL:: series of modules. At least UNIVERSAL::isa and 
UNIVERSAL::can have some purpose.

Without wanting to offend the author, UNIVERSAL::clone has no purpose I 
can see at all. While yes, the name is ok (if you think UNIVERSAL::isa 
etc are ok), I'm sorry but I for one cannot bring myself to hit the 
approve button for something that makes my stomach twist like this 
module does.
