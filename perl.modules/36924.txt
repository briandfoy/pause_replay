Sure, images, media, archives, Database records (which would likley be 
text but also data structures in and of them selves)

Text:: would also be a bad name I think because it then gives the idea 
of only working on a single piece of text rather than a rich array of 
data types and stuctures.

Plus you may out put HTML or binary goodies for some sort of PDF or TTY

I've even heard of one tester that parsed a swf (source befor making it 
binary???) file and paginted it into parts and created a new 
navigateable swf from it. kinda cool huh?

Thanks for your time :)
