Hello, I would like to get a CPAN account, as I have a few things I
think worth contributing.

Contribution:

LCD
::MatrixOrbital adpO Interface to Matrix Orbital LCD Panels

thanks,
Devon Jones

P.S.
I have a script that I might consider posting, but I need to know if it
would be appropriate.  It is a CGI script that creates thumbnails, and a
thumbnail page for gif/jpeg/png, and has all sorts of options.
