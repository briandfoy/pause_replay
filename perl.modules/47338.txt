Subject: Module submission Math::Sparse::Vector

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Sparse::Vector
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Sparse Vector Operations in Perl
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nlp at umd mailing list,

  similar:
    Sparse Sparse::Vector

  rationale:

    The module Math::Sparse::Vector is the successor to Sparse and
    Sparse::Vector. In effect we are simply renaming these modules as
    Math::Sparse::Vector, and will move the code to this name space and
    gradually remove Sparse and Sparse::Vector. We realize now that the
    naming of Sparse and Sparse::Vector was inappropriate, and would
    like to clean that up.

    The other reason for wishing to create Math::Sparse::Vector is to
    then introduce a module Math::Sparse::Matrix, that will include
    sparse matrix operations in Perl. The vector operations currently
    supported in Sparse are limited to adding vectors, finding dot
    products, etc. In Math::Sparse::Matrix we will include functionality
    for operations like matrix transpose operations, that will be built
    using methods that will (as appropriate) be provided in
    Math::Sparse::Vector.

The resulting entry would be:
