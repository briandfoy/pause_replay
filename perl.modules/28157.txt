The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

    Template

  rationale:

    PORE (Perl Object Rendering Engine) is a general-purpose template
    rendering engine. Many other templating systems, such as
    Text::Templar, Text::Template, Template Toolkit, etc., are complex
    and slow. PORE is a very light, very fast and does not require any
    other Perl modules. PORE uses byacc and therefore is easy to extend
    and maintain.

    Parallel to the idea of JSP and PHP, PORE was designed to separate
    data from presentation. The data is encapsulated in PORE objects,
    like Java Beans. The presentation is represented by PORE template
    files, like JSP files. PORE consists of a templating language that
    is a set of XML tags and a rendering engine that parses templates
    and generates output using specified Perl objects. PORE is suitable
    for any environment where dynamic content needs to be produced based
    on Perl objects.
