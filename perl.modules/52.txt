Does that mean you object to the name 'NameSpace' or not?

		Personally I see no advantage either way, but the same can
be said about

		The two questions I would ask myself are

		1) Would anyone ever sub-class this
		2) Do I want to export functions

		My answers would be no and no, so its makes no real
difference.

		That probably explains why it is under Devel::

		However I think if I were implementing this module (which I
am not)
		I probably would have not chosen OO but

		  $ns = ns_find($package);
		  ns_set($ns, $name, 'CODE', $value);
		  ns_get($ns, $name, 'CODE');

		where $ns would have actually been a reference to the
package hash.
