The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Highlight
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: a flexible text/code/syntax highlighter
  userid:      ICRF (Andrew Flerchinger)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    module-authors

  similar:
    Syntax::Highlight::Universal Parse::Syntax Log::Colorize

  rationale:

    Per discussion on module-authors at the end of November 2003 (yes,
    I've been sitting on this for awhile), we didn't want to extend the
    Syntax:: namespace, because at that time, it only contained
    Syntax::Highlight::Perl. It's grown a little since then, but I still
    believe in the Text::Highlight namespace.

    Syntax::Highlight::Universal looks pretty new, like within the last
    six months, but it also looks like it depends on outside tools, and
    at the very least, a C/C++ compiler. This module is pure-perl, and
    while not as robust in it's current state, I did spend a deal of
    time benchmarking to keep it fast, since it's designed use was via
    cgi.

    Parse::Syntax is unimplemented, and its name implies more intimate
    knowledge of the syntax than I think is neccessary for most
    highlighting.

    Text::Highlight could probably do much of the same highlighting
    that Log::Colorize does, but is more closely designed for code. At
    the very least, it can provide a common, customizable interface to
    different highlighting requirements.

    I've included a wrapper around HTML::SyntaxHighlighter since that
    works around a limitation of my parsing method. I have plans to add
    wrapper modules to utilize the more precise parsing of the other
    Syntax::Highlight:: modules, as well.

    I left "Syntax" out of the requested namespace because the module
    could be easily user-extended to highlight something other than
    syntax in code.

    A sourceforge project has been set up for it (texthighlight). I've
    also been in contact with fellow cpan member Enrico Sorcinelli who
    has been contributing.

The resulting entry would be:
