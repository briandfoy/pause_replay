I would like to register myself as a developer on CPAN.

> Description of what you're planning to contribute:

I have written a module I call GoodPing.pm that pings a host and in
scalar context it returns whether or not it was successful.  It
returns the actual ping output in list context.  Net::Ping doesn't do
this right.  As outlined in the Ram book, it sometimes fails even when
the host is alive.  That's why I wrote this.

I haven't really discussed this one publicly.  Just with one friend who
tested it in Unix for me, I think.  This was just something I whipped up
because I needed something that worked and I found that an existing
module doesn't.  I'd rather not try to fix the existing one because this
already works and I don't know much about the other, other than what the
Ram book says, and what I've seen from testing it.

Would posting it to Perl-Win32-Users help?  Or comp.lang.perl.modules?
In any event, thanks for your consideration.
