The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Record::Cleanser
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Normalize text based records
  userid:      KIMRYAN (Kim Ryan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    A standard part of the data loading and transforming process is to
    clean records so they conform to a standard defined by the user.
    Utilities currently exist to do just this in several database and
    data warehousing products.

    The cleaning process can be applied to one or more fields, within a
    record.

    Types of cleaning operations that can be applied to fields include:
    - stripping whitespace and unprintable characters - case conversions
    - numeric conversions - conforming to a data type, such as all alpha
    or all numeric - conforming to a standard abberivation, such as New
    York => NY Text records will typically be in CSV or fixed width
    format, but a record could also span several lines.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::Record::
::Cleanser        idpOp Normalize text based records                 KIMRYAN
