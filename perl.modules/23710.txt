I've got a script and some supporting classes for converting POD-enabled
Perl into fake C++ that doxygen (an open-source documentation producer) can
handle.  I currently have the classes named doxy::???.  I don't see a
top-level Doc:: (or similar) namespace.  Is doxy:: unique enough?  Is there
a better place to put this stuff?

Note that the classes aren't really useful without a top-level script, which
is part of what I hope to submit.  The directory structure currently looks
like:

	doxyfilt.pl
	doxy/
	  Filter.pm			doxy::Filter
	  Item.pm			doxy::Item
	  Item/
	    Class.pm		doxy::Item::Class
	    File.pm			doxy::Item::File
	    Function.pm		doxy::Item::Function
	  POD/
	    Filter.pm		doxy::POD::Filter
	    Item.pm			doxy::POD::Item

So...can I create a top-level namespace named doxy (lowercase used to follow
doxygen spelling)?  Or is there a better place?
