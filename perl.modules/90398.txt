     why:

    I have written a simple but IMHO useful module to create and track
    "background" processes. This works on Unix (using standard
    fork()/execs()) and Windows (using Win32::Process plus Win32::Job, I
    need "Process" to create a "background" process, and "Job" to
    control it).

    The new feature is that this module keeps the information about the
    started processes in a persistent directory, so the processes can be
    tracked from "third party" programs, not only the parent process.

    This is very "straight forward", but still I think it's nice. It
    also adds some convenient unix #!-magic to windows.

    I'd like to make this available to the public.

    Best regards, Michael
