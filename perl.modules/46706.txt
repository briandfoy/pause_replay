There are two ways to reach maintainership status:
registration/approval and simple upload of a module in a namespace
that is not yet taken on a first-come-first-serve basis.

On CPAN you find two files:

  411682 Jan  3 21:10 02packages.details.txt.gz
  110183 Jan  3 19:49 03modlist.data.gz

As you say, 03xxx contains namespaces that have been registered and
went through some discussion of namespace issues and they have a
description line and a DSLIP entry (metadata about Development status,
Support level, Language used, Interface style, Public License). It
contains evensome namespaces that have been registered in advance and
that have never lead to a released module.

In addition, there is 02xxx that contains actual uploads where
registered and non-registered namespaces are mixed together.

In CPAN.pm you find both file contents merged. You can tell the
difference by watching if there is a description line and a DSLIP
entry.

Hope that helps,
