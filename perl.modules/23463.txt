Cool.

Seems like nulls and zeros are not distinguished well. For example:
    remove_zeroes
            Remove from the record set all the columns where all
            values are zero or NULL.
Nulls and zeros are not always so interchangable. And I don't see any
examples in the docs where missing data appears as blank cells but
zeros appear as zeros.

Also, I think the formating of the output table should be delegated
to a separate module. There are several on CPAN already. If none
do the 'straddled' rows and columns you feature then perhaps you
could extend one of them or extract your formatting code into a new
modules.

It generates and executes queries via the DBI and is fairly abstract
in nature (not application specific) so DBIx::* seems fine to me.

Would be good to indicate the server-side nature of the module though.
So perhaps something like DBIx::ServerXtab or DBIx::SQLCrossTab.
