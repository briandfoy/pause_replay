Hi!


I wrote the following beginning of december, got successfully registered =
as
PFEIFFER, but nothing else happened, despite an unanswered mail asking ab=
out
the progress.  What's up?


Now that it's reached a good level with version 0.5, I think it's time to=
 have
iPerl be listed in CPAN.  You need not keep the source, since I have my o=
wn
download area, which I'll be keeping up-to-date.


Inverse Perl means instead of having long strings in short Perl code, rat=
her
having a big string (the document), and dispersing the Perl code in it.


What I submit are essentially three files, a module that does almost
everything Text::iPerl, a commandline-interface iperl (just a getopts
frontend), and a cgi-frontend web-iperl.


I do not see this in the File:: or IO:: trees, because it is hardly conce=
rned
with where the processed document comes from.  Nor in the Filter:: tree,
though in the wide Unix sense of the word it is a filter.  Nor in the Par=
se::
tree because more than only a parser it defines a Perl based language tha=
t
resides in arbitrary text documents.
