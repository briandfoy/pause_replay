The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TaskForest
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Text-file-based job scheduler
  userid:      ENOOR (Aijaz Ansari)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/taskforest

  similar:
    Schedule::Advisory

  rationale:

    I wrote this software because I needed a simple way to schedule and
    chain jobs on Linux servers that host applications for schools and
    not-for-profit organizations. Most of the work maintaining these
    servers is done by volunteers who have a basic amount of familiarity
    with Linux and its shells and editors. I couldn't find anything that
    met my needs on the common open-source repositories.

    The goal was to make something simple enough that one didn't *need*
    to know, for example, how to generate valid XML, or even what XML
    is, in order to create complex job dependencies. The key was to
    understand that I was working with intelligent individuals, and that
    they just happened to be educated in a different discipline than I
    am. This is why I chose a text-file based format for representing
    job details, as opposed to what would really be cool - a design
    environment like Yahoo's Pipes that would allow you to draw graphs
    on the web, linking nodes to represent dependencies.

    Another key design factor was that the program would have to be
    very fault tolerant and rely as little as possible on external
    systems like database servers and messaging systems. I pictured this
    working on a individual headless boxes hosted at an ISP, to which we
    connected via ssh. It was not reasonable to assume that the boxes
    would necessarily have Apache or PostgreSQL installed.

    I chose the name TaskForest because the code allows you to specify
    multiple job dependency trees in a single file. These forests of
    task trees share certain characteristics, such a default start time,
    days of the week on which they run, etc. I think this namespace
    articulates the high level design model espoused by this code.

The resulting entry would be:

TaskForest        RdpOa Text-file-based job scheduler                ENOOR
