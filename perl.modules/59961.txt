Hello,

As per the situation with the Perl 6 community where they are only wanting 
the language to be called Perl, and the multiple implementations to be 
called other things, such as Rakudo or Pugs, ...

I would like to have similar differences in names for my Muldis D language 
and its implementations.

Right now, the language spec is on CPAN under the package name Muldis::D 
which is the same as its normal name but for the colons.  I'm fairly stuck 
on keeping this name.

My reference implementation for the language is currently called Muldis::DB 
and that name looks too similar, so I'm looking to rename that.

I still want to brand all my own large projects into the Muldis:: 
namespace, so the new name should be there and should consist of one other 
word or acronym.

I've had a brief discussion with David Wheeler, who suggested I returned to 
the past and used Muldis::Rosetta, and I agreed that that looked like a 
good idea.

I'm now soliciting your opinions on whether you like Muldis::Rosetta over 
Muldis::DB, and/or what third alternatives you may suggest.

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
