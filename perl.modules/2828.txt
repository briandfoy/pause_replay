a description of what you're planning to contribute:
----------------------------------------------------
I'd like to start with a package (building on LWP) to search various
phone directories, returning names/addresses/numbers/etc.

This might be similar to the "Finance-quote" package.

I've only got my alpha version working and tested on two platforms
(unix and win98).  So I still need to work on robustness and
documentation.  Also, I am still researching the interest level for
this particular module.  However, if it doesn't turn out to be
"desired" I still have other packages that I am developing for CPAN.


Respectfully,


Daniel Sherer
