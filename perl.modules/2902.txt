Hi Srohit,

I too have been writing Perl code for handling Spice related stuff,
and requested permission to upload it to CPAN
(http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-09/msg00107.html)

I tried finding other interested people last week, but got no feedback,
and now you fall out of heaven like a deus ex machina! Sure you'll
understand I am interested in what you want to do. Do you want to start
a private discussion with me on that?

Wim

PS: BTW, I already have one remark about your module: I don't think
    Spice is a good name. You should at least move it out of the global
    namespace and rename it to EDA::Spice or something alike. Even better
    would be to use Text::Spice, Number::Spice, ... depending on your aims.
    But there you come into a conflict with my code, of course :)
