We have a module we've written that talks to our local voicemail server
(running a commercial package called 'CallXpress').  Currently the
module is called:
	VoiceMail::CallXpress

There is no 'VoiceMail' or similar hierarchy at present.  The closest
suitable hierarchy would appear to be 'Net' (this is where 'SMS'
messaging has gone, for example).  Some other namespaces that may work
are:

Existing namespaces:
* Mail (possibly not intuitive :-)
* Audio (possibly not intuitive :-)

Possibly better generic namespaces:
* Telephony
* Phone
* Voice

Any opinions on which would be best?

Also (having read the man page for 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker'), is there any
documentation on _how_ to use h2xs to generate a good Makefile.PL
(i.e.  including all the good stuff CPAN modules have in this file,
e.g. default install dirs).

Thanks!
Nate
