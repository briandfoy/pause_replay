The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Thread::RWLock
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: rwlock implementation for perl threads
  userid:      AFERBER (Andreas Ferber)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Thread::Semaphore

  rationale:

    Thread::RWLock is similar to a semaphore but distinguishes between
    readers and writers. One writer xor many readers may held the lock
    simultaneously.

    RWLock is a common name for this kind of lock, and it applies to
    multithreaded (perl-5.005-threads) programs, so I think it should be
    named just the way it is.

  enteredby:   AFERBER (Andreas Ferber)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 29 02:28:33 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Thread::
::RWLock          RdpOp rwlock implementation for perl threads       AFERBER
