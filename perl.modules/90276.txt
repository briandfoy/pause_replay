The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTCondor::Queue::Parser
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Provides a better API to condor_q -l -xml
  userid:      SAMIRCURY (Samir Cury Siqueira)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    Discussed in modules@perl.org. Brian D Foy suggested this name.

  similar:

  rationale:

    I didn't want to create a new namespace just under root myself, but
    that was suggested by people at modules@perl.org

    Brian's reasoning made sense to me :

    "That sounds like a good name to me. It puts Condor related stuff
    under a top-level name that users care about. Matt suggested
    Parse::, but I've never fancied that top-level. It inverts the
    important bits and makes people look in the middle of the name to
    see why they are using it."

    If you would like to see the full history, the first email was
    "Help in module naming" from eu@samircury.eng.br at "Sun, May 20,
    2012"

    Unfortunaly since then, only now I had free time to release
    something decent for the public. But now it can be out there safely.

    Ah, HTCondor is the new name of the original project :

    http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/

    Thanks, Samir
