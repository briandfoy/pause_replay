Subject: Module submission Lexical::Persistence

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lexical::Persistence
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Bind lexicals to persistent data.
  userid:      RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org #poe

  similar:
    Catalyst::Controller::BindLex

  rationale:

    I was developing a similar feature for POE::Stage when Matt Trout
    showed me Catalyst::Controller::BindLex. I thought it was a fine (if
    somewhat experimental) idea, and one that could be generically
    implemented. Lexical::Persistence implements the pattern, hopefully
    in a way that can be generally useful.

    I chose Lexical::Persistence because there's already a
    Lexical::Typeglob, and the Persistence:: top-level namespace is
    primarily for database-backed persistence. Lexical::Persistence can
    be extended to support database backing, but it doesn't provide that
    by default.

  enteredby:   RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov 14 08:47:02 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lexical::
::Persistence     bdphp Bind lexicals to persistent data.            RCAPUTO
