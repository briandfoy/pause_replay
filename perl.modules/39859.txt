Hello,

I've got a module that allows querying of RDF databases (current 
version[1]), and intend on uploading it to CPAN. The module allows 
queries in multiple languages (RDQL[2] and SPARQL[3]), and can use 
various backend databases (currently RDF::Redland and RDF::Core). I 
have tentatively named the module RDF::Query, with supporting classes 
in RDF::Query::* (::Model, ::Parser), and was hoping for comment on the 
appropriateness of this name.

I see existing work in this area has been discussed on the list 
previously for TripleStore [4]. TripleStore doesn't appear to have 
changed names, or even updated since that email was sent, however, and 
fails to address the querying needs of RDF.

thanks,
.greg
