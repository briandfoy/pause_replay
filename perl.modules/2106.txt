Hi, I'd like to register as a developer.

Name: Mariana Alvaro
Email: mariana@alvaro.com.ar
Preferred user id:  MALVARO

I'm developping some modules for coping with the differences that exists in
each WML browser. In my last project I learnt that although evry device is
WML 1.1 compliant the same wml code it's not seen the same way in one
phone/wap browser.
So I developped some modules which generate WML decks and cards in the best
format suited for the user agent received, Therefore the programmer should
not worry about it. The proyect is opened to add as many devices as wished.

DSLI: cdpO
44 Desc: WML Cards, Deck generator. WML code adjusts according the device
used.

I've read some modules are being developped to convert WML, for basic WML
functions, but none dealing  with the incompatibility issues.

Hope it helps...
Mariana
