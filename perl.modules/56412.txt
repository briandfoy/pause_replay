From: ido@cs.uchicago.edu (Ido Rosen)

I received a message about "Old namespace registration" for  
Crypt::ProtectedString.

I'd like to keep this namespace.  I have uploaded a module by this name.

It's a method for keeping sensitive data private while also offering  
a "display" version, and offers many of the traditionally useful  
manipulations for storage of credit card numbers.

See this link:

http://search.cpan.org/~ido/Crypt-ProtectedString-0.00_01/lib/Crypt/ 
ProtectedString.pm

The module may be an initial upload/import, but it is functional.  It  
is also well documented.  It's meant to be a framework where users  
actually write their own plugin for the specific type of sensitive  
data they wish to use in their database or storage media.

Thank you,
