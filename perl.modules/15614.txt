The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::Maketext::Fuzzy
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Maketext from already interpolated strings
  userid:      AUTRIJUS (☺唐宗漢☻)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    perl-i18n, tpc6, rt-devel

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is a subclass of "Locale::Maketext", with additional
    support for localizing messages that already contains interpolated
    variables. This is most useful when the messages are returned by
    external modules -- for example, to match "dir: command not found"
    against "[_1]: comand not found".

    With this module, Locale::Maketext users can avoid the terse forms
    and have the correct plural (and other grammatical variation) forms
    figured out automatically.

  enteredby:   AUTRIJUS (☺唐宗漢☻)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov 29 23:03:06 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Locale::Maketext::
::Fuzzy           bdpOp Maketext from already interpolated strings   AUTRIJUS
