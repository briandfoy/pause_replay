The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Salesforce
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A simple to use interface to Salesforce.com
  userid:      CAPOEIRAB (Chase Whitener)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    An API for Salesforce.com was written by Byrne Reese, the
    maintainer of SOAP::Lite. I have extended this API to include
    simpler ways of obtaining data from your Salesforce.com accounts.

    Byrne Reese has not published his Salesforce module to CPAN. I want
    to see what I can do about getting him to publish it to CPAN, having
    the Salesforce namespace created and having the module updated and
    made easier to use.

    Thanks
