Current plan of order of tasks:
- finish current task (SQL::Statement / DBI-bundled Pure-Perl-DBD's)
- Proc::ProcessTable code merge from current $work on libstatgrab
  (make it thread-safe, all fields available on all OS, ...)
- List::MoreUtils (first (re)write tests to cover leak-test, then fix
  and go on business as usual)

The meanwhile deleted releases had other issues - all XS related.

From my point of view, nothing beyond 0.22 didn't work for real.
I hope I get P::PT managed this year, but could require some weeks
at start of 2011.

So you have a rough time line. I suggest you don't try to fix the
leaks without tests :)
