The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences::Joins
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: Wishart-Hirshfeld test of sequences
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil

  similar:
    Statistics::Sequences::Turns Statistics::Sequences::Runs

  rationale:

    Superficially, this test is very similar to the Runs Test. A join
    is a point in a sequence of dichotomous data where the values
    alternate. For example, in the following series

    0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0

    there is a join (of the values 0 and 1) at the indices of 1 and 2,
    then immediately another join (of the values 1 to 0) at 2 and 3, and
    then another join at 5 and 6. (Continuing, there are eight joins in
    total in this series.) The only difference between joins and runs,
    then, is that joins are counted at the point of alternation, whereas
    runs are counted for each unique segment (between the alternations).
    So joins will always be at least 1 less the number of runs.

    The test-statistics, however, differ more fundamentally. Runs are
    tested on the basis of the observed distribution (e.g., of hits and
    misses), whereas joins are tested on the basis of a theoretically
    expected distribution.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Sequences::
