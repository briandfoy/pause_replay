Fyi, last night I uploaded WWW::Honeypot::httpBL and deleted WWW::httpBL =
via PAUSE.  I think that should take care of this.  If I'm missing =
something please let me know.

Thanks for your feedback and have a great weekend!

Yes, I think you're right.  I considered that, waffled mainly because =
"Honeypot" didn't seem to uniquely identify the API provider and =
"ProjectHoneyPot" seemed too long.  I've always had lumper/splitter =
issues and now I regret my choice.  I want to clarify who's API I'm =
wrapping with the module name.

I find myself looking for an "on the re-naming of modules" PAUSE page.  =
It's easy enough to change the code, but I'm not yet sure how to =
deprecate the distribution I've created and replace it with a new one.  =
I'm looking into that, but if you have any suggestions I'd appreciate =
it.  Thanks.

Since it comes from Honeypot, shouldn't that be in the name? Perhaps
WWW::Honeypot::httpBL?
