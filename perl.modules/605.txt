    I would like to know a few thing from you,
I'm a asp programmer working in India.
Recently i started to learn CGI/Perl.
         But i don't know how to do database program with CGI/PERL.

I know two things, 
     first we want a DBI module to connect database 
and second is we want a DBD driver installed in server.These things i learned from perl.com.
But problem is, the explanations which given thier is confussing me.

 
my problem is:
     i would like to do some database program with MSAccess.       
   how can i do it?
i have some space in unix server.
how can i install DBI module and DBD driver to the server(i mean uploading this to the server)?

Can you give me an answer sir?,
How can i start to do database programming with CGI/PERL?
i hope you will encourage a new comer like me.
           Thanking you!
