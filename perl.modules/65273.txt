The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::Statistics
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Calculates common stats for social networks
  userid:      EMORISSE (Erich Morisse)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    Determining a namespace was difficult. The functions do not seem to
    fit into traditional Statistics; Network is focused on
    IP/connections; so Graph is the closest.

    The difficulty with Graph is the proposed module does not utilize
    the Graph.pm functionality (too slow). Although I plan to add that
    in as an option.

  enteredby:   EMORISSE (Erich Morisse)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr  3 22:14:15 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::Statistics      adpfp Calculates common stats for social networks  EMORISSE
