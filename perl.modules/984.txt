Ran this by the list perhaps six months ago, with nary a reply. So here
goes again.

I have written a Perl interface to the CFITSIO subroutine library. CFITSIO
is a C library for reading and writing of FITS images, used primarily in
astronomy. See http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio for more information.
I am requesting the 'CFITSIO' namespace in the CPAN module list.

Recently I finished a Perl interface to the BLADE web development
environment. See http://www.thestuff.net/bob/projects/blade for more
information. I would like to have the 'BLADE' namespace for this
module.

Thanks for your consideration,
-Pete Ratzlaff <pratzlaff@cfa.harvard.edu>
