Accessor methods, custom packages, relationships, joins,=20
group_by, ->next, ->single and more...

Also, DBIx::ResultSet is clearly not an ORM.

I contacted the DBIx::ResultSet maintainer last year and sent=20
him a long e-mail with ideas and patches for new features. I got=20
no answer.
After a couple months, I tried again. Still no answer.
Then I tried again. And no answer.

After waiting for a bunch of months, I decided I had tried=20
enough and it was time to design something different (this time=20
an ORM) and put my ideas there since I wasn't able to contribute=20
them to the said existing module.

I hope this answers your questions. :)
