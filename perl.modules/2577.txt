Hi!

As per FAQ recommendation :) - "is there anybody who reads this
list?"

Seriously:

name:     Andrew Maltsev
email:    am@amsoft.ru
url:      http://amsoft.ru/
user id:  AMALTSEV
plans:    I'm planning to put perl interface to APPGEN database to
          CPAN. Probably I'll also make some kind of OO wrapper for this
          interface later.
	  Time permitting I'm also planning to add some modules
	  for e-commerce from time to time - we're working on open
	  source e-commerce suite here :)

I would also like your opinion on DB::Appgen as a module name. It
seems that it fits well into current namespace, but if you have
better ideas I'm all ears.

Thanx for your quick response! :)

Andrew.
