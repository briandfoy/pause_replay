Yeah, that's what I was sorta thinking.  I just hate to screw with that
damned ontology axis.  But I see three votes for MP3::, so I would not be
opposed to changing MPEG::MP3Info to MP3::Info.  Please advise me on how
this should be handled; it is a fairly well-used module, and such a change
will surely cause confusion and pain.
