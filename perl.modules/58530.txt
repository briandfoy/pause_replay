The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Server::AsyncEndpoint
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Asynchronous Endpoint Server for EAI
  userid:      AIMASS (Alejandro Imass)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://www.p2ee.org

  similar:
    POE::Component::MessageQueue POE::Component::Client::Stomp

  rationale:

    The POE::Component::Server::AsyncEndpoint is a high-level
    conglomerate of several already existing POE components, servers and
    other CPAN modules. It implements a design pattern called "Endpoint"
    based on the specialization of the ChannelAdapter concept coined in
    the book "Enterprise Integration Patterns" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby
    Wolf. The idea behind this module is to make it very simple and
    straightforward for companies to develop Asynchronous Outbound
    WebServices implemented in SOAP (or any other WS technology) with a
    very flexible and powerful architecture. It is not an Enterprise
    Service Bus technology, on the contrary, it supports the idea that
    the so-called ESB should be pushed to the endpoints, enabling a
    completely distributed Service Oriented Architecture. Ultimately,
    this module will try to attract EAI programmers into using
    Perl-based EAI, instead of the more popular Java-based projects like
    MuleESB and Apache Camel (ActiveMQ).

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Server::
::AsyncEndpoint   bdpOp Asynchronous Endpoint Server for EAI         AIMASS
