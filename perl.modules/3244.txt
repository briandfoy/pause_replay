Hi all,

I would believe the time has come to fold back the separate module
lists for Apache, Tk, and XML into the main module list. Software on
PAUSE is now a tad batter than it was at the time we went separate
ways. (I would not suggest a change otherwise.)

Would anybody object if I just started to do the folding now? Of
course, all of you will get the required privileges to maintain the
modulelist via PAUSE as far as possible. This should already work if
you try now as I added Jonathan and Achim to group "modmaint" and all
admins can invoke it anyway. (((((((((Hint, hint))))))))

Recap why: The advantage for the users would be a consistent look at
modules information (e.g. information accessible also from CPAN.pm),
and a single point of getting at it (THE module list). The advantage
for authors would be a single point of applying for registration and a
software that handles their information mostly automatically,
especially allows editing without human intervention. The advantage
for both would be having to deal with less typos and inconsitencies.
One advantage for maintainers would be to join their forces in
handling THE module list, another advantage could be that we find a
way to have more specialized modulelist pumpkings in the future (if we
succeed in providing the right software).

The most interesting improvement for us maintainers is the tiny new
module CPAN::Admin that comes with the current CPAN.pm in
A/AN/ANDK/CPAN-1.58_55.tar.gz. Please, give it a try with

    perl -MCPAN::Admin -e 'shell'

You get an additional command on the shell, called "register", and
this does a couple of things for you that seem to me very nice and
useful, but of course, your milage may vary. Feedback welcome, please
ask if you need further instruction on usage.

Cheers,
