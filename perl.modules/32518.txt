I'm not going to bore you with hype or games. This
is simply the best email list you will ever, ever
buy.  This is a database of over 8 million
users of the BIGGEST online provider. You know
which one!!  This list contaims FULL DATABASE DUMPS
including first name, last name, and address info ..
so you can send customized emails that "appear" to
be opt-in!  Your response rate will be INCREDIBLE
from this list .. the database was verified at 100%
three months ago and now is about 75% deliverable.
I am willing to sell the list in whole or in parts.
$2000 for the entire 8 million names, or $300 per
million. I am only selling this list because I am 
having a lot of trouble getting mail into this domain.
If you can get the mail through, you will make a TON OF
MONEY with this list!  YOU WILL NOT FIND A BETTER LIST
OUT THERE!

To purchase, contact me on AIM as DrOptagon or
email me at mark@standardservice.net

DO NOT respond to this email.

Thanks - Mark
