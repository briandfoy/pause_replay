planning to contribute:
  set of modules for interfacing with J-Pilot <http://jpilot.linuxave.net>
  also any tools I have to develop for divining its binary file format :-)
  I anticipate putting the J-Pilot modules in Palm::JPilot::* or JPilot::*
  although obviously this will be discussed when I am ready to upload -
  I hope to have something ready by the beginning of November.

these have been discussed with the author of J-Pilot but there is no
mailing list available yet.  Some of the tools for binary file twiddling
have been discussed briefly with a few of the london.pm crowd.
