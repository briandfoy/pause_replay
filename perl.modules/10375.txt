Hi.  I'd like to get a CPAN ID.  Here's my info.

name:		Don Badrak
email:		dbadrak@census.gov
userid:		DBADRAK

contribution:

I've written some modules dules for dealing with Cisco IP Phones, called
Cisco::IPPhone.  They are for writing applications that return appropriate
XML to the phone.  I've written four of the six XML data types: Menu,
Input, Directory, Text.  The two not written are Image and GraphicMenu.  I
am working on those now.  I also have a sample application (LDAP directory
search).

Don
