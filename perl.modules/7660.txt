Silly boy! :P

I believe the usual method is for you to fill in another author ID
registration on PAUSE, we'll set it up, then you re-upload your stuff to
the new account, and/or reassign ownership if they're registered
modules, and delete the files in the old author directory.  Then you
tell everyone about the new one, and the old one just sits there and
gathers dust until the last trump.

Oh, I'm sure we can figure something out :)

Fill in the author ID request again, and make a note so we remember that
it's you.
