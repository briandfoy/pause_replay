Ingy has given you co-maintainership of

Inline
Inline::C
Inline::C::ParseRecDescent
Inline::C::ParseRegExp
Inline::C::grammar

However the distribution has other modules you will also need co- 
maintainership of

Inline::Foo
Inline::MakeMaker
Inline::denter
Math::Simple

Which I have added.

You upload to your own directory. As you have co-maintainership of all  
modules inside it will not show as UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE
