It is not enough to do your best; you must know what to do, and THEN do your best.	W. Edwards Deming	
Do the right thing. It will gratify some people and astonish the rest.	-Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)

THE PARENT arrived back on the scene. She gave me a tape by Dr. Laura Meyers from UCLA. I listened to that tape eight times. I listened over and over and heard the same thing again and again. Ms. Meyers said, 'These kids may need to hear a word many times (perhaps 72 times) before they ever say a word. A computer can be patient and say it the same way every time.' Now I understood. I was not patient enough. I did not allow the student to hear the words over and over. I was interrupting their learning by interjecting, when they were totally engrossed in what they were doing. I was asking questions they were not ready to answer. They were just learning language. They didn't have the answers yet.
Minds are like parachutes. They only function when they are open.	-Sir James Dewar, Scientist (1877-1925)	

6 Is the manager missing walking?
Did Alfred's niece like playing well? They have loved dancing.

Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.	 
Whenever you find you are on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.	-Mark Twain [Samuel Langhornne Clemens] (1835-1910)	
If a million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.	-Anatole France [Jacques Anatole Thibault] (1844-1924)	
When all think alike, no one is thinking very much.	-Walter Lippmann (1889-1974)
