OK, in short:

1) difficult to configure
2) poor email integration
3) unattractive and unusable user interface
4) the code's a mess, hard to work with if you want to change stuff

The worst part, though, is the poor email integration.  I don't think
it's much good for auto-generating bugs in response to email to a set of
specified addresses, and it's hard to update a bug by email.  

Imagine having to manually open a bug for each request that came into
modules@perl.org, by pointy-clicking in this nasty web interface.  Then
imagine deciding that you wanted to automate it and hook it into PAUSE,
but it turned out to be a scary collection of random Perl scripts with
no consistent database interface or anything.

Just don't go there.

I recommend RT2, the main benefits of which are:

a) good email integration
b) clean underlying code in OO Perl
c) the author is a Perl community type, hangs out on #perl, and will
offer good support.  There's also a strong RT user community among the
#perl crowd.
