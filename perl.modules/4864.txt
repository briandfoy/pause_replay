I am QUITE amenable to "FameHLI::API" since, as you point out, more modules
are likely to be added, albeit by the small incestuous community of FAME
programmers (including me).

The "Fame::*" namespace is already in use with "Fame::HLI", "Fame::LANG" and
"Fame::<something else>" by TRIAS.

The actual Fame product which I am porting is called the "Fame C-HLI".  It
seems that the "Fame" language was written by a bunch of economatricians and
(10 to 20 years ago) "API" wasn't as 'in vogue' as it is now (at least with
their crowd).

Any XS API module tends to spawn purp-perl module built over it.
I think a Fame::* (or better still FameHLI::*) category should be added
to provide a natrual home for those. Your module could be FameHLI::API
or similar.
