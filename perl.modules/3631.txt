I have uploaded MCrypt-0.9.tar.gz to my PAUSE account.

I have gone ahead and named my module MCrypt instead of Crypt::MCrypt.  I believe MCrypt makes more sense because of the hodge-podge of crypto modules under Crypt.  MCrypt implements most, if not all of the crypto algorithms listed as separate modules under the Crypt:: packagename.

If people have trouble finding this module, I will change the name.

This is my first release.  Constructive criticism welcome :)

cheers,

This depends on the search backend people are using. When there are
already 45 perfect matches in a search for crypt, a search interface
might cut the list of put you on page 3 of the results.

Nonono, we are here to help not to dictate, really. MCrypt does not
suck and does not break rules, but Crypt::MCrypt makes more sense to
me.
