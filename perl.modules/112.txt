I am not reading the mailing list archives, because I am assuming that
anything relevant to my modules will actually be sent to me.

The only thing in 04pause.html is that I should "talk to modules@perl.org
before you decide on the namespace you're going to use". I do not really
believe that it literally means that now that I have talked to the list I
can decide to use whatever namespace I want. I rather get the impression
that modules@perl.org will be doing the deciding. There are no indications
as to how that deciding happens, or how long I should expect it to take. And
of course, there is no indication at all as to who is on the list, or what
roles they play.

I am not complaining that it "takes too long".. just that I have no idea how
long it will take, and it has already taken longer than I had presumed it
would.

		Ouch. So it seems. It seems you're right. I believe both Tim
and I
		have been following this thread on modules@perl.org with too
little
		attention. Sorry for that.

		It's documented how it works, please read
CPAN/modules/04pause.html
		and the archives at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/

		Yes, that is unfortunate, but on the other hand there were
times when
		it worked good and times when it didn't work at all. My
excuse is that
		I have started rewriting PAUSE from scratch knowing about
the
		shortcomings and I believe with the new engine we have a
chance to
		dedicate more time to true namespace monitoring. As things
are right
		now, I'll be done with the PAUSE relaunch by the ned of the
year. Stay
		tuned.

		The archives are open to everybody, the mailing list isn't.
We want to
		have a closed list to do our work, because we believe we do
not need
		yet another mailing list but we need a working environment
but we want
		to have an open archive about what we are doing. Some people
like to
		read the mailing list archives and chime in at random points
in time.
		Should we discourage that?

		Good point.
