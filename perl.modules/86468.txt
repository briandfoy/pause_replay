Hello everyone,

  I'm working on a Perl module project that aims to offer descriptive
statistical functions without keeping the whole dataset in memory, at
the cost of certain precision loss. It does so by sorting raw data into
logarithmic buckets, and analyzing bucket counts later. The interface
follows that of Statistics::Descriptive::Full as close as possible. 

  However, I'm not completely sure how to name it. My current idea is
Statistics::Approx::LogScale. Does it count as descriptive, unambiguous
name?

  I was thinking of Statistics::Descriptive::Approximate initially, but
it's already too long, and there may be other algorithms (e.g.
probabilistic resampling) meaning even more ::'s.

  The current project name is Statistics::Approx::Bucket, but it looks
like LogScale is better. Or isn't it? 

  Just in case, the project page is
https://github.com/dallaylaen/perl-Statistics-Approx-Bucket

  Thanks in advance!
