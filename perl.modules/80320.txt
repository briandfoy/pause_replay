Hi all,

Rob Hoelz has written this blogs.perl.org post about his willingness to
contribute to Inline::Lua by contacting the original author :

http://blogs.perl.org/users/hoelzro/2012/04/still-alive-inlinelua.html

Quoting from it:

[QUOTE] 

I was reading about the Inline module the other day, so naturally I looked to see if there was a binding for one of my other favorite languages, Lua. Sure enough, Inline::Lua exists; however, it has not seen a new release in nearly five years, and it doesn't even build on perls newer than 5.10. I like this idea enough that I'd like to put some time into it and cut a new release; however, I haven't been able to reach the author. So, in accordance with the guidelines I read in the CPAN FAQ, I'm making a post asking if the original author, Tassilo von Parseval, is still in the Perl community and interested in updating this module.

[/QUOTE]

There's also a useful comment by Joel Berger with some leads.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
