Hi Steffen,

co-maintainership

mailing list is a weird thing to carry authority. :)

Ah, that's the right label to use then? I've referred to you as the =
Modules Cabal in the past,
but "PAUSE administrators" does sound less like a conspiracy. I'll make =
that change for the next iteration.

>=20
> Well, ideally, I think, an author should be able to do either one (or =
both). Personally, I'm perfectly willing to hand responsibility to the =
PAUSE admins if I'm not reachable/whatever. I would not want to go =
through the effort of marking each of my 150 or so modules.

Good point. I forgot that there are some =FCber-maints, who have more =
dists than I have digits.

We need to think of a good way to handle this. Those using Dist::Zilla =
could set up a global profile,
but we need some other mechanism for tagging your PAUSE profile with =
this...

Maybe instead of just this Covenant, we have a number of Ownership / =
Maintenance statements,
one of which is the one I proposed, but another of which would something =
along the lines of:

	This is my module, I don't want it handing over unless I've =
either
		(a) bestowed (co-)maint using PAUSE
		(b) have explicitly given the PAUSE admins permission to =
bestow it

And by default everyone could be tagged with this. Much as I might wish =
that the default could be
more open, there are clearly people who are more aligned with the above, =
so that would have to
be the default.

Yes, I think that could be one of the ownership statements. I recently =
took over a module where
both previous maints clearly had no interest, but it just took a long =
time to determine that fact :-)

PAUSE.

Absolutely. I'm having a number of offline discussions with various =
people, and one of them is about defining the
right bits of metadata, so metacpan et al can (search | summarise) it.

endorser?

Another good point. Will ponder some more.

thanks,
Neil
