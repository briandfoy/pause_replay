Thanks Andreas.

It appears that ExtUtils::MakeMaker only allows you to turn on and off
META.yml creation. So I'll need to switch to something other than
ExtUtils::MakeMaker or turn off META creation and then modify the yml
file by hand. Let me know if there's an easier route I can take and
still continue to use ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

Thanks,
Tim
