Subject: Module submission NoSQL::PL2SQL

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NoSQL::PL2SQL
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: NoSQL implemen tation to RDB such as MySQL
  userid:      TQISJIM (Jim Schueler)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    pl2sql.tqis.com

  similar:
    DBIx::NoSQL

  rationale:

    I discussed this with the author of DR::Tarantool/MR::Tarantool.
    He, Konstantin Osipov, is promoting NoSQL technology and this root
    level creation is appropriate given his and others' efforts:

    http://2012.nosql-matters.org/cgn/slides/#konstantin_osipov

    I submitted at least one other request on behalf of this module.

    Regarding DBIx::NoSQL: My impression is that this module is still
    in beta. I sent an email to the developer, robertkrimen@gmail.com,
    inquiring about the status and got no response.

    Additionally, DBIx::NoSQL seems to be no more than an
    implementation of DBIx::Class that includes a blob for an embedded
    JSON representation. This solution overcomes a big limitation of
    DBIx::Class, in that every element does not need to be explicitly
    defined. On the other hand, it provides none of the flexibility that
    one would expect from a NoSQL solution.

    I realize that CPAN makes an effort to discourage modules that
    duplicate functionality. But it's inappropriate to universally
    discourage NoSQL implementations on the premise that NoSQL
    essentially duplicates RDB functionality. At that level, the
    decision starts to look like a technology bias.

The resulting entry would be:

NoSQL::
::PL2SQL          bdpOp NoSQL implemen tation to RDB such as MySQL   TQISJIM
