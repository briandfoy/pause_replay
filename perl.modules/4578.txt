I sent a copy of this email this morning, however, I did it from another
email client with another address, I'm not sure if you need them to be
from the email address which we gave in the request.  This email should
fix that.

Your name:
Paul T. Seamons
 
Your email address:
paul@seamons.com
 
Your homepage if you have one:
http://seamons.com/ (under development -- of course)

Your preferred user-ID on CPAN:
RHANDOM

A description of what you're planning to contribute:
Immediate - 
Net::Server - adpO - Extensible (class) oriented internet server
   The first version of the readme may be found at:
     http://seamons.com/Net-Server/pod.html
   (Other efforts have been made in this area-- such as 
   Net::Daemon and NetServer::Generic.  Net::Daemon has
   a fairly good structure, but can not be easily extend to
   use other types, plus all server types are in one module giving
   a certain amount of bloat.  NetServer::Generic is a bit too generic
   but offers a nice prefork method.  Net::Server tries to implement
   the best features from each of these, add multi port mode, add the 
   extensibility of Net::FTPServer, and some concepts from Apache.)

Future - 
Continued development of Net::Server, as well as contribution of other
modules.
 
Open Discussion:
This hasn't been discussed in an open forum, but after speaking with
colleagues and after using the Net::FTPServer (which has a wonderful
class model), we decided it would be wonderful to have an extensible
base class upon which we could build FTP, HTTP, SMPT, banner, POP3,
etc., servers, making especial use of the Net::Server::PreFork sub class
to handle high traffic.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
