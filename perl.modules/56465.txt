AFS::Command is yours alright and I removed it from the todo list. The
reason it was on there is because there is no actual AFS::Command
package in the distribution. (There is a .pod file with documentation
but no code.) Thus it was detected as there not being an implementation.
It's also not directly installable via "cpan AFS::Command" and not
reachable via the link under "Registered Modules" on
http://search.cpan.org/~wpmoore

Whether or not you want to change that is entirely up to you. The
registration is not going away.

Best regards,
Steffen
