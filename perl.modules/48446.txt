     why:

    Current maintainer of an application framework used to manage the
    myriad application landscape of a major banking institution, I would
    like to contribute the non-bank specific components to the Open
    Source community. Approval is still pending; nonetheless I think the
    time is ripe to open up an account on this fantastic tool so many
    like me couldn't live or work without... namely CPAN. An opportunity
    to say thanks to all the devoted maintainers and contributors.
