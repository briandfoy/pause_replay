I searched CPAN and found no such module. I then wrote a module which
defines the vertices, edges and faces for a variety of commonly useful
polyhedra, such as cubes and rhombic dodecahedra. 

The basic data for my module came from someone else's site,
http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/Lynn/Coordinates/coord01.html, and I've
gotten his permission to publish a Perl module based on it. Some eye
candy: Perl + SDL::OpenGL + Math::Polyhedra at work:
http://www.halley.cc/ed/linux/scripts/polyhedra.png

I'm proposing the Math::Polyhedra name, unless someone gives me a good
reason otherwise. The code is almost done; I just need to finish up the
faces() function and touch up the POD. 

Future expansions would be to support a few other figures, but all of
the ones currently supported are defined by phi, the Golden Ratio.
