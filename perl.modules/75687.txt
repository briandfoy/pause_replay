The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FCGI::Daemon
  DSLIP:       adpno
  description: An easy to use FastCGI daemon for nginx
  userid:      ONLYJOB (Dmitry Smirnov)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    FCGI::Spawn

  rationale:

    This is a relatively advanced replacement for
    http://wiki.nginx.org/SimpleCGI which I had to write to overcome its
    limitations.

    FCGI::Daemon allows to easily use CGI scripts with nginx (but not
    limited to).

    FCGI::Daemon's unique features include

    * Proper STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR redirection

    * CGI acceleration by persistent Perl, similar to mod_perl.

    * flexible configuration, including control over RLIMITS.

    * memory leak detection.

    * fallback to traditional 'fcgi-spawn' execution style for non-perl
    scripts.

    * dropping privileges if run as root

    * detection of script executable in path (for compatibility with
    some some CGI apps like fossil)

    Sample LSB Sysv init script included.

    I use it on 3 servers for quite a while already so it might be
    mature enough to be useful for public.

    Thank you for considering this module.

    Regards, Dmitry.

    P.S. It's licensed by GNU AGPL-3 license.
