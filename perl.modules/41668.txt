Hi,

Spirit Quest is a collection of professionals preparing to successfully
survey Giant Squid alive for the very first time.

The only realistic solution to date is our own exclusive and advanced
subsea vehicles, specially developed and ready for these specialised
surveys.

This world event will have huge media coverage and now I am seeking
publishers to join and assist with sponsoring or making agreements as soon
as possible.

Our surveys will discover other creatures of interest and artifacts as the
subsea vehicles progress over thousands of miles inside the known hotspots.

I look forward to a positively enthusiastic reply

All the best
