Very good point.

In a solar powered house (like mine) there is
	- Regulator		= Controls the power in and out of the batteries
	- Inverter		= Turns low voltage DC to high voltage AC
	- Charger			= When the batteries are just too low
	- Current Meter 	= Many current meters

Technically it is a company, but their products are called things like
	Plasmatronic 40
	Plasmatronic 20
	Plasmatronic 60

My code handles all of them, there is slight differences in scaling 
factors of the raw data, but the protocol is the same.

Let me think, how to combine the words Device, Power, Regulator and 
Plasmatronic.
How about.
	Device::Power::PlasmatronicRegulator;

I guess the only problem with the above is if we end up one day in the 
future having a common Regulator API (eg: Device::Regulator) which 
abstracts all of them.
