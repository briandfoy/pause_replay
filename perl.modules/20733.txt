The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IP::Authority
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: database for IP address->authority lookups
  userid:      NWETTERS (Nigel Wetters)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Whois::* modules

  rationale:

    Historically, the former InterNIC managed (under the auspices of
    IANA) the allocation of IP numbers to ISPs and other organizations.
    This changed somewhat when the Regional Internet Registry system was
    started, with the creation of three (and later, four) Regional
    Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world, each managing the
    allocation of IP addresses to organizations within differing
    physical areas (see also RFC2050).

    This means that there is no central whois database for IP numbers.

    This module allows the user to lookup the RIR who has authority for
    a particular IP address. After finding out the authority for an IP
    address, it is possible to use the authority's whois server to
    lookup the netblock owner.

    The difference between this module and the Net::Whois::* modules is
    that no network lookups takes place. All information is held within
    a local database. The Net::Whois::* modules could benefit from using
    this modules, as it would reduce the number of network lookups
    needed for an IP address from a maximum of four to a maximum of one.

The resulting entry would be:

IP::
::Authority       MdpOp database for IP address->authority lookups   NWETTERS
