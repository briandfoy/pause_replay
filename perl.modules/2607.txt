'Milter' means something specific to Sendmail, it is the term used to
describe sendmail's Mail Filter API (libmilter.a, FFR_MILTER, etc.).
Filter would be too overly general, since one could write a program that
was a filter for sendmail, but did not use sendmail's Mail Filter API. I
did consider Sendmail::MailFilter, but that also suffers from the same
problem.

I'm trying to be as nondescript as I possibly can... :)

What do you think?
