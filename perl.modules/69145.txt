Hi Stephen,

Thanks for the link. I have read the FAQ, and I have contacted a
person with the same name (don't know if the same person) by email;
this was last week, so I will wait a couple of weeks for an answer, if
any.

The reason I have put the question here is that I have seen in the
archives Ovid asking the same question on the same module back in
2005. Were there any developments then? Was someone able to contact
the author and get the co-maintenance rights?

Best regards,
Paulo
