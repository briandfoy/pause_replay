Subject: Module submission Cobweb
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, leprevost@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cobweb
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: yet another distributed processing system
  userid:      LEPREVOST (Felipe da Veiga Leprevost)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    repository

  similar:
    gearman

  rationale:

    The new rootlevel name and namespace is necessary because this will
    be the name of my new project. The reason for make it available at
    CPAN and the 'uniqueness' of this new project are related to the
    implementation, this will be a pure perl project and will be running
    in different OS's like Linux an Windows. I also think it will be
    nice to make it available in CPAN, and not just the GitHUb
    repository.

  enteredby:   LEPREVOST (Felipe da Veiga Leprevost)
  enteredon:   Wed May 16 16:38:39 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Cobweb            cdpfp yet another distributed processing system    LEPREVOST
