Hi,

Just because the library is named GnomeVFS doesn't mean it have to have 
that name on CPAN does it? Doesn't VFS::Gnome give enough credit to the 
underlying library? Why do we need to to say the obscure acronym ;) 
twice in 15 characters, taking up 6!

I don't really mind between VFS:: and FileSys::Virtual, if you are 
really planning on writing
an abstract VFS.pm that is designed to work with multiple 
implmentations I am think VFS should be a go. However I don't think 
VFS::GnomeVFS should be a go.

VFS::GnomeVFS
VFS::ApacheVFS
VFS::DarwinVFS
VFS::LinuxVFS

Doesn't read well at all.

Regards Arthur
