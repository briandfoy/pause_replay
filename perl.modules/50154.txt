The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fuse::Simple
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Simple way to write FUSE filesystems in Perl
  userid:      NOSEYNICK (Nick Waterman)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    just discussed with Fuse.pm developers

  similar:
    Fuse

  rationale:

    Original Fuse module by Mark Glines, maintained by Dobrica
    Pavlinusic, arguably should have been called Filesys::Fuse, but the
    precendent has already been set.

    My module builds on Fuse.pm, which has a very function-based
    interface ("open this file", "delete that file"), and makes it
    Simple to use - you describe the root of your filesystem in a hash,
    and any subdirectories are hasrefs eithin that hash. Instead of
    describing "here's how to open a file", you describe "here's a
    simple representation of my filesystem, let Fuse::Simple handle the
    details".

    Thus, as it makes Fuse.pm simple to use, my module is called
    Fuse::Simple (::Simple seems to be more popular than ::Easy)

    Thanks NoseyNick
