Maybe we need a discussion forum for this work.  I favor a
subscriber-post-only mailing list myself and I think it would be fairly
low traffic.  Basically, just invite whoever's written exception code,
either as a base CPAN module (you, me, Pete Seibel?, Matt Sargent, that
guy who uploaded something called Exception.pm, Pete Jordan who's
working on this for the core).

I strongly disagree.  As try/catch is not built into Perl I really don't
feel that it should be considered the core of any exception model that
gets built.  But that's why we need a discussion forum.  There are people
who are interested in these things but we don't really talk to each other.

See my above mention of a mailing list.  I know Pete Jordan is working on
this (making it available from XS and such) so it would be nice if the
10-20 people who've gotten seriously interested in this could talk about
it.
