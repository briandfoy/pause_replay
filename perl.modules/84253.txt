That was what I had in mind.

That's just a lot of s///ing and some checks that your tests still pass :)

Neither of those are acceptable perl. You wanted -

  my $parser = Games::RPG::Traveller::Stramp::Parser->new;

See http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/indirect-but-still-fatal/ for an
explanation of why indirect object notation should never be used.

Enough to not be creating confusing top level namespaces, for preference - for
example, Games::RPG is unambiguously about roleplaying whereas RPG:: could
mean the programming language RPG.

RPG::Dice lists -

  Peter L. Berghold <peter@berghold.net>
