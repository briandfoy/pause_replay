XML::Parser currently lacks an owner - Clark Cooper has been
un-contactable for many months now. He responded briefly to cries of an
urgent 5.8.0 fix required, but has since returned into quietness. There's
a memory leak been discovered in XML::Parser, and I'd like to get it
fixed, along with a number of other things that I would like to get done.

Please assign dual ownership to me (MSERGEANT), as has been agreed on the
Perl-XML list. Thanks.
