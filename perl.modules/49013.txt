The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::Insomnia
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Make it so your scripts can't sleep()
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Lying awake one night I thought this would be a fun Acme module and
    it actually came in handy when working through some existing code
    that had lots of long sleep()s in it that I wanted to skip during
    troubleshooting.

    sleep(60);

    takes one minute

    use Acme::Insomnia;

    sleep(60);

    now its instant, it *can't* sleep(), hence the name :)

    optional warnings, and a nap() function that you can use to
    actually catch a z or 2 while still making sleep() escape your
    script :)

  enteredby:   DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  enteredon:   Wed May 24 20:30:27 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Acme::
::Insomnia        Rdpfp Make it so your scripts can't sleep()        DMUEY
