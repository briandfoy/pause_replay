I understand the rationale behind avoiding terminology which non- 
native speakers might not grok easily.

Sort::Huge would more or less accurately describe what this module  
does.  As implemented, it's not yet a direct replacement for the sort 
() function, which I think that name implies.  For instance, sort()  
sorts undef values -- it complains, but it doesn't do what my module  
does, which is turn them into an empty string.  However, with a  
little work, I can tweak this code into something which provides  
nearly the same functionality as sort().  It can already handle  
arbitrary sortsubs.  Sort::Huge, hmm... I like it.

I already uploaded the file Sort-MonsterSort-0.01.tar.gz -- hope it  
isn't a problem to change things now.

Shall I apply for the Sort::Huge namespace?

Best,
