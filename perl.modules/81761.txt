Subject: Module submission Graph::Similarity
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, shoheik@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::Similarity
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Calculate similarity of noes in graph(s)
  userid:      SHOHEIK (Shohei Kameda)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    github

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's reasonable to name Graph::Similarity because this module
    provides similarity in Graph. Also, Graph module needs to be used
    for the input of Graph::Similarity. From the information in Graph,
    such as topology, node name and label name are used for the
    calculation of the similarity. Therefore, it's easy to know the
    similarity using Graph module as well.

  enteredby:   SHOHEIK (Shohei Kameda)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug 10 23:48:11 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::Similarity      bnpOp Calculate similarity of noes in graph(s)     SHOHEIK
