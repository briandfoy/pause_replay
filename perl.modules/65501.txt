Hi Colin!

I recently discovered http://search.cpan.org/dist/Statistics-Descriptive/ , 
and found it useful and used it for something. Thanks for maintaining it. I 
noticed there were no new releases in over 6 years, and that there are 9 bugs 
pending. Therefore, I decided to adopt it, since it proved useful to me.

I started working on it in a Subversion repository:

https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/Statistics-Descriptive/

I converted the build system to Module::Build, added the Module-Starter 
skeleton, and converted descr.t to use "use strict", "use warnings" and 
Test::More . Next, I plan to fix bugs.

In any case, please give me a co-maintainer status for Statistics-Descriptive, 
because I'd like to make new releases for it.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
