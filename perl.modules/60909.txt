The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::ParabolicSAR
  DSLIP:       RdpOl
  description: Parabolic Stop and Reversal
  userid:      JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://groups.google.com/group/stockmonkey

  similar:

  rationale:

    This was module was requested by a couple people. It was the
    hardest of the ones I've written as Wilder's book is out of print.
    Google books to the rescue...

    (Incidentally, the stockmonkey list on google groups is brand new.
    The 5 or 7 of us have been communicating informally and I'm trying
    to get everyone on a list instead.)

  enteredby:   JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun 21 11:09:44 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Business::
::ParabolicSAR    RdpOl Parabolic Stop and Reversal                  JETTERO
