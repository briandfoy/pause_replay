Hi, Nick and Steve.

The process is that Steve needs to get in touch with me and provide some
way to associate his identity with the new gmail address and then I can
update it and trigger a password reset.  Typically, I've found that a
LinkedIn invitation to me provides what I need, but we can work out
something else if that isn't possible.

Regards,
David Golden
