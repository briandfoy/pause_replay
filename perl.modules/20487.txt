The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Eobj
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Easy OO programming environment
  userid:      BILLAUER (Eli Billauer)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Eobj is short for Easy Object (easy to remember, I think).

    It is an environment, which exports a few functions, but changes
    the way the rest of the script is written.

    It has its own set of rules of the way classes are written, how
    objects are generated, and how properties are set.

    It includes it's own Carp-like error reporting mechanism, which
    gives call traces with extra information (to give neater info about
    the objects).

    And it consists of six Perl code files (three Perl modules and
    three classes) as of now.

    In light of all this, I find a rootlevel name (which is hard to
    confuse with anything else anyhow) in place. I can't see how it can
    be related to any other module set I know of.

    You are welcomed to try the OO-environment of Perlilog
    (www.opencores.org/perlilog) which is what Eobj actually is.

    I intend to upload the module as soon as I've finished stripping of
    the docs from the Perlilog parts. (The modules themselves are quite
    ready).

    Thanks, Eli
