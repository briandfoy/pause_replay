I realized this and decided to drop that specific part of the issue.

Okay, too bad. I had the impression this would be possible. It shouldn't
be too common for a third party to upload a module with the same name as
a registered (but unused) namespace. Unfortunately, we can't detect this
(see above).

Does the PAUSE database know when a registration was approved? I suppose
it doesn't which is bad for proceeding programmatically. Then, then only
source of approval dates would be the modules@perl.org mailing list
archive. Yuck.

So I guess manually going through the list is the most practical
approach. That's too bad because I don't think there is so much manual
email-writing time to spare between the bunch of us.

I'll think about this a little more and perhaps I can come up with a
semi automated process:

Something along the lines of
1) paring down the list of stale registrations manually, removing any
recent registrations,
2) then sending mails to the authors with a script and asking them to
contact modules@perl.org telling us whether they intend to use the
namespace and whether they object to deletion of the registration.
3) As they answer, the namespaces which the authors want to keep are
manually removed from the list.
4) Purging the leftovers from the database in a few weeks or months
could probably be automated again.

Best regards,
Steffen
