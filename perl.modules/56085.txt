I have transferred primary maintainership to Mattia. Given that the two 
of you are involved in the same project, I assume Joe would agree. I was 
going to give co-maintainer status to Joe, but somehow, the web 
interface wouldn't let me.

So, Mattia, after you uploaded the first version, could you try to give 
Joe co-maintainer status through pause.perl.org? Perhaps that doesn't 
work until at least one version is indexed.

Best regards,
Steffen
