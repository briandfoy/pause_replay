     why:

    I didn't realize in my previous request that you would need more
    information in this box, I apologize for the duplication. I wrote/am
    writing a Perl Module that determines variable length n-grams using
    suffix arrays. An n-gram is a sequence of 'n' tokens that occur in a
    given text. The module has different options, such as the ability to
    define a stoplist, define a token, remove nontoken characters, to
    name a few. I called the module Array::Suffix and rather hope to
    keep that name if it is okay. I didn't find another module of that
    name. If you need more information or have any questions, please
    email.

    Thank you for your time,

    Bridget Thomson McInnes bthomson@d.umn.edu
