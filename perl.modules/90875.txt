The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sidekick
  DSLIP:       cdpO2
  description: Bring to any framework a common set of tools
  userid:      RIVOTTI (André Rivotti Casimiro)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's common to work with different frameworks, platforms. We often
    need the same set of tools in Mason, Catalyst, Apache, Shell, etc.

    Usually we tend to create helpers and, every time we use a new
    framework, we adapt those helpers to that framework. In the best
    case scenario, we use the same Modules but need to create a Wrapper
    or Middleware to use them. Things like config, checkers,
    transformers, headers, cookies, sessions, databases, etc.

    The ideia, with Sidekick, is to create a common interface that can
    be used by any framework. This way, instead of adapting the code or
    creating a new module, the framework would include the sidekick as a
    method/helper.

    Plus, Sidekick is build in a way that facilitates the addition of
    new helpers and plugins.

The resulting entry would be:

Sidekick          cdpO2 Bring to any framework a common set of tools RIVOTTI
