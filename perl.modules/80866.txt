     why:

    I've been developing Perl actively for a dozen years, but have yet
    to contribute to CPAN for no particular reason. I have at least one
    module to contribute (Memoize::Memcached::Attribute, which does
    memoization using memcached via subroutine attributes). I hope to
    continue to contribute both my own modules and patches for existing
    modules as I see the need. I'm doing this both as a personal goal
    and to set the tone of CPAN contribution at my place of employment,
    LiquidWeb.
