The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::FTPTurboSync
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: synchronization via ftp

  rationale:

    https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/Y/YA/YAITSKOV/turbo-ftp-sync.pl

    turbo-ftp-sync - a script moves changes of files and folders of a
    local machine to a remote one via FTP very fast with minimum network
    traffic.

    turbo-ftp-sync [ options ] [ <localdir> <remoteURL> ]

    The script synchronizes files and folder on an FTP server with
    local ones via usual FTP protocol. The advantage of this script over
    usual FTP client is it doesn't upload all data every time but only
    once.

    Its secret is that it doesn't ask a FTP server about last
    modification date and current size of each file. These information
    is stored in local SQLite db. Therefore this program doesn't explore
    folder tree of a remote host. It acts blindly. You can interrupt a
    process of this program in any time and you will not lose changes
    which you already uploaded.

    The program can move changes only one direction from a local
    machine to remote one. If a file was changed on a remote machine and
    a local one then the program overwrite the remove version of the
    file by the local one.

    turbo-ftp-sync.pl is based on sources of ftpsync.pl program.
    Christoph Lechleitner is the initial author of ftpsync.pl
    (ftpsync@ibcl.at)
