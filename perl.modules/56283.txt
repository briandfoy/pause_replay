I think I want to mirror BackPAN and index it, entirely. I'll do all of
the work, but tell me if I'm missing something:

I have this project I'm working on to make custom CPAN snapshots.
Basically, the client wants to locally lock down a particular subset of
CPAN and not update it.  They install exactly the versions they want
from their own MiniCPAN no matter what is currently on CPAN.

The trick here is figuring out what to put in that special MiniCPAN, no
matter what is currently on CPAN. That shouldn't be a problem since
BackPAN has everything. And, this is the sort of thing I find fun. :)

The trick is figuring out which distro to get from BackPAN though. If I
know that I have module Foo at version 1.2.3, which distro is that?
And,
is that the right distro, since some might have the same module
versions.

So, here's what I want to do, in roughly this order:

* mirror BackPAN (I don't even know how big it is). This could happen
slowly over a couple months so I don't pound a server to death, and I
don't need all of it to start work.

* start indexing the distros, and put that into some suitable form,
maybe sqlite or whatever. This will be something simple that I can
distribute easily. I keep rsyncing BackPAN and keep this up-to-date
automatically.

* write the apps to take a module name and option version, and spit out
the distros.  Yeah, that might mean one [ module, version ] pair maps
to multiple distros. But then...

* write the app to take a list of module names and versions, and figure
out the right distros. This can collapse any repeats as long as one of
the modules in the distro increased it's version number.

* then, (then!), most of the pieces should be there to take a Perl
installation and generate from all of the installed modules which
distros I need to get to put into MiniCPAN. There is some
Module::Corelist magic in there somewhere too.

* If I'm lucky, I can build a dependency tree along the way, sorta like
David Cantrell for the CPAN Testers results, but that's a side thing.
