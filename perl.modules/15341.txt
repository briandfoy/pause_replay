Contributions:

I have only one module to contribute at this time. I have not yet discussed the
namespace with any groups yet. Currently it is just called 'Between'. It might
be better as Math::Between. The object accepts a minimum and maximum value which
will act as boundary checks to data structures provided by the user.

This may be as simple as passing one value - or - as complex as passing a
reference to a multidimensional array. The return values are controlled by the
programmer. Inclusive and exclusive functions control whether or not the top or
bottom end of the range is to be considered 'Between' the values provided.

I have already co-authored Tk::MDI (a multiple document interface for Tk) with
Ala Qumsieh, which currently exists under Ala's repository. I intend to upload
other Tk modules as time permits.

Please register me with a CPAN id.

Thanks.
