The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::BEEP::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: lightweight BEEP framework
  userid:      DBLACKA (David Blacka)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    iris@lists.verisignlabs.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a BEEP protocol framework (RFC 3080, 3081), and, as such,
    it is a bit like other internet protocol frameworks (Net::FTP,
    Net::DNS, etc.).

    It is named BEEP::Lite because it is a lighter-weight
    implementation of BEEP than exists in other languages. It does not
    support the (often) complex threading models that other BEEP
    implementations have. Because of this, it does not directly support
    some of the use cases that BEEP is known to handle (specifically
    highly-multiplexed or peer-to-peer appliations).

    This name also creates a ready-made name for a more full-featured
    implementation (Net::BEEP).

    As far as I could tell, there are no other Perl BEEP
    implementations of any sort.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::BEEP::
::Lite            bdpOl lightweight BEEP framework                   DBLACKA
