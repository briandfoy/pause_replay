Sadly and I liked the Django::Template name, too.

So true.

Template::DTL would also be ok, but I don't want to butt in on TTs namespace.

Well, I don't like taking a root namespace for no good reasons either, but I'm fresh out of ideas on the name.

Good to know, wanted to do that first (and reregister) but then I read on PAUSE:
>To delete, add or rename an entry, mail to modules@perl.org.
And that's what I did. :)

Thanks for the quick answer.

Yours,
