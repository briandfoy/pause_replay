Andreas,

A few weeks ago I wrote asking for my module list to be updated. Any idea
what's happened to that?

My current list is:

CGI::XMLForm
Win32::ASP

It needs to add:

Apache::MimeXML
DBIx::AnyDBD
Time::Object
Win32::ADO
XML::PYX
XML::XPath
XML::miniXQL

Let me know if you need any descriptions.
