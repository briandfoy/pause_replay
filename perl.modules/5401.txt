Oh, that's a whole 'nuther discussion!  It relied on Email::Valid
(which, notably, isn't in the module list) so I went by that.  If I
was to do it over again, I would have called it Mail::Find, yes.  I
could probably be convinced to change the name (keeping around the old
for compatibility).

I just noticed Email::Find is in the module list (forgot) and not
under "Mail and Usenet News" but under "Text Processing" which sort of
makes sense, but isn't quite where I'd look for it first.  URI::Find
is under WWW and not Text Processing.

How can I stoop so low?  Years of practise, that's how. It's been hard
going but now I can stoop lower than a pygmy limbo dancer.
