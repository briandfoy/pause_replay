The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Introspector
  DSLIP:       bmcpg
  description: Interface to the GCC Compiler
  userid:      MDUPONT (James Michael DuPont)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    introspector.sf.net site

  similar:
    Inline

  rationale:

    The introspector represents a new way to interface into the GCC
    compiler. It patches the gcc to make XML statements about the
    programs being compiled in XML to a perl script parsing them. I have
    created an INLINE::C::Introspector package as well, but would rather
    have a top level package because there will be more interfaces
    supported.

  enteredby:   MDUPONT (James Michael DuPont)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug  2 13:33:49 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Introspector      bmcpg Interface to the GCC Compiler                MDUPONT
