The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HPUX::LVM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to HPUX's LVM volume manager
  userid:      CWHITE (Christopher White)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    chrwhite@seanet.com

  similar:
    HPUX::Ioscan

  rationale:

    Only works with HPUX's LVM impletmentation so putting it with
    Ioscan seemed right. Its an extremely useful program when used with
    the included cgi for HPUX disk capacity planning and overview. More
    useful for system admins of large scale servers with lots of disks.
    I've been using it and updating it for years. I've also attempted to
    post it 3 other times w/o success. :-)

The resulting entry would be:

HPUX::
::LVM             bdpOp Interface to HPUX's LVM volume manager       CWHITE
