The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Serge
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Localization Automation Toolkit
  userid:      AFAN (Igor Afanasyev)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Serge (name stands for String Extraction and Resource Generation
    Engine) is a free, open-source toolkit that helps you set up a
    continuous localization process for your various pieces of software
    and marketing materials in a fully automated and scalable fashion.

    Serge is written in pure Perl and is a robust application with
    plugin-based architecture, consisting of 70+ classes, this is why I
    think it deserves a root 'Serge' namespace.

    Serge is being developed, maintained and internally used by
    Evernote (www.evernote.com).
