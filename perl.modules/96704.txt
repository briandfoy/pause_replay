     why:

    I contribute to several OSS projects, most of which use Perl. I
    have a couple of modules that I use in some of my scripts, and a
    number of these could be generally useful to others, particularly
    those writing code for libraries (i.e. the places with books, not
    code libraries, necessarily).

    I plan my first contribution to be a class module for looking up
    attributes in a MARC21 bibliographic record. I hope to use the name
    MARC21::FixedFieldMap.

    I also have a small module on github for using JSON files as simple
    application preferences. Not sure that would really fit here as I
    think there is already a Config::JSON module. If not, I could turn
    my module into something like that.

    Not sure what other modules I'll be contributing in the future.
    I've been using Perl 5 for about two decades, and I've been using
    CPAN to find other's useful modules since about the time it was
    started. In all that time I've never contributed and think I should.

    Just to be clear, my main reason for asking for an id is the
    MARC21::FixedFieldMap module. It's the first thing I've done that I
    think is worthy of sharing via CPAN.
