Not really. Things are about to change as new menu items pop up on
PAUSE, but the menu for "submit a module description" is just a few
weeks old and not yet properly documented.

    cpan> make Cmenu
    Running make for module Cmenu
    Running make for D/DR/DREWF/Cmenu-1.0.tgz
      Is already unwrapped into directory /root/.cpan/build/Cmenu-1.0

      CPAN.pm: Going to build D/DR/DREWF/Cmenu-1.0.tgz

    Can't locate Curses.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/local/perl-5.7.1@10090/lib/5.7.1/i686-linux /usr/local/perl-5.7.1@10090/lib/5.7.1 /usr/local/perl-5.7.1@10090/lib/site_perl/5.7.1/i686-linux /usr/local/perl-5.7.1@10090/lib/site_perl/5.7.1 /usr/local/perl-5.7.1@10090/lib/site_perl .) at Makefile.PL line 16.

This is what I mean, it seems tightly coupled with Curses. I have no
personal experience with Cmenu and hardly any experience with Curses,
so I see things like a beginner. If it integrates tightly with Apache,
it's usually called Apache::*, same goes for Tk. The name Cmenu
doesn't tell me anyhing, Curses::Cmenu tells me: ah, maybe I find
something in there when I next time have to deal with Curses. That's
all, I thought.


 df> The module stems from perlmenu which was independent of Curses so

 df> I'll appreciate guidence - categorising issues are a bit beyond
 df> me in this case.

In general we encourage names that are descriptive if that seems
possible and doesn't lead to overlong package names. Rootlevel
namespaces are most appropriate for anything that either ties
something bigger together (category, toolset, community) or has really
no appropriate place anywhere. It's your call to decide, I do not
really have strong feelings about it.


 df> Thanks for your consideration.

Thanks for yours:-)
