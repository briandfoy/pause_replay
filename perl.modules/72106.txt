It seems to me that you could do a simpler refactor of the state - if
the '###' part can be held for the filtered block I don't really see
why the filehandle state can't be.

It just seems to me that a total rewrite (which is effectively what your
code is) is overkill and could cause lurking bugs.

I'd much rather you try and figure out how to turn this into a small
set of patches to the current code plus a lot of extra tests - and am
willing to brainstorm on design to do so - I'm not assuming you're wrong
that the changes are necessary, but I'd like to feel like we've explored
all possible alternatives before a fork.

Well, doing a major rewrite to add what appears to be a minor feature is
*usually* a sign of error - though if you've had no reply at all that's
likely a communications failure. If you've had an explicit "not interested"
reply that's a different matter - could you clarify?

Awful choice. ::Any modules are currently pretty much all "choose between
N implementations depending on which one's installed" - see JSON::Any for
a canonical example.

Poor name but MultiPartPackageNames are normally like that in perl - see
perlstyle.pod for reference.

Smart::Comments::LogToFile would be my first thought. ::File is ok.

Yes, and yes, so Smart::Comments::*Something* is likely preferred even if
technically "incorrect".
