Excellent question!  Every time I see Yet Another License popping up with an author who claims that "It's OK, it's better!", I just want to scream.  I don't have time or patience for this and if I have the slightest bit of doubt, I'll chuck the module and reach for one with the standard Perl licensing.

(This is not an invitation to defend ANY other license.  I have too many things to do and I don't want to be burdened with someone else's pet crusade)
 
Cheers,
Ovid
