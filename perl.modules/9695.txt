Subject: Module submission Term::Clui

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Clui
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Command Line User Interface
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)

  rationale:

    Term::Clui offers a high-level user interface with subroutines
    &choose &ask &edit &view &confirm. It interfaces to the user at a
    much higher level then widgets; it gives command-line applications a
    consistent "look and feel". Its metaphor for the computer is as a
    human-like conversation-partner, and as each answer/response is
    completed it is summarised onto one line, and remains on screen, so
    that the history of the session gradually accumulates on the screen
    and is available for review, or for cut/paste. &choose uses arrow
    keys (or hjkl) and return, and &edit and &view use the default
    EDITOR and PAGER if possible. It's fast, very easy for both
    programmer and user, and has few external dependencies. It doesn't
    use curses which is a whole-of screen interface. If "Clui" is too
    cutesy (pun on "cluey" = smart, clever) I'd be happy with Term::Vtui
    referring to vt100, or Term::Ttui because it uses /dev/tty. I have
    an HTML equivalent planned, offering similarly named routines in the
    messier CGI environment.

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
