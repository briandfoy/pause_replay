The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Transformer
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Traverse a data structure, altering in place
  userid:      BALDUR (Baldur Kristinsson)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Rmap Data::Walk

  rationale:

    Data::Transformer walks through a data structure, altering it in
    place according to the specifications of the user. (It can also be
    used non-destrucively to merely collect information from the data
    structure).

    The module fills a similar niche as Data::Rmap and Data::Walk, but
    shares no code with them. It is my impression that for most common
    purposes it is easier to use and understand -- though perhaps not
    quite as powerful.

    Since the main purpose of the module is to facilitate
    transformations of data structures, the name Data::Transformer seems
    natural and appropriate.

  enteredby:   BALDUR (Baldur Kristinsson)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb  3 10:57:22 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Transformer     bdpOp Traverse a data structure, altering in place BALDUR
