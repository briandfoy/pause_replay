Yes, I have.  With all due respect to its author, I don't like
the design of Tie::ShadowHash: it tries to do too much, to be too
many things.  In short, it has poor modularization.
IMHO, fixing it would mean chopping it up into several distinct,
independent modules.  One of them would be essentially identical
to my Tie::HashDefaults.
