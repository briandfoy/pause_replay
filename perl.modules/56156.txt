The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IP::ChinaISP
  DSLIP:       SdpOp
  description: Querying China ISP from a given IP
  userid:      PANGJ (Jeff Pang)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    In China there're two primary ISPs,one is China TEL
    (CHINANET),another is China CNC

    (CNCGROUP).Due to the bad policy here,the internet connection
    between these two ISPs is

    very slow.I once worked and still be working in China large
    websites like Sina,Netease

    etc.For us we need to make two suites of systems for the same
    application,like webmail

    systems,each for each ISP.So we maintained the IP database for both
    TEL and CNC.When the request is coming from CNC network,we redirect
    it to CNC servers.Otherwise redirect it to TEL servers.I searched
    and didn't find CPAN has that a module which can do the IP-ISP

    querying.That's to say,we may need such a module,

    my $cnisp = IP::ChinaISP->new; print $cnisp->ip_isp('11.22.33.44');

    It would return 'CHINANET' or 'CNCGROUP' or other isp based on the
    given IP argument. So I'm glad to write one for CPAN.

    There is already the 'IP::' parent namespace on CPAN,and my module
    does something related to IP querying,so I take this namespace of
    IP::ChinaISP.

The resulting entry would be:

IP::
::ChinaISP        SdpOp Querying China ISP from a given IP           PANGJ
