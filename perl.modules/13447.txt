No, I'm not sure; but I do think I remember checking 00modlist.long.html
after I first registered the modules back in December and feeling happy
because they were there; but I suppose the memory might be mistaken.

It did say "Thanks for registering" ... Surely that implies that I
registered ?  and I'm not a module list maintainer, just an author ...

Ahh...

Because version numbers can occur many times in many different files
(in the Module-7.89.tar.gz name, twice in each .p[ml] file (once in
the pod), in the README, in .p[ml] files in subdirectories, in other
..p[ml] files that don't get installed and are used only in the build
process, in .p[ml] files that are installed optionally, in Makefile.PL
if it uses MakeMaker and contains VERSION=>'6.78', etc etc) at that
time my build process involved inserting the version into all these
places automatically from a single authoritative source.
(#VERSION# was of course the magic string that got replaced.)

I sort of assumed that CPAN would deduce its version number from
the Module-7.89.tar.gz name (as humans do) because it is the only
uniquely-placed source for that information.  When that failed,
I thought maybe it ran Makefile.PL with a stripped-down MakeMaker
and measured what version that gave.  It didn't occur to me that
CPAN would go grepping through all the .p[ml] files because that
seemed so unstructured and ambiguous.

Can you clarify for me which occurrence of $VERSION= in which file
is taken by CPAN as authoritative ?  Is this documented anywhere ?

Thanks for the suggestion. I have deleted all pre-latest versions
of everything, and will wait for 72 hours and then "Reindex" :-)

Interestingly (?) the "Delete" item also offered me all the really
old versions to delete, i.e. the ones I'd already deleted long ago :-(
I wonder if those deletions worked ...
