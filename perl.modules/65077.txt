Hello to the modules list,

Following up a discussion a couple months ago, Matt Sergeant still hasn't 
responded to that or any other message from me concerning DBD::SQLite, and so, 
AFAIK with the community's support, ...

I would like to be registered as an official co-maintainer of DBD::SQLite, so I 
can start release managing it and CPAN will accept my uploads as authorized.

I hadn't started work on this before now, but DBD::SQLite has now moved to the 
front of my queue of un-paid projects (now that Set::Relation 0.9.0 is out), and 
I plan to start working on it this week or next with a first developer release 
to CPAN estimated in 2-3 weeks from now and a first normal user release 
following a few weeks later when early adopters consider it ready.

Note that I consider the dbi-dev list to be the official channel for all 
DBD::SQLite development, so if any of you have any input for this project then 
please just make it there.  Also I have already made an RFC post there earlier 
today about my initial plans for DBD::SQLite's development.

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
