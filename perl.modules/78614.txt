There's no way to just change the ID as far as I know (short of
mucking directly with the production DB) and it would cause several
problems as the old distributions are stored on BackPAN under the
original distributing author ID.

Transferring ownership is the way to go.  Look at this page (using the
*old* ID):

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=3Dshare_perms

Sounds like you want option 2.1 -> "Pass primary maintainership status
to somebody else (giving it up at the same time)"

Then you'll want to delete the distributions (in the old ID account),
bump the version numbers up and then upload the new distribution with
the new version number from the new account.  Please don't try to
upload the old distribution tarballs - that might not index properly
and it can potentially confuse some tools that expect that a
distribution name is unique on CPAN (even though it's not true, it's
true 99% of the time).
