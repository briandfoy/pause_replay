     why:

    Menus.pm allows you to create powerful CMD environment menus. Any
    CMD enviroment perl script can now include a menu facility that
    includes sub-menus, forward and backward navigation, single or
    multiple selection capabilities, dynamic item creation and
    customized banners. All this power is simple to implement with a
    straight forward and very intuitive configuration hash structure
    that mirrors the actual menu architechture needed by the
    application. A separate configuration file is optional.
