I'm leaving today for London for a bit of a break before YAPC::EU, and
after YAPC I'm taking a week off in a remote part of Iceland where I
hope they don't have internet. I should be back by September.

I'll try to catch up on everything when I get back, but maybe this is
José's big chance to try out his admin bit. :)
