Request to register new user

fullname: Yann Kerhervé
  userid: YANNK
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://yann.typepad.com/
     why:

    I want to contribute a Catalyst plugin (changing forward behaviour
    about exceptions), see : http://cyberion.net/mortalforward/

    I'd love to have YANN as a PAUSE ID, I contacted Yannick Le Saint
    about it (the actual owner inactive for 4 years with no UPLOAD) but
    he didn't bother to reply (or this email is not maintain anymore
    either) If you can do something about it, would be appreciated !

    Thanks,
