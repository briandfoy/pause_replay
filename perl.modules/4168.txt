I have two scripts that I would like to contribute, with a 3rd on the way.
The first script is a Sybase DDL extraction script that uses Sybperl.  In
fact it was originally part of the Sybperl distribution directly, but
needed beefing up, which I am currently co-ordinating.  The second is a
process monitoring script for Sybase, much like 'top'.  This one is
entirely my own work.  Finally, I am just finishing off a script that
reverse engineers a the SQL that was submitted to a Sybase SQL Server.

As well as the scripts, I am building a a Sybase::CTLib::DBA module that
will provide people (Sybase DBAs) with the ability to generate migration
scripts very quickly.

The scripts have been publicly available for download for a year from my
own site and are frequently discussed in comp.databases.sybase together
with the other public newsgroups hosted by Sybase themselves
(forums.sybase.com/sybase.public.sqlserver.general).  Also, there are 3
mailing lists that have discussed the scripts: ase-linux@isug.com,
SYBPERL-L@list.cren.net and SYBASE-L@LISTSERV.UCSB.EDU.
