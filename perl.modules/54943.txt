The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::SQL
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: installs SQL modules and their dependencies
  userid:      SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    While I don't use SQL, I'm working on a project where a good number
    of modules require SQL; however, I encountered so many problems with
    the SQL modules that I reinstalled all of them and made this bundle
    as a result. While the performance is better, there are still some
    modules that just won't install properly, like SQL::Translator. They
    still have to be installed manually.

  enteredby:   SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun 18 06:43:28 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::
::SQL             adpnp installs SQL modules and their dependencies  SKI
