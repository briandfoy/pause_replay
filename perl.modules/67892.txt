The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Password
  DSLIP:       adpha
  description: Unix-style, Variously Hashed Passwords
  userid:      DRSTEVE (Steve Eirium)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    totality of public presence is a github repo

  similar:
    CORE::crypt() Crypt::SaltedHash

  rationale:

    This is just a wrapper for perl's crypt(), which can do everything
    you would probably want to do to store a password, but this is
    supposed to provide the various uses easier.

    Only implements a bunch of behaviour in a Moose object that isn't
    real in-your-face about its objectory. Given a string it defaults to
    using sha256 and generates a salt for you. Using crypt() bare would
    require the string and a salt string that goes: "$5$saltjunk"
    passed. I conjecture that this usage is a factor in the neglect of
    perl's crypt().

    Hashes look like
    "$5$%RK2BU%L$aFZd1/4Gpko/sJZ8Oh.ZHg9UvxCjkH1YYoLZI6tw7K8" by the
    way. "$digest$salt$hash".

    Cheers.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
