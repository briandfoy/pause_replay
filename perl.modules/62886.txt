The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::Befunge::Vector::XS
  DSLIP:       RmcOp
  description: LB::Vector rewritten for  speed
  userid:      JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org#language-befunge, language-befunge@mongueurs.net

  similar:
    Language::Befunge::Vector

  rationale:

    Language::Befunge::Vector::XS is re-implementing
    Language::Befunge::Vector (part of Language::Befunge) in XS for
    speed reasons.

    i'm the owner of Language::Befunge, and wanted it to be pure perl.
    however, for speed reasons, i rewrote one of its key components in
    XS, that will take precedence over the pure-perl version if it is
    installed.

    ==> this explains the deep namespace within Language::Befunge

  enteredby:   JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 28 17:34:52 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Language::Befunge::Vector::
::XS              RmcOp LB::Vector rewritten for  speed              JQUELIN
