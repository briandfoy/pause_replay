Subject: Need a module name...  Transaction support for Storable file objects
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: muir@idiom.com (David Muir Sharnoff)



I've just written a module that does transactions.

It works in the following environment:

	Hash-based objects which are stored one-per file using Storable.

It's multi-user and will not deadlock.  Transactions can span objects.

What should I call it?


	Storable::Transaction
	Object::Transaction
	Record
	Record::Multiuser
	File::MultiStorable

Ideas?

Thanks,

-Dave
