Subject: registered module not found on search nor in cpan installer.

I have a module registered, PayflowPro, which doesn't show up when  
searching for that keyword on search.cpan.org.  Also, when you search  
for it within the cpan installer with "m PayflowPro" it doesn't list  
the file location nor the version number, even though it is in my CPAN  
directory.

I configured the Metadata for it months ago.

What more do I need to do to make it show up on the searches and to  
allow the cpan installer to find it in my CPAN directory?

Thanks!
