Have you spoken to the DateTime or the Date::Holidays people about this 
module, they may have something to contribute, and in crowded and tricky 
areas like date and time we prefer that you have at least spoken to some 
of the other people doing this sort of work.

As for the name, if you choose to integrate with Date::Holidays perhaps 
something like Date::Holidays::File?

Otherwise, for parsers often something like Date::Parse::Holiday or 
Date::Parse::DotHoliday?
