The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::US::INGDirect
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interact with US INGDirect accounts
  userid:      SSEVERIN (Steven N. Severinghaus)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::INGDirect Finance::Bank::ES::INGDirect

  rationale:

    The module Finance::Bank::INGDirect is only for French accounts. A
    cursory search of CPAN suggests that the name I'm proposing is
    reasonable. The module provides functionality that does not
    currently exist and could be useful to many. It does not conform to
    either of the existing INGDirect modules' interfaces, but it
    hopefully improves on them in some ways. I selected "beta" above as
    I've only been able to test it with a limited number of users.

    As with any module that is essentially scraping a website beyond
    the author's control, this module will probably need periodic
    maintenance. As a regular user, I'll be motivated to keep it working
    as the website changes.

    Development is tracked in bzr, but I have not made the repo
    publicly accessible yet.

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::US::
::INGDirect       bdpOp Interact with US INGDirect accounts          SSEVERIN
