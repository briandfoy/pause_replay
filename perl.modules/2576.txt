I am reworking a newmail script that runs against procmail generated mail
files to list out vital stats about the mail files.  (i.e. Read, Seen,
Answered).  Most of the current mail parser modules are a little too heavy
weight to run in .login file and still finish quickly.  So I am making a
module optimized for speed, with just enough functionality to get the job
done.

I think the module name Mail::Stats works well, and does not seem to be
used.  

The current nonmodule script is being passed arround ammoung coworkers and
friends at the moment, and hopefully with the more configurable Module
version I am working on, even more people will find it useful.

Thanks for your time,

	-Sean

There is no silver bullet.  Plus, werewolves make better neighbors than
zombies, and they tend to keep the vampire population down.
