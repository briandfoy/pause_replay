FYI-

	I haven't dropped this ball - I'm just trying to plan for it properly.
	
	Right now we're in the middle of planning for an upgrade from RT2 to 
RT3, but that might not happen for another month or two.

	I can easily setup all of the queue's and mail-process stuff, but the 
automation/pause integration is going to take a little longer, and I'd 
rather only do it once (as well as to integrate some of Autrijus' work)

	Basically that's Arthur's flow:

>   1. CPAN authors use a form on PAUSE...
>     2. Email gets sent to RT and placed in the modules queue
>     3. RT sends a copy of the request to modules@perl.org
>     4. RT tracks any discussion that happens on modules@.
>     5. When it is approved/rejected/altered/etc, one of the modules@
>        admins goes into the RT system and marks it as such.
> 
>     6. Status reports can be generated that show the status of the
>        queue.
>      (5 in queue, 3 under discussion, 2 new) 

	It would not (initially) deal with Andreas' concerns:

	Now that I think about it a little harder, it wouuld probably be 
relatively easy to write something that extracted the PAUSE-request-id 
and stuck it somewhere it could be queried from.

	(Random thought for self:  Store extracted PauseReq as a Link, then 
write custom query to retrieve ticket id for tickets containing that link.)

	I will try and look into this sooner than later, and will report back.
