Subject: PAUSE permissions clash between Load and load modules

Hi George,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

You own the Load namespace, which is used in your FastDB distribution. =
This now clashes with the =E2=80=9Cload=E2=80=9D module, which is owned =
by PAUSE user ELIZABETH.

To resolve this conflict, I=E2=80=99d like to propose that you rename =
the modules in your distribution to follow the usual convention of all =
being in the namespace of the distribution. So your modules would be =
renamed as follows:

	Delete		=3D>	FastDB::Delete
	Load		=3D>	FastDB::Load
	Question	=3D>	FastDB::Question

I could then drop your permissions on the Delete, Load, and Question =
namespaces, after deleting the releases which have these module names.

Would you be happy to make this change? Please ask if you=E2=80=99ve any =
questions about this, or would like any help.

Cheers,
Neil
