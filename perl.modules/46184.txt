The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Model3D::WavefrontObject
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Read, manp, write Wavefront Object 3D Models
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Poser forums

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is *no* root level namespace that covers 3D
    models/rigging/animation except VRML.

    Unfortunately, VRML is only one specific form of 3D model and is
    conceptually equivalent to Excel occupying a root level namespace,
    as opposed to being part of the Spreadsheet namespace where it is.

    I not only suggest that the Model3D namespace (so named to comply
    with the guideline against beginning with a number, even though
    3DModel would be more aesthetically pleasing) be created as a base
    for this and my upcoming Poser (::Character, ::Prop, ::Camera,
    ::Pose, etc) modules, but that the maintainsers of existing VRML
    namespace should have a relocation under this broader heading
    suggested to them.

The resulting entry would be:
