Like Exporter::Import?

I would have no problem with that name. I just imagine it might be a little
confusing to people, as it had no relationship to Exporter.
I also feel a little odd about using "someone else's namespace". I don't
want to make trouble for maintainers of Exporter by having people send them
mail about a module that isn't theirs.

But like I said, I have no problem with that name if you don't.

		It seems pretty obvious to me that this should go under
Exporter.
		Can you explain why it wouldn't?
