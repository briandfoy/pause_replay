Regarding "Courier" meaning more than just the MTA:  While of course there
are a few other non-famous software packages that use or roughly relate to
the name "Courier", the Courier MTA is _by far_ the most widely known one
on the net (ask a few search engines, possibly including the words
"software", "suite", "tool", etc. -- I tried it), and just about the only
one I could find that has significant potential of being interfaced with
or complemented by Perl in the first place.  In this light, the "Mail::"
part in a "Mail::Courier::Filter" name variant appears largely redundant.

Besides, except for extremely distinct names like "Qmail", there will
always be a chance that "some other weird software package" uses an
established name.  Just think of the "Sendmail the MTA" vs. "Sendmail the
concept" issue, or the "Firebird the database" vs. "Firebird the web
browser" issue.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in this issue
here on the modlist, does it?  What are we supposed to do?
