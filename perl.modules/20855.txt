The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MusicBrainz::Client
  DSLIP:       RmhOa
  description: MusicBrainz Client API
  userid:      SVANZOEST (Sander van Zoest)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.musicbrainz.org/

  similar:
    CDDB Net::CDDB WebService::FreeDB

  rationale:

    The namespace we are interested in is a MusicBrainz::* namespace
    that can be used by the MusicBrainz Project Perl code (The URL for
    the MusicBrainz project is http://www.musicbrainz.org/)

    Currently this namespace mainly going to be used for the interface
    to the Client Library (C/C++) which makes RDF calls to the
    MusicBrainz Server. In the future we might want to publish the
    actual server code here as well. The commonly used RDF queries are
    available in the MusicBrainz::Queries module and we also have TRM
    tagging available under MusicBrainz::TRM which is used to create
    unique signatures for audio files that then in turn can be used by
    MusicBrainz to identify the track and album information.

    Because we currently do not fit in the XML::, Net:: WebService::,
    RDF, Audio, etc. interfaces as a whole, we were hoping that it would
    be okay to claim the MusicBrainz:: namespace. The Namespace is
    pretty uniquely named and does not interfere with any other project
    (AFAWK).

    All discussions and work in this namespace is done on the
    musicbrainz-devel mailing list that can be found at
    http://www.musicbrainz.org/

The resulting entry would be:

MusicBrainz::
::Client          RmhOa MusicBrainz Client API                       SVANZOEST
