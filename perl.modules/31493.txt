I imagine that there are some modules on CPAN that have not been updated
in a while and the developer has disappeared, but the module works fine
and people use it.  We might mark it as abandoned, but I don't think 
that they should automatically disappear.  It is rare that they cause
such any problem, and in this case it looks like the developer wanted to
make it difficult to contact him on purpose.
