     why:

    Dear Sir/Madam

    I am a beginner of perl programming and perl DBI programming. I am
    trying to learn web development and management at this time. But I
    am really at the starting point of these vast courses.

    I want to know from ABCs of these courses, if possible. So, I am
    trying hard to get a thorough tutorials of the courses by some
    means. I look forward your valuable help towards this effort as soon
    as possible.

    Yours sincerely Raj Rai New York
