Subject: Module submission Nagios::Status

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nagios::Status
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perl Extension for Nagios Daemon Integration
  userid:      RCROWDER (Roy Elton Crowder, III)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    Nagios Exchange, Perl Monks

  similar:

  rationale:

    I created this namespace on 01 June 2009 without a request for
    registration. There are currently 4 modules existing under
    Nagios::Status. Of the 4 modules, all are being used in a number of
    large organizations including areas of healthcare,
    telecommunication, manufacturing, etc.

    I chose Nagios::Status for the nature of the modules I was writing
    at the time. The models are used to integrate with the Nagios
    host/service monitoring suite, gather information and present that
    information in a human readable format on an intranet, for example.
    Generally, the modules maintain up to the second status information
    for all hosts and services registered on a Nagios server.

  enteredby:   RCROWDER (Roy Elton Crowder, III)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov  1 20:03:28 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Nagios::
::Status          RdpOp Perl Extension for Nagios Daemon Integration RCROWDER
