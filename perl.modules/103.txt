Hi,

I'm writing a CSS1 parser as part of a project &, as I couldn't find
any such beast on CPAN, thought it might be worth uploading.

My problem is I haven't the vaguest idea what to call it.  Some
thoughts:

    HTML::CSS1
    Parse::CSS1

Having gotten this far I may well write a CSS2 parse engine as well,
so the name of the current module should allow a logical extension to
CSS2.

All this came about because the project is actually a html2ps
converter.  Yes, I know about Jan Karrman's work, I'm borrowing from
his code.  By Jan's own addmission however, html2ps is neither fast
nor embeddable.  When the whole project is done (or if :/) I'd also like to upload this module.  What should it be called?  HTML::PostScript?

I eagerly await any suggestions you may have.
