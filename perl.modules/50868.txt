Subject: Module submission DBIx::Timeout
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Timeout
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: provides safe timeouts for DBI calls
  userid:      SAMTREGAR (Sam Tregar)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    dbi-users mailing list

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This module provides a safe method of timing out DBI requests. An
    unsafe method is described in the DBI docs:

    http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/DBI.pm#Signal_Handling_and_Canceling_Operations

    The problem with using POSIX sigaction() (the method described
    above) is that it relies on unsafe signals to work. Unsafe signals
    are well known to cause instability. To understand why, imagine the
    DB client code is in the middle of updating some global state when
    the signal arrives. That global state could be left in an
    inconsitent state, just wait for the next time it is needed to cause
    problems. Since this will likely occur far from the cause, and only
    ocur rarely, it can be a very difficult problem to track down.

    Instead, this module:

    - Forks a child process which sleeps for $timeout seconds.

    - Runs your long-running query in the parent process.

    - If the parent process finishes first it kills the child and
    returns.

    - If the child process wakes up it kills the parent's DB thread and
    exits with a code so the parent knows it was timed out.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
