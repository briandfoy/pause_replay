Subject: Module submission Spread::Client

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Spread::Client
  DSLIP:       bdhhp
  description: Spread client implemented in perl
  userid:      MBAILEY (Marlon Bailey)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    #poe

  similar:
    Spread

  rationale:

    This is a Spread client, hence the namespace Spread::Client, this
    difference between this and Spread, is that is allows asynchronous
    operation on multicast/join/leave/receive and disconnect. Making
    connect asynchronous will eventually be worked on. This is also a
    perl implementation it does not which does not depend on the C
    Spread client, and also parses the body of the message
    automatically, so that the end user does not have to unpack it
    manually. It will be released with a Danga::Socket async class,
    however writing other async classes(such as POE) should be trivial.
    The POE async connection class will eventually be released with the
    distro.

The resulting entry would be:

Spread::
::Client          bdhhp Spread client implemented in perl            MBAILEY
