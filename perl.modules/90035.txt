Hi, Priyal.

I'll answer your questions the best I can.

You don't need to register the namespace.  Namespace registration is
in the process of being deprecated.  Just document your support intent
in your module documentation and upload your distribution.

In looking at your distribution, I see several "problems" that you
might want to address.  First, your distribution naming is not
consistent with typical Perl conventions.  For a module Foo::Bar with
version 1.23, you would ship a tarball called Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz
containing the directory Foo-Bar-1.23. That directory should contain
your Makefile.PL, a lib directory containing your .pm files and so on.

The error message you saw is because you uploaded NET-NETCONF and you
don't have a NET::NETCONF package in your distribution.

My suggestions:

In your Makefile.PL, set the 'NAME' parameter to "Net-Netconf".  Then,
add lib/Net/Netconf.pm that contains the "package Net::Netconf"
statement.  That top-level .pm file will claim the Net::Netconf
namespace for you and will allow you to upload a tarball starting with
"Net-Netconf".  It is also a good place to put introductory
documentation, support information, etc.

It doesn't have to have any real code.  E.g.:

    package Net::Netconf;
    our $VERSION =3D '0.01';
    1;

    =3Dhead1 NAME

    Net::Netconf -- Netconf Perl client

    =3Dhead1 SYNOPSIS
    ... etc ...

Then, use your Makefile.PL to generate your tarball for upload:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make dist

Looking at the Makefile.PL, I see some other things that might go
awry, but I don''t have time to diagnose all of them for you.  I
suggest finding a good resource on shipping modules to CPAN and
following the guidelines there.  The latest edition of Intermediate
Perl by brian d foy includes a very good chapter on the subject and I
encourage you to read it.

I hope this helps.
