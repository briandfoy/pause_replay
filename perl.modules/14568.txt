i think we finally decided not to put such things under Net.  

is Freenet a new protocol, or does it ride on top of something else
(like nntp, http, or so on?).  if it is another layer, i don't think
it should be in Net.  if it's a new low-level protocol, you might
be ale to convince us.

do you have other suggestions for names?  would it fit in WebService?

Does anyone have an objection to a new top-level namespace?  Blog seems
similar and has its own namespace.
