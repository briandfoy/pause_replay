     why:

    I plan to contribute a series of modules that offer a much better
    interface to FedEx's Direct Connect API per Version 1.2 of the FedEx
    Ship Manager API Tagged Transaction Guide. There is currently a
    module called Business::FedEx::DirectConnect which does allow one to
    interface with FedEx via this API. However, its interface can only
    be described as difficult to use. In order to properly use this
    module, you must consult the Transaction Guide which is a mere 156
    pages. I plan to make a module that should allow a company to become
    certified within a matter of two days(you must submit labels to
    FedEx).

    Thank you
