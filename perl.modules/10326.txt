Hello,
	On Feb 5th, I had applied for module submission for the following.

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unix::Conf
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Unix system administration
  userid:      KARTHIKK (Karthik Krishnamurthy)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups

  similar:
    Unix::Configfile

  rationale:

    Unix::Conf seems a logical name for a bundle of modules intended
    for manipulating various configuration files on a typical Unix
    system. Unix::Conf is intended to offer utility OO modules to be
    used by other modules under the Unix::Conf namespace, all of which
    are supposed to be for offering an OO interface to manipulating
    various Unix configuration files.

The resulting entry would be:

Unix::
::Conf            bdpOg Unix system administration                   KARTHIKK


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unix::Conf::Bind8

Could you kindly expedite on the registration ??? Also would it be a better idea to release it
as a bundle ?
