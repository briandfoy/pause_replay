Sven as agreed to pass maintainership of FCGI to me. There are a few
things to work out and everyone who's interested in the next release
should speak up.

Matt Trout has volunteered to host a git repo. When he has that setup
he'll make an announcement. Patchers can then clone, etc. We'll figure
out everything and get a development release out shortly.

Thanks, :)
