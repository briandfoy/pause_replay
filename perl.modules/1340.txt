G'day Perl modulers.

I'm starting work on a package to manipulate text/directory types
(at the moment I'm concentrating on vCard, but vCalendar could
be useful in the future too).

I'm at a loss as to where this package should go in the namespace.  The
data which it will manipulate is directory information (in the LDAP
sense of the word, not in the filesystem sense of the word), and so
it would seem to make the most sense to use the word "Directory"
somewhere.  I notice that "Directory" is not in use at the moment.
However, it might be a bit confusing to have something in the toplevel
namespace called "Directory" which has nothing to do with filesystems.

Any thoughts?

Cheers,
Andrew Bromage
