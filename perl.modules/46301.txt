Hi Andreas,

Well, it's still showing up, but the normal entry has been updated. I
think the whole problem was my error of having the Table.pm in the
second patch (which was a VERY old version) and that had the same name
space with the other modules version number. My second patch is showing
first now, however I think the whole thing will be cleaned up much
better once the thing I requested to delete is deleted.

The module I had the patch for was written by a guy who used to work for
our company, I'm in the process of contacting him to take over that
module.

Thanks,
-Aaron
