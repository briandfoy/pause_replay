Subject: Module submission DBIx::ScaleOut

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::ScaleOut
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: A smart database access layer
  userid:      JAMCC (Jamie McCarthy)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://github.com/jamiemccarthy/dbix-scaleout

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm compiling my experience with how perl applications interface
    with MySQL into a client library that pulls together useful features
    into one place. The overriding concept is scaling, taking an app
    from a hand-holding get-started-quick setup to 100 hits/second
    without significant application code changes required. I decided on
    "ScaleOut" as the name because scaling out (not up) is the principle
    behind the most important planned features: multiple layers of
    caching, replication, horizontal and vertical table partitioning.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::ScaleOut        cdpOp A smart database access layer                JAMCC
