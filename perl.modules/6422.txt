Hi

I have uploaded a file to my account TWIBBLER.

file id PDFREP-1.00.tar.gz.

This is a PDF report writer. I have also asked for a module namespace.

This email is to inform you of this and ask if there is anything else I have to do to have this module included in cpan.
(First module).

I believe that this module will be tested by various people. ? Will you let me know if there are problems or suggestions please.

Thank you.

(This be work email).
