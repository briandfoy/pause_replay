Subject: Module submission Win32::FetchCommand

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::FetchCommand
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: Get the command line for a file extension
  userid:      CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Win32:: because this is Win32 specific. FetchCommand because it
    searches the Registry to fetch the command line for a specific file
    type. Did not use 'GetCommand' because there is an API with a
    similar name (GetCommandLine).

    I don't know of any other module which offers this functionality.
    It is intended to be used with Win32::Process::Create. For example,
    thingy.doc will resolve to the full command to open this file,
    probably winword with an option, followed by the filename. That can
    then be passed to Win32::Process::Create.

  enteredby:   CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov  9 17:34:34 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::FetchCommand    bdcfp Get the command line for a file extension    CLIVE
