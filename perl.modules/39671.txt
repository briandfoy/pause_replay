From: wez@omniti.com (Wez Furlong)

I have some code that I'd like to submit to CPAN; it's essentially the 
same concept as Dave Roths Win32::Daemon, with a few build fixes so that 
it builds with MakeMaker.

While I was poking around the code I saw a few things that I would 
probably have done differently (it's been a few weeks now, so I don't 
recall exactly what off the top of my head), so I'd really like to 
rewrite it from scratch.

I've emailed Dave to see what his opinion is on folding the changes into 
  his code; since the code is quite old and doesn't really seem to be a 
normal CPAN citizen, I only half-expect to receive a reply.

If I don't hear anything from Dave in a few days, I'd like to choose an 
alternative name, perhaps Win32::ServiceProcess; this would reflect the 
slightly different API and different code base.

Any comments/feedback appreciated. (as well as pointers to other 
appropriate places; I'm relatively new to the perlguts world).

--Wez.
