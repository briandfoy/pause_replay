Hold on, we've already had this discussion:

  o  I already have a large number of users pulling the module from
     CPAN, and am in the process of adding features
  o  This module was already approved by *this* list, and  *they*
     recommended the namespace as it is
  o  This module was originally a companion module to Michael Fowler's
     Parse::PerlConfig, which we wrote intentionally to allow developers
     to choose a config file syntax on the fly
  o  The name is appropriate enough, since it's primary purpose *is* to
     parse plain syntax config files

In short, I think you would do well to note that dumping it from CPAN would be
a disservice to those already using it, and expecting it to be there.  I would
also be somewhat disheartened to have this list go back on a decision that
they already made:
