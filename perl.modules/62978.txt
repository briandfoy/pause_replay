Matt and PAUSE Cognosceti-

The remaining unaccounted for permissions
for PDL module maintenance are held by an
account id: PERLDL.  As near as I have
been able to determine, this was set up
as a means of sharing the PDL maintenance
permissions.

The catch is that we have not been able
to locate anyone who knows the account
password in order to add co-maintainer
permissions for new users.  I did a search
of modules@perl.org archives and did not
find any clues to the origin of the account
and who might speak for it.

I've queried the current active PDL
developer community including two listed as
co-maintainers for PDL.  No luck.

I would like to request the password for
the PERLDL account so that we may fix
permissions before the PDL-2.4.4 release.
If that is not possible, please consider the
PERLDL account as "abandoned" and transfer
the modules it owns to me so that a current
PDL developer will have access to required
permissions for an authorized PDL release.

Matt has been working with me and the
PDL team to sort this out and can vouch
for things.  We're looking for PDL-2.4.4
to be uploaded at the end of this week so
this final issue needs to be addressed at
this time.

Thanks much,
Chris Marshall
  for the PDL developers
