RTFM. 04pause.html says, under "Register yourself": "All mails to
modules@perl.org is archived at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules. modules@perl.org isn't
a mailing list, just an alias for the maintainers of the Perl 5 modules
list. Please do not subscribe. Visit the archive instead."

The closest thing to subscribing to the list is to monitor it via the
NNTP interface ( nntp://nntp.perl.org/perl.modules ), but you said you
have no access to Usenet. So you'll have to search the archives yourself
(e.g. with the web search interface provided there or by downloading
monthly mbox files and importing them into your favourite email program
and/or grepping through them).

modules@perl.org can be slow to answer, though response time seems to be
worse than usual at the moment. Please have patience :)

Also, I believe volunteers to represent 'modules@perl.org' are always
welcome, so if you want to help speed things up for other people, you
could join in ;)

Cheers,
Philip
