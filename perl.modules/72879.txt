In a nutshell, you take a copy of the source tree and do something like 
a glorified

find | xargs perl -pi -e 's/Tk(::|-)ForDummies(::|-)Graph/Tk${1}Chart/g'

and move the lib/Tk/ForDummies/Graph.pm to lib/Graph/Chart.pm (etc).

Then you upload under the new name and mark the old files for deletion.

Cheers,
