No, I'm not officer.  It's a fair cop.  Please expunge the incriminating
evidence from PAUSE.

History: My original motivation was to speed such tests as op/misc.t, but
then a new release of MachTen with less awfully-slow fork() and file access
appeared, reducing my personal need, and shortly afterwards I experienced a
(less than cataclysmic, but time-consuming) family crisis and forgot all
about the module.  A subsequent Ilya hack to speed common redirection cases
in system() has improved misc.t's speed further.  That's not to say that
Test::Cases would not be useful.  It's just that I never got it into a
submittable state.  Please accept my apologies for not following through.
