Here are the reasons why I chose Net:: instead of WWW::

- the usage of Net::Akismet is not limited to web applications (I must 
admit it is meant to be used in web applications, though);

- the fact that Akismet is checking the spammishness of comments via 
HTTP is a mere coincidence. The service's concept of work has little to 
do with the web itself;

- there already are plenty of modules interacting with web services in 
the Net:: namespace.
