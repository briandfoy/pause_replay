Hi,
     Is there a way in Perl where in one can return more than 1 values
from a function ?

For example : 

Let say I have a sub GetX() which takes into parameters and it returns
two values both of which are Hash list.

This is what i tried :
 
sub GetX
{
     ($Valu1, %value2) = @_;

      Filled hash list wih values;

     trying to return these two has lists 
          return (%hashList1, %HashList2);
}

(%receivingHash1, %receiving Hash2 ) = &GetX ();

When i try to print hash list 1 and 2, The first one displays the value
the second one looks to be an empty list. Any ideas what could I be
doing wrong

Thanks
