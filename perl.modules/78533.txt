Subject: Module submission Authen::Credential

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::Credential
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: abstraction of a credential
  userid:      LCONS (Lionel Cons)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module offers an abstraction of a credential, i.e. something
    that can be used to authenticate. It allows the creation and
    manipulation of credentials. In particular, it defines a standard
    string representation (so that credentials can be given to external
    programs as command line options), a standard structured
    representation (so that credentials can be stored in structured
    configuration files or using JSON) and "preparators" that can
    transform credentials into ready-to-use data for well known targets.

  enteredby:   LCONS (Lionel Cons)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov 22 07:56:26 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::
::Credential      bdpOp abstraction of a credential                  LCONS
