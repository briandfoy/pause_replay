Since I didn't see any mention of this in the archive I thought I'd send
along a copy. Since this guy is an 'in absentia' maintainer it makes me a
little uncomfortable seeing this...though from what I understand it was a
needed thing. Anyway, FYI.

*>Subject: ANNOUNCE: libxml-enno separated
*>
*>Hi,
*>
*>I have separated libxml-enno into four packages:
*>XML-DOM
*>XML-XQL
*>XML-Checker
*>XML-RegExp
*>
*>You may find them on CPAN at
*>http://mirror.anidea.com/CPAN/authors/id/T/TJ/TJMATHER/
*>
*>In addition, Beau Simensen and Nyk Cowham have volunteered to
*>maintain XML-DOM and XML-Checker, respectively. Unless anybody has any
*>objections, I will turn the modules over to them.  Of course, these
*>modules are owned by Enno first, the community second, meaning that if
*>Enno comes back, he will have rights to the modules.
*>
*>In addition, Ken MacLeod has offered space on the perl-xml sourceforge
*>account, so once I get my sourceforge ID (tjmather) added to that project
*>I will add the modules.
*>
*>Finally, I will continue to maintain XML-XQL and XML-RegExp until somebody
*>volunteers to take over those.  I don't have much time to maintain them,
*>since my job and other open-source projects (PageKit) keeps me busy, but I
*>will try my best.
*>
*>Comments, suggestions welcome.
*>
*>Thanks,
*>TJ
