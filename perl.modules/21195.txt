The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::MultiType
  DSLIP:       MnpOp
  description: OO as Hash, Array, Scalar, Code & Glob.
  userid:      GMPASSOS (Gaciliano Monteiro Passos)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.com

  similar:
    None. This module make a Perl object that work at the same time as
    Hash, Array, Scalar, Code & Glob, and work with tied references too.
    (Can't find a module with all the types/resources in the same time)

  rationale:

    This module return an object that works like a Hash, Array, Scalar,
    Code and Glob at the same time, and can work with tied references
    too.

    Need the namespace for future sub-modules and XS version...

    ** This module was made for XML::Smart, and is here to be used in
    any other place.

  enteredby:   GMPASSOS (Gaciliano Monteiro Passos)
  enteredon:   Sat May 17 22:09:51 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Object::
::MultiType       MnpOp OO as Hash, Array, Scalar, Code & Glob.      GMPASSOS
