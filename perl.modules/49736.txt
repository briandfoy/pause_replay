What kind of grouping do you have in mind?  The relationships don't
form a nice tree structure.  My Time:: modules are logically related
something like this:

    TCB
     |
    TCG    GPS
     |      |
    TT --- TAI --- UTC --- UTC_SLS
            |       |
      TAI::Now --- UTC::Now

(Orientation is meaningless in this diagram.)  All the TLAs would be
instantly recognised by the target audience, as they are all names of
time scales.

Some groupings: TCB, TCG, and TT are relativistically-correct astronomical
time scales; TT, TAI, and GPS are mutually related by practicalities
of terrestrial atomic time keeping; TAI, UTC, and UTC-SLS are forms of
terrestrial atomic time.

No.  Each module that I have submitted for registration is the primary
module of its own distribution.  Some of the distributions also contain
additional modules that do not seem useful to include in the module list.
