The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Indian
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Class for Indian calendrical computations.
  userid:      SYAMAL (Syamala Tadigadapa)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    mailing list comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This module Date::Indian serves as the base class for errecting an
    Indian calender. In India the calender traditional is luni-solar and
    various flovors of tcalenders exist. Mostly they are classified as
    Amanta and Purnimanta depending on whether the calendrical month of
    the religious calender starts with the dark half or the bright half
    of the Moon's month long journey aroud the zodiac. Calculation of
    festival and other important days differ depending on the region,
    religious groups and variations on the disputed 'ayanamsa' value and
    a hoard of other things including the Era. This module serves as a
    base class and individual calendrical modules can be added in due
    course of time. The official Indian calendar is not so complicated
    but by nature, it is not the religious calender and is not
    extensively employed for civil purposes. Even to errect the official
    Indian calender, services from the base class is still very much
    needed.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
