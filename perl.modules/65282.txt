The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Class::Snowflake
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: DBIC comps for star and snowflake schemas
  userid:      MFOLLETT (Matt Follett)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::Class

  rationale:

    The reason this module is called DBIx::Class::Snowflake is because
    it extends DBIx::Class by providing components that can be loaded to
    work specifically with star and snowflake schemas. There are 4
    components, 2 components for dimensions and 2 for facts, both have a
    component to be loaded for the row and a component to be used for
    the resultset.

    The module as a whole provides the user with the ability to easily
    inspect schemas and generate reports from them. First, it does this
    by providing the user of the module with the ability to request a
    list of all the columns for all of the dimensions of a fact along
    with the type of value the column holds. Then, it allows the user
    with the ability to request a new resultset or array of columns by
    passing in a list of columns on dimensions requested and data to
    filter on. Finally, it also provides the user the ability to
    automatically ignore and not report on certain columns.

    This greatly simplifies generating reports and writing custom
    report generators with snowflake and star schemas.
