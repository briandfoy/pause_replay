Dear Webmaster,

Hi, I'm Rick Stooker, author of Secrets of Changing to a High Pay 
Computer Career.

A while ago, I sent you an email offering you LINK PARTNER status on 
my site at http://www.inforingpress.com . I never heard back from you.  
It costs you nothing...just a link back to. Our hits are increasing 
daily and we would like to share some of that traffic with you.

Please look at the link you currently have on our links page, then add 
our link to your site so you can move to the top of your category. 

I currently have over 60 articles on computer subjects for "not yet
techies" and plan to add more soon, so there is a lot of content on
my site for techie newbies.

Thank you for taking time to read this. I look forward to hearing 
from you soon.

Thanks a lot,
Rick Stooker

P. S. Reciprocal links help us both in two ways. We get more traffic
through the links themselves, plus they increase your standing in most 
search engines. Please see my article in Internet Day for more details:

Email me and let me know what you decide.
