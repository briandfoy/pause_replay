Subject: Module submission FulltextSearch::CLucene

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FulltextSearch::CLucene
  DSLIP:       RdhOp
  description: CLucene C++ full text search engine
  userid:      PEDWARDS (Peter Edwards)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl.modules http://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene

  similar:
    PLucene (similar concept, but PLucene is pure perl while CLucene is
    a wrapper to a separate C++ engine). Search::FreeText. htDig/mifluz.

  rationale:

    This module is a perl/swig/C++ wrapper to CLucene, a fast C++
    reimplementation of the java Lucene free text search engine. CLucene
    has been around a few years and is stable beta quality software
    intended for real world use in searching. It is fast and the insert
    time does not degrade as you add new documents.

    I've classified it under 11) String Processing, Language Text
    Processing, Parsing and Searching rather than 25) as it is not
    commercial software. It doesn't fit well with the modules in the
    existing Search:: section so I've given it the namespace of
    FulltextSearch::CLucene that I asked about in post
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/39723.

  enteredby:   PEDWARDS (Peter Edwards)
  enteredon:   Fri May 13 15:04:03 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

FulltextSearch::
::CLucene         RdhOp CLucene C++ full text search engine          PEDWARDS
