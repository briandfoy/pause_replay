Subject: Module submission Maypole::Plufin::Authorization
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Maypole::Plufin::Authorization
  DSLIP:       Rmphp
  description: Role-based authorization for Maypole apps.
  userid:      DJH (Dave Howorth)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    maypole@lists.netthink.co.uk

  similar:

  rationale:

    The namespace is this obvious choice for this module. Early
    releases have already been published on the Maypole list with this
    name.

  enteredby:   DJH (Dave Howorth)
  enteredon:   Sun Feb 20 17:00:12 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Maypole::Plufin::
::Authorization   Rmphp Role-based authorization for Maypole apps.   DJH
