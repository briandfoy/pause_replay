Yes, I agree. And seeing I've just had an idea for how to write BACK to
multiple files/dirs/formats, the Loader name is probably too
non-specific and limited.

I'm in two minds about this (and I'll admit that partly it is out of
pride), but I'd like my module to be used, which means the name needs to
be:
 - visible
 - easy to remember
 - not confused with another module

Pros for "Config::Any::Merge":
 - the Any implies the multiple formats
 - the Merge describes what it does, merging trees of config files,   
   plus local overrides
 - the Config::Any namespace has traction, which might lead people
   on to my module

Cons for "Config::Any::Merge":
 - it implies an interface relationship with Config::Any which there 
   isn't
 - it hides the module away under a 3rd level namespace
   which also makes (eg) Config::Any::Merge::Writer quite 
   a keyboardfull :)

Other suggestions:
 - Config::Merge (the author has offered to vacate the namespace)
 - Config::Tree (does the Tree imply something else?)

You guys have more experience with this than me, so I'll abide by your
better judgement (ie I'll take whatever you throw at me ;)

thanks

Clint
