DR. SANI BARE
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLUEM RESOURCES (F.M.P.R) 
LAGOS-NIGERIA. 

ATTN: SIR, 
                                    REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE- STRICTLY =
CONFIDENTIAL 

I am DR. SANI BARE, an accountant in the Ministry of petroleum Resources =
(MPR) and a member of a three-man Tender Board in charge of contract review =
and payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable =
person to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer =
of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but =
exercise patience and read on. There were series of contracts executed by a =
consortium Multinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of =
Petroleum Resources among which were: 

1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down =
stream product distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million.
2.  Contract for the Turn around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries =
in the country: US$ 152 Million. 
3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 =
Million. 

The original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced to the =
sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and is =
now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed =
these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. =
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to =
your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant and are =
prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant Laws) from opening =
operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed on =
you at this juncture is enormous. 

In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum while 10% =
shall be set aside for accidental expenses (Internal & External) between the =
parties in the course of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up an =
investment plan for us of which you will control since we cannot bring our =
shares back to Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in real estate in =
your country.

You must however note that this transaction is subjected to the following =
terms and conditions: 
1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence. 
2. 2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and =
confidentiality because of the circumstances we now find ourselves. 
3. 3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have =
absolute control. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the presidency at the =
Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 =
working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our =
assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. 

To accord this transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security =
of the parties involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be =
officially and legally processed with your name or the name of your company =
you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main =
reason of contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to =
invest these funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be of =
immense help in this regards. 

Kindly expedite action so as to enable us include this transaction into this =
batch as payment to foreign contractors is usually carried out on quarterly =
basis. 

Please, contact me as soon as possible on my private e-mail address: =
sanibare@netscape.net

Best regards, 

DR. SANI BARE
