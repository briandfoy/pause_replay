1. Yes, I tried the forgot password link twice.  The first time was last =
week and the second was earlier today.
2. We do filter email, but I don't believe any messages are dropped =
outright.  They should end up quarantined in different folders based on =
whether they are spam, virus infected, etc.  The messages will go away =
after a week in that state, but I check the folders daily in case any of =
my mailing list traffic is incorrectly categorized.

I have received the automatic replies from bitbucket@cpan.org and your =
email (obviously) reached me, but that is all.  What email address would =
the password emails be coming from?  Are they sent from a possibly =
blacklisted SMTP server?

Thanks much,

Peter

it looks like your email address is correct in your PAUSE account.

did you try the "Forgot Password?" item in the PAUSE menu?

   http://pause.perl.org

are you filtering mail, by any chance?
