Hi,

on 2013-03-31 I sent the following message to Anthony Kilna 
<anthony@kilna.com>, the author of Quote::Reference:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi,

I want to upload a module I've written to CPAN. My preferred name for it 
would be "Quote::Reference". Obviously that's not possible because 
you're already using this name. (To be honest, I actually uploaded a 
v0.01 without checking the name was available first. I'm sorry about that.)

I wanted to ask you if you'd agree to rename your module and let me take 
over the name Quote::Reference.

Your documentation says the module is just a silly experiment and you 
don't expect anyone to actually use it. And it uses source filtering, 
which can cause mysterious failures in code. For these reasons I assume 
you're not overly attached to the code.

My version is based on the "pluggable keyword" mechanism in newer perls 
(so it doesn't break), and of course I intend to use it in real code. :-)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't received a response yet.

My questions: What can I do? Should I just choose a different name? Or 
can I get comaintainership even though I intend to completely replace 
the module by an incompatible version? Is there another way to reach 
KILNA (apparently inactive since 2012-08-30)?


Looking for advice,
