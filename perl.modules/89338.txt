The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tinkerforge
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Official Tinkerforge API binding.
  userid:      ISHRAQ (Ishraq Ibne Ashraf)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/Tinkerforge/generators/issues

  similar:

  rationale:

    Tinkerforge GmbH produces easy to use embedded hardware. The
    products are basically divided into two groups, Bricks and
    Bricklets. Tinkerforge approach to embedded electronics is focused
    on simplicity of usage. The users doesn't need to have detailed and
    specialized knowledge on the systems and more interestingly the
    Tinkerforge API currently supports 11 programming languages and more
    to come. This gives the user of the system freedom to choose the
    language the user is comfortable with to program the system.

    The Perl API support module does that same thing.

    It is logical to request for a root level namespace `Tinkerforge::`
    because this clearly indicates the purpose and more importantly all
    our devices are implemented as Perl modules which will be under this
    namespace. It's more intuitive for the users to start using the API
    bindings in their Perl program in the following way,

    `use Tinkerforge::IPConnection;` `use Tinkerforge::BrickMaster;`
    `use Tinkerforge::BrickletHumidity;`

    More information about the system and detailed documentation can be
    found here, http://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/index.html

The resulting entry would be:

Tinkerforge       RdpOa Official Tinkerforge API binding.            ISHRAQ
