That's great, Robin, Welcome, Thanks for the offer.

I made you admin on the PAUSE, so please enjoy playing with the new
menu that appears for you and ask questions if anything is unclear.

I'll have to dig out the instructions how to subscribe you to
modules@perl.org. Maybe Ask beats me to it.

The hard part of the whole task is giving advice for namespaces
especially giving consistent advice. That's why the group should not
become too big. The archive of modules@ is at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/. Please get some
inspiration from there, especially from Tim's, our silken voice,
postings.

Cheers,
