The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::ICal
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Class for ICal date objects
  userid:      RBOW (Rich Bowen)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Reefknot, datetime@perl.org mailing lists

  similar:
    Date::ISO, Date::Discordian, Date::Tolkien::Shire

  rationale:

    ICal (or, more accurately, iCalendar) is a proposed standard for
    expressing date, time, and scheduling information. This module is a
    very low-level one, encapsulating just the date portion of iCal.
    This will be used in Net::ICal, specifically as the basis if
    Net::ICal::Time. It is also proposed, and has been discussed on the
    datetime@perl.org mailing list, as a possible base module that will
    be used by other Date::* modules so that one calendar type can be
    seamlessly converted to another, because they all speak the same
    language internall. Hance, you could create a Date::Discordian
    object, rebless it into the Date::Tolkien::Shire class, and have it
    just work.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::ICal            bdpOp Class for ICal date objects                  RBOW
