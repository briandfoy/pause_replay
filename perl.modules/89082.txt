It's basically irrelevant, except as a means to get feedback on naming.

However, bdfoy[0] seems to still like approving modulelist entries and since
he's an excellent trainer and author it's a net win for the community for
him to look like his opinions are still relevant whether my personal
belief that it's irrelevant is correct or not, so I vote for leaving
things as-is until we run out of volunteers who care enough to approve them.

I would, however, appreciate a de-emphasisation of the registration process
that's reasonable about the benefits it purports to deliver should you do so.

[0] Brian and I don't get on. We just happen to care about professionalism
and the success of the community more than we care about our disagreements.
