Hi.

I am working on a module that makes it possible to write small chunks of
code that carries out various transformation on large amounts of data
(fast!). The transformations are handled by something I call data
transformers that can be plugged together in many different ways.

I currently use it to pull data out of (and later load it back into) a
very large relational database at a company, I work for, but the toolkit
has been
carefully written to be entirely independent of data source and
destinations.

The module is almost ready to be published, but I need to figure out
what to call it. I am most inclined to call it Data::Stream, since it is
a kind of data stream framework.

Any comments?

Regards,

Michael.
