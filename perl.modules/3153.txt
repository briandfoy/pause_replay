Subject: namespace for 'system'-like package

From: reichert@numachi.com (Brian Reichert)

I have cobbled together a perl module to act, in effect, as a
varient of 'system', with the added feature of being able to get
to both the STDOUT and STDERR of a child process.  More specialized
and cheaper to run than Open3.

Anyway, the way I'm privately using it:

  use System2;

  my @args = qw(ls -laF);

  my ($status, $out, $err) = system2(@args);

  print "OUT: $out\n";

  my ($exit, $signal, $core) = &System2::exit_status($status);

etc.

Does anyone have any suggestions suggestions for a proper namespace for
this?
