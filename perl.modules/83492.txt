The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::NSS::X509
  DSLIP:       adcro
  description: Perl extension to NSS's
  userid:      BERNHARD (Bernhard Amann)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    https://github.com/amannb/perl-nss

  similar:
    Crypt::X509 Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 Crypt::NSS

  rationale:

    This module exports a big part of the X.509 API of the Network
    Security Services (NSS).

    NSS is the library which is currently being used for encryption by
    Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

    The library allows to load x.509 certificates (and CRLs), query
    certificate information and validate certificates.

    The basic functionality is similar to Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 (I tried
    to keep the interface very similar). However, NSS offers a wider
    range of functionality in certain areas. Especially the certificate
    verification functions use a much more lenient chain building
    algorithm, hence allowing more certificate chains to be validated.
    It also supports other features like the X.509 AIA extension.

    Using this library you can get (nearly) the same results that
    browsers would get when verifying a certificate. It is also easily
    possible to examine the certificate chains that the library used for
    validation.

    Crypt::NSS itself offers only as much of the NSS X.509
    functionality as necessary to establish SSL connections - this will
    (very very probably) not change in the future (and much of the
    functionality in this library is out of scope for that).

    Current source is available at https://github.com/amannb/perl-nss

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::NSS::
::X509            adcro Perl extension to NSS's                      BERNHARD
