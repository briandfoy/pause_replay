The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Lock
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: simple and safe local/network locking
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    template toolkit mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    Provide a safe and simple way to lock across boxes or locally.
    Memcached offers an add function which is atomic, so to start, I am
    really just wrapping around that function. Plan to also use mysql,
    postgres or another db, if the interest is there.

    Should be able to lock rather simply around anything that has a
    network safe method that is atomic.

  enteredby:   EARL (Earl Cahill)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct 21 08:06:11 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::Lock            adpOg simple and safe local/network locking        EARL
