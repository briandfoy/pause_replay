Hi PAUSE admins!

I would like to adopt the Tk::Zinc module. Could you please assign it to my
PAUSE ID ASB or make me co-maintainer?

I contacted the author Patrick Lecoanet. He has access to the corresponding
Bitbucket repository where all the source code and documentation resides.
But he does not have access to the PAUSE account. A colleague of his did it
in the past.
Her did not reach the colleague so he asked if there would be a way to
somehow adopt the module.

So, according to list item no. 2 on
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_adopt_module I would like to ask
if you could assign the module to me. Or make me co-maint, so I can upload
the module.

Best regards,
Alex
