     why:

    I have been a avid user of CPAN for many years and have extensive
    experience in using perl (a language I am very fond of although it
    is not as much in "vogue" as other languages).

    I have been working on some modules of my own and I want to in the
    short term contribute a module for handling HTML template files
    which are more sophisticated than the ones I have used so far (like
    the nice HTML::Template module). It can handle more tags to ease the
    work of generating a home page and it also works with scalar, arrays
    and hashes for variables. It can handle foreach-loops, for-loops
    using both arrays and hashes, sorting, logical statements with
    variables and operator (HTML::Template eg. only handles true or
    untrue statements). It also makes it more easy to generate
    drop-downs (select), checkboxes and radio-buttons using just one
    hash (much easier and with more options than perls CGI-module). My
    module understands global and local vars (that is local to foreach-
    and for-loops) and it understand variables that are specific to a
    certain loop-run on an array or hash (to address the value of a
    field for a specific run of a loop). I always found HTML::Template,
    although nice, a bit restricted when it came to how variables were
    handled. It will also handle unix time date conversions which are
    handy when working with databases and time stamps.

    Anyways - we will see what comes more in the future, but quite soon
    I am ready to publish my HTML template module...
