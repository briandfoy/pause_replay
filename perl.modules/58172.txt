The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Queue::Beanstalk
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Client library for the beanstalkd server
  userid:      LUNATIC (Håkon Nessjøen)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I would like to use the namespace Queue::Beanstalk because
    beanstalkd is a job queueing system.

    It is quite inspired by the simplicity of memcached.

    Currently only supported by ruby,
    http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd/

  enteredby:   LUNATIC (Håkon Nessjøen)
  enteredon:   Wed Dec 12 07:03:39 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Queue::
::Beanstalk       adpOp Client library for the beanstalkd server     LUNATIC
