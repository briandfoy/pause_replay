     why:

    I have written a debugger module which is powerful extension of
    perl's interactive debugger. some of the features of the extension
    are lexical scanning and rendering the data elements automati-cally
    to correlate with code flow, support for flexible breakpoints and
    various modes for debugging the forked process.
