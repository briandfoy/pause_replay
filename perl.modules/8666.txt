The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Piet::Interpreter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interpreter for Piet programming language
  userid:      MAJCHER (Marc Majcher)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Befunge::Interpreter

  rationale:

    I've implemented a basic interpreter for the Piet programming
    language, as described at
    http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~mar/esoteric/piet.html. It is an
    "esoteric" language, in the spirit of Intercal, Befunge, Brainf**k,
    and many others - not very useful, but fun to program in, for
    certain values of "fun". I'm requesting the Piet root level
    namespace for consistency with the only other esoteric language
    interpreter I've seen on CPAN, Befunge::Interpreter. I don't think
    it belongs under the Language:: namespace, as it is not a "real"
    language. If there is a more appropriate name, I'd be happy to use
    it.
