- apply for a cpan account at pause.perl.org

- upload a developer release of the new codebase (i.e. use a version
  string in the tarball that matches /\d_\d/)

- make a patch from the current official version to your dev release
  and post it to the Text::EP3 queue at rt.cpan.org. There you can
  provide prose about your work to the current owner and the world

Alternatively you can do the last step alone but if you do the others
you have the additional benefit to accumulate feedback from cpan
testers about test failures.

Let me know if I should elaborate on any of the above.

Good luck,
