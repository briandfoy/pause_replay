Come on, I've submitted my fully functional, freeware module, accepted 
and registered as a namespace, and waited over five months for it to be 
available in the CPAN search engine.

All advice mentioned, to add $VERSION string, has been implemented.

Is there a method of speeding this process up?

I have added the $VERSION string as mentioned, after no adding to search
engine for five months. It has been two days and is not showing in
results. How long is it expected to take?
