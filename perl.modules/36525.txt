The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Makes building complex GUI's easy
  userid:      JRED (Jörn Reder)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailing list: gtk-perl-list@gnome.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a framework which tries to make building complex Gtk2 GUI's
    easy, by offering these two main features:

    1. Consistent looking GUI without the need to code resp. tune each
    widget by hand. Instead you declare the structure of your GUI,
    connect it to the data of your program (which should be a well
    defined set of objects) and control how this structure is
    transformed into a specific layout in a very generic way.

    2. Automatically keep widget and object states in sync (in both
    directions), even with complex data structures with a lot of
    internal dependencies, object nesting etc.

    Currently no other module wich a similar functionality exists.

    The namespace follows the recommendation of the Gtk2 development
    team for pure Perl extensions, and thus uses the Gtk2::Ex prefix.
    The name was discussed in the gtk-perl-list@gnome.org mailing list,
    without objections.

The resulting entry would be:

Gtk2::Ex::
::FormFactory     bdpOg Makes building complex GUI's easy            JRED
