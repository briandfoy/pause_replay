Hey all-

I have a bunch of new modules I'd like to add to CPAN as both
fully-functional Perl 5 modules and also prototypes of proposed Perl 6
additions:


Name             DSLI  Description                                 
---------------- ----  --------------------------------------------
File::Object     adph  open() supporting fileobjects, extensibility
Date::Object     adph  Date function/OO replacements for localtime
Time::Unix       adpf  Make time() use UNIX epoch on all platforms
URI::Embed       adpf  Allow URIs to be used in Perl builtins
IO::Default      adpf  Add $DEFIN, $DEFOUT, $DEFERR I/O variables
Class::Handler   adpO  Make Apache-like pseudoclass event handlers
Class::Overload  adpO  Object-based polymorphic overloading
Regexp::Func     adpf  Replace =~, !~, m//, s/// with functions
Module::Autoload idph  Load module functions in scripts on-demand


Let me know if you need more info. That last one is different from
'autouse' in that it uses a separate config file to decide which modules
to load based on which functions are used. I'm not sure it can be done
without core hooks, but I'm working on it. :-)

Thanks!
Nate


P.S. I originally sent this email from 'nate@west.sun.com' at the start
of the week, but didn't get a response. If you're just busy, that's
fine, but if you have mail filters setup, could you add
'nate@west.sun.com' as an "ok" address? If this is too difficult (i.e.
the filters are autogenerated) don't worry about it. Thanks.
