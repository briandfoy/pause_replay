you have quite a bit of say in this.

here are the options i can think of, but other people might have more
ideas.

   1. Not register it.  This maintains the current situation.

   2. Choose a better name and use it for future versions.  This
   affects people who start using it now, and leaves people 
   already using it in the present situation.

   3. Convince somebody else to register it to you.

remember that the PAUSE admins are a loose collection of volunteers,
and not all of us have been doing the work all of the time.
