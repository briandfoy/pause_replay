It was indexed under 4 other namespaces but not under the fifth,
Yahoo::Search::Request.

Nowadays two solutions are popular

(1) add a $VERSION assignment near the top of the file. If you do not
    want to have a VERSION in every file, $VERSION = "undef" or
    $VERSION = 0 are OK from the indexer's point of view (but users
    might prefer version numbers that increase from time to time to
    track dependencies). Complex assignment constructs that need more
    than one line or involve reading of other files are not feasible
    in the indexer environment.

    In any case the following paragraph, taken from
    http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html tells you how to test:

      Please make sure all your *.pm files contain a $VERSION variable
      that conforms to the CPAN rules, i.e. the complete computation
      of $VERSION must take place on the one first line within the
      module that assigns to it. You can test if this is the case by
      running

          perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le 'print MM->parse_version(shift)' 'file'

      on the filenames in question. The CPAN indexer will run this
      code within a Safe compartement, so maybe even if the above
      command succeeds, PAUSE may fail if you're doing file IO or
      other potentially dangerous things within that line.

(2) Use Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, it adds a
    "provides" stanza to the META.yml so that the indexer takes just
    that and does not parse the files for $VERSION. Instead,
    Module::Build parses the files under your control. You might end
    up with the same requirement that Module::Build wants $VERSION
    assignment. I do not know how well this works.

In theory you could do (3): write you own provides stanza for META.yml
but this doesn't seem like a good idea because the META spec does not
seem stable yet.

Hope that helps, Regards,
