It is correct that I have registered the namespace "AFS" and I am
using it since 2002.  I have uploaded the following versions

  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.00.tar.gz]      2 Jul 2002
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.01.tar.gz]      8 Jul 2002
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.03.tar.gz]     15 Oct 2002
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.2.0.tar.gz]     3 Feb 2004
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.2.1.tar.gz]     9 Mar 2004
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.2.2.tar.gz]     6 May 2004
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.2.3.tar.gz]    17 Feb 2005
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [AFS-2.4.0.tar.gz]    20 Feb 2006

And at the moment I am working on version "2.4.1".

As attachment you can find the latest email from my CPAN uploads.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to support you in
sorting out this issue.

Cheers,

Norbert
