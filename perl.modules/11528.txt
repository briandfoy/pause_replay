The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::CTable
  DSLIP:       MnpOp
  description: Read, write, manipulate tabular data
  userid:      CHTHORMAN (Chris Thorman)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Table

  rationale:

    Data::CTable is like Data::Table, but uses a more efficient and
    accessible underlying data representation and also has many more
    features designed to make data interchange extremely convenient. It
    is highly factored to allow very easy and powerful lightweight
    subclasses. It also comes with a number of sample subclasses and
    utilities. It can also cache data files using Storable. It is a new
    and complete rewrite of a module that I have been using for
    real-world projects for over 6 years; hence I designated it "mature"
    although this is the first public release.

    The module has a home page at:

    http://christhorman.com/projects/perl/Data-CTable/

    ... you can view full docs & source, etc. there.

    Some passages from the docs:

    Data::CTable is a comprehensive utility for reading, writing,
    manipulating, cleaning and otherwise transforming tabular data. The
    distribution includes several illustrative subclasses and utility
    scripts.

    A Columnar Table represents a table as a hash of data columns,
    making it easy to do data cleanup, formatting, searching,
    calculations, joins, or other complex operations.

    The object's hash keys are the field names and the hash values hold
    the data columns (as array references).

    ...snip...

    Data::CTable reads and writes any tabular text file format
    including Merge, CSV, Tab-delimited, and variants. It transparently
    detects, reads, and preserves Unix, Mac, and/or DOS line endings and
    tab or comma field delimiters -- regardless of the runtime platform.

    In addition to reading data files, CTable is a good way to gather,
    store, and operate on tabular data in memory, and to export data to
    delimited text files to be read by other programs or interactive
    productivity applications.

    Similar / related modules on CPAN

    The Data::Table module by Yingyao Zhou & Guangzhou Zou offers
    similar functionality, but uses a different underlying data
    representation (2-dimensional array), and has a somewhat different
    feature set. Check it out. Maybe you will prefer it for your
    application.

    http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Data::Table

    The Data::ShowTable module renders tables in various viewable
    formats. CTable relies on ShowTable's ShowBoxTable method to
    implement its own format() and out() methods.
