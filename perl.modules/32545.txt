The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Shelly
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Yet Another Shell-Kit/ReadLine Interface
  userid:      PSIONIC (Jordan Sissel)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    cvs repo, email with the developer, developer's website website.

  similar:
    Term::ReadLine

  rationale:

    Term::Shelly is good. You love it. Go ahead, touch it... touch it!
    you want to... it commands you to touch it. Zorro would, why won't
    you? Come on! You can do anything at zombo.. er.. Term::Shelly...

    Term::Shelly is a.. Shell.. kit.. thing. Thus it's module name is
    appropriate. it is not a Term::ReadLine derivative and thus isn't
    named such.

  enteredby:   PSIONIC (Jordan Sissel)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun  4 04:46:53 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::Shelly          cdpOp Yet Another Shell-Kit/ReadLine Interface     PSIONIC
