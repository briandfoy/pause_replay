The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::WalshTransform
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Fast Hadamard and Walsh Transforms
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module provides Hadamard transforms and Walsh transforms. The
    two are very closely related, but Walsh transforms are more
    frequently used. The name conforms with 00modlist.long.txt where it
    says "Always try to use two or more whole words". Also included are
    routines for converting a Hadamard to a Walsh transform and vice
    versa, for calculating the Logical Convolution of two lists, or the
    Logical Autocorrelation of a list, and for calculating the Walsh
    Power Spectrum - in short, almost everything you ever wanted to do
    with a Walsh Transform.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::WalshTransform  bdpfp Fast Hadamard and Walsh Transforms           PJB
