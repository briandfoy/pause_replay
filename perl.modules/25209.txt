The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::Part
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Partition one array into several
  userid:      BRENTDAX (Brent Dax)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks (node 225721); the concept has been discussed on p6l

  similar:

  rationale:

    The namespace choice is obvious--it's a module designed for use
    with lists, and it implements the part() function. The function is
    named "part" because its Perl 6 equivalent carries that name (or did
    last time I checked); a search of the p6l archives ought to turn up
    the rationale, but basically it's because it's short for "partition"
    and many other appropriate words. It is not under Perl6 because it
    isn't designed to be a perfect emulation--just a similar function.

    I think it should be listed because it is useful and (as far as I
    can tell) unique. Listing will help people who can use the module
    find it.

The resulting entry would be:

List::
::Part            bdpfp Partition one array into several             BRENTDAX
