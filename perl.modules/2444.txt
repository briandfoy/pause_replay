Please note that I am re-sending this message with another SMTP after 
an unsuccessful attempt around 11:30pm -8:00 yesterday.  That copy 
may arrive eventually (if not lost), so please discard the duplicate.
---------------------------------

Context Note: I am releasing a succession of around 15 Perl 5 object 
modules.  Six of these are complete and documented, and will be 
submitted quickly.  The others are working but not fully documented, 
so I am holding them back for the moment.  All of these modules, with 
info on how they can be used together (and working examples), are 
available at http://www.DarrenDuncan.net.  They have temporary names 
in the DDuncan::* name space.  They all require 5.004 for 
consistency, although some can do with less.
-----------------------------------------------

Here is #1:

Name                DSLI  Description                                     Info
------------------  ---- 
----------------------------------------------  -------
Data::HashOfArrays  bdpO  data (text,bin) store/parse/url-encode, 
subset  DUNCAND

I strongly request suggestions of alternate names for this module, as 
there are doubtless some of you who have better ideas on what it 
should be called.  Likewise, suggestions for a better brief 
description for use in the module list.

For a description, I have provided part of this module's POD at the 
end of this letter.  The rest of the POD is on my site.

Let it be known that at least 5 of my other modules use this one.

Good days,

// Darren Duncan

DDuncan::HashOfArrays - Perl module that implements a hash whose keys can have
either one or several associated values.

works until a more appropriate and integrated name can be found.  A possibility
could be "Hash::MultiValued">

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl 5 object class implements a simple data structure that is 
similar to a
hash except that each key can have several values instead of just 
one.  There are
many places that such a structure is useful, such as database records whose
fields may be multi-valued, or when parsing results of an html form 
that contains
several fields with the same name.  This class can export a wide variety of
key/value subsets of its data when only some keys are needed.  In 
addition, this
class can parse and create url-encoded strings, such as with http 
query or cookie
strings, or for encoding binary information in a text file.

While you could do tasks similar to this class by making your own 
hash with array
refs for values, you will need to repeat some messy-looking code everywhere you
need to use that data, creating a lot of redundant access or parsing code and
increasing the risk of introducing errors.
