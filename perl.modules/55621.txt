The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fcntl::Flock
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: 'struct flock' data type for fcntl
  userid:      ANDERS (Anders Johnson)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::NFSLock

  rationale:

    File::NFSLock uses a standard trick for locking files (actually,
    directory entries) over NFS. This trick is widely supported, but it
    has a number of drawbacks, chief among them that locks are easily
    orphaned. Furthermore, the mechanism is unfair, inefficient and
    complicated.

    A more robust mechanism is to use fcntl locking. The main drawback
    to fcntl locking is that it is not universally supported. In fact,
    there is no portable mechanism to do it in Perl. That's where
    Fcntl::Flock comes in.

    Once we can do low-level fcntl locking, we can build friendlier
    RAII interfaces around that mechanism, such as a drop-in replacement
    for File::NFSLock (with certain caveats).

The resulting entry would be:

Fcntl::
::Flock           adcOp 'struct flock' data type for fcntl           ANDERS
