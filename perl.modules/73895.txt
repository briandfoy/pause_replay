Dear CPAN maintainers,

I'm requesting a comaint status on 
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Stash-AutoEscape/ which was created by Ma 
La ( https://github.com/mala ; http://search.cpan.org/~mala/ ). I forked his 
repository on github and implemented some enhancements, which he has applied 
to his copy, but he did not release a new version to CPAN. Furthermore, the 
Changes file inside the repository was not kept up-of-date from some reason,
and there are no tags inside the git repository for the 0.02 and 0.03 CPAN 
releases. 

I filed bug reports about it months ago here:

* https://github.com/mala/Template-Stash-AutoEscape/issues#issue/2

* https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=62641

and received no response.

So I'm requesting a comaint status on that module, so I can upload my 
improvements and continue to improve it if necessary, also because I'd like to 
utilise it for two projects, one of them my day job's project.

Thanks in advance,

	Shlomi Fish
