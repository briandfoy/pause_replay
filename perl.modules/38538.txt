Wouldn't it be sufficient to use different directories within your
home directory to keep the modules apart from each other? Why should
other parts of the whole system need to distinguish between two
identities of the same person? The relationship between you and your
employer should not really be exported to the world, should it?

I'm not intending to complicate things for you, but I do not feel
comfortable when I envision that other developers start having
multiple identities based on the roles they play in real life.

Please convince us that the second ID is really helpful to somebody.

Thanks,
