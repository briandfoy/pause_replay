Not directly. The namespace index on PAUSE is
CPAN/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz. I don't know how exactly this
index influences search.cpan.org.

You mean, if people ask CPAN.pm to update threads, they should
actually get forks.pm? If you want that, you need to ask Artur and
Jarkko if they make you co-maintainer. To me this looks dangerous.

The PAUSE indexer has a 1 to 1 mapping of namespaces to distributions,
i.e. only one file on CPAN can be mapped to a given namespace.

search.cpan.org is a different beast. It can list unlimited documents
associated with a given query term.

Fair enough. Fixed.
