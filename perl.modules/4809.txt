This is over a month old, and has still not been added to the database.
I'd appreciate a reply if the name space was rejected for some reason.

Otherwise, I expect a first CPAN upload of CGI::Test in 2 weeks.

I'm about to start developping a test framework to allow testing
of CGI applications "offline", i.e. without plugging them into a
web server.

I was thinking to use the CGI::Test namespace.  Would that be ok?

DLSI follows:

CGI::
::Test        i     Off-line CGI regression test framework    RAM
