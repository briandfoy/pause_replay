The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PTools
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Collection of Perl Tools for Tool Developers
  userid:      CCOBB (Chris Cobb)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    At Hewlett-Packard for years, and in "c.l.p.m" this afternoon.

  similar:
    Most are unique. Some wrap procedural modules in OO clothing.

  rationale:

    Long time CPAN user, first time submitter. So, first things first.
    I've got some tools to submit that rely on some lower level modules,
    and I'll need to submit the meta-tools first.

    Things like OO interfaces to Getopt::Long, Date::Format and
    Date::Parse; a module to turn a script into a daemon process;
    another to handle all the counters in an application. Nothing quite
    like them around already.

    Includes a couple of modules that implement a flexible, multi-tier
    library heirarchy for larger applications that makes the development
    and evolution of modules and apps a lot easier. These also allow for
    completely relocatable Perl apps without modification to directory
    paths.

    Originally these were just in the top-level name space, so I've
    just recently collected them under the PTools::* space. Seemed like
    the best name choice. I have, for years, created documention and
    given presentations and tutorials introducing these as "Perl Tools"
    for "Perl Tool Developers".

    As meta-tools, I hope you like the idea of "PTools::*" Thanks!
