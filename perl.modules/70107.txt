Subject: Re: Module submission IPC::MMA
Date: Thu, 25 Feb 2010 19:23:56 -0800
To: modules@perl.org
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.753.1)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: mackenna@animalhead.com

Should you have notified me of the non-approval at the time?
Perhaps you did, but I save all emails and have no record of it.

Now we are more than a year down the road and many people know of
the module as IPC::MMA due to:

1. emails to Perl testers about installing the prerequisite C library  
mm.
2. correspondence about testing issues and bug fixes.
3. emails on the mod_perl list
4. emails on the module_authors list
5. threads on perlmonks

Also I would submit that this is far more than maintenance.
It was a rewrite from scratch, plus addition of a complete array
facility and usable, internally redesigned locking.

All I can think of to do is to bcc a number of people who have
helped me or corresponded with me on this module, and/or have used it.
I do this in the hope that they will write to you encouraging you to
approve a "done deal" with respect to the name.

Best Regards,
Craig MacKenna (cmac)
