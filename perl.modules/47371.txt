thanks for the pointers.  I'll go for Math::Logic::Ternary.
The short description should be updated to:

Math::Logic::Ternary - ternary logic and related operations

I had seen the Term "ternary" mainly in conjunction with number
systems before but apparently "ternary logic" is not uncommon
either.

Should I apply for a new namespace registration now or will
this email do?

Yours,
	Martin
