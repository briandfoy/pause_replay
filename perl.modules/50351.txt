The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::OpenSSL::AES
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: Interface to AES functionality in OpenSSL
  userid:      TTAR (Tolga Tarhan)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    None yet

  similar:
    Crypt::Rijndael

  rationale:

    Crypt::OpenSSL::AES is an XS-wrapper around OpenSSL's AES (Advanced
    Encryption Standard) library.

    This module is an alternative to the implementation provided by
    Crypt::Rijndael which implements AES itself. In contrast, this
    module is simply a wrapper around the OpenSSL library.

    The Crypt::Rijndael implementation seems to produce inaccurate
    results on 64-bit x86 machines. By using OpenSSL, this module aims
    to avoid architecture specific problems, allowing the OpenSSL
    maintainers to overcome such issues.

    The namespace choice is logical because there are many other
    Crypt::OpenSSL:: modules which implement interfaces to other parts
    of the OpenSSL library.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::OpenSSL::
::AES             adcOp Interface to AES functionality in OpenSSL    TTAR
