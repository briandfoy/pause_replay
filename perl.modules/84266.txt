The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::Replace
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Performs arbitrary replacement in strings
  userid:      MATHIAS (Mathias Kende)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    String::Replace is yet another templating system. However, it
    differs from other existing modules in two ways:

    - firstly, there is no imposed syntax for the replacement to be
    executed in template. This may be seen as a feature (usage is light
    and flexible) or as a bug (there is no advanced interpretation
    functionnalities).

    - secondly, and this is the important point, the library provides
    an OO interface which is centered around the replacement to be
    executed rather than around the template in which these replacement
    will be done. This feature is unique on CPAN (to the extent of the
    modules that I have found).

    So String::Replace will be particularly suited in situation where
    the same replacements will be done repeatedly on different inputs,
    whereas standard templating systems will be good when multiple
    different replacements will be done on the same input.

    Checked templating systems includes: String::Format,
    String::Template, String::Expand, String::Interpolate::Shell,
    String::Interpolate::RE, String::Interpolate, Text::Sprintf::Named,
    String::MatchInterpolate, Text::Template, Template::Sandbox,
    Template::Magic, and Template::Recall.

The resulting entry would be:

String::
