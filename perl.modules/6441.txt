I am starting work on Date::Cal, which is intended to allow users to store
and manipulate calendars, including features like auto-repeating events.

I would have chosen the name Date::Calendar, but it appears someone else
got there first.  However, it looks like that is a Mac-specific module,
so there is still a need for something which will work cross-platform.

If you have any comments either on the choice of name or the functionality,
please let me know.

Whilst there's not yet anything to release, it will eventually come under
the combined GNU/Artistic license, and will be supported by myself.

If you save all your money for three years, you'll be able to afford this
new computer.  If, however, you blow all your money on poker, booze and
loose women - you'll still be able to afford it in three years.
