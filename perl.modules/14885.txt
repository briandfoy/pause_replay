Hi Arthur (and other modules*)

I am happy to follow your advice. My feeling is that it sort of  
deserves a top level for the same reason that POE or DBI or other  
driver interfaces work.

But as I said, I am happy for you guys to guide us in the name.  
Filesys::Virtual definitely the right space if not top level.

We have just got the GnomeVFS compiling into the VFS structure. We are  
hoping to have a fully working release by early January.

Again, thanks for the quick response.

BTW. If we are going to go for Filesys::Virtual instead, should I be  
resubmitting the form ?
