The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Dancer::Plugin::Legacy
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Support and Denote Deprecated Routes
  userid:      DRZIGMAN (Robert Stone)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Dancer's convention is for all plugins to live in the
    Dancer::Plugin::* namespace. This module allows users to in place
    refactor their routing tables in pieces rather than en masse.

    get "/bad/name/for/route" => &controller_do_thing;

    Can become: get "/good/name/for/route" => &controller_do_thing
    legacy_get "/bad/name/for/route" => &controller_do_thing;

    This allows developers to restructure and clean up their routing
    tables while preserving the interface for integration points until
    such time as the consumers can update their code as well.

    The legacy_* prefix will also support additional logging (to
    identify who is still calling legacy routes) and other features as
    it continues to be developed (deprecated routes, obsolete routes,
    etc).

The resulting entry would be:

Dancer::Plugin::
::Legacy          adpfp Support and Denote Deprecated Routes         DRZIGMAN
