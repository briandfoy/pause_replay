Subject: Namespace request for CGI::State
Mime-Version: 1.0

From: dan@mealtips.com (Dan Kubb)

I would like to request the following namespace CGI::State

Name        DLSI Description                            Info
----------- ---- -------------------------------------- ----
CGI::State  bdpf CGI params into multi-dimensional hash DKUBB

I have already had a conversation with Andreas J. Koenig
regarding this namespace, the reply to which can be seen at:

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-11/msg00238.html

I did some research, as suggested, and but Andreas is right, State
does best fit the namespace considering the module use.

Taking this answer, and lack of reply to follow ups as a yes,
(the PAUSE doc defines a non-answer as general acceptance)
I will upload the module to my CPAN directory DKUBB.

Thanks,

Dan Kubb
