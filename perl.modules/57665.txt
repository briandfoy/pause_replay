Subject: Module submission DBIx::Class::Virtual
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Class::Virtual
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: DBIx::Class virtual entities
  userid:      CHUMP (Christopher Humphries)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    #dbix-class on irc.perl.org at the moment, more as it gets
    non-vaporware

  similar:

  rationale:

    To provide an interface to virtual database entities. Examples
    would be database portable views (like in PostgreSQL) and other
    DBIx::Class namespace items that may not actually be direct database
    entities.

    This would mainly be for whenever you need to have virtual entities
    that are at a higher level than the database itself, yet the
    Controller layer doesn't need and shouldn't need to know about the
    details of it (in MVC pattern software).

  enteredby:   CHUMP (Christopher Humphries)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov 13 10:01:26 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::Class::
::Virtual         idpOp DBIx::Class virtual entities                 CHUMP
