Hello,

I'm requesting a userid on pause so that I can post some of the
modules I've been working on to CPAN.

My information:

Name:			Patrick Devine
Email:			patrick@valinux.com
Homepage:		(none currently)
Preferred UserID:	PATRICK

The first module I would be posting is an OO module for creating
RedHat Kickstart configurations.  Basically it provides a programmer the
ability to call many different method types for configuring a system
(such as partitions, init services, and packages) which can then be used
to automagically spit out a Kickstart file.

It's possible that the same methods could be used for many different
types of systems (ie. other RPM based distributions or even debian), so
I'm not really sure how to name the module.  Potentially the methods
could be broken out and have sub-classes for various output types such
as Kickstart, or even XML descriptions of operating systems..

--Patrick.
