This is really up to you. If you intend to implement the module at some
point, you are welcome to keep the registration even it will take some
time. I'll remove it off the deletion list for now. If you ever decide
you are not going to use the namespace after all, you can delete the
registration yourself via the PAUSE menu: go to pause.perl.org, log in,
select "Edit Module Metadata", select the registration, change the
"Module life cycle" (or so) to "can be deleted".

Best regards,
Steffen
