Please don't. Of all 7 options presented in the mail you quoted, this is
the one which makes the least sense and will minimise the chances of people
finding your module and maximise the likelihood of confusion and accidental
reinvention.

"POGL" means absolutely nothing to somebody who isn't already aware of the
existence of other /POGL/ modules, of which there aren't any - just a
reference in OpenGL.pm (at least according to search.cpan.org)

I'd suggest you either go for ::OpenGL::POGL or ::PerlOpenGL - I prefer the
latter but if you like the POGL name then the former is probably equally
good in terms of clarity of naming.

Experience says the author of a module is often the last person you want
naming it - I can happily say that the modules of mine that other people
have named are all better named than the ones I named myself :)
