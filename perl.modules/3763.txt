There seems to have been no objection to have "Config::Ini" allocated. 
If possible I'd like to take "Config::Ini".  Here's a resubmission of
the request for your consideration please.

: Config::Ini       RdpO  Accesses Windows .ini and .reg files    AVATAR
: 
: I think it should go to the "12_Opt_Arg_Param_Proc" category.
: 
: This modules provides easy access to MS-Windows style .ini files, Unreal
: style extended .ini files (where multiple values can be associated with
: a single key), as well as registry files with automatic conversion from
: native Perl to Windows registry data encoding and vice versa.
: 
: IniFile was first released half a year ago and is used by UmodPack, an
: Unreal mod installer:
:     http://umodpack.sourceforge.net/
: 
: This module differs from another module, IniConf, in that this one
: supports single-key-multiple-value, Windows registry file format and has
: a different parser that may be a little more tolerant about wierd data.
: 
: Thanks for your time.
