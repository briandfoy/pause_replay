The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RRD::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Simple managed interface to RRD storage
  userid:      NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Talker, mailing lists, private PUG

  similar:
    RRDTool::OO

  rationale:

    This is a rewrite of an existing (fuller) module that I wrote and
    never publically released, which managed the creation and
    manipulation of RRD files through an OO interface.

    This module allows very simple creation and data updates of RRD
    stores, needing only datasource names, datasource types, and a
    general period of ageing to setup.

    Compared to the existing RRDs interface, and by extension the
    RRDTool::OO, this module allows a very clear and simple interface to
    store uncomplicated data sets.

    Hopefully the namespace should explain itself as fitting it well.
    There are any number of additional modules which could (and I think
    should) be placed under the RRD:: namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

RRD::
::Simple          bdpOg Simple managed interface to RRD storage      NICOLAW
