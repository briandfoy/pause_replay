The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EAI::AES
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Asynchronous Endpoint Server (for EAI)
  userid:      AIMASS (Alejandro Imass)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://www.p2ee.org

  similar:
    POE::Component::MessageQueue

  rationale:

    The proposed top level namespace is a mere suggestion. I am aware
    that top level namespaces are a problem and I could probably
    function under Net::.

    Nevertheless, the reason I am suggesting the new EAI top level
    namespace is because Enterprise Application Integration is a topic
    all by itself. Perhaps EAI could even be a module chapter and I
    submit this to consideration also.

    The module I am building is an Asynchronous Endpoint Server, based
    mostly on POE::Component::MessageQueue and other POE Components,
    Servers and Wheels. Of course, I use other CPAN modules as well. I
    am well aware that I could go under POE::Component or
    POE::Component::Server, but I am not actually extending POE. In
    fact, my module is both process-centric and event driven. In other
    words, the AES server itself is event driven, and the endpoints
    also, but each endpoint is a server process so it really does not
    fall completely in the SEDA paradigm.

    Besides, I discussed the issue on the POE mailing list and only two
    people bothered to answer, which showed me little interest from this
    particular community on my work. One of them was the author of
    PoCo::MessageQueue (David Snopek) I suspect because I posted on his
    MQ list also. The other person (Matt Sickler) suggested to find
    another namespace to publish my work. After several days of
    discussing the issue internally in my company we decided to ask you
    for the usage of the top-level EAI namespace.

    Please, review the short namespace discussion thread here:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/poe@perl.org/msg03854.html

    The name of the module itself, is very narrow because it implements
    a specific artifact specified in the widely accepted EAI terminology
    coined in the book "Enterprise Integration Patterns" by Gregor Hohpe
    and Bobby Woolf.

    Again, we are open to suggestion, since it's my first CPAN
    publication I could be very well be overlooking a perfectly fit
    existing namespace. But after a lot of internal debate and research,
    we truly believe a top level EAI or even an EAI chapter (as
    mentioned above) is needed on CPAN.

    Best regards, Alejandro Imass
