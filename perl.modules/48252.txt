Won't approve.

The root namespace is not the place for humor.

If it's a joke module, please see the Acme:: namespace.

Otherwise, please find an appropriate namespace (and possibly a less 
jokey name that more accurately reflects the module).

And you may wish to take a look at things like the mixin modules, or 
Sub::Install, etc.
