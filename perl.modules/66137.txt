The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Asterisk::CoroManager
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Asterisk Manager Interface, Coro version
  userid:      FIDDUR (Fredrik Liljegren)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    asterisk-perl@lists.gnuinter.net

  similar:
    Asterisk::Manager

  rationale:

    This is a rewrite of Asterisk::Manager, based on the Coro and
    AnyEvent, to provide an event-based API to the Asterisk Manager
    Interface. Since Coro is a heavy dependancy that changes things
    quite a lot for the programmer, I decided to put that into the name
    to show one big difference to Asterisk::Manager.

    Coro is also the reason I didn't just "fix" what I found lacking in
    Asterisk::Manager (in the asterisk-perl package), since it makes the
    usage quite different.

    I chose chapter-id 16 since the scope of Asterisk Managers often
    are to run as controlling daemons beside Asterisk itself.

The resulting entry would be:

Asterisk::
::CoroManager     bdpOp Asterisk Manager Interface, Coro version     FIDDUR
