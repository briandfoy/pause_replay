yes, it is. In terms of registrations, the module (namespace) names
count, not the distribution name.

So as it stands the link under "Registered Modules" on your
search.cpan.org authors page goes nowhere and you can't install the
package by running "cpan Games::Go::GoPair".

You can fix this by including a mostly empty "lib/Games/Go/GoPair.pm"
file in your distribution which contains a line "package
Games::Go::GoPair;". You could use that file as an entry point for new
users and add a little documentation.

Please note that this is entirely optional. If you're content as things
stand, that's fine. The registration will not be deleted since it's valid.

Best regards,
Steffen
