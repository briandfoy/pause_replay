The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::RVector
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: R Stats-like mathematical vector library
  userid:      BALDOWN (Josh Ballard)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://github.com/baldown/rvector, http://code.oofle.com/

  similar:
    Math::Vector::Real - has very basic math vector capability, lacks
    statistical capabilities.

  rationale:

    I decided to go with Statistics::RVector rather than
    Math::Vector::something for a few reasons. Since the background of
    the module is to mimic a statistics processing language capability,
    and since the added capability is ultimately about making
    statistical computing easier, this seemed the logic choice over
    Math:: as a basis.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
::RVector         RdpOp R Stats-like mathematical vector library     BALDOWN
