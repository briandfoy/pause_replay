First, if ::Parser, ::Regex, ::LibXML are just sub-modules of
HTML::StripScripts which are used internally, it only makes sense to
ever register the main namespace HTML::StripScripts so it turns up in
the module list.

Generally speaking, if you just upload, say, "Foo::Bar" to CPAN and it
hasn't been used before, you'll automatically be assigned primary
maintainer status on "first-come" basis. If somebody else uploads
something with the same namespace, it will not be indexed (i.e.
installed-by-default using CPAN.pm) unless that guy's made at least
co-maintainer. So in terms of "onwership", the first-come status is
quite similar to an actual registered namespace.

Registering the namespace is only a complementary action. A registered
namespace will be included in the module list under a certain category
(see search.cpan.org front page for example). Furthermore, it's possible
to reserve a namespace before uploading. (Though it's not intended for
long-term reservations without actual implementations.)

In your case, if you'd register the namespace, I *think* you'd have to
be made primary maintainer of HTML::StripScripts. We usually leave the
original author as primary maintainer in the PAUSE DB. Of course, if the
author agrees, that won't be a problem. Otherwise, I guess this would
have to be decided upon by brian or Andreas who have been involved for a
much longer time.

Best regards,
Steffen
