The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DNS::ZoneParse
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Parse and manipulate DNS Zone files
  userid:      SIMONFLK (Simon Flack)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    DNS::ZoneFile - It doesn't work and hasn't been worked on in a year.

  rationale:

    I originally requested namespace addition in March,
    (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-03/msg00056.html).

    Despite not being listed, quite a few people have turned up the
    module in the search and are using it.

    The module has grown and matured in response to user feedback.

    The next phase of development is to replace the regular-expression
    parsing routines with a Parse::RecDescent grammar. Not only will
    this allow for more complex parsing, such as round-robin dns. It
    will also be easier to make the parsing routine a subclass, so you
    can have different grammers for different DNS server zone files. At
    the moment it seems to work ok with Microsoft DNS and Bind, but I am
    not sure about others. I can also allow the user to provide their
    own grammars.

    All in all the feedback has been really good from users.

The resulting entry would be:

DNS::
::ZoneParse       RdpOp Parse and manipulate DNS Zone files          SIMONFLK
