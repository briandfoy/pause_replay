    It seems to me that it would be more appropriate as, e.g.,
Tree::Patricia.  It doesn't implement network protocols, rather it
manipulates data structures.  The fact that the elements of the
data structure _can_ obviously be interpreted as CIDR addresses and
netmasks doesn't prevent one from coming up with more dastardly uses
for the module.

    Very useful.  Thanks for your work!
