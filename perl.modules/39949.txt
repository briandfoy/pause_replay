Hi all,

I originally sent this to webmaster@search.cpan.org, but go no
reaction. I’m not sure if that was the right address or where
else I should send this if not, so I’m sending it to this list in
hopes that it will be bounced to the right contact.

It appears that search.cpan.org interprets my UTF-8 author name
as ISO-8859-1 before entity-encoding it. The name I set on PAUSE
is

    Αριστοτέλης Παγκαλτζής
    
but due to broken retranscoding, it appears on
<http://search.cpan.org/~ARISTOTLE/> as

    Î‘Ï�Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï„Î­Î»Î·Ï‚ Î Î±Î³ÎºÎ±Î»Ï„Î¶

which is exactly what you'd get if you regarded the bytes of the
UTF-8 encoded name as a Latin1 character string.

However, on at least some other author pages, such as Autrijus
Tang's (<http://search.cpan.org/~AUTRIJUS/>), it works fine: his
name comes out properly as 

    ☺唐宗漢☻

Is there something I should do to fix this? Is this a bug on the
side of search.cpan.org somewhere?

Regards,
