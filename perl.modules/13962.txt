Hi Tim!

I have no problem with changing the name. As far as I undestand I'm not in 
anyones way since the namespace is not registered (meaning - you can only get 
Meta from MY cpan directory and it does not appear in the main modules 
directory listing).

This means that I'm not hurting anyones work RIGHT NOW. Am I right ?!? Please 
correct me if I'm wrong... In addition - no one else has either registered 
the Meta name space or even created any private modules that use the 
namespace. So I'm not stepping on anyones toes at the moment in ANY WAY what 
so ever and this discussion is more on future naming of the modules in my 
project more than any concrete problems that my module raised. Right ?!?

If the above is right then I can take my time with changing it. I'll think of 
a new name. The module is big and you'll forgive me if the change takes some 
time (since I'm not hurting anyone as stated above this is ok right ?!?)

This doesn't seem right. The name space is NOT registered. Why would PAUSE 
keep someone from using it ?!? The module only resides in my directory. 
Please let me know if I am wrong and if it is so then I will remove my module 
from CPAN until I change it's name.

As for participating in existing projects goes: I am all for participation 
and I contribute patches, bug fixes and bug reports to many modules which I 
use (about a 1000 email exchanges so far with various CPAN module 
maintainers). However! When you're doing something that has never been done 
before like what I'm trying to do you can't do that in the confines of an 
already existing project. Sorry! But no current project has the ambitious 
goals that I set out for meta. What I'm trying to do is to build a single 
system which integrates the following subsystems:
1. Source control system.
2. Build manager.
3. Bug tacking system.
4. Todo lists.
5. Contact manager.
6. Email client.
7. Web server. Yes - Server.
8. Application server.
9. Movie database manager.
10. Music database manager.
and much much more. All the data, for all these systems, is going to be 
stored inside a SINGLE RDBMS. Yes - you heard me right. If there is another 
project that does this - be sure to let me know...:)

Regards,
	Mark
