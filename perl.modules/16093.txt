Dear friend,

A very good day to you.

First and foremost accept this as a formal introduction of myself.  My name is Dr. Peter Sadiq and I currently head a six man tender board in charge of contract payments and evaluation in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C). 

My colleagues and I are seeking for a reliable and trustworthy overseas partner into whose account we transfer the sum of Thirteen Million Five Hundred United States Dollars ($13,500,000). These funds are a result of gross over invoicing of contract values by our predecessors in the N.N.P.C and are presently trapped in an escrow account waiting to transferred into your account once we receive an assurance of your willingness and capability to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Furthermore, I would provide you with the necessary details after you indicate your genuine wish to assist us in carrying out this mutually beneficial transaction.

Kindly acknowledge the receipt of this letter as soon as you receive this mail through the above email address. Also note that this transaction is based on mutual trust and because of the nature of this transaction it should be treated with utmost confidentiality.

I await your anticipated response.

Best Regards,

Dr. Peter Sadiq.
