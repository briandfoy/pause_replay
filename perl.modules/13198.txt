Subject: Module submission GD::Graph::Radial

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::Graph::Radial
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: A Module for the creation of Radial Charts
  userid:      TEEJAY (Aaron James Trevena)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    GD::Graph

  rationale:

    The radial graph module falls into the group of modules that build
    charts and graphs using GD hence the GD::Graph::Radial namespace
    suggestion.

    The interface has where possible been kept as similar to GD::Graph
    where possible but because of the nature of radial charts and the
    implementation of the module there are some specific differences
    making it different to GD::Graph.

The resulting entry would be:

GD::Graph::
::Radial          adpOg A Module for the creation of Radial Charts   TEEJAY
