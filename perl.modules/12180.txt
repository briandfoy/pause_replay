The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::Compare
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple methods for comparing lists
  userid:      JKEENAN (James E Keenan)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules http://groups.yahoo.com/group/perlsemny

  similar:
    Array::Compare Set::Scalar List::Utils Algorithm::Diff

  rationale:

    List::Compare is a simple, object-oriented implementation of
    standard Perl code (perlfaq4, Perl Cookbook Chap. 12) for the
    comparison of lists. While the code to compare two lists with
    respect to intersection, union, subset status, etc. is well-known, I
    could find no object-oriented implementation of the code available
    on CPAN. As I have found this useful in my day job as well as in
    preparing an introductory level course in Perl, I would like to make
    it available to the Perl community at large. Similarly named modules
    and/or modules with similarly named methods exist on CPAN but are
    aimed at other tasks. Array::Compare, for example, focuses more on
    evaluating the sameness/difference of two arrays judged by various
    criteria and does not focus on intersection, union, etc. Set::Scalar
    compares sets for the aforementioned properties but returns strings
    rather than lists. These modules have very sophisticated features,
    but they don't solve the precise problem which List::Compare does.
