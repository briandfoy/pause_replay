I don't think that actually improves the situation. How is this
different than a person judging on his own based on author activity and
release dates, which they can already see? I don't see any additional
benefit and a lot more work.

I'd rather see someone build a formula that can handle it without any
work from PAUSE or a new group of volunteers. This could be completely
external to everything that already exists, and I bet it would work
just as well.

This is a separate argument though that begs the question that we can
do it appropriately.

We know how that turns out. Hardly anyone uses the facilities, such as
CPAN Ratings, already out there.

But this is the problem of being in favor of things that you don't want
enough to work on yourself because you think it might benefit some
group of people you don't know.
