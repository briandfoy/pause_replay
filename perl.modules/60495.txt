     why:

    I would like to contribute a set of modules considered as "Open
    Statistical Services" that are described in general at
    http://openServices.sourceforge.net.

    The modules currently involve about 15K lines of PERL. They define
    and use systems of statistical models, by making use of algebraic
    perspectives as to what statistical models are. Individual modules
    for numerical and statistical engines have already been written for
    R, SAS, NONMEM, Monolix, WinBUGS, Maple, and CASL. Application areas
    to date are proteomics and clinical pharmacology.

    For additional details on this project, please see
    http://openServices.sourceforge.net and/or
    http://www.cellularStatistics.com

    Thanks!
