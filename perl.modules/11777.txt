The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Compress::SelfExtracting
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Self-extracting Perl executables
  userid:      SEANO (Sean O'Rourke)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    perlmonks, perhaps

  similar:
    Compress::Zlib for pure compression; Text::Quote, too

  rationale:

    This module creates compressed scripts that will extract and run
    themselves without requiring additional modules. It is useful in the
    same way that self-extracting archives are useful -- in not forcing
    the user to download a second piece of software to get the first to
    work. In fairness, the module is more about fun than utility -- the
    Perl compression routines are slow, disk is cheap, gzip is
    everywhere. Nevertheless, I think it's just useful enough to stay
    out of Acme::

    /s

The resulting entry would be:

Compress::
::SelfExtracting  adphp Self-extracting Perl executables             SEANO
