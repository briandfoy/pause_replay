proposed module: Crypt::PGP-Simple
module status: adpO

I recently finished a module that provides an interface to PGP 2.6.2 and
6.5.8 (maybe other versions if they support the same command line syntax).
This functionality has already been done with a few other modules, namely
PGP::Pipe and Crypt::PGP5.  However, I believe my module is of use because
unlike the existing modules, it runs on windows as well as unix and doesn't
rely on any other modules, so it is very easy to install.

i just sent a message to Ashish Gulhati (author of Crypt::PGP5) regarding
the module and how it might fit into the existing structure.  that was just
today, so i have not heard back of course.  other than that i have not
discussed it with the perl dev community.  i am pretty sure it will be an
appreciated module because i have been working with Perl/PGP for a few years
and have recieved a lot of email on the subject.  to my knowledge there is
no easy way to get this functionality on a windows server (or even a unix
server in some cases)

here is an example of my current object model:

use Crypt::PGP-Simple;
my ($objPGP) = new Crypt::PGP-Simple;

$objPGP->PublicKey("myfriend\@herhost.com");
$objPGP->PrivateKey("me\@myhost.com");
$objPGP->Password("mypassword");
$objPGP->PlainText($plain_text_message);

$objPGP->EncryptSign;

my ($encrypted_signed_message) = $objPGP->EncryptedText;

best,
Jason
