My suggestion...

is to follow Sean's suggestion to include a HTML::Tree module in the
HTML-Tree distribution. I'd then tell the PAUSE indexer, that Sean has
the older rights. The reason for this is that the distribution is
2+1/2 years older and very popular.

Doing more than that seems overzealous but doing nothing would make
the confusion of the users a permanent unacceptable annoyance for Sean
and us. Building users' trust upon namespace similarities must be
considered as negligence/fault/carelessness and we should care to
protect established modules.

Opinions?
