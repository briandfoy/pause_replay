The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cobalt::LCD
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Perl wrapper for using a Cobalt's LCD
  userid:      JEFFW (Jeff Walter)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://gentoo.404ster.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I chose Cobalt::LCD for a two reasons. First, near as I can tell
    this will only work with Sun Cobalt's. Second, it's used to
    minipulate what is displayed on the system's LCD front panel display
    and read the buttons surrounding it.

    I suppose my approach would be more unique if I bound the module
    directly to the LCD's library, or did direct ioctl's, but then I
    would lose some of the efficiency of the C code in the library and
    applications I'm wrapping. *starts plotting* I could code the whole
    thing in C, then use the module as an interface to that library. I
    feel like some kind of super villian now...

    So why does this need a new rootlevel namespace? Well, because I
    went through all the other rootlevel namespaces, and none seemed to
    fit. The closest was Interface, but the other occupant there is
    ::CORBA, which is in no way related to an LCD.

The resulting entry would be:

Cobalt::
::LCD             bdpOg Perl wrapper for using a Cobalt's LCD        JEFFW
