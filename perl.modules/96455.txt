Request to register new user

    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Currently working on a new HTML::Formatter, translating HTML to
    Atlassian JIRA syntax, which at least seems to have originated in
    the Textile markup years back, supporting most of the possibilities
    JIRA-syntax offers.

    This might culminate in something like

    HTML::FormatJIRA,

    which does not exist.

    Maybe others could make use of that, as there is no such formatter
    yet, but the need to communicate data from and to JIRA is there all
    the time (installation count in the order of 10^5).

    That being said: It might still take a while to adapt my already
    existing converter as subclass of HTML::Formatter...
