The usage of the Gtk2::Ex:: namespace was [1]drafted on the [2]gtk2-perl
[3]mailing list. Anything that is not an official part of the bindings
should go into Gtk2::Ex. That's accepted among the gtk2-developers and
users. It's much more reasonable than Gtk2x in the style of DBD and DBDx
for example, at least in my eyes.
