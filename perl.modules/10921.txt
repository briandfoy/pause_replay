p2: My first planned upload is a bit of 'extension' work I have
done here locally to help our lyris email list admins do simple
tasks and hence expected to call it

	Wetware::lyrisWebExtension

but that of course is a bit long - but i wanted to make sure
that I was out of everyone's name space issues. My housemate
thinks that this is a bit silly. I figure that I can leave
my copy in my src directory...

this is more a question of propriety and all - it is only
useful to folks running the older lyris 4.2 release.


p1: I am a bit slow, so I use h2xs to provide my
frame works - and it of course creates a README file
which I of course edit, along with the rest of the stuff.

but the webPage has me 'concerned'.... I fear I may be
misreading it:

"Do not upload the READMEs that are integrated in your distribution files.
  PAUSE is designed to take care of unwrappig your file with tar or zip, 
registering all the modules it finds in there, and placing the readme file 
(i.e. a file with the name README in the top level directory of your 
package) into your directory. PAUSE will change the name of the file to 
package-name.readme. It should do so within a few hours after your upload.
"

Right - now it makes patent sense... since there is a README
in the foo-bar-0.01.tar.gz, there is no reason to upload an
independent file....

please tell me that this is the correct interpretation.

ciao
drieux
