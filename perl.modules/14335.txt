can you general some components and put them in appropriate
namespaces, then create a bundle?  for instance, libwww has
several namespaces in it.

your code should be as reusable as possible, so any attempts to
not specialize it for this particular purpose help other people
benefit from your work. :)

what other suggestions do you have for a top level namespace?
