No, it is perl specific

hmmm.... good point. I couldn't think of another name that was
applicable. Perhaps a description of how it works would illuminate the
choice.

The developer portion has a couple of scripts, one which generates user
certificates that contain short keys and usually contain a "terms of use
statement" or License. The script crypts the perl sources and autoload
stuff using a modified non-linear RC4 type of scrambling. The user end
of things only decrypts and feeds the module into the perl engine. First
it checks the user certificate for valid host, etc... + expiration date.
If the "license" period has expired, it will not decrypt the file. There
is an optional e-mail module that notifies the user/developer/licensor
of pending expiration of the cert. Thus the choice of names. The
objective of the module is to provide the developer that has spend a lot
of time an $$ on a proprietary application in perl to be able to keep
prying eyes out of source code. This encourages development of
applications in perl rather than a compiled language such as "C". Any
suggestions on what might be a good name other if this one is not
suitable?
