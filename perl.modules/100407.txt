Hi Joshua

No, I do not believe that Travis or some other CI/CD is appropriate or
needed or worth the effort here. If Dave set something up for the whole
ecosystem then of course DT::HR should be in it. But like Dave I find the
release and prerelease testing and management provided by dzil to be
perfect for my CPAN needs. (Although I have been wondering about making a
PAUSE API now that  the innards are all new and shiny ;-) )

Please keep in mind that the change needed to DT::HR is trivial and has
been reported for over three years IIUC, and it's well over a year since I
contacted you. That statement is *only* about my ability and willingness to
help; not about your own time commitments/priorities/interests. We all get
busy. I was quite distant from Perl for some time (when my kids were small)
and I undrstand it and you may be back as strong or stronger than before.
But in the meantime please reconsider handing the module over or at least
co-maint.

Thanks!

- nick
