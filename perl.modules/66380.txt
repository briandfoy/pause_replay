The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parallel::Fork::BossWorkerAsync
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: asynchronous preforking queue processor
  userid:      JVANNUCCI (Joe Vannucci)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parallel::Fork::BossWorker

  rationale:

    I got the idea for the module from Parallel::Fork::BossWorker. I
    tried to use that module, and realized it was only capable of
    synchronous operation. Fill a queue, process the queue (while the
    whole application waits).

    Parallel::Fork::BossWorkerAsync, while named similar, is very
    different inside. When you start it, a Boss process is forked. The
    Boss preforks the specified number of children (Workers), and then
    listens on both ends, managing communication between the application
    and the preforked children. This allows the application to add items
    to the queue, and/or retrieve results, whenever desired. Latency is
    low because of preforking. When the application places something in
    the queue, it need not wait for completion.

    I don't know if this is the best namespace. I just followed the
    earlier module's example. I am open to suggestions for changing the
    namespace, though I'm not sure how best to do that since the module
    is already released.

The resulting entry would be:

Parallel::Fork::
::BossWorkerAsync RdpOp asynchronous preforking queue processor      JVANNUCCI
