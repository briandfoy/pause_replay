Subject: Module submission Apache::AuthCookieDBI
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::AuthCookieDBI
  DSLIP:       MdpOl
  description: Use a DBI datasource with Apache::AuthCookie
  userid:      MATISSE (Matisse Enzer)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    It's been in use since 2000 - registration was never acted upon

  similar:
    Apache::AuthCookie Apache::AuthCookieDBIRadius
    Apache::AuthCookieLDAP

  rationale:

    This module was supposed to have been registered in 2000, but
    somehow it didn't happen:

    It looks like the module was never registered. There was a
    registration request in July 2000, but it looks like nobody ever
    approved it.

    You can submit another registration request and I'll approve it.
