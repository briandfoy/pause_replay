Does anyone know how to contact Clayton Donley, the author of 
Net::LDAPapi?  I've tried contacting him at several addresses about 
updates I have for the module to get it to work with perl5.6.1 and freed 
memory bugs (the module uses XS)

If Mr. Donley cannot be contacted, then I'd like to request a CPAN ID.

I plan to do some work on Net::LDAPapi The current version on CPAN
hasn't been updated since May 1998 and the original author (Clayton
Donley) seems to have completely dropped support for it in favor of
PerLDAP or perl-ldap.  Net::LDAPapi is still important since it seems to
be the only module to currently support kerberized ldap binds.  
Net::LDAPapi does not work with perl5.6.1 and I have some patches to fix
this.  Also there seem to be some problems with the module calling free
on already freed memory that I intend to fix.  I tried contacting Mr.
Donley at donley AT wwa DOT com and also via his home page as listed in
the CPAN author directory.  The email bounced and the web page doesn't
seem to be working.  I have also contacted him at clayton DOT donley AT 
octetstring DOT com
