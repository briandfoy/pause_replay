[Not sure if this is the right place to send this,
but the address was in the message.]

I got this error from PAUSE:

   Status: Version parsing problem
   ===============================

      module: Ogre::ExampleFrameListener
     version: undef
     in file: Ogre-0.25/Ogre/ExampleFrameListener.pm
      status: The PAUSE indexer was not able to parse the following line
              in that file: C< if (eval { require OIS && $OIS::VERSION >=
              0.03 }) { > Note: the indexer is running in a Safe
              compartement and cannot provide the full functionality of
              perl in the VERSION line. It is trying hard, but sometime
              it fails. As a workaround, please consider writing a proper
              META.yml that contains a 'provides' attribute (currently
              only supported by Module::Build) or contact the CPAN admins
              to investigate (yet another) workaround against "Safe"
              limitations.)

Note that 'OIS' ne 'Ogre::ExampleFrameListener'.

I don't really "care" and might add 'provides' as it suggests
if I can automate it.
Just thought I'd point out the underly smart smart behavior.

Does http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html
specify a "proper META.yml"?
