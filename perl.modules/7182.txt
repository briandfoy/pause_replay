Hi!  :)  Welcome to the Pit of Despair, don't even think about trying to
escape ...

While I agree with the first sentence, I don't agree with the second,
necessarily.  First, there is no MacOS::, it is Mac::.  ;-)  Secondly and
far more importantly, traditionally, all modules in Mac:: and Win32:: and
VMS:: have been modules that are meant for use on that specific platform.

I am not opposed to putting it in Mac (Mac::FileSpec::Unixish runs on any
platform), but there might be a better place for it, if we have one for
doing such file reading.  I can't think of one offhand.

In general, just reply to the email that comes in.  It should reply to the
list and to the user, so all of us can participate with the user in the
discussion.  (Of course, this list is readable via nntp.perl.org and the
list archives, so the user can see what we write here, but that's usually
far less efficient :).

I don't actually do any of these things; a few people do, but not all of us
on the list.  Andreas probably knows most of how to do everything.


>Is there
>anything else I need to do or need to know?

Realize that most of us don't read most of the emails that come through
here (I think).  I think the general rationale is that given enough list
members, each of the important mails will get read by *someone*.  *grin*  I
only read what I can, when I can, if I have something to contribute.
