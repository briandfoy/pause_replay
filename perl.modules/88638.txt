The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Holidays::CZ
  DSLIP:       Rdpf2
  description: Determine Czech Republic bank holidays
  userid:      SMITHFARM (Nathan Cutler)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/date-holidays-cz/

  similar:
    Date::Holidays::DK

  rationale:

    Since Date::Holidays::CZ was missing on CPAN, I had to write it,
    and since I had to write it anyway, I decided to take the
    opportunity to learn how to package it for CPAN and push it
    upstream.

  enteredby:   SMITHFARM (Nathan Cutler)
  enteredon:   Fri Dec 27 10:07:01 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Holidays::
::CZ              Rdpf2 Determine Czech Republic bank holidays       SMITHFARM
