I would like to register for module / script development.

I have only been writing in perl for a little over two years, but I have
a lot of ideas and would like to be able to give back to the perl
community. 

I've been in the industry for 12 years primarily as an Oracle DBA and
developer.  I am currently employed by a large computer manufacturer in
Arizona.  Recently started doing a lot of network services type of work:
setting up a directory server utilizing the "unified directory" model
including a unified authentication mechanism; web services including a
portal approach and virtual hosting for intranet users; researching new
technologies such as XML and integrating them into our environment and
our products.

A few ideas I've been thinking of:

1. A module for translating and validating XML to LDIF and vice versa
... maybe XML::LDIF
I'd like to be able to incorporate directory server data into web pages
for easy maintenance.  Netscape DS provides a proprietary (yet
customizable) web front-end for their DS.  I thought with at least an
XML representation, I might be able to parlay this into LDAP API use
through the web by incorporating XML and XSL.  I don't believe there is
currently an LDIF DTD, but it would not be difficult to write one.  
Mark Wilcox has suggested the possibility of writing an LDAP loading
application taking XML data and making LDAP API calls, but there is not
anything I can find publicly available to help in the translation
process.

2. LDIF pretty printing script (a conspicuous lack of printing LDIF in
easily readable formats).  I started using the Netscape address book and
realized that there is no useful way to print this stuff out, either in
address book or label formats.

3. Scripts for Oracle database administration including schema
reporting, performance monitoring, alert and trace monitoring, tuning
tips, etc.  I have a small suite of this type of script that I use
on-the-job.  It has become an indispensable collection of conveniences
for Oracle db administration.

4. An Oracle 'import show' file translator, in fact this is 80%
written.  Oracle's 'import show' file is a gross quoted string mishmash
of SQL statements that are almost impossible to read.  There was some
discussion of such a utility on the comp.databases.oracle.server
newsgroup, and there appeared to be a lot of interest in it.

I know these may not all be candidates for perl modules.  Many of the
utilities are actually better described as scripts, but I thought I'd
throw them out to see what you think.

Any suggestions and comments are appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
