The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URLprocessor
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Class for processing URL addresses
  userid:      KOSCIELNY (Pawel Koscielny)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    URI Rose::URI

  rationale:

    Hello :)

    My name is Pawel and I am a beginner in CPAN. I've got a problem
    while using URI or Rose::URI.

    When I process URL addresses automatically (e.g. through
    webspider), they often can't deal with damaged fragments of a URL
    and I cannot find a way to validate their correctness. Even if I add
    the implementation of validation to URL and/or Rose::URI the problem
    still won't be solved, as they parse the addresses differently â
    they are URI-oriented and should be best redone from scratch, which
    is pointless. These modules are great for URI addresses.

    I've got a module with a number of tests ready and it works well
    for URL addresses. That's why I suggest setting up a new namespace,
    e.g. URLprocessor or URL.

    Also, my aim is not to compete with other developers - I recommend
    them in the documentation of my module anyway.

    If anything is wrong with the namespace that I suggested, please
    let me know, as I am new to CPAN. I would really appreciate your
    help.

    Best regards, Paul
