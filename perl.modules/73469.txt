Hi Folks

I've re-writing CGI::Session from scratch, and now wish to use
Test::Database, but it's a mess (IMHO). Details here:
http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/Data/Session.html#FAQ


So, I'm going to re-write Test::Database and I'd like your opinion on a
dir structure to hold db config data.

I propose File::HomeDir -> my_home/.cpan/test/database/connexions.ini,
to be read with Cofig::Tiny.

Can you see any problems with that?
