I definitely agree that it would be a bad idea to reinvent
functionality that's already provided by existing modules.  I was
planning to use Proc::Spawn and Mail::Send for running commands and
sending mail, and I need to do more research to determine if any of
the existing logging modules will do what I need.

I think it would be more than just a few lines of code, especially
once the module starts supporting arbitrary output handling using
arbitrary criteria.  Here are a few examples of what the module would
allow you to do:

  * If the command output contains a specific regex, pipe it to
    another program.

  * If the command gets killed with SIGSEGV, page someone.

  * Send email to different people based on regexps in the command
    output.

Anyway, if the consensus is still that there's no point in
contributing this module, that's fine with me.  However, I'd still
appreciate feedback on what to call it, even if we'll only be using it
locally.

Thanks for the input!
