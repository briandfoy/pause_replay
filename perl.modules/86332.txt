     why:

    I am a developer of many useful Perl libraries and modules,
    including an event framework called EventedObject, an objective and
    evented Internet Relay Chat library for IO::Async originally named
    libirc (which needs to be changed), a fully-featured objective and
    evented wiki parser called Wikifier, a remote TCP event framework
    known as Evented::Socket, an dynamic configuration class known as
    Evented::Configuration, an evented DBI wrapper called Evented::Query
    and Evented::Database, an evented and object Omegle.com interface
    for IO::Async called Net::Async::Omegle, and many more. I've also
    written countless IRC servers, clients, bots, and more... In
    particular, I'm interested in putting my EventedObject and IRC
    library on CPAN. You can find my code on my GitHub account at:
