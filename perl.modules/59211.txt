The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Ratings
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: calculation of ratings -- e.g. chess ratings
  userid:      BARTOLIN (Christian Bartolomaeus)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Chess::Elo

  rationale:

    The module Games::Ratings provides methods to calculate ratings.
    The first version (0.0.1) only supports calculation of chess
    ratings, namely FIDE ratings and German DWZ. But for later versions
    support for other rating systems (e.g. Go) can be implemented. Since
    there are different rating systems for different games I went for
    Games::Ratings -- even if the module is limited to chess ratings at
    the moment.

    There is already a module to calculate Elo ratings (Chess::Elo),
    but it uses a simple formula which doesn't work for FIDE ratings.

  enteredby:   BARTOLIN (Christian Bartolomaeus)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb 26 19:52:44 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Ratings         bdpOp calculation of ratings -- e.g. chess ratings BARTOLIN
