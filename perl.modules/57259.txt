Subject: Module submission Signal::StackTrace

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Signal::StackTrace
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: Issue a stack trace on recieving a signal.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Sys::Signal, sigtrap, Sys::Sigaction

  rationale:

    All this does when it traps a signal is output a formatted stack
    trace. It does not attempt to be a generalized signal handler nor to
    localize any handlers. The only interface is use Signal::StackTrace
    w/ optional arguments of signals to trap (default USR1). This makes
    the module low-overhead, dependent on only Carp, Config, &
    Data::Dumper, and lightweight enough to use easily in development.

    The stack trace levles are also output as a hashref with keys of
    the headings (e.g., "File") rather than the somewhat criptic format
    used in most stack traces.

    sigtrap has similar functionality, but it dumps core on the signal
    rather than continuing execution; all of the other handler modules
    require more configuration (vs. a single use and some signal names).

    The module could also be called "Sig::SigTrace", but the "Signal"
    package name seemed like a better place to put special-purpose
    signal handlers.

The resulting entry would be:

Signal::
::StackTrace      bdpnp Issue a stack trace on recieving a signal.   LEMBARK
