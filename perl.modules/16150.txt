From: cpan@arie.org ("Arie M. Rubenstein")

Hello. My name is Arie Rubenstein and I would like to contribute to CPAN.
After searching for a module to convert between zip codes and states, I
ended up writing one myself -- I think it might be useful to other people. I
write a lot of perl, I'm sure I can put together some other useful things.

My email address is cpan@arie.org, my homepage is www.arie.org, my preferred
ID is 'ARIE' if available.

Thank you.

Arie
