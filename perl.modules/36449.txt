The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Toaster
  DSLIP:       MdpOb
  description: a secure full-featured mail server recipe
  userid:      MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    mailing list (mail-toaster@simerson.net), Web Forums
    (http://www.tnpi.biz/support/phpBB/)

  similar:
    Nothing known on CPAN similar, but uses functionality of others like
    Mail::Tools and Net::DNS when appropriate

  rationale:

    Mail::Toaster is the project name, in addition to being a somewhat
    useful moniker to those admins who are familiar with using file
    toasters and similarly named purpose built systems.

    There are several other mail toaster projects in existence but none
    that are perl centric and thus there is no likelihood of conflict.
    This project is over 5 years old, so it's certainly the grand-daddy
    of Mail::Toaster projects.

    It's only logical that it belongs in Mail::, for obvious reasons.

  enteredby:   MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 17 16:58:01 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::Toaster         MdpOb a secure full-featured mail server recipe    MSIMERSON
