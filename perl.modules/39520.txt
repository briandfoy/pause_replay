The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cache::Repository
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Generic file repository handling
  userid:      DMCBRIDE (Darin McBride)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:
    Cache::FileCache

  rationale:

    This module is intended as a way to group files to handle them as
    groups. For example, Cache-Repository-0.01.tar.gz and
    Cache-Repository-0.01.md5 are related, and can be treated as such
    when placing them in a repository.

    This module makes no assumptions about relatedness - the user can
    place files in the repository giving each file a unique tag. Or the
    underlying driver (only a file system driver is currently available)
    may provide groupings for repositories, such as CPAN, which are
    largely readonly.

    A Cache::Repository::CPAN module would be a cool possibility, after
    Cache::Repository::FTP is developed.

    The primary difference between this and other caching available on
    CPAN is that this module treats the file itself as the data, rather
    than merely a store of other data. Rather than putting a HoHoAoH
    structure to disk (such as via Cache::FileCache), this module is
    intended to treat the file(s) as the data.

The resulting entry would be:

Cache::
::Repository      bdpOp Generic file repository handling             DMCBRIDE
