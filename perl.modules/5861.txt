Yeah. sorry about that. The email came thru the PAUSE interface to the
modules list and it wasn't clear to me exactly what was required. Hope this
makes a bit more sense:

The module allows the user to match hash keys using regular expressions.
This means that if you have a hash containing the value $h{key}, then
looking up $h{'^k'} will return that value to you.

There's already another module on CPAN called Tie::RegexpHash, but that
works 'in reverse', that is, you _set_ hash values using regexes as keys.

As for the name of the module, I think it follows the standard for naming
tied objects:

Tie:: indicates that it is a tied object

Hash:: indicates that you tied the object to a hash

Regex:: tries to indicate that the tied hashes can be accessed using regexes.

Hope that is clearer.

Let me know if you need any more info.

Dave...
