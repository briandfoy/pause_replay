Subject: Module submission Net::Google::PicasaWeb

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Google::PicasaWeb
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl binding to the Google Picasaweb API
  userid:      ROBERTMAY (Robert May)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    CPANForum, Google Code SVN repository

  similar:
    Net:::Google::Calander

  rationale:

    There are various modules already in CPAN (mostly, but not
    exclusively in the Net::Google hierarchy) that wrap access to the
    Google gdata APIs. There is no wrapper for the Picasaweb API, and
    this module intends to give an abstracted, perl like, OO API to perl
    users so that they don't need to have any understanding of the gdata
    feed format, or how to manage user authentication with Google.

    Code is currently in alpha status: what's done works, about 90% of
    the functionality is complete, about 25% of the docuemntation is
    complete, and about 10% of the tests are complete. Code is currently
    available from http://code.google.com/p/net-google-picasaweb/

    Regards, Rob.
