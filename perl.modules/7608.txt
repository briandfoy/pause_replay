hello

this craven individual has realised that what he thought was a 
private login id is actually the public author id displayed on cpan. 
The login name that he chose because it was unlikely to be taken is 
now looking rather stupid.

is there any chance of changing the stupid cpan id THPFFT to the more 
sensible WROSS or something like that?

I apologise for wasting your time with this daft mistake: I'm sure i 
can live with a silly name if necessary.

best

will

cpan id, er,'thpfft'.
