The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ObjectivePerl
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Objective-C style syntax and runtime in perl
  userid:      KYLED (Kyle Dawkins)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It seems that most modules in the "Interfaces to or emulations of
    other programming languages" section have their own namespace. For
    the sake of simplicity, and because ObjectivePerl runs (mostly) as a
    source filter, it is really nice to be able to say

    use ObjectivePerl; ... no ObjectivePerl;

    which helps with source code readability.

    Since it's a project unto itself, and will be extended over time as
    I connect it to Camel Bones and maybe even the Mac OSX
    PerlObjcBridge, it doesn't seem too strange to me that it would have
    its own namespace.

    Thanks for your consideration!
