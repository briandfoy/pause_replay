The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGIUtility
  DSLIP:       Rnpfg
  description: A perl module used to reduce code
  userid:      MAXIS (maxis)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Data::Diff Data::Display

  rationale:

    When I use perl to write a lot of cgi scripts, it's to bothering to
    write the same code all the time. Every time when bug appears, we
    must look at the error log to find out the reason. Why we can not
    make this work easier for other developers. And also make the cgi
    coding much more fun, less bugs in a shorter time. I use this module
    to develop a lot of web sites, so I am sure what it provides will
    satisfy many developers like myself.

The resulting entry would be:

CGIUtility        Rnpfg A perl module used to reduce code            MAXIS
