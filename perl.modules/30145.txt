Dear Sir/Madam,
 
New Fields Exhibitions would like to extend an invitation to you and your company representatives to participate in our 4th Rebuilding Iraq Expo, which will be held in Arbil, Iraq on April 26-29, 2004. 
 
The best way to begin operations in Iraq is to go there. Our Rebuilding Iraq conferences in Washington have highlighted success stories from companies that turned their vision for business in Iraq from talk into action, with remarkable results. The reintegration of a long-isolated, but potentially rich, economy with a well-educated population into the world market rarely happens, making Iraq the type of opportunity that may not come again for many years. Don’t miss out on a unique chance to bring your products to a brand new market.
 
As an exhibitor, you will have even more opportunities to meet potential Iraqi partners than you would if you register on the basic attendee level. Instead of combing the trade show floor hunting for contacts, you will have your own exhibition space that you can use to promote your company. As a result, prime contractors and Iraqi businessmen with needs in your industry will be able to easily identify you from your exhibit as someone who they should meet.
 
New Fields is working with all relevant agencies, including the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Kurdistan Regional Government, to ensure security.
 
We will bring project managers from prime contractors on the ground in Iraq to share their experiences, provide subcontracting information, and network with exhibitors.
 
The 4th Rebuilding Iraq Exhibition in Arbil will feature key representatives from the Iraqi Governing Council, regional Iraqi authorities, and the Coalition Provisional Authority.
 
New Fields is committed to doing whatever is necessary to ensure smooth and safe travel to the 4th Rebuilding Iraq Exhibition and providing you with as much information as you need to make your journey to Iraq as easy as possible. To this end, we will charter flights from Dubai, UAE to Arbil on April 24 and return flights on April 30. The round-trip cost per person for these flights will be $1,850. While it is your responsibility to arrive in the UAE by April 24.
 
New Fields is also committed to making it as easy as possible for you to send your exhibit to Arbil. In addition to passenger planes, we will also charter a cargo plane from Dubai to Arbil in order to ensure that your material arrives in Iraq safely and on time. All you need to do is make sure your exhibit is received at New Fields’ Dubai office by April 12.
 
New Fields is confident of a strong Iraqi presence at the 4th Rebuilding Iraq Exhibition due to our connections in the Iraqi media. Beginning in early April, New Fields will launch a major advertising campaign that will blanket the entire country with information showcasing the Arbil exhibition as a “can’t miss” event for the Iraqi business community. We are currently producing a series of 30 second ads that will give us a regular presence on Iraqi television and radio throughout the month of April and will also advertise heavily in the Iraqi print media.
 
The networking opportunities available at previous New Fields events have resulted in a significant number of successful partnerships and our event in Arbil will provide a unique setting for you to meet other American businessmen with an interest in Iraq.
