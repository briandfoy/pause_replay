Subject: Module submission Pod::Manual

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pod::Manual
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Aggregates several PODs into a single manual
  userid:      YANICK (Yanick Champoux)
  chapterid:   26 (Documentation)
  communities:
    use.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I was looking for the longest time for a way to collect many PODs
    (e.g., all the Catalyst documentation) into a single manual for
    printing. Some modules exist to do something similar for web-based
    collations, but I found nothing for printed documents (with table of
    contents and such printed-medium goodiness).

    From the feedback I got on use.perl.org, that seems to be an itch
    that is shared by a few other mongers. Hopefully, Pod::Manual will
    be able to fill the void.

The resulting entry would be:

Pod::
::Manual          adpOp Aggregates several PODs into a single manual YANICK
