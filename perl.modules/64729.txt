Request to register new user

fullname: Roland Minner
  userid: MINNER
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    i already registered an PAUSE account with id 'rminner'. However it
    seems that there must have been a typo in the email address (never
    got the registration mail). As such i can't log in and the reset
    form also doesn't work. I can't even log in with my Bitcard account
    which has the same id (there seems to be some kind of conflict with
    the pause account). Could you change my email address to the one
    above? The only credential i can offer is that the domain of the
    email is registered to myself (Roland Minner).

    Apologies for the incovenience and abusing of this form. Regards,

    Roland Minner
