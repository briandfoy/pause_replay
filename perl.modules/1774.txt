Hi all-

I recently uploaded File-Remote-1.10.tar.gz, which is a standard Perl
package (Makefile.PL and everything) for the module I wrote called
File::Remote.  The namespace for this module seemed extremely obvious
(the module provides methods for interacting with remote files) so after
perusing all the File:: packages I decided to put it in there. Any
objections?

Here is the DSLI for this module so that it can be registered on CPAN:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  
-------------  ----  --------------------------------------------
File::Remote   Rdph  Read/write/edit remote files transparently

If there are any problems, please let me know. Otherwise, if you could
register my module on PAUSE so that I can edit it/etc I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,
Nate
