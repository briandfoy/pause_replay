     why:

    I would like to upload a module with the following description:

    This module implements Perl arrays that have both numeric and
    string indices, similar to PHP arrays or Collections, therefore the
    array keys are unique string.

    The order in which the elements were added is preserved just like
    Tie::IxHash does this.

    Both Perl array and Perl hash functions can be performed on a
    variable of this class. The elements of an array may be sorted both
    by keys and values, or with an external callback subroutine. They
    can also be reordered.
