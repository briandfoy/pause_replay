The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pod::Trial::LinkImg
  DSLIP:       cdpnp
  description: Test image display in pod docs.
  userid:      OTTO (Otto Hirr)
  chapterid:   26 (Documentation)

  rationale:

    From the module doc:

    Trial demonstration of image display in pod documentation.

    I<A picture is worth a thousand words.>

    =back

    or so says some sage. Way back in the dinasaur age of December 1977
    Ken Thompson used graphics when he wrote a manuscript on the I<UNIX
    Implementation> as found in B<Bell System Technical Journal, Jul/Aug
    1978, Vol. 57, No. 6, Part 2>. (Yes I have a copy and for the young
    folks, there was only one phone company back then.)

    My calander today says we are about to flip to 2009 and yet I find
    no graphics displayed in any documentation as displayed at
    L<http://search.cpan.org>.

    This is 32 years!!!

    I find this a major step backwards - and most especially as we
    continue to push the levels of complexity. If a module writer really
    wants to provide better documentation with graphics, then there
    should be some method for it to be displayed at
    L<http://search.cpan.org>.

    This do-nothing module is to test this out.

The resulting entry would be:

Pod::Trial::
::LinkImg         cdpnp Test image display in pod docs.              OTTO
