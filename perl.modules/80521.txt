The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::TEng
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Framework for text mining scientific papers
  userid:      ANDREFS (André Fernandes dos Santos)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Soon on GitHub (github.com/andrefs)

  similar:
    Text::Mining

  rationale:

    In the context of my master thesis in Bioinformatics, I'm currently
    developing a framework for extracting numeric parameters (i.e.
    tuples formed by numeric expression + parameter name + unit of
    measure) and other relevant information from scientific literature.

    Despite being tested mainly with biomedical-related domains, it
    should be able to be used in other areas such as physics or
    economics, because the recognition of numeric expressions is
    domain-independent, and the recognition of domain specific entities
    is performed based on an domain-specific user-provided ontology.

    From the start the project was dubbed T-Eng (from Text
    Engineering), and initially I had planned to call the distribution
    Bio::TEng. However, given its broader scope, I now think that
    Text::TEng is a better option. The only problem I see is the
    existance of Teng, a "very simple DBI wrapper/ORMapper".

    Is Text::TEng acceptable? I could also name it Text::Eng, is this a
    better option?

    Thanks,

    AndrÃ©
