      a description of what you're planning to contribute 
      for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry, which
is: Development stage, Support level, Language used, Interface style
      (see the modulelist), and a 44 character description). 
      for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send a concise
description that helps us to categorize the issue so we can forward your
      mail to the maintainers of the corresponding archive branch. 

my first contribution to CPAN will be a rfc1725-compliant POP3 daemon
that reads maildirs.


      It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where
you have discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and
if
      there was at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for
submissions, but we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality
      control. If your work has never been discussed publicly, then it's
extremely difficult for us to make our judgement whether to accept the
      submission or not.

After I announced the existence of popdaemon on comp.lang.perl.moderated
there
were many views of the page, but not a whole lot of discussion.  It
could
be improved.

There are other things I could contribute to CPAN, too.
