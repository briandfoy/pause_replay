Hello there,

I've written a spamfilter a la Mail::SpamAssassin that uses bayesian
probability scores to determine whether incomming mail is spam or not. It
is a Mail::Audit plugin and currently a bit in beta. It works and has been
tested. However, some configuration options are still to be added.

I would like to start uploading to CPAN sooner or later. According to the
PAUSE FAQ I was to send the following:

    * Allard Hoeve
    * allard@byte.nl
    * no homepage
    * HOEVE
    * Shortish Description: above
    * Short Description: Bayesian spamfilter

Could you please provide me with a login?

Kind regards,

Allard Hoeve
