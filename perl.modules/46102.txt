You ignore what the module's used for because people will use it for
all sorts of things you don't expect. You code a general solution
that you can use, but that you also realize other people might use
for different tasks than your particular itch.

No one cares what you want them to do, they care about what they
need to do. If your module gets them to A to B, that's all that
matters to them. :)
