From: ed@membled.com (Ed Avis)

I'm writing a program (pmq) which tests the modules installed on the
system.  I would like to make a test suite for this program containing
a few dummy modules.  It's important that the names chosen for the
dummy modules do not interfere with those already installed on the
system.

Is there a namespace for pretend modules, modules which do not exist
and should not be installed?  I was thinking of using names beginning
with an underscore, it's fairly certain that modules@perl.org will not
allocate such a namespace to any real modules.
