I have a couple of ideas for packages I'd like to contribute to CPAN,
since I haven't found the functionality there.  At the moment, they're
specifically access to system facilities like id(1) and sync(2).

From the #registering section of the page:

your name: Ken A L Coar
your email address: Ken.Coar@Golux.Com
your homepage if you have one: http://Ken.Coar.Org/
your preferred user-ID on CPAN: ROUS

Thanks!
