Ok.  Talking about this a little with mjd and rethinking it a bit,
adding the categories really isn't going to help.  There's only so
much info you can shove into five characters.

Presumably you keep this info in some sort of real database?  (Please
tell me you do.)  Rather than sipping module information though the
straw of 00modlist.long.txt, we could set up an interface to the
database.  The amount and detail of information stored would be pretty
much infinite and whatever interfaces people want can be set up.

Simplest way to do this is

A) Publish the internal database schema.  That way somebody other than
Andreas can work on it.

B) Supply the information via CPAN in an easy to parse, fairly human
readable format, say YAML, in easy to digest chunks, say one file per
top-level module name.

Do that and people other than the module cabal can work on improving
CPAN.

gigaconway: a hypothetical unit of mind expansion, so disturbing it
  is likely to change the fundemental nature of the universe.  Some
  contend that gigaconway events, while rare, are much cheaper to produce
  than antiprotons, nuclear weapons or even XML specifications, and start
  at US$60,000 each.  If you believe gigaconway events are indeed possible,
