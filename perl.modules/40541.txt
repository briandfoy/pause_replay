The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NET::TL1
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A management interface for network devices
  userid:      STEVENH (Steven Hessing)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    TL1 is a command language used to manage telecommunications
    devices. Alternatives to TL1 are SNMP and for example Cisco IOS CLI.
    SNMP is not in human-readable format. Cisco IOS CLI is
    human-readable but free format; TL1 is human readable but input and
    output are specified in detail. This makes TL1 ideal for scripts
    that interface between provisioning systems and the actual network
    elements (typically referred to as `northbound OSS integration')

    The module I've written telnets to a port of a TL1 gateway and
    executes one or more commands. The response to each command consists
    of a header and a footer. The module parses this response and puts
    the results in data structures.

  enteredby:   STEVENH (Steven Hessing)
  enteredon:   Fri May 20 19:17:04 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

NET::
::TL1             adpOp A management interface for network devices   STEVENH
