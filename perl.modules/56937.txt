From: derek@ximbiot.com (Derek Price)

Please don't remove the registration for Wiki::Toolkit::Mediawiki.  I am 
working again on the Wiki::Toolkit modules related to this module, which 
I intend to eventually use to provide a pre-packaged set of CGI scripts 
to run an example wiki using the related modules, similar to how 
Wiki::Toolkit::Kwiki installs an example wiki using other Wiki::Toolkit 
modules.

I have the files up and running that would go into 
Wiki::Toolkit::Mediawiki, but currently they contain my own branding, 
which I intend to change before distributing it.

Thanks and regards,

Derek
