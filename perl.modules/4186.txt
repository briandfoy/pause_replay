O.K., here's how I think it should work:

The Makefile.PL has a postamble subroutine that adds an additional step to
"make install" that installs the http-webtest directory in /usr/local/etc.

There is a Bourne shell script called "configure", to be run BEFORE "perl
Makefile.PL", that prompts the user for where he/she wants to install the
http-webtest directory.  If the desired location is not /usr/local/etc, the
shell script modifies the Makefile.PL using sed.

Sounds good?  The alternative is to have the "make install" step prompt the
user for the location of the directory, but this seems non-standard to me
and would be more difficult for me to program.
