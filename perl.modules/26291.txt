The message apparently sent by you has been processed by Brightmail(TM) Anti-
Virus using Symantec's Norton AntiVirus Technology.

text.pif was infected with the malicious program W32.Novarg.A@mm .
It has been deleted because the file cannot be cleaned. It is not necessary to forward this message if you don't need information.

Since most current email viruses disguise the address they came from, it is quite possible that the
person named as the sender is not, in fact, the sender.

There is no need to report this incident to the Threat Assessment Centre (david.harley@nhsia.nhs.uk)
unless you have a query.

Most email viruses and worms alter messages so that the mail address from which
they mailed themselves cannot be identified. Viruses that do this include
Mimail, Sobig, Klez, Yaha and so on, but there are many others, so it is
quite possible that you didn't send the message and don't have an infected
system.

If you are in any doubt as to whether you may be infected, please take appropriate
measures, including updating your anti-virus software.

If you are employed by the NHS, you should contact the Threat Assessment Centre
(david.harley@nhsia.nhs.uk) for further information and to check whether further
action is needed.
