Hey,

I would like to create two modules. One for the ObjectTemplate.pm code
that Sriram Srinivasan wrote about in APP, and the other which is a
derivative class.

I propose to use the Class::ObjectTemplate space for Sriram's original
class, and Class::ObjectTemplate::DB for the derivative class (which I
believe to be especially useful for objects derived from OO
databases).

So...

Name                 DSLI  Description                             Info
----------------     ----  --------------------------------------- -----
Class::
::ObjectTemplate     bdpO  Optimized template builder base class   JASONS
::ObjectTemplate::DB bdpO  Template base class for DB objects      JASONS


Thanks,
jas.

PS. I'm including pieces of the relevant email exchange with Sriram

Sure, you can do that. 

Thanks.

Sriram.
