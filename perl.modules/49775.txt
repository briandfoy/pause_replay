Announce somewhere public (such as use.perl) that you intend to take
over the module, then wait a while for the author to get in touch with
you. If after a couple of weeks we don't hear anything, we can see
about transferring the module to you.

In the mean time, you can still work on your new version and upload
developer releases. :)

As long as the old interface still works, people shouldn't care about
how it does the work behind the scenes. However, so people fool around
under the hood, too.

Why not just Net::SMS? It could dispatch to the right class based on
the input.
