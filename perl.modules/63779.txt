Subject: Module submission Net::INET6Glue

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::INET6Glue
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Help Net::* (SMTP,..), LWP... deal with IPv6
  userid:      SULLR (Steffen Ullrich)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    libnet (Net::SMTP, Net::FTP,...), LWP and other modules have hard
    coded dependencies to IO::Socket::INET and thus are unable to use
    IPv6. Because they are core modules they are used a lot and programs
    using them should be made IPv6 capable as easy as possible: -
    Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6 deals with this problem by making INET
    the same as INET6 - Net::INET6Glue::FTP patches support for EPSV and
    EPTR (needed for IPv6 FTP) into Net::FTP - ... more coming?

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::INET6Glue       adphp Help Net::* (SMTP,..), LWP... deal with IPv6 SULLR
