     why:

    Note: I requested an account in the end of September, and received
    an automatic reply, but no password on 30.9. I waited since then,but
    retry today. Found no record in the modules mailing list archive...

    A ClearCase::Wrapper:MGi module, with support for a pattern of use
    of ClearCase, based on branching of the root of version trees.

    Possible modifications to existing modules, if required, to support
    the same pattern: ClearCase::SyncTree, ClearCase::Wrapper. These are
    things I need to negociate with the author of these modules, DSB.
