I think it's probably both.

I find myself creating URI-modifying functions from time to time as 
well, although mine are more like wanting to know if a URI is absolute, 
root-relative or file-relative etc etc.

I'd suggest deleting module, and doing a bit more investigation into 
what differences there might be to some of the more standard functions, 
and to talk to the relevant authors about adding yours if they are 
sufficiently different and still valuable.
