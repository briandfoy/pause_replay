Subject: Module submission MySQL::Packet

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MySQL::Packet
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: encode and decode the MySQL binary protocol
  userid:      TAVIN (Tavin Cole)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    poe@perl.org, dbix-class@lists.rawmode.org, #poe

  similar:
    Net::MySQL

  rationale:

    Net::MySQL was already taken. Net::MySQL::Packet would be another
    possibility, but I thought it best to avoid confusion with
    Net::MySQL altogether, and also to emphasize one of the big
    distinctions between my module and many Net:: modules, which is that
    my module does not wrap an IO::Socket. It expects you to do all the
    I/O and call its functions much like any other Perl string
    processing functions (though the data is binary).

    So, it's just a tool for encoding and decoding MySQL binary
    packets. Hence the name.

    There's nothing about the architecture that's really generalizable
    to other databases as far as code reusability goes, so I don't see
    how it might fit under a root namespace besides MySQL, but I'm open
    to suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

MySQL::
::Packet          adpfp encode and decode the MySQL binary protocol  TAVIN
