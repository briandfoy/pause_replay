Request for Namespace for POE::Component::IRC::Onjoin

Description: 

  A module providing IRC channel owners the ability to establish a
  moved message bot. That is, a bot that will inform persons who
  join the specified channel that the channel has moved elsewhere. 

  This module can also be used as a general onjoin bot, and can
  optionally provide periodic notifications of the move to persons
  sitting on the channel, and the channel itself.

DSLI entry: 

  POE::Component::IRC:: 
  ::Onjoin bdpO Provides IRC moved message & onjoin services AFOXSON

Discussion: 

  There has been minimal, yet positive dicussion of this module on IRC. 
  There are other modules that implement IRC bots for various purposes,
  such as libsirc, a module that implements an IRC channel management bot. 

  I have spoken to the authors of both POE (Rocco Caputo), and
  POE::Componenet::IRC (Dennis Taylor), neither have any objection
  to the proposed namespace. 

  Thank you for your time and consideration.
