FYI, I recently tried to submit a registration for a namespace 
(Net::Peep) on the "Apply for namespace registration (BETA)" page.  I 
originally selected chapter 32 (Miscellaneous Modules) and was told that 
Net was already found in chapters 15 and 5.  I decided that chapter 5 
would, in fact, be the best choice, and selected it.

I then received the following message:

--
ERROR:  The submission didn't succeed due to the following reason:

Module rootnamespace Net doesn't match chapter. Net is already 
registered in the chapters 15 and 5. If you really believe that it 
belongs to chapter 5 too, please turn on the small checkbox next to the 
chapterselection.

Nothing done. Please correct the form below and retry.

In the dropdown, what should have been chapter 5 was prepopulated with 
chapter 2.  Just to be sure I wasn't seeing things, I selected chapter 5 
several times and observed the same behavior before finally clicking on 
the abovementioned checkbox, after which the submission was taken 
without error.

Regards,

-Me
