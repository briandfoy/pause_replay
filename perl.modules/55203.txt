Correction: there is no IGLU Cabal! ;-)

Seriously now - how am I supposed to call the core CPAN administrators? I once 
referred to them as the "CPAN gods" but was told that it's inappropriate. Now 
I'm told that "CPAN Cabalists" is also wrong. Is "CPAN admins" good enough?

Well, I'm not familiar with a licence called the "UCLA licence". I'm normally 
using the MIT/X11 Licence (sometimes referred to as "the MIT Licence"). I 
assume that's what you meant.

I have no plans of switching the distribution to the MIT/X11 licence. If I'm 
planning on using the original code, I am not allowed to do so, because the 
originator of the code licensed them under the GPL and (original) Artistic 
licences. Both of these licences are recursive, and do not allow relicensing 
under a different licence in a derived work. 

The only way to do it, is to rewrite the code under a different licence.

What I am doing is disclaiming any implicit or explicit ownership on my 
modifications, and am assigning the full rights of them to the originator. 
Thus, if he ever resurfaces, he could re-licence the most up-to-date code 
without a need for my approval.
