Hallo,

I have partly finish Perl module for XML "cleaning". It's a simple module,
which from text with unmatched XML tags makes text with matched tags, so it
will hopefully pass throught any XML parser.

It's yet not fully featured, but it's working for basic task. If I will have
time, I will add more functions sometimes in future. 

I named it XML::Cleaner, but I'm not sure, if this name is correct. I could
e-mail it, if required. Documentation is in POD format.

Thanks for any name suggestions.

Petr Kubanek
