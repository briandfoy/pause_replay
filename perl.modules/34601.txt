I think that "DVB" is obvious only to people who are interested in
video technology. Other people will probably know DVB through another
name: "ugly satellite dish" ;-).

Anyway, I don't think that the aim of a name (and name spaces) is to
provide a precise taxonomy of available perl modules.

I'd like to think that the aim is to guide the casual user when he
browses the available modules.

Let's consider an average user who does not know or care about
DVB. This guy will be glad that DVB is under Video since he does not
care about it and will be glad that the name space is somewhat less
cluttered.  (90 % of users)

Let's consider another user looking to do radio through DVB. He knows
that DVB is a *video* standard and will probably look into Video to
get DVB (if there's no DVB:: name space). Then he will pick a module
according to the OS he's using. If this user does not think about
looking into Video::* and does not find DVB while browsing, he can
always use search.cpan.org. But that's a corner case.

So I think that Video::DVB::Linux make sense for Linux specific parts
and will satisfy the majority of perl users (non-video users also).

As for the linux specific argument, non linux specific modules falls
into: Video::DVB. Of course we'll probably end up with
Video::DVB::Radio or Video::DVB::Radio::Linux. But that's fair enough
since this radio stream is transmitted through a medium designed for
video and extended for radio.

I prefer to put Linux at the end, because I hope that the Linux
specificity is a temporary situation. Even if you don't plan to
provide DVB modules for another OS, someone might do it later. Let's
not close this door.

IMHO, only *really* linux specific APIs should be in Linux::*. Since
Linux aims to be a Unix, there's should be few modules in there. Only
module closely related to Linux kernel such as /proc interface,
modprobe interface...

For instance LVM can be found on both HPUX and Linux. Perl LVM modules
should fall into HPUX::* and Linux::* only if there's no hope of
having a reasonably common interface. 

I hope this is not the case for DVB. (Does DVB exists on FreeBSD ?)

So I also vote to place your module in Video::* , preferably
Video::DVB::Linux.

Anyway, thanks for your work and for offering it to the community. I
really hope that we will be able to reach an agreement regarding its
name.

Cheers
