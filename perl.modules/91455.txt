The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SNTP
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: SNTP Client/Server Script
  userid:      GARYFALOS (Athanasios Garyfalos)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Perl Monks, GitHub

  similar:
    Net::NTP

  rationale:

    The only module that I can found relative to mine is Net::NTP. This
    does not mean that they are the same but because both are based on
    NTP protocol but at the same time they are completely different
    protocols. NTP and SNTP similarities "the Simple Network Time
    Protocol (SNTP) Version 4, which is a simplified access strategy for
    servers and clients using NTP Version 3 as now specified and
    deployed in the Internet" [1]. The Client and server are running on
    a constant while loop that need to be terminated by the user. The
    server it simply listens and waits for the client to send a request,
    process the request and reply back. Based upon the reply the client
    readjusts the while loop sleeping period. The client upon receiving
    of the server message displays the calculated data and prints them.

    The main function of the module is to calculate the roundtrip delay
    d and local clock offset t. My target was to create a generic module
    able to operate on any OS and calculate the values based on the
    highest possible accuracy microseconds. That can be achieved on
    Linux OS only not in Windows OS due resolution problems on Windows,
    approximately 1ms.

    1. RFC2030 (Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Version 4 for IPv4,
    IPv6 and OSI)

  enteredon:   Tue Sep 23 13:57:52 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::SNTP            bdpfg SNTP Client/Server Script                    GARYFALOS
