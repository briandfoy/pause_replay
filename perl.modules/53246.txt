The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sash
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Provides standard CUI for Web Services
  userid:      WBAILEY (Wesley Bailey)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is used by the sash script which supports a Plugin API.
    Each plugin will be based off of Sash::Plugin and others can develop
    them so thats why I was requesting this module.

  enteredby:   WBAILEY (Wesley Bailey)
  enteredon:   Mon Feb 26 23:51:38 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sash              RdpOp Provides standard CUI for Web Services       WBAILEY
