Net:: seems like a sacred namespace for things of mostly a internet 
RFC'd protocol nature, but I do see some vendorish/projectish 
specific things.

I have a project http://benson.sourceforge.net/ (distributed 
monitoring) that has it's own little simple network protocol that allows a 
client to send, recieve and query data. Net::Benson seems like a 
reasonable place to me, since it's unlikely someone else has intentions 
of/or will use the same namespace. 

I consider Net::Benson the most important part to be public, but I could 
no doubt take advantage of being able to distribute other modules under a 
root Benson namespace including this one.

Regardless, I am unsure of where to upload or if I should upload the 
module and before I do a damn fool thing like upload my module, I wanted 
to get either unanswered acceptance, constructive criticism, questions, or 
flames if I have come to the wrong place.

Thank you for your time.
