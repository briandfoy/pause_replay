Sir,

My name is MR MICHEAL USENI the eldest son of Rtd
General JEREMAIAH.  J. T. USENI who was the est. while
Minister of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in the
late General Sani Abacha's Regime of 1993-1998.
I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost
confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution
to a sum of money $41.5M that is presently
putting
my entire family into great disarray.  You may be
quite surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not
despair, I got your contact from a business site on
the internet and following the information I gathered
about you, I was convinced that you could be of
assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once
due to the urgency required for us to immediately
transfer the said funds out of the country.

During the time my father was in the government with
the late head of state,they were both involved in several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the
Nigerian Defense, and monies set aside to
rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries
and the National Electric Power Authority which
supplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are
conversant with world news, you would understand
better.

During this period my father was able to make some
good money for himself and kept in his private bank
accounts. The then head of state transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive governments and most of the president's loots were traced and repatriated from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury.

Out of the money my father made, he left the sum of
N50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow
account for further transfer into a foreign account
and a sum of $41.5M (Fourty-one Million five hundred
thousand united states Dollars) was kept in
a Private security firm here in Nigeria. Through the
confessions made by the late president's Family, the N50Million was recovered by the investigating agency from
the CBN escrow account.  But were unable to discover
the $41.5M.Also the firm issued him with a certificate
of deposit of the consignments. Note that I have these
information in my custody.

Right now, my father has been arrested and detained. As the eldest son of my Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to
ensure that the $41.5M is successfully transferred
abroad for investment purposes.  With the present
situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based
on this that I am making this contact with you. Be
rest assured that the modalities I have resolved to
finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and
the successful delivery of the funds.  So, you will be
absolutely
right when you say that this project is risk free and
viable. If you are capable and willing to assist,
contact me at once via email for more details.

Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.
All my fathers' friends have deserted us after
exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my
father. As it is said, "it is at the time of problems
that you know your true friends".  So long as you keep
everything to yourself, we would definitely have no
problems. For your assistance, I am ready to give you
as much as 20% of the total funds after completion and
invest a reasonable percentage into any viable
business you may suggest.

Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and
please; do not undermine it because it will also be a
source of up liftment to you also.  You have
absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us instead,
you have so much to gain.So kindly send me your
private telephone and fax numbers,in other for me to
commence the transaction immediately.

Awaiting your urgent and positive response.

BEST REGARDS,

MR MICHEAL USENI
