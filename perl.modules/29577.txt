     why:

    OSPS is a service port generator and cryptographic communication
    system. OSPS is designed to make it easier for you to implement
    need-to-know security for your server port #'s. OSPS is a simple but
    effective system for making your private services that much harder
    to hack. If your IDS/IPS is working then you should be fairly able
    to detect a port scan looking for open services and you can defend
    against those to a degree but if you are running your services on
    WKS ports then scanning isn't required nor is any “man in the
    middle attack”. OSPS is designed to hide the service port #'s from
    those who do not need to know and yet make them available to those
    who do need to know.
