Greetings folks,

Quick question about a new module name now that my PAUSE account is up and
running.

I'd like to add this module: Die::Retry

The module provides a simple way to retry executing a block of code which
may fail (where we don't really care about the exceptions if the code
succeeds just once). The main function (&retry) can be called like a
builtin.

And example of use would be:

use Die::Retry qw( retry );

...

retry { some_function_that_might_fail(@args) };

retry can be adjusted to delay between retries, or to change the number of
retries that will be attempted:

retry( sub { some_function_that_might_fail(@args) }
     , times => 42
     , delay => 1.5 );

If &some_function_that_might_fail succeeds once the return value is passed
back:

my $retval = retry { ...

Or if it fails too many times the die is passed on with some extra
information:

"Too many retries (${retries}) - the last exception was: $@"

Matt suggested that Die::Retry was a good name but not necessarily in the
usual namespace. I'd still quite like to use it for the following reasons:

 * When I went looking for it the first thing I searched for was: retry die
   (and then went on to searching for 'exception', but die was first)
 
 * To me at least, terms such as "exception" aren't overly perlish - an
   exception occurs in a language where an error was thrown or raised,
   while in perl we're eval'ing for dies. Sure we're throwing exceptions,
   but that's not what we typed. :)

 * Die::Retry is a little more poetic and sounds cuter.

So that's my thoughts. :) If you disagree and remain unswayed by my
arguments I can switch to something like Exception::Retry.

Cheerio,

 Brad
