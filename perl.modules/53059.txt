search.cpan.org is not integrated directly with PAUSE, it is a seperate 
service.

When you upload a module, search.cpan.org will add it, and the PAUSE 
indexer will assign you "first come, you own it" rights to the 
namespaces and add you to the index. But you can upload any old crap you 
like and it will still get indexed.

This is not the same as registering a module.

Registration is a second level in which authors submit a request for 
more-formal ownership of the namespace, beyond just first-come rights.

It also means that the module is added to the official module list 
(little-used since search.cpan.org became popular).

In essense, just because you added it to CPAN, you own it and it will 
install.

If it's registered, it means that at least the NAME of the module and 
it's appropriateness have been peer-reviewed by the CPAN admins, and 
you've answered any concerns we might have over the module.

This doesn't necessarily mean the code is any good at a line by line 
level since it's really not possible to review it at that depth, but it 
does mean that we think it is named appropriately and that we've made 
sure that the author is integrated into and has discussed the module 
with any applicable CPAN sub-communities (particularly important for 
things like date and time modules, or mathematical modules).
