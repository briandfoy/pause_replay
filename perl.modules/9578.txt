The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perl6::Parameters
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: Perl 6-style prototypes with named params
  userid:      BRENTDAX (Brent Dax)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I think the reasoning behind this module is pretty obvious. Larry
    Wall and Damian Conway have already defined much of how prototypes
    work in Perl 6; I'm emulating that to the best of my ability. No
    other module currently provides this functionality. I think it
    should be listed because it's useful to both Perl 6 core hackers and
    your average Perl 5 hacker--that's why the feature's being put in,
    after all! :^)

The resulting entry would be:

Perl6::
::Parameters      bdpnp Perl 6-style prototypes with named params    BRENTDAX
