Hi Kurt,

I was thinking of implementing a few of the various Elliptic Curve
Cryptosystems within the Crypt::Elliptic namespace, however, given more
thought it is possibly more apt for them to be placed within the
Crypt::ECC namespace.

Since pretty much any cryptographic scheme/protocol based on discrete
logarithms can be (fairly) easily converted to elliptic curve form, such
that the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm would be:

Crypt::ECC::DSA

And the Elliptic Curve Pretty Good Privacy Algorithm would be:

Crypt::ECC:PGP

etc, etc.

However, the implementations could also be placed within the Crypt
namespace, as in:

Crypt::ECDSA
Crypt::ECPGP
etc,

I'm not partial to either setup.

Regards,

Alistair Mills
