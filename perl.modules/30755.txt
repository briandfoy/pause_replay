SPOPS is an existing package on CPAN for "Simple Perl Object 
Persistence with Security". I have developed a package which extends 
the functionality of SPOPS to support inheritance of persistent SPOPS 
objects. I would like to post this on CPAN and propose to use the name 
SPOPSx::Ginsu (which stands for SPOPS eXtension for Generalized 
INheritance SUpport).

Any objections?

(BTW, Chris I just wanted to give ESPOPS a better name before uploading 
to CPAN).
