Hi,
In case you don't know, you are listed as optimizer maintainers.
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=optimizer

This wasn't touched since ages, Dec 2002.
I bugged you two weeks ago, via rt.
Several patches are listed in the tracker.
Do you care if I can get co-maint to get the update out and keep it 
up-to-date?

I have several ideas for peep(), and with this simple module it can be 
tested in perl.
