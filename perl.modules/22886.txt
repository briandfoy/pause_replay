Hi,

I've written a pair of modules to detect and parse UAProf
(http://www.wapforum.org/what/technical/SPEC-UAProf-19991110.pdf) details,
that I now need to find a suitable namespace for.

UAProf is a "User Agent Profile" and it is an XML/RDF document that contains
the details of a WAP devices capabilities, i.e. it's screen size, what type
of images it can accept etc. It is a subset of the W3C's CC/PP (Composite
Capabilities/Preference Profile) specification. 

When a WAP browser visits a site, it sends an HTTP header giving the URL
where the XML/RDF document describing the devices capabilities can be found.
I download this, parse it, and provide a nice object orientated way to query
what the device is capable of. 

At present I am thinking of calling it
 HTTP::UAProf		- for the detecting and downloading, that then calls

 HTTP::UAProf::Parser	- the XML/RDF parser and data extractor itself.

I have seperated the detecting and the downloading of the XML from the
parsing as it will give others a way to handle that side of things for
themselves if they prefer.

Does HTTP::* seem like a suitable namespace to place the modules under? I
notice there are other modules that try to do similar things like browser
detection there. This module doesn't appear to be suitable for agregation
into those modules as it returns far more information, so I think it should
be standalone. Would I be better off placing it under WAP::*?

Thanks for any suggestions,

Rob
