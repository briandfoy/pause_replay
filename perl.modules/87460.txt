The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shell::Cmd
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Run shell commands with enhanced support
  userid:      SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)

  rationale:

    A very comman use of perl is to act as a wrapper around shell
    commands where it is used to prepare the shell commands, execute
    them, and deal with the resulting output. Even where the bulk of the
    work is actually done in the perl script, creating small shell
    scripts within it to do some portion of the task is common.

    In the simplest form, running shell commands can be done very
    simply using the system() call, backticks, or several other ways,
    but I usually find myself wanting to do a bit more, and I frequently
    ended up writing a subroutine to run the shell command(s) with added
    functionality.

    This module is designed to take a list of shell commands and
    automatically add some common desirable functionality to them
    including:

    o Keeping or discarding STDOUT and STDERR (in any combination). o
    Echoing commands if desired. o Dry-run mode where the shell script
    is created, but not actually run. o Error trapping and handling at a
    per-command level. o Setting up environment variables for the
    commands. o Alternate commands that do the same thing so that you
    can run the scripts more easily on multiple platforms. o Running the
    commands locally, or via. ssh on a remote host (or hosts). o When
    running via ssh on multiple hosts, support serial or parallel
    execution. o Handle quotes, dollar signs, etc. correctly, especially
    when passing the command to ssh.

    This module is designed to run multiple commands in a single shell,
    adding standard shell commands automatically to handle the desired
    functionality.

    I looked through all of the modules under the Shell and System
    namespace, and didn't find anything that did many of these things
    (though there are a number that can deal with STDOUT/STDERR
    effectively, and a few SSH modules that do some of the SSH work).

The resulting entry would be:

Shell::
::Cmd             bdpOp Run shell commands with enhanced support     SBECK
