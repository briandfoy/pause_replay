The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Wx::WidgetMaker
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: CGI.pm-like widget library for wxPerl
  userid:      SLANNING (Scott Lanning)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    wxPerl mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    NAMESPACE

    Initially I thought Wx::CGI, because it provides a CGI.pm-like
    interface to wxPerl, but that was considered confusing (people might
    think it was a web programming module). I considered Wx::Simple, but
    it's not really that simple (c.f. LWP::Simple, XML::Simple).
    Considered Wx::Abstract, but it's not abstract (c.f. DBI). Someone
    mentioned Wx::Thunk::CGI, but I think "thunk" is a little obscure
    and the module name still contains CGI. Someone mentioned
    Wx::WidgetMaker; there was an objection that "widget" isn't really a
    wxwindows term, but I think it's generic/common enough. "Maker" has
    some precedence in other CPAN modules.

    UNIQUENESS OF APPROACH

    There are currently no wxPerl-related modules other than Wx.pm.

    WHY IT SHOULD BE LISTED

    Using Wx.pm is somewhat low-level, as it is a thin wrapper for the
    C++ library; Wx::WidgetMaker provides a higher level interface. It
    also tries to mirror the CGI.pm API, so it should be familiar to CGI
    developers.

The resulting entry would be:

Wx::
