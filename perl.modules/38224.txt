Yes -- I think this IS the problem. When I go to the link:

http://cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/R/RC/

You do not see the directory appear. However, I'll bet you see it if you 
were on the web server. Check out the CHECKSUMS file in the same 
directory, and RCS is there along with the other directories.
