Actually, I am about to take a job as a Perl programmer. but I think maintaining 
Recordset is going to be daunting for me at first, having been out of Perl 
programming for about 9 months.

Actually, Matthew Simon is showing interest in maintaining Recordset also. So, 
either you can maintain it and Matthew can submit all of his cleanups to you. He 
is also integrating Silvio Wanka's cleanups.

Also, I really am starting to think that DBIx::Recordset deserves its own 
mailing list. Many users of Recordset (myself included) have no interest in the 
DBI or Embperl mailing lists. The two competitors of Recordset (Class::DBI and 
Alzabo) each have their own mailing list.

I think that I can go into PAUSE and change this myself and will do so as soon 
as it is decided how Matthew and Gerald feel it is best to cooperate on this.

I don't think you are prohibited from uploading a new version without maintainer 
credentials.
