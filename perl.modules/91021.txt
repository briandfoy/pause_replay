Request to register new user

fullname: Roberto Frenna

     why:

    Because I have been coding in Perl for a long time, and it's my
    time to give something back to the community! I plan to upload a
    module that I wrapped up recently, and I have more stuff in the
    works. By the way - keep up the good work!
