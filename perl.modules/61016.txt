     why:

    Kevin C. Krinke (KCK) is looking for a co-maintainer for UI-Dialog;
    I have contacted him to offer my services. My understanding is that
    I would need a PAUSE account in order to do this work.

    I have also been developing a module for automating interactions
    with the Opsview monitoring system (http://www.opsview.org). It is
    approaching production readiness, and I would like to submit it to
    CPAN.
