The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Jorge
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple ORM.
  userid:      PORTA (Julián Porta)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::Class

  rationale:

    This is a software we use in our company for internal dev and it is
    time to share it with the world. It grew a lot in the last few years
    and I consider it a good usable piece of software. The approach is
    far from being unique, to be honest, but I think it's easy to use
    and implement. About the name, I think it's kinda funny and not
    usual.

  enteredby:   PORTA (Julián Porta)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 18 03:28:25 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Jorge             adpOp Simple ORM.                                  PORTA
