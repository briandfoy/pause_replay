Hi,

thanks for assigning the CPAN user id 'GUIDO' to me.

Unfortunately something went a little wrong with it: First problem is
that there was a typo in my e-mail address as entered into the CPAN
database.  It is "guido" and not "guide" @imperia.net.  I have alreay
fixed
that on PAUSE.  Is this sufficient or are there any traces of the typo
left someplace else?  Our MTA is configured to distribute all mail for 
unknown users at our domain to my boss...

Second problem: Before I applied for the CPAN id I have searched with
all available engines if there is already an entry for me in your
records.
All search engines said no but now that it is too late I have discovered
http://pause.kbx.de/pause/query?ACTION=who_is and it turned out that
I was already listed with the user id 'GFLOHR'. :-(

Could you manually remove the user id GFLOHR?  Or remove GUIDO and mail
me a password for GFLOHR, so that I can update the information, whatever
is easier for you.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks in advance!

Guido
