The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Getconf
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: config container for command-line apps
  userid:      DOZZIE (Stanisław Klekot)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    App::Options, AppConfig

  rationale:

    The module is meant as a config container for command-line
    applications. Configuration options may be set from command line or
    configuration file.

    The module provides a way of passing options down the function call
    stack. Traditional way of doing this is to either use global
    variable(s) or to pass config container as argument to each
    function. * global variable has a drawback of introducing name of a
    variable that is treated differently than most of the others (i.e.
    locals): it's defined elsewhere and programmer needs to remember not
    to use the name * passing container as argument is tedious, as
    programmer needs to pass it to every function, even if it doesn't
    use options directly

    App::Getconf uses approach similar to Log::Log4perl: it provides a
    static method that returns option container (actually, a view of the
    options).

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Getconf         RdpOp config container for command-line apps       DOZZIE
