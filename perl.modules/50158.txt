Subject: Module submission Devel::RingBuffer
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, darnold@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::RingBuffer
  DSLIP:       RdhOa
  description: Shared memory ring buffers for Perl scripts
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Devel::RingBuffer provides data structures and interfaces to permit
    recording and retrieving diagnostic and debugger information on a
    per-thread basis in a shared memory area (via IPC::Mmap). Currently,
    Devel::RingBuffer is only used by Devel::STrace to record callstack
    information, but it has been instrumented with interfaces to support
    a complete interactive debugger (e.g., Devel::Psichedb, currently
    under development). The provided interfaces permit construction of
    attachable/detachable debuggers that are multithread/multiprocess
    friendly.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
