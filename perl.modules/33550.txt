The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Glib
  DSLIP:       RmhOl
  description: Bindings for the glib-2.x UI Toolkit
  userid:      RMCFARLA (Ross McFarland)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    gtk-perl-list@gnome.org, #gtk-perl on ircd.gimp.org,
    http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/ (news, rels, doc, tutorials, cvs,
    etc.)

  similar:
    Gtk

  rationale:

    In gtk+-1.x the functionality of glib was bundeled with gtk+. in
    the 2.x series it was broken out into a seperate module providing
    portablity, type registration, and the base object type (with
    properties, signals etc.) If has purposes outside of GUI programming
    and thus was placed in a seperate module for perl so that i can be
    used in non-GUI apps. especially when object oriented c code (using
    glib-2.x) is bound to perl.

    this isn't really a binding of user interface stuff (thus the
    chapter choosen,) but it may best grouped with Gtk2 and Gnome2 under
    user-interface.

The resulting entry would be:

Glib              RmhOl Bindings for the glib-2.x UI Toolkit         RMCFARLA
