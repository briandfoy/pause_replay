Not really because
  a) the name space is for Terminals, not a browser or TK window or  
anything else
  b) its a start/stop sort of thing w/ magic in the terminal letting  
it run while something else is running, which would never work for  
say HTTP/browser based stuff, or anything else AFAICS (maybe Tk with  
some major voodoo)

This is generic enough to be used in any type of output to Twiddle  
text, while specific enough to do one specific task completely.

HTH, thanks Adam!
