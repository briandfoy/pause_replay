Hi

My pause id is TWIBBLER and I have today uploaded various files to this
area.

The primary file PDFREP.pm which is a report creation package in PDF format
output file.

There is also a PDFREP.htm file which is the documentation for this package
what it is how to use etc. This document was written as a dual document to
explain to non techies about the package and also to explain to techies how
to use.

The third part of the upload is pdftest.htm, pdftest.cgi and pdftest.pm
which is an example application to show how PDFREP can be used.

I hope that I have understood the info correctly in sending you this to ask
if it ma be added to the appropriate modules list, and making it available
to CPAN.

May I thank you for the advice you gave in naming this package and in
getting me this far.

If I should be contacting somebody else to add this to the list could you
please let me know.

Thanks

Trevor.
