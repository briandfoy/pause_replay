right.. if i do that now, stuff breaks. So either we need a 
simultaneous release, or you give me a proper API i can use.

I have a better idea. How about i give you co-maintainership of 
DBIx::Simple::OO, and you can sort it as you see fit. I'm sure you have

And seeing the size of the code base (quite quite small), it should be 
easy to overview it.
