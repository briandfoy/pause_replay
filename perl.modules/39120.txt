Hi

I want to type korean on my site cgi:irc chatting room.
So i tryed to install Encode 2.0.9 and lower version. But it made some
error after "make test".
Error message is like this


2 tests and 6 subtests skipped.
Failed 1/19 test scripts, 94.74% okay. 2/4951 subtests failed, 99.96% okay.
make: *** [test_dynamic] error 29


My server version is Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES (v. 3 for x86) 
and I am using perl 5.6.0.

Can you help me? I really would like to your help.

Thank you
