if the search engine would index GTop.pod, then the package would turn up
with keywords such as memory, cpu, etc.
libgtop provides a common api to access data you normally see with a
broad range of system utilities: top, ifconfig, df, uptime, etc.  the only
existing namespace i could see all this fitting into was Sys::, but as
andreas said, that is avoided.  i did make the effort to put it in the
module list under the section: 4) Operating System Interfaces, Hardware
Drivers
i do not plan any further documentation or advertising for GTop, but
patches are welcome of course.
