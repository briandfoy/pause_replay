Subject: Module submission WebService::Eventful
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, radcliff@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Eventful
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Interface to the Eventful web services API
  userid:      RADCLIFF (Chris Radcliff)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    This module is discussed at http://api.evdb.com and on the developer
    mailing list http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.evdb.api

  similar:
    EVDB::API

  rationale:

    This is an attempt to permanently locate the previous EVDB::API
    beta module, which will be released as version 1.0 within the next
    week. The service it accesses has been renamed Eventful
    (http://eventful.com), so this seemed a good time to rename the
    module as well and find it a permanent home.

    Similar modules exist in the WebService root namespace already,
    including WebService::Upcoming and WebService::Basecamp.

  enteredon:   Fri Sep  1 19:32:19 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::
::Eventful        RmpOp Interface to the Eventful web services API   RADCLIFF
