Subject: Module submission Net::CascadeCopy

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::CascadeCopy
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: efficiently copy files to many servers
  userid:      VVU (Alex White)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    A frequent solution to distributing a file or directory to a large
    number of servers is to copy it from a central file server to all
    other servers. To speed this up, multiple file servers may be used,
    or files may be copied in parallel until the inevitable bottleneck
    in network/disk/cpu is reached.

    This module and the included script, ccp, take a much more
    efficient approach. Once the file(s) are been copied to a remote
    server, that server will be promoted to be used as source server for
    copying to remaining servers. Thus the rate of transfer increases
    exponentially rather than linearly.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
