Planning to contribute:
-----------------------
A module, Sendmail::Milter, that gives users the ability to write mail
filters in Perl.

Module list description:

Sendmail::Milter   bdch   Write mail filters for sendmail in Perl      CYING

Discussed publicly:
-------------------
This module has never been discussed publicly, however full pod
documentation is available with the module, and I can provide those if you
like. I'll briefly describe what you can do with it below:

Extended description:
---------------------
Sendmail::Milter provides users with the ability to write mail filters in
Perl that tightly integrate with sendmail. These mail filters are able to
perform operations based on every step of the SMTP negotiation process,
and can perform operations on message headers and message bodies, such as
scanning and filtering mail attachments, checking for and replacing
headers, adding / removing envelope recipients, and so on.

Mail filters written with this module define and register perl callbacks
with the main engine. Sendmail::Milter calls these perl callbacks using a
threaded persistent interpreter pool. (Similar to mod_perl 2.0) Milter
contexts are presented using an object-oriented style interface for
performing operations on a Milter context.

Thanks,

Charles Ying
