Cool. I am looking forward to follow it's development. You might =
consider pasting some of your first reply into the projects README file, =
it would make the whole undertaking (which seems interesting) =
intelligible to outsiders (such as me).

Ok, here is the pinnacle of the whole thing - I didn't notice that your=20
framework isn't linked from the main listing. A co-worker sent me a =
link, and I
never thought to check where he had found it. Aren't assumptions just =
the road
to hell. I apologise.

And no, I certainly am not planning to use Meta:: as a namespace myself, =
so I have no problems with it for now. Of course somebody might complain =
once it get's 'released', but lets take the problems as they come =
(unlike what I did in the previous mail).

ps. Actually I am quite intersted in projects such as this, using =
databases to drive applications. I have been playing with a pet project =
for a while, indexing emails in a PostgreSQL database. I'll have a look =
at your code and try and give you some kind of comments on it if I have =
the time (maybe as unqualified as 'cool' or 'yuck', but hopefully more).
