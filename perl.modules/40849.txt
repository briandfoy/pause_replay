Generally, the first step is to try to contact the original author 
(regardless of the age of the module). Send him a couple of emails.

If his email address doesn't bounce, please allow a few weeks to reply.

If you want to take over a distribution, it is a strong preference (for 
obvious reasons) that HE make the request to turn over maintainership to 
you. Old authors are generally quite positive about this.

They will either take your changes as a patch, upload it for you, or 
will do the handover... it varies.

If he is uncontactable after a couple of weeks despite your efforts, 
then please request the change of maintainership again, detailing what 
you did.

And thanks greatly for your interest in keeping the module up to date.
