The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bigtop
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A web app description language
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    gantry-l@usegantry.org www.usegantry.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Bigtop is a language for describing database backed web
    applications and a code generator which makes web apps from those
    descriptions.

    It allows for generation of... sql to build the database object
    relational modeler code controllers config files

    It is somewhat like the code generators of other web app
    frameworks, but only in that it is a generator. What distinguishes
    it is... variety of generated output (see above) generation from a
    single description file safe regeneration as the app matures plugin
    scheme allowing new generators

    The last point needs more explanation. By writing a plugin, anyone
    familiar with parsing and syntax tress, may write a generator to
    produce whatever they need from the original description. For
    instance, if the SQL syntax of your database is a bit odd, you can
    write a new generator for your database and use it as easily as the
    supplied generators. The new plugin may even register additional
    keywords with the grammar, if the current language is not rich
    enough for its purpose.

The resulting entry would be:

Bigtop            bdpOp A web app description language               PHILCROW
