If ownership has been transfered the CPAN indexes haven't been updated.
modules/02packages.details.txt.gz still points to 1.00.  Did the ownership
transfer happen after you uploaded 1.02?  Was it official?  (ie. does
pause.perl.org recognize it?)  If so, CPAN may need to reindex.

Or you can put out a new version.  CPAN should notice that.
