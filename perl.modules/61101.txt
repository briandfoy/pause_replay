     why:

    A module (or factory of modules) to tie charting modules to
    database results or a simple perl data structures. The primary
    charting module that I want to improve is for Google Charts. I don't
    like the fact that with all the existing APIs you have to always
    think about the encoding, ranging, and color selection. There should
    be nice defaults for all these things that are computed
    automatically. Even more cool will be when I get it working with
    other charting tools. Giving each charting tool a common api.
