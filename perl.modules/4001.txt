The modules look very cool.

However

You should be careful as to what modules you've created solve a problem in 
a particular way that you enjoy using and which ones are truly 
generic.  Some of the following was unclear in your email explanation of 
the modules.

I am worried that some of your CGI::* modules have taken a hold of a 
generic namespace when they should belong either somewhere else in CPAN or 
under CGI::WPM.

eg Why is CGI::SequentialFile under CGI::? Shouldn't a data storage module 
you are relying on be under a totally different tree? And also what are you 
using CGI::SequentialFile for? It's a bit unclear as to the relationship there.

Of course, I should be one to talk... I've never uploaded anything to CPAN 
yet (although I've got an ID now... ). Congrats on taking that step forward. :)
