Jos=C3=A9, what alternative phrasings do you think would be more obvious?
"Give up" seems clear to me, but I could imagine how a non-native
speaker might not catch the subtle difference between "Give" and "Give
up" if reading quickly.

Ideas:

    2.2 - Abandon primary maintainership status

    2.2 - Drop primary maintainership status

    2.2 - Nuke primary maintainership status

The later is slang, but evocative of the severity of the choice.

Or we could slap a big warning on it:

    2.2. - DON"T DO THIS UNLESS YOU REALLY MEAN TO: Drop primary
maintainership status

What do you think?

Thanks,
David
