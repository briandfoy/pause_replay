Hi Reini,

I think that Ian already granted me co-maint - see 
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Crypt-OpenSSL-Bignum

It is only metacpan.org that did not noticed that - see "UNAUTHORIZED" 
flags at https://metacpan.org/release/Crypt-OpenSSL-Bignum

I'll wait a day or two, perhaps something has to somehow propagate somewhere.

Anyway I have the same trouble with unmaintained Crypt::OpenSSL::AES 
(owner: TTAR - Tolga Tarhan) see 
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=77605 (no response since 2012)
