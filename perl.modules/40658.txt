     why:

    I'd like to contribute two modules initially:

    Tie::File::Hash -- This module allows a file to stand in for a
    hash. Unlike other modules providing tailored applications of this
    principle, this is for generic use. Built on Data::Dumper and
    Tie::File.

    Hash::IntegerKeys -- This module is intended for use by code that
    needs flexible use of hashes with keys that are all integers. It
    allows said code to refer to the keys polymorphically, i.e. all the
    following would be valid lookups of the value at key 10: $h{10},
    $h{0xa}, $h{0Xa}, $h{0xA}, $h{012}, $h{0b1010}, etc. Built on
    Hash::MultiKey.
