The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Package::Transporter
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Transport between and into Packages
  userid:      WINTRU (Winfried Trumper)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    RT, Ratings

    AutoLoader AutoloadComponent Carp::REPL Devel::REPL
    Class::AutoloadCAN UNIVERSAL::canAUTOLOAD Class::ArrayObjects
    Class::AutoAccess Class::Exporter Class::Fields Class::Gomor
    Class::LazyObject Object::Lazy Data::Lazy Class::Method::Auto
    Data::Locations Exporter Exporter::Easy Exporter::Lite
    Exporter::Renaming Exporter::Simple Exporter::Tidy
    Object::AutoAccessor Method::Autoload Object::Trampoline
    Object::Realize::Later load Object::Wrapper Fatal PAR Shell
    Perl6::Export SelfLoader Sub::Auto Sub::Autostub Sub::Exporter
    subs::auto Util::Any constant fields

  rationale:

    Choice: It carries subroutines and other definitions into or
    between packages via (in classical terms) Export, Import and
    Autoload.

    Uniqueness: Packages only modify their own namespace, shared
    AUTOLOAD, interface for subroutine creation through generators, OO
    interface (drain, potential, and universal), propagation along
    hierarchies, (very) limited support for lexicals.

    Why: "It is just recommended for better searchability of the CPAN
    and to avoid namespace clashes."

    Relations: Package::Transporter is not not meant as a drop-in
    replacement for any of the aforementioned modules. The existing 26
    generators stretch its capabilities in various ways to chase bugs
    out. The amount should not be taken as an indicator for completeness
    or support. Some generators bridge to existing modules (Fatal,
    Shell), some are more specialized solutions (Interactive vs. REPL),
    some have - surprise - no direct match (Export), and many generators
    are simply experimental (SQL_Table). But all use the same interface
    style and can co-exist with each other.

The resulting entry would be:

Package::
