Hi Andreas

I've just uploaded CGI::Application::Demo V 1.00 via PAUSE, but my build=
 script 
included a config file with real passwords in it.

It's not /too/ serious, but if possible could you delete that distro ASAP.=
 I've 
scheduled it for deletion but that's Sunday.

I'll upload V 1.01 now.

TIA.
