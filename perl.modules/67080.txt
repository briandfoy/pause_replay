Thanks for replying. I also thought that Authen::Email would be too
specific. On discussing on #email, I concluded that Authen::UserVerify
would be more appropriate, since it need not be via email.

The module generates a code that can be part of a URL sent to a user via
email. When the user clicks the link, she is redirected to your
application and can confirm her email or reset her password, etc.  So
the module does a password-less authentication based on the unique code
generated.
