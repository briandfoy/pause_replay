sorry, I didn't explain myself correctly.  there will not be 2 modules, only
one, reclassified, and Steven has asked me to maintain it.

the space Proc::PID should actually become a family of which File is only a
member, there is other PID related functionality that could use that space
like Proc::PID::Of

There's no need for the extra level of name here and having both a
Proc::PID_File module and a Proc::PID::File module doesn't help people.

Whatever the differences in functionality are between the two modules
should be expressed somehow in the names. The suggested change doesn't.
