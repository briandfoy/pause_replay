There are lot's of anomolies, hidden secrets, double meanings and simply 
funny things scattered about the Perl language and culture. For me, it's one 
of the top reasons that I put my efforts towards Perl rather than some 
arguably "less confusing" languages out there. Perl is a clever language for 
smart people.

I think DataBuilt has chosen this name to keep in line with its other running 
puns like "DBI.pm" (DataBuilt Inc Perl Mongers). Having the author id of DBI 
is clever, but not really *that* clever. I personally would be fine with 
using DATABUILT.

However I think it's a little overboard to argue that *anything* (matching
/\w{3,9}/) should be disallowed from being an id. It's almost like saying
that I shouldn't be allowed to use $Jesus as a variable name. CPAN author ids
simply don't show up in very prominent places. (BTW, I just checked and there
is an author id of JESUS. So for chrissake, er, nevermind...

Cheers, Brian
