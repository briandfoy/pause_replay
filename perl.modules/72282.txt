Did you file on rt.cpan.org? You need to do that first.

Preferably with a patch.

Then, email the author as many places as you can.

I would say the ::*fix modules are an awful idea - installing a fixed
version locally and clearly documenting that that's required seems like
a much much better idea - or bundling a fixed version with your code.

Note that you could build a $current_version_01.tar.gz dev release and install
that - then it's clearly not the mainline CPAN version if anybody looks.

Bundling a fixed version would be much better than bundling the *fix modules.
This is what applications in the wild commonly do.
