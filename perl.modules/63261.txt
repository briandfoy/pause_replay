Hi Alex,

sorry for the delay. Too much work.

I'd be fine with either IO::Stream of IO::EV. I think I'd consider
IO::Stream more appropriate given your outline of how you could make it
pluggable and not much dependent on EV itself. However, if it's
EV-centric at the core after all, IO::EV would probably be better.

Regardless, if you submit a registration for either of them, I'd be
inclined to approve it *unless brian objects*.

Best regards,
Steffen
