Matt,

Thanks for the recommendation.

I think that the difference between "Outline" and "Inline" in the Lua 
case is clear, hence the difference in names.

It seems that in my request I put too much emphasis in that my module 
allows JavaScript programmers to use most perl modules easily, when in 
fact it equally easy allows Perl programmers to use JavaScript code.

That was because that's the main difference between Claes's JavaScript 
and my module.

Please read 
http://search.cpan.org/~sortiz/JSP-1.01/lib/JSP.pm#INTRODUCTION for a 
broader view.

The whole thing needs a short name, think in an author that needs to 
write "Outline::JavaScript::Tweaks::IO::Handle" or 
"Outline::JavaScript::Runtime::JSCommon" to hook into it.

The name "JSP" in fact has the problem that it can be confused with the 
well established acronym of "JavaServer Pages".

I've been thinking in the name for weeks, a better one can be 
"JavaScript Perl Lingo" or "JSPL", not unlike Larry's JPL.

What do you think?

Can I get "JSPL" registered?

Best regards.

Salvador Ortiz.
