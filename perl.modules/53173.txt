Gimp::Fu make it possible to write Gimp plugins in pure Perl to be run 
from the Gimp menu, and also provides a Gimp PerlFu server to run 
external Perl scripts. I would prefer to use Gimp::Fu but it requires 
compilation of Gimp/Perl/GTK. I am a Windows user. The process is 
complex and uses tools unavailable on Windows. Gimp used to come with 
Perl support built in, but interest in that seems to have waned and no 
one seems to be solving the Windows problems.

Gimp::ScriptFu::Client at least provides a Perlish way to run Scheme 
scripts with the ScriptFu server, which comes with all Gimp installs. No 
compilation needed. The embedding of Perl in Scheme provides a way 
around the limitations of Scheme.

Gimp::ScriptFu::Client also embeds the actual transmission of the script 
to the server. Hence the Client part of the name. I don't think Gimp::Fu 
does that, but I am not sure.

As for namespace, it's a Gimp tool, so it seems reasonable to be in the 
Gimp:: root space, but it is not dependent on or related to the Gimp::Fu 
modules. It's an alternate approach.
