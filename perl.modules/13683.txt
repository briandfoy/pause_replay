The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Persistent::Hash
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Data Structure Persistence API
  userid:      BBEAUSEJ (Benoit Beausejour)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:
    Tie::Persistent, Persistence::Object

  rationale:

    Persistent::Hash is a base class that implements a hash persistence
    framework for Perl. The Persistent::Hash class implements a TIE
    mechanism to transform a standard hash into a storable object. It
    also includes standard method to load and save the object. A
    Persistent::Hash basically has the same behaviour a normal hash
    would, but has additionnal methods pertaining to persistence.

    The base class uses "storage modules" to know how to save a
    specific object to storage container and how to reload it, so the
    whole "storage" part of the implementation is completely modular. A
    Persistent::Hash can be saved in two chunk, data and index. The
    "data" chunk is saved as a blob while the "index" chunk is saved in
    a properly indexed table to take advantage of native database
    implementations.

The resulting entry would be:

Persistent::
