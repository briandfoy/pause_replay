Subject: Module submission CouchDB::Lite

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CouchDB::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A simple Perl module for CouchDB
  userid:      CMS (Cliff Stanford)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    CouchDB::View CouchDB::Client

  rationale:

    The existing modules appear not to have been kept up to date and
    are therefore useless against CouchDB versions 0.10 (current). 0.11
    (about to be released) and the upcoming 1.0.

    The intention of CouchDB::Lite is to provide a simple and
    up-to-date framework from Perl around the CouchDB interface.

    I am expecting to write, and hope others will also write, other
    modules below the CouchDB::Lite namespace to perform specific tasks
    when interfacing to the database. Bulk updates and authorisation
    modules are in progress.

    I notice that CouchDB is in chapter 16. In my opinion it should be
    moved to 7 as CouchDB is now becoming a serious database to compete,
    as a back end, with SQL.

The resulting entry would be:

CouchDB::
::Lite            bdpOp A simple Perl module for CouchDB             CMS
