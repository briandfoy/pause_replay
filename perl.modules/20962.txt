The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Linux::NBD
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: interface to the linux network block device
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    If (according to the pause registeri form) CVS is a place to
    publicly discuss a module, then I guess CPAN also qualifies - the
    module is already uploaded.

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace choice: well, it's linux-specific, broken, and
    linux-specific. Oh, and it's the network block device (known as
    NBD).

    Uniqueness of my approach: Pardon??? ;) Well, it sometimes oopses,
    but thats not really unique to my module. But them again, pelr
    modules that make a kernel oops are indeed rare...

    Why it should be listed: How the heck should people find out about
    it's existance if not through the wonderful module list?

    In any case, this application is not a joke, but the language used
    in the register form sounded sooo funny with respect to this
    particular module, I just had to ... ;)

The resulting entry would be:

Linux::
::NBD             adcOp interface to the linux network block device  MLEHMANN
