Hello Nick, hello everyone,

I'm searching for a perl module which allows approximate checking of file 
similareness as per manber94 (see link)
	http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/manber94finding.html

I've had a good look around and found
	String::Approx,
	String::Similarity,
	File::Find::Duplicates,
	File::Compare,
but they all do not what I need.

Does anyone know such a module?

If not, it could probably go into File::Compare (which would return not 0 or 1 
but fractions for the amount of similar data).

Nick: Is it ok with you to put that into your module, or would you suggest 
creating a new module? (which would probably be better since File::Compare is 
in the standard distribution, while this functionality will be beta for some 
time)


Any pointers??


Thank you in advance!

Regards,

pm
