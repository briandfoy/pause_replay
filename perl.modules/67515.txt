CSJewell does the strawberry builds and has been trawling round taking
and fixing abandoned stuff to help make win32 a first class citizen
without needing third party commercial stuff. He's good people.

Modules that look like they were abandoned in 2002 don't usually have any
development history we can get at; Curtis' email was of the standard form to
start the clock ticking on a vanished maintainer so that modules@ could
pass the permissions over if they genuinely were vanished.

Evidently you're not, you were just pining for the fjords, but we didn't
know that - FCGI.pm has been on the "looks abandoned, we'll probably have
to steal or fork" list for the Catalyst team for a couple years as well.

The initial email could have been phrased better, sure, but please look at
it from the point of view of somebody whose window onto the state of FCGI.pm
is

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SKIMO/FCGI-0.67/
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=FCGI

and very little else.

And hey, one of the things a META.yml can/should contain is a repository URL,
so if somebody cuts an FCGI release with one, then everybody will know
where the development history lives :)
