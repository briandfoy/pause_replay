Hello,

I'm trying to upload a module to CPAN called Symbol::Table
I searched from the various CPAN search engines
to make sure I didn't bump into anyone else's namespace.
But when I uploaded the module, I got the following email 
(at bottom).

The email says the Symbol::Table is registered to GARROW.
There is nothing of that name at that CPAN account:
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/G/GA/GARROW/

Can I register Symbol::Table and Symbol::Table::Tie ??
Do I need to rename the module?

please advise,
Greg London
