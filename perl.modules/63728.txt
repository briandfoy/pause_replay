Subject: Module submission TL1Toolkit
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TL1Toolkit
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Utility functions for TL1 equipment
  userid:      RVDP (Ronald van der Pol)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    presentations at various (research) network meetings

  similar:
    Net::TL1, TL1ng

  rationale:

    The TL1 Toolkit has been in use for a couple of years by various
    organisations. We think that the inclusion in CPAN will stimulate
    its further development.

    We are in contact with the author of TL1ng to see if we can use
    TL1ng for lower level calls to TL1 equipment. However, the current
    version of TL1ng does not handle multi-part return output correctly.
    That is why we propose TL1Toolkit as a standalone module at first.

  enteredby:   RVDP (Ronald van der Pol)
  enteredon:   Sun Dec 21 14:59:02 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

TL1Toolkit        bdpOo Utility functions for TL1 equipment          RVDP
