Hi All,

Currently the DBM::Deep::* primary maintainer permissions are divided
between RKINYON, TSCHULZ, and JHUCKABY.  This means that three people
have to work in concert to add a new co-maintainer. 

Can we make RKINYON the primary maintainer for everything in DBM::Deep
so he can assign co-maintainer permissions on everything?

Everyone can still be a maintainer, but there would be only one primary
maintainer for the entire distro.
