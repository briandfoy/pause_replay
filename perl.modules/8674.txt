a short description of what you're planning to contribute :
A module (GD::Dashboard), based on GD, that provides users with a quick =
and easy way to create dashboard or cockpit like JPGs to display
key information. =20

I have spoken with Lincoln Stein (GD.pm author) and he is OK with me =
being under the GD namespace, which appears to be the convention.  I =
haven't found a similar module.

Additionally, I have another module that works with HTML::Template to =
perform certain types of aggregation operations and present the data to =
H::T.  I would like to include this eventually but it is not yet ready.
