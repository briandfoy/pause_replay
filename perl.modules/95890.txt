Hi all,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m emailing you because =
I=E2=80=99m working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now =
considering package names case insensitively. This has left us with some =
situations where two or more people are owners of namespaces previously =
considered distinct, and now considered the same.

One such case is the conflict between I18N::String (which BABF owns, and =
DRTECH has co-maint on) and i18n::string (owned by AUDREYT, and four =
others have co-maint). To resolve this, one of the package names needs =
to either be removed from CPAN, or marked for non indexing. The =
immediately obvious options I can see are:

  1. The I18N-String distribution doesn=E2=80=99t appear to install on =
recent versions of Perl,
     or on many older Perls either. See: =
http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=3DI18N-String
     So maybe the distribution can be deleted from CPAN and I drop drop =
the permissions?
     I notice that the module name has been marked for HANDOFF as well.

  2. The i18n::string package is a =E2=80=9Ccuckoo package=E2=80=9D =
defined in i18n.pm, in the i18n distribution.
     Given the public interface for i18n, I think it would be fine to =
hide the i18n::string
     from PAUSE (or you could rename it, of course).

Audrey, would you be happy to do a release, changing the package lines =
to:

    package
	i18n::string;

    package
        i18n::var;

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m working through the historical cases, resolving conflicts.

Cheers,
Neil
