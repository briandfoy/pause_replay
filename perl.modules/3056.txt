Description (from original announcement msg):
---------------------------------------------------------------
I am pleased to announce the 1st version of DBD-Sprite, a brand =

new pure Perl DBD driver for the Perl/DBI interface! DBD-Sprite =

emulates DBI   database access on ascii text flat-files, similar to  DBD:=
:CSV,
but MUCH BETTER! DBD-Sprite was build around a very much  modified copy o=
f
"Sprite", a flat-file SQL interface written by =

Shashir Gurdavaram.

My original intent for writing DBD-Sprite was to allow myself to =

prototye

web and other database applications on my personal machine, which =

had no database and then upload to production servers with Oracle. Obtain=
ing
Oracle licences was also time-consuming and some =

customers wished to test my apps on their machines before being =

able to obtain Oracle. DBD-Sprite allows this permitting usually =

no more than 1 word of code-change (the database type) when =

uploading to an Oracle server.
