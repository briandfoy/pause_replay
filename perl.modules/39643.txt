I read this message on codecomments.com by coincidence. This message
never came directly to me, but I'm pretty sure it is directed to me
since I proposed the module namespace. Excuse me if I'm not supposed
to post to this list.

The Apache::LogFormat is a base module, for which I now have two
extensions: Apache::LogFormat::Common, and
Apache::LogFormat::Combined. These modules can construct an
accesslog-line in the approriat format. This line (string) can then be
used to write to a file (or whatever). It is Object oriented, an
expample of it's intended use:

<code>
use Apache::LogFormat::Common;

sub handler{
my $r =3D shift;
my $lf =3D Apache::LogFormat::Common->new($r);
open (FH, '/var/log/access_log');
print FH $lf->toString();
close(FH);
}
</code>

The base module Apache::LogFormat contains an algorithm for
efficiently creating the Apache date format.
I wrote this module because I couldn't find any module or interface
that could do this.

I hope my explaination of the module is sufficient,

Does this module get and set the LogFormat value? I just
want to be sure since the first thing I thought was that it
might be a parser.

If that first situation is the case, I have no problem with
the name (and wonder how we went this long without it :)
