First of all, I'm confused about provenance here.  Brad Fitzpatrick is
the author of the module, but you want to register it in the
namespace?  Is the module on CPAN?  Will it be under your directory? 
If so, do you have permission from the author?  What are the licensing
terms (I looked at the website you've listed, and found no terms or
statement of authorship)?

Then, I'm not convinced that Danga:: is the best top-level namespace. 
We generally discourage new top-level namespaces unless either 1)
they're very general and functionally descriptive, like Net:: or
Math::, or 2) they represent an unusual (and potentially large) set of
related modules.  I'm not sure that Danga:: fits either of those
criteria.

Also, if danga.com wants to release its modules to CPAN, I'd want to
hear that from somebody affiliated with Danga.
