I think it's important to clear up misunderstandings, so I'm
not going to ignore it :-)

Not really. Jabber is not just an IM or chat system. Jabber is 
a development architecture and platform for building distributed
services, just as e.g. Apache is a development architecture and
platform for building services and so on. Many of the developments
I and other people are doing with Jabber have nothing to do with
Instant Messaging. Jabber doesn't really belong in this area.

Again, Jabber, amongst other things, embodies protocols, as for example
Apache embodies HTTP. But it is a lot more than that. The problem is
that people have a perception that it is just a protocol or just an
IM solution. Placing the modules under Net:: would only further that
misunderstanding.

Just as Apache is important enough to warrant it's own top level,
so is Jabber.

This doesn't really fit, I'm afraid.

There are other modules in the pipeline for Jabber in the 
Jabber:: namespace, for example Piers will be bringing on 
Jabber::JAX::Component module soon.[1] And there will be
Jabber::JUDO::Element and Jabber::JAX::Packet too. None of them
related to a *protocol*, and none of them related to IM or chat.
There's increasing interest in Jabber as a solution to many things,
and these modules provide many different types of mechanisms for
leveraging Jabber's capabilities.

Other modules that I have already written and will be submitting
include Jabber::RPC (to support the official marriage of Jabber
and XML-RPC: Jabber-RPC) and Jabber::RPC::HTTPgate - a bridge 
between traditional (HTTP-based) XML-RPC and Jabber-RPC.

Furthermore, there will doubtless be modules related to Jabber as
a commercial product emerging too. 

It's important to get this right early, rather than when it's
too late. Putting the Jabber work under Net:: does a disservice
to both Jabber _and_ Net::. 

Kind regards
