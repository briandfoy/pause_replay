Mail::IMAPClient v1.19 has just been uploaded to PAUSE. I went to
the "Edit Module Metadata" page on PAUSE, though, and I see that
this module is not listed. (That same page says I should write to
this address, so here I am!)

This module has been on CPAN for over a year now; could I have
overlooked something when I registered it? Yes, I checked the
Modules page on CPAN and followed the instructions some time ago.
(A year ago maybe?) I know people are using my module because I
get feedback every day.

Thanks for your assistance,

Dave Kernen
