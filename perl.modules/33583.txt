To start your own domain name and web site in to the German Market you need =
the German domain extension ".de" to become visible in the German search =
engines.
My service is to register your requested German domain names in my name and =
get them working on German servers which fulfil the German dns technical =
hosting requirements.
In addition, I provide you with my individual services to get your new German =
presence working with success!
More information go http://german-domains.d-abc.de
or mail to german-domains@d-abc.de
