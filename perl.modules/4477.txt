Hi everybody

I am working as a developer/programmer in South Germany.
The most projects I do is for a typesetting system which has
an interface to perl. The Name of this system is 3B2.

I nearly finished my package with a lot of functions very useful
for 3B2. And they are only useful if you have 3B2.

Now I want to make it public.

For my tests and developing I created a new directory .../lib/advent3b2/
to load the stuff with "use" without modifying INC.

I am thinking about an own way to distribute this (we and other sellers have 
enough resources and the package is indeed very special stuff) but I am not
shure whether this is possible.

My idea is that all 3B2-Users can develop helpful functions and store them in
the same folder.

Before I wan't to make a decision I have some questions:

1. Is it possible to reserve the foldername .../lib/advent3b2/??
2. Additionally I would like to register the Namespace Advent3B2.
3. Is it possible to register 1. and/or 2. and distribute everything
   without uploading to your server?


Best regards,
Uwe Braun
