Dears,

as I do not have the impression that security@pause.perl.org is fully
functional I use modules@ plus David in the To field.

On 2009-08-06 I got the perlmonks password file with all 51105
passwords. Each of them hashed with all 4096 possible salts that
crypt() may have. During the next days I set all accounts to the state
'nologin' that used one of these passwords. The final total number of
accounts was 767.

I just finished a batch job run that informed all 767 users in
personal mails about the state: I reset their passwords and allowed
them to use the 'forgot password' interface so they can gain regular
access again. I did send these emails to their public and their secret
address *and* to their secret email that was in effect on May 01, 2009
(if there was a difference).

Let's keep the eyes wide open.

Best,
