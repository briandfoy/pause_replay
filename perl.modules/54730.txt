     why:

    I plan to contribute the following module to CPAN:
    Compress::BytePack This is a module I developed for in house use in
    my company. It packs 4 characters into 3 bytes. It is only useful in
    very specific situation, where the message to be compress is very
    short (typically less then 30 bytes per message) but the traffic
    volume is high so any slight guaranteed byte saving is worth the
    work. In such situation the usually effective compression such as
    zlib, gzip, bzip2 are not suitable since the statistical occurance
    of each characters are too low. Finally, it has its constraint of
    using only a small subset of printable ASCII characters.
