When I install XML::Stream-1.19, CPAN wants me to install
XML::Stream-1.18 to restore XML::Stream::Namespace, but that of
course means that on the next round, I need to install XML::Stream
to update it back to 1.19!

You need to delete all prior versions of XML::Stream from the CPAN,
or release a new version of XML::Stream that includes a version
of XML::Stream::Namespace.

Thanks.
