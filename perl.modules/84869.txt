The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Smart
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Easy & Powerful way to access or create XML
  userid:      TMHARISH (Harish T Madabushi)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    PerlMonks, GitHub ( https://github.com/harishmadabushi/XML-Smart )

  similar:
    XML::Simple, XML::Reader, XML::Generator

  rationale:

    XML::Smart is based on a HASH tree created from the XML data, and
    enables dynamic access to it through the standard Perl syntax for
    Hash and Array, without necessarily caring about which you are
    working with. In other words, each point in the tree works as a Hash
    and an Array at the same time!

    This module additionally provides special resources such as: search
    for nodes by attribute, select an attribute value in each multiple
    node, change the returned format, and so on.

    The module also automatically handles binary data
    (encoding/decoding to/from base64), CDATA (like contents with
    <tags>) and Unicode. It can be used to create XML files, load XML
    from the Web ( just by using an URL as the file path ) and has an
    easy way to send XML data through sockets - just adding the length
    of the data in the <?xml?> header.

    This module is authored by: Graciliano Monteiro Passos, The
    namespace can be registered to him or if him not being active for a
    long time is a problem, to me.
