Greetings:

I was wondering if I could get a yea/nay from you guys on the
Object::BaseClass submission.  I'd like to port my Curses::* modules to start
using it, and I need to know if I need to include in under my Curses::*
namespace, or if it will be accepted in the the Object::* namespace.  Nothing
has been uploaded to CPAN, of course, until you tell me where I can put it.

Your diligence is appreciated.
