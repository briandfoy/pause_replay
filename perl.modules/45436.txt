The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::PatternMatching
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Pattern Matching for Perl subs
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    none that I know of

  rationale:

    This module implements what's generally called "pattern matching"
    in functional languages. Of course, this is rather unrelated to
    regular expressions which most Perl programmers probably associate
    with pattern matching.

    The Sub:: hierarchy was chosen because this module acts on
    subroutines. (After all, this comes from the functional
    languages...)

    The "Development Support" module list chapter was chosen because
    that's where most Sub::* modules are listed right now. :)

The resulting entry would be:

Sub::
::PatternMatching idpfp Pattern Matching for Perl subs               SMUELLER
