     why:

    module-proposal: I have a module named FORMIT.pm which generates
    HTML form widgets in a neatly formatted table with minimal user
    effort. I have found it to be very useful. I know that there is
    FormBuilder and similar modules, but sometimes you just want
    something that is simple and does just what you need, no more and no
    less. I am also working on a module to handle persistance of form
    data by passing a DBI MySQL database handle and a CGI object.

    Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

    Sincerely,

    Mark Leeds
