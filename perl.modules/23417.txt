     why:

    We (zincev is an alias for a group of people directly involved in
    the development of Tk::Zinc) will deliver Tk::Zinc, an extension of
    the Tk::Canvas:

    Zinc (alsa called TkZinc), like the Tk::Canvas, implements items
    used to display graphical entities. Those items can be manipulated
    and bindings can be associated with them to implement interaction
    behaviors. But unlike the canvas, Zinc can structure the items in a
    hierarchy, has support for scaling and rotation, clipping can be set
    for sub-trees of the item hierarchy. It also provides functions from
    openGL, such as color gradient and transparencies. The item set is
    quite more powerful and includes field specific items for
    prototyping Air Traffic systems Graphic User Interfaces.
