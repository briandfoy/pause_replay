     why:

    Hi, At work I've been writing a toolkit for doing some testing on
    the servers we have (by doing the testing by group of servers or by
    separated servers).

    This toolkit basically uses Test::Class and Test::More for checking
    that the servers are working properly:

    * Some classes for checking the DNS * Others for checking the
    servers are reachable. * For validating configuration.

    All the testing of this is done by separated Perl test classes
    (inherited from Test::Class) where each test class focuses on
    something in special, ie:

    * t/Ping.pm -> Has all the tests that involve using ping * t/DNS.pm
    -> For checking the nodes are resolving correctly or validating
    zones.

    For loading the test classes it uses Test::Class::Load to find them
    in a directory the user provides, otherwise . or ./t is used.

    Additionally this test toolkit returns the results for each test
    and each server in different formats (console, cpan, json, etc) with
    the use of Class::Factory. It also provides some statistics about
    the tests.

    Also there will be other CPAN modules I'll happily like to
    contribute like Getopt::Awesome, similar to Getopt::Modular but
    lighter and keeps the "get opts" of each module separated from
    others and also the user can set the option "foo" of module Foo::Bar
    as --foo-bar-foo and Foo::Bar will be the only module able to
    get/set its value.

    Thanks!
