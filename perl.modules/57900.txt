The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::Korean
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Encodings of Korean Language
  userid:      YOU (YOU Hyun Jo)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    Not yet but will be mailinglist or/and wiki

  similar:
    Encode::Arabic Encode::KO::Romanize::Hangul Encode::KRka

  rationale:

    The namespace Encode::Korean is choosen because it can be called a
    Korean version of Encode::Arabic.

    There will be provided various non-canonical encodings -- meaning
    not a local two-byte encoding nor unicode. The first result is a set
    of encodings based on transliteration method, which can be used when
    one can't type Korean directly, or only ascii codes are allowed, or
    for academic purpose, or for writing cgi, or for writing email in
    transliteration, or for preprocessing TeX source, or for builing
    linguistic data, etc.

    These encodings of Korean in general can not be placed under
    Encode::KR, since KR represents South Korea (ROK). Please, notice
    that Korean scripts are included in local encodings of South and
    North Korea, and even one of China.

    Encode::KO might be a good choice but I prefer Encode::Korean not
    because the latter is easier to recognize, but because my plan is to
    provide non-canonical encodings. It's better to leave Encode::KO for
    canonical ones (who knows if two Koreas will agree on a kind of
    unified encodings?)

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::
::Korean          adpfp Encodings of Korean Language                 YOU
