The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pastel
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Everything of Scalable Vector Graphics
  userid:      MALAY (Malay Kumar Basu)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Pastel has an unique character. It is not only about Scalable
    Vector Graphics but about graphics in general. It has sophisticated
    support for computational geometry and animation and API closely
    follows Java Graphics2D API. In future it will also support PDF
    generation.

    There are several modules in the package and it is imperative that
    I "use Pastel".

The resulting entry would be:

Pastel            adpOp Everything of Scalable Vector Graphics       MALAY
