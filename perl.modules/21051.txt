I already have an account on CPAN (CCLOUTIER)...

Thanks,

Hi Christian,
a few hours ago I got an email from Andreas Koenig - the CPAN master.
He proposes that you get your own CPAN account and after that
we transfer the namespace that is currently registered on my name
to you.
I will probably meet Andreas for a beer in Berlin.
I let you know how we proceed as soon as I have more info.
Best regards,
Martin
