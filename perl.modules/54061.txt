Subject: Module submission Finance::QuoteOptions

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::QuoteOptions
  DSLIP:       idpOg
  description: Retrieve Options Prices and Symbols
  userid:      KBOCEK (Kirk Bocek)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::Quote

  rationale:

    There doesn't seem to be any module that will retrieve all current
    options for a single equity. I considered using the
    Finance::Quote::Options name space but Finance::Quote seems to used
    that sub-space for the various data sources they use.

    This will be a 'screen-scraper' that will initially use either
    Yahoo Finance or the CBOE site. The CBOE code will use the http
    quoting tool pages instead of the restricted file-download pages.

  enteredon:   Thu Apr 19 19:34:55 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::
::QuoteOptions    idpOg Retrieve Options Prices and Symbols          KBOCEK
