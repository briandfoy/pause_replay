Well, no, Petal processes exclusively XML or HTML... So being under
Text:: does not seem appropriate. Being under XML: might actually be
better, given the fact that it's what Petal has been developed for.


> You could also use Template::Petal (or Template::PerlTAL).

Template::Petal would do... Although I really don't like being under
'Template' which is used by the template toolkit. I think it leads to
confusion, people might think that Petal is meant to work with the
template toolkit.

I agree, but TT effectively *does* occupy the Template:: namespace,
which as you say is very generic... Mind you, CGI::Carp and CGI::Cookie
are both under CGI I suppose...

What do you think?
Would XML::Template eventually be an option?
