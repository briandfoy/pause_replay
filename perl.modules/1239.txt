  I would like to update that information with:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
urlparse       Rdpf  RFC 2396 dictated URL parseing code          HALLECK
paths          Rdpf  RFC 2396 relative and absolute paths code    HALLECK
urls           Rdpf  RFC 2396 relative and absolute URLS code     HALLECK
