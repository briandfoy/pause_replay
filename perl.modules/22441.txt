The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Gopher
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: The Perl Gopher/Gopher+ client API
  userid:      WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Net::FTP, Net::SMTP, etc. LWP and HTTP::Response.

  rationale:

    I never got a "yes" or a "no" on my original submission.

    Do I need to upload something first? If that's the case, here:
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Gopher

    As you can see, Net::Gopher is a Gopher/Gopher+ client API for
    Perl.

    Net::Gopher is really two modules: Net::Gopher and
    Net::Gopher::Response.

    The first module, Net::Gopher, is the class used for requesting
    items from Gopher and Gopher+ severs. It supports two models of
    communication: a connect(), request(), and disconnect() sequence, or
    the URL based request_url() which connects, requests, and
    disconnects for you using the URL you supply.

    The second module, Net::Gopher::Response, is a class for
    manipulating Gopher and Gopher+ responses. It has methods to
    determine the success or failure of a request, to parse Gopher
    menus, to parse Gopher+ attribute information blocks, to retrieve
    the status line and status of a Gopher+ request, and much more.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Gopher          adpOg The Perl Gopher/Gopher+ client API           WGDAVIS
