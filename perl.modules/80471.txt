Subject: Module submission DMTF::CIM

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DMTF::CIM
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to the DMTF's CIM model
  userid:      SHURD (Stephen James Hurd)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    There are very few APIs in any language to support the DMTF
    standards - and even fewer to support the ones based on the CIM
    model. There are a large number of these standards, and tying them
    all together in one API makes a lot of sense.

    There has been interested expressed by some large companies on a
    simple way for administrators of UNIX and Linux systems to be able
    to script CIM operations over CIM-XML, WS-Management, an JSON and
    this module (and others in the DMTF:: namespace) provide an answer
    to that request.

    Further, this module was written to enable our QA guys to test our
    product, so permitting them to install it readily via CPAN is of
    value to me.

  enteredby:   SHURD (Stephen James Hurd)
  enteredon:   Fri May  4 21:46:03 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DMTF::
::CIM             RdpOp Interface to the DMTF's CIM model            SHURD
