That isn't necesarily so, as modules tied to particular brands are 
relatively common.

If the module only involves the communications API, use WWW:: for 
web-scraping implementations, or Net:: for more direct XML-RPC or soap'y 
implementations.

If you adding significant client-side functionality beyond just using 
the APIs, then we'd certainly consider a top-level namespace. Especially 
if this will involve multiple distributions building on each other.

But yeah, if it's just the communications stuff, stick to (what I'd 
imagine is probably) Net::Salesforce
