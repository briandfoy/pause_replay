Dear Yanick, dear Stephanie,

I've given Yanick co-maintenance permissions for the NetPacket::*
namespaces.

Stephanie, I gather from the quoted mail exchange that you agree to
this. If that's not the case, please note that this is not an
irreversible action. Just let us know.

Best regards,
Steffen, for the PAUSE admins
