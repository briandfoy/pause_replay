    Earthquake Early Warning(Japan) The Earthquake Early Warning (EEW)
    (ç·æ¥å°ééå ± ,Kinkyu- Jishin Sokuho-) is a warning which is
    issued just after an earthquake in Japan is detected. The warnings
    are issued mainly by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). JMA has two
    EEW schemes. One is for advanced users. The other is for the general
    public, which is mainly mentioned in detail in this article.
    Earthquake::EEW::Decoder supported 2 schemes.
