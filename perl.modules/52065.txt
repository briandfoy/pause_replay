If it means Getting the module fixed, sure I'll take over it.   :-)

what's the next step? I can take a guess, but I'm not sure:

1) register as an author (PAUSE ID) (been meaning to do this for 5 =
years!)
2) repackage with new version/maintainer details
3) upload through PAUSE (which I just read about)

Do I use the same namespace and just change the version no?
Is there anything else I need to do?

Thanks,
Buzz.
