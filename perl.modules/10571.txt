The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GFL::Image
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: high-level OO Wrapper for GFL
  userid:      GGARAND (Germain Garand)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    GD Image::Magick

  rationale:

    GFL is the name of the cross-platform C library for which this
    module is an Object Oriented wrapper - it stands for Graphic File
    Library - see www.xnview.org

    It is similar to GD, but with a stress put on the very high number
    of exotic graphic formats supported (more than 300).

    Thus this proposal to adopt the same naming scheme than GD :

    GFL -> low-level wrapper

    GFL::Image -> high-level Object Oriented wrapper which inherits the
    above.

    This structure seems the most relevant as it is coherent with the
    inheritance scheme. Moreover, it seems unlikely that a three letters
    capitalized acronym like this one could clash with future root names
    as there are 26^3 = 17576 other 3 letters combinations. At last, GFL
    is actively developped since 2 years and is likely to gain a large
    fame as a "swiss-knife" for image importation.

The resulting entry would be:

GFL::
::Image           adpOp high-level OO Wrapper for GFL                GGARAND
