The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Pot
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Schmidt's test of force-like runs
  userid:      RGARTON (rgarton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Pot statistic measures the bunching relative to the spacing of
    a single event within a series of other events, conceived as a
    targeted "potential" energy (or Pot) that dissipates exponentially
    between events. It's not limited to considering only clusters of
    consecutive events (or bunches), as is the case with the more
    familiar Runs test. Say you're interested in the occurrence of 3
    within an array of digits: a cluster of 3, 4, 3, 7, or 3, 8, 1, 3,
    is, with the Pot-test, of exponentially declining interest, with
    respect to the occurrence of 3, as is a cluster of four 3s, without
    any breaks by other digits. That is, the statistic accounts for
    increased spacing between target-events as an exponentially
    declining force that reaches its asymptote across a specified range.
    Running the Pot-test involves a z-test for significance.

The resulting entry would be:
