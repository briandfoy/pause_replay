That'll happen depending on what version of Parse::YAPP happens to be
installed on my build system; that's a generated .pm file and I don't
set the version manually.  I must have different versions of Parse::YAPP
on two machines I do maintenance to X::F::D on.

There is no $XML::Filter::Dispatcher::VERSION.  Whatever script is
giving you grief must be scanning the file line by line and missing the
fact that the $VERSION string it's finding is in a different package and
does not refer to the file as a whole.

Thanks for pointing it out, I'll upgrade Parse::YAPP and rerelease
X::F::D at some point, probably not immediately.  I'm not even sure
it's a problem I need worry about, what issues is it causing?
