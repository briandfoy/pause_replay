The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Tournament::Swiss
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: FIDE Swiss Same-Rank Contestant Pairing
  userid:      DRBEAN (Dr Bean)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.chesschat.org/forumdisplay.php?f=57

  similar:
    Algorithm::Pair::Swiss

  rationale:

    My set of modules is a lot more heavyweight than
    Algorithm::Pair::Swiss. With the scripts, you can take scores and
    generate pairings for the next round from them. This means it is an
    application, I guess.

    Probably the main users would be chess tournament directors, but my
    purpose in developing it was not to make it just for chess. It will
    handle any kind of tournament where partners of the same rank are
    paired and the strictness of the FIDE algorithm is desired.

    My plans are to extend some of the functionality of the base
    classes in the distribution with different kinds of algorithm than
    the swiss one, or different swiss ones than the FIDE one it
    presently has. I am not mainly interested in chess tournaments.
    Implementing the FIDE algorithm represented a challenge, I guess.

    I'm using it in an educational setting, so I have to make the
    algorithm accountable.

    This present name, Games::Tournament::Swiss fits in with the space
    of tournament genres created by my earlier module,
    Games::Tournament::RoundRobin

    Another perl reference point is John Chew's script, tsh, which has
    similar, more extensive functionality, but did not use any modules
    as of version 2.960.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Tournament::
