Great! Welcome!

I would say the third is the clearest. At least, I only got it when I 
read that Hamiltonicity is related to a Hamiltonian circle. To me 
defense, my CS course was long ago. I'd be fine with any of them though.

I suppose inheritance would be fine here.

Yes, that's slightly ambitious. :)

I fear that there is little you can do here except only collaborating 
with whom you trust. CPAN is intended for freely usable code. 
Preferably, the code should be licensed under the same license as perl 
itself (Artistic+GPL), but that's not enforced in any way. So once you 
upload to CPAN under a free license, you can't stop anybody from using 
it to claim the prize. But an implementation will not get you that 
anyway, you'll need an algorithm which runs in polynomial time.

Best regards,
Steffen
