Sounds good to me.  Somehow I completely overlooked the DBIx category. Wow,
that's so much better.  When I first started work on it I named it Shashou
("abstraction" in Japanese), when it came time to give it a real name I
couldn't find a place in the tree that I was happy with.  The DBI tree was
clearly wrong, but the SQL tree wasn't much better...
