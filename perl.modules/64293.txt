Apache2::Pod has had no progress in two years and has had a
critical bug for a year and a half:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=31102

The maintainer does not respond to e-mails and has
apparently abandoned the package.  I'd like to take it over,
upload the incredibly easy 3-line fix for the bug and add
features because it's useful for a project I'm working on.

Thanks for the consideration.  I am CPAN: MARKLE.

Mark
