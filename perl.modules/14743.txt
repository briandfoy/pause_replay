On 18dec2001 I registered the Crypt::Tea  namespace.
On 14jan2002 I registered the Term::Clui  namespace.
On  6mar2002 I registered the CGI::Htauth namespace.
On 19oct2002 I registered the Math::Evol  namespace.

But, then and forever, from "Edit Module Metadata":
> Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to PJB.
> Please note, only modules that are already registered in
> the module list can be edited here. If you believe, this
> is a bug, please contact modules@perl.org.

On 23jan2002, on 20may2002, on 4jul2002, on 12jul2002, on 28aug2002,
I wrote about the "Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging
to PJB" message I was getting when I tried to "Edit Module Metadata".
There should be CGI::Htauth, Term::Clui, Crypt::Tea and Math::Evol.
There has been no reply.  I have also been in communication with
cpan-testers@perl.org, randy@theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca, gp@familiehaase.de
and with andreas.koenig@anima.de on the subject.

I am able to upload new versions and delete old ones, and receive
the usual confirmatory emails. The modules still appear in
$CPAN/authors/id/P/PJ/PJB so I'm still working on them and they
have been through several significant revisions; but obviously I
am beginning to get the impression that CPAN simply doesn't work.
Perhaps there is a programming bug, perhaps there is a social
engineering bug, I don't know which.  Can it be revived ?
Is there anything I can do to help ?

I particularly want to suggest that whenever a plea for namespace
registration is rejected, the supplicant should be informed of the
reason for the refusal, rather than just ingored.

I don't actually expect this email to be attended to, but I do hope
that it will be found  by some future net historian trawling through
archives trying to understand the history of CPAN and Perl.
