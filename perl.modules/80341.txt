This still sounds to me like there's something fundamental that might be able
to do this more easily. Maybe we can move this to the qa@perl.org list and
let the testing people have a crack at it. I'm still having a tough time seeing
what the problem is and an even tougher time understanding the solution.

I didn't write it. I just patched it. :)
