Request to register new user

fullname: Kazumasa Utashiro
  userid: UTASHIRO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: https://github.com/kaz-utashiro
     why:

    I've been developing perl programs for many years, and actually
    somebody registered my scripts to CPAN, but I didn't have a chance
    to get involved by myself. I have several staffs which may
    contribute to the community.
