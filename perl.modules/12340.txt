Seems like that is a top level domain request.

It would be nice, 
if there would be a description, what algorithms shall be processed.
What subdomains are planned ?
...
How they differ on the other Image modules ?
Experiences on using (IPA is a mnemonic description - so it must wildly known,
or nobody understands). 
Please don't flame me - I'm not an computer vision expert, if it's already :-)
Belonging to the description,
Image::ProcessAlgorithms, Prima::Algorithms, 
Algorithms::Images, Algorithm::Img::Processing, Algorithm::Img::Proc
could be sensful, too :-)

I looked to the web address, so I believe it's a well thought module.
However, a short explanation, what its advantages and disadvantages are,
would be nice, too.

Greetings,
Janek
