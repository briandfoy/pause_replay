Subject: No "spool queue" module?

I can't seem to be able to find a "spool queue" module, to handle
things like a spooling directory to list to-be-printed files, or
a "job queue" to list job data along with control info (ala sendmail
queue).

The closest seems to be Server::FileQueue::DirQueue but that's not
released yet.

Since I do need this functionality, I propose to open the following
namespace:

	Spool::Queue

which will heberge things like:

	Spool::Queue::File		A file queue
	Spool::Queue::Jobs		A jobs queue (data + ctrl)

I don't know the exact interface those will have yet. I have to think
about it for a while.
