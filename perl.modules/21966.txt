Recently I've been receiving emails from people who are trying to
install "mon" (http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/), which requires
Patrick Ryan's Time::Period module to operate. It turns out that Dave
Cross has a completely different Time::Period module in CPAN, which
obviously conflicts with the namespace of Patrick's module, and is
causing confusion and hassle. Here are the two modules:

http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Time::Period

How do we get this resolved? Since Dave's module is newer than Patrick's,
I believe it should be renamed and older copies which use the Time::Period
namespace should be removed from CPAN so as to not further propagate
the conflict.
