Request to register new user

fullname: Kevin Semande
  userid: KLYNC
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.26a.net
     why:

    I am preparing a module to submit to CPAN, as it may be of use to
    others. Module can currently be found here:

    https://secure.26a.net/svn/projects-kevin/perl/modules/Klync/Children.pm

    I am looking for any feedback or advice to make this module more
    useful. I'm currently reading through the docs to make the module
    CPAN-friendly, and I'll need to create a Makefile before submitting
    it. I do a fair amount of Perl coding, so I may have other
    contributions in the future.

    (Note: I've previously made contributions to SVN::SVNLook)
