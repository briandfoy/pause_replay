     why:

    We wrote and validated a script that allows you to automatically
    obtain the bibliographic record for an arbitrary scientific paper
    available in full-text from the PubMed database (de facto
    comprehensive database for the Life Sciences). Saving the user from
    having to type in author, title, journal, etc all the time, this
    script can be quite an asset for any bibliographic software, which
    is why we would like to make it publically available via CPAN.
