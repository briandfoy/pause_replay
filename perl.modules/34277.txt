The "_x" (or just "x") isn't very descriptive. It 'works' for DBIx
only in the sense of being a bucket for the many many modules of varying
quality people would otherwise want to put in DBI::*

My preference would be for DBM::Utility::<foo> for utility modules that
work for multiple types of DBM.

For utility modules that only work for one type of DBM then
<dbm_mod_name>::<foo> seems better: thus DB_File::<foo>.
