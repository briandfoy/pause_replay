The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Content::ContentExtractor
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl module for extracting content from HTML
  userid:      JTAVERNI (Jean Tavernier)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Corpora-List

  similar:
    Text::Identify::BoilerPlate

  rationale:

    HTML::Content::ContentExtractor because we are interested in
    extracting content from HTML. This involves trying to determine
    which text is boilerplate (menus, ads, headlines) and which of of
    the text is actually novel to the webpage. The approach taken in my
    module finds the best ratio of text to tags, using one of a number
    of different ratios. This approach has been discussed on
    Corpora-List (natural language processing community) but to my
    knowledge, this is the first perl module that has been made
    available with this type of implementation.
