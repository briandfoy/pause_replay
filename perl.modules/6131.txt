The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Repl
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: file/dir structure replication
  userid:      DROBERTS (Dave Roberts)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    unsure - advice on mailing list to suggest ?

  similar:
    File::Backup Dir::Purge

  rationale:

    File::Repl provides a replication utility between file structures.
    Whilst File::Backup creates an alternative directory/file structure
    (which File::Repl can be used to do) File::Repl is potentially
    bi-directional, has delete file matching (regex) and age mechanisms
    that achieve a significant degree of control on the actions.

    Dir::Purge presumeably purges a directory tree - a function built
    into File::Repl through the Delete method. Again the same comments
    apply as above.

    I've struggled with the naming of the module. First I think it
    should either be File:: or Dir:: - and given most of the actions are
    on files I've chosen File::

    Replication is the primary function of the module - but it does
    have other methods than "Update" - which is the call to replicate.
    These are not strictly replication methods - more file maintenance
    calls (subject to the regex/age criteria mentioned above). Perhaps
    File::Maint would be a better name ??

    You can find a copy of the latest module release at
    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-authors/id/D/DR/DROBERTS/
    . This has pod/html documentation for the module.

    Version 1.3.3.0 was uploaded to pause on June 14th - so should be
    in my author directory soon.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Repl            RdpOp file/dir structure replication               DROBERTS
