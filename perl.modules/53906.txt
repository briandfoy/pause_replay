I was thinking maybe Pavatar moves on to use other protocols in the 
future which aren't HTML, such as YADIS (or RDF or other). But it 
doesn't make a big difference to me, the module will still be searchable 
by Pavatar and will work as expected, so virtually any name is good for 
me. But users might find it less confusing to use Net::Pavatar, 
especially in the future.

The module is ready by the way. So, which namespace do you think I 
should use?
