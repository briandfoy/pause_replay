Hello Darren Duncan, in a previous mail you wrote:

Not just months, there are pending registrations which are almost
TWO YEARS old by now.

Or does still anyone read the modules@perl.org archive at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/
at all?! I see that the archive is full of spam and virus mails.
Maybe the list has been silently given up altogether?

> I think that there are quite a few people now who are wanting to know.

I second this. :-)

Or is PAUSE now simply conceding namespace based on "first come,
first serve" (as the automatic mails from PAUSE after an upload
seem to indicate)?

But these modules do not show up on "The Perl 5 Module List"
(http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/00modlist.long.html).
Or has this list been given up in favour of newer/better
solutions? E.g. search.cpan.org or the like?

Many thanks in advance for any enlightenment!
