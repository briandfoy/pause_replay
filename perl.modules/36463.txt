Hrmm, maybe that term isn't as popular as I thought, but we've  been 
using it since the days of BoardWatch and BBS Con, and most sysadmins 
I've bumped into had a passing familiarity with it.

Alas, a toaster is an appliance. A device you plug in that does it's 
one thing and does it very well. File toasters, or later filer's as 
they're now called like the NetApp are the original bearers of the 
term. You just plug them in and voila, they do their thing.

The Mail::Toaster project makes it almost brain dead easy for a 
sysadmin who would otherwise be stuck with something icky like Exchange 
to get a full featured high performance mail system up and running, 
using entirely free open source software.
