  [I just posted this to comp.lang.perl.modules, but am now thinking
  that this mailing list would be more appropriate. Also, one option
  that I didn't iterate below was to leave things as they are, namely,
  package Net::Datafusion::Foo::Bar. I'd appreciate hearing your
  views.]

  How do folks typically name their company's modules? Do you use a
  flat namespace such as CPAN or prepend an identifier for your
  company?

  In our software hierarchy, we have dogs (Java), cats (C & C++) and
  other small furry mammals (Perl) all happily living together. In the
  beginning, we used the Java module naming conventions for our
  modules by prepending our domain name reversed to the beginning.
  This prevented namespace collisions in the world. For example, we
  might have had Net::Datafusion::Foo::Bar.

  But all is not well on Noah's Ark. If our users install our software
  in a standard place, the name above will collide nastily with the
  Net package [or will it?]. So, what to do?

  We see a couple of possible solutions and seek your advice:

  1. Declare packages with "package Datafusion::Foo::Bar".

  2. Declare packages with "package Foo::Bar" and either use existing
  namespaces for Foo or pray that someone else won't use it.

  3. Sell the house and computer and sail around the world.
