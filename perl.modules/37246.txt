The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WordNet::SenseRelate
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Word Sense Disambiguation with WordNet
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    wn-similarity@yahoogroups.com

  rationale:

    This module will allow a user to assign senses (meanings) to words
    in an English language text. The text may be plain text, or it may
    be part of speech of tagged with the Brill Tagger. This is an
    important foundation for automated natural language understanding,
    since it is hard to understand what a sentence or document means
    without knowing what the individual words mean.

    The module uses the WordNet::Similarity module, which computes the
    semantic relatedness between concepts (based on information found in
    WordNet). Our disambiguation algorithm assigns the sense to a word
    that is most related to the senses of its neighbors (based on the
    WordNet::Similarity computations).

    The module is also dependent on WordNet::QueryData, which is used
    to access WordNet, which is a free lexical database distributed by
    Princeton University.

    The name WordNet::SenseRelate makes the relationship to WordNet and
    the other WordNet:: modules clear. Disambiguation is based on
    finding the most related sense, hence SenseRelate.

The resulting entry would be:

WordNet::
