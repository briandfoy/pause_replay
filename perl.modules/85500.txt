The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Anansi::ObjectManager
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A module object encapsulation manager.
  userid:      ANANSI (Kevin Treleaven)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is the first of many modules that I have been working on. I
    need this one in place before the others can be implemented as this
    is a core part of the system. Anansi is a spider god, hence it's use
    in a web module system. The module used to be called "Kith" but I
    felt that "ObjectManager" would be better understood and more valid
    in it's generic use. The system will be used as a foundation for
    module development, interaction and implementation via web and shell
    interfaces. Can't really state more than that prior to their
    inclusion. So, on to the next I go. :)

The resulting entry would be:

Anansi::
::ObjectManager   adpOp A module object encapsulation manager.       ANANSI
