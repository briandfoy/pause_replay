Yes.  You have shown you have no desire whatsoever to cooperate, to follow
the advice of the people running the CPAN, and to be a reasonable person.
So I guess we are done.  And I want to thank you: if anyone ever argues
that the keepers of the CPAN should exercise power to enforce name problems
on the CPAN, you will be the primary evidence of why this power is needed.
It had always been the hope that the members of the Perl community would be
reasonable in such issues, but it is clear that this won't always be the
case.
