Subject: Module submission Locale::Script

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::Script
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: standard script codes (such as ISO 15924)
  userid:      SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Locale::Country, Locale::Currency, Locale::Language

  rationale:

    The Locale-Codes distribution consists of 5 modules:

    Locale::Country Locale::Currency Locale::Language Locale::Script
    Locale::Constants

    The last one is not called directly, and is strictly a support
    module for the others (and I plan on moving it to
    Locale::Codes::Constants), but Locale::Script provides the same
    functionality as the Country, Currency, and Language modules (just
    with a different set of codes).

    The first three are registered already. I want Script to be
    registered so it's consistent with the others.

  enteredby:   SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb 12 11:47:40 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Locale::
::Script          Rdpfp standard script codes (such as ISO 15924)    SBECK
