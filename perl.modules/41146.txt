Subject: Module submission SNC::Manipulator

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SNC::Manipulator
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: An interface to Sony SNC-RZ30N web cameras.
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    modules@cpan.org

  similar:
    none that I know of.

  rationale:

    This is the second module I wish to post to CPAN, an interface to
    the networked cameras detailed above.

    Currently there is no open source software that deals with these
    cameras.

    My approach is unique because there is nothing about SNC on CPAN.

    It seems that this module should create a root namespace because of
    the groundbreaking nature of it; As there is nothing like this that
    I have seen in CPAN so far.

    However, I am thinking that this module may not need a top level
    namespace, if there are camera::, webcam::, or sony:: namespaces,
    and it is thought that it should go there instead.

    As with my previous proposition, thoughts from more experienced
    CPAN posters are always welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

SNC::
::Manipulator     bdpOp An interface to Sony SNC-RZ30N web cameras.  CMORRIS
