I'm not an admin, but a lurker here. But I feel I must throw in my two 
cents about this name:

The perl part is implied by the fact that it is on CPAN. Can it just be 
'ChartDirector'? I'd rather see it not in the root (like 
Graphics::ChartDirector), but I'm more concerned about the actual name.

Cheers! (and apologies if I shouldn't be commenting)
