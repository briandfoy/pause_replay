Subject: Module submission DateTimeX::Tie::Hash
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTimeX::Tie::Hash
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Lookup by exact date or nearest before/after
  userid:      METAL (Seth L. Blumberg)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org

  similar:
    DateTime

  rationale:

    I have not found any existing modules on CPAN for handling opaque,
    aperiodic time-series data; Data::TimeSeries comes closest, but is
    highly specialized (strictly periodic samples of numeric data with
    functions for trend-line analysis, etc.) and not useful for my
    projects.

    DROLSKY suggested on the datetime@perl.org mailing list
    (http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.datetime/2007/11/msg6849.html)
    that new modules which are intended to complement the main DateTime
    distribution, but don't quite fit there, should go in a new
    root-level namespace DateTimeX::*, analogous to DBI/DBIx, etc.

    This module provides functionality dependent on, but not
    contributing to, DateTime's timekeeping facilities, so DateTime::*
    would not be appropriate. It uses a tied-hash interface (with
    additional object-oriented API for functions that do not fit the
    hash paradigm), so the logical options are Tie::Hash::DateTime or
    DateTimeX::Tie::Hash. Since the module works only with DateTime (as
    opposed to any of the other date/time classes), it seems to me to be
    appropriate to emphasize the DateTime-ness of it more than the
    tied-hash-ness.

    DateTimeX::Tie::Hash is related to the main DateTime distribution
    in that any DateTime-compatible object (i.e., any object
    implementing utc_rd_values with the same semantics as DateTime
    itself) can be used as a hash key.

  enteredby:   METAL (Seth L. Blumberg)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov 20 01:25:52 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DateTimeX::Tie::
::Hash            cdphp Lookup by exact date or nearest before/after METAL
