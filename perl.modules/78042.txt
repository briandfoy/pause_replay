Please don't misunderstand.  Of course in general, CPAN has saved me
lots of time as there is lots of fully functional, working, quality code
on there.  I have no beef with quality in general of the code in CPAN,
but as always, I have found this exception.

That's fair enough I suppose.  Instead perhaps some kind of quality
rating up front would be useful.  I do see in a search result (i.e.
http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=3Dall&query=3Dbounce) the module in
question only has one star out of four, but that information right on
the main page for the module would be useful.

In typical Perl fashion, I'm afraid the code is too obfuscated for me to
maintain, assuming I had the time.

Looks like there are also 12 bugs in RT (which I just found, FWIW) that
have gone unanswered for as long as 3 years ago.  I wish I'd have found
this information the first time around.

Indeed, as I mentioned above, I just found this RT.  But from the array
of issues that are already open and unanswered, I would likely just be
wasting more time filing a ticket.

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, I've e-mailed him a couple of
times and gotten about as much response (which is none) as the 12
(still) "new" tickets over the last 3 years.

I guess I will just drop this (issue, and the use of this module) and
move on.
