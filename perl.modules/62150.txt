I (and several other people evidently) have found fixes to several problems in the latest version of net::mySQL.  I tried to contact the author using two email addresses I found (one on CPAN and another via web searches).  I haven't heard a reply.  I'd be glad to send my fixes to the author and even help apply them.  I'll even volunteer to look at other reported bugs and fix them.  In short, I'll do anything I can to minimize the time required of the author to update the module.

Is there any way you can contact the author?

Thanks in advance.

Ken Fairchild
