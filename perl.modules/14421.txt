The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PIKT::UI
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: User interface classes for gPIKT, a PIKT GUI
  userid:      LEUCOS (Michel Blanc)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    pikt-users@gsblistmail.uchicago.edu

  similar:
    none known, certainly none

  rationale:

    PIKT (http://pikt.org) is a widely used systems management
    application, that has been ported to wide variety of unix systems.
    This last year, several PIKT modules have been written that covers
    many aspects. PIKT::UI is one of them, and as it names suggests, it
    implements a User Interface. Among others, PIKT::Config is an
    interface to pikt configuration system, PIKT::Random contains and
    interface to several PRNGs used in pikt. As pikt will integrate
    direct perl support in its future versions, other modules will come
    as well (PIKT::History for instance). This is why a rootlevel
    namespace seems reasonable in this perspective.

The resulting entry would be:

PIKT::
