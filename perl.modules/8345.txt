OK, there are two issues here.  The first is just getting you a PAUSE
ID, and the main issue is probably that you requested an ID for a
group/company, and PAUSE IDs are usually meant to be for individuals,
not groups.  This is a policy decision, and someone with more experience
will have to answer than me will have to deal with this.  Andreas?

The second is the naming of your module.  The quick answer is, we don't
like people opening up new toplevel namespaces unless it's for something
that's recognised as a biggish category of well known stuff, and/or
something which has no place else to go.  We also aren't too keen on
cryptic acronyms at the top level.  Whether "P3P" is cryptic or not, I
don't know.  It's a W3C standards-track-thingy, but that doesn't
necessarily mean much.

So.  You suggested XML::P3P, which I'd be OK with, except that we're
unsure whether XML::* is the right place to put implementations of
specific XML schemas.  I think we're leaning in the "no" direction...
XML::* should probably be for generic XML modules.

I'd tend towards something in the WWW::* hierarchy, I think.  How do you
feel about that?
