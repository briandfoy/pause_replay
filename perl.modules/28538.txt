The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::GPG
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Handling of GnuPG encrypted / signed mails
  userid:      JRED (Jörn Reder)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Mail::GnuPG

  rationale:

    The main difference between Mail::GnuPG and Mail::GPG is the API,
    which is stricly OO in Mail::GPG. E.g. Mail::GnuPG modified user
    supplied data instead of returning modified data (here
    encrypted/signed MIME::Entity objects), which is bad in many
    situations. I submitted patches to Mail::GnuPG which added features
    or fixed bugs, but always disliked its API. Mainly both modules do
    the same work, but Mail::GPG has more features (in the meantime) and
    the cleaner (maybe a matter of taste; let's say: at least a
    different) interface. So I think it's not too bad for the user
    having the choice between both modules.

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::GPG             RdpOp Handling of GnuPG encrypted / signed mails   JRED
