Thanks, Tim. Brian suggested this top level:

"i think you should break up that top level to make it more
general (and more expandable).  for instance:
  Simulation::Tools
-- 
brian d foy"

There could be other categories, e.g. Interfaces, Wrappers, etc.

Of course, for those wanting to use the SynSim modules stand-alone, 'use
Simulation::Tools::SynSim::Analysis;' is quite long. But in general you'd just
'use Simulation::Tools::SynSim;'
