Input: LaTeX code, usually a one-line formula.
The process:
1) md5_hex hash of the code will be calculated.
    If a file with that hash already exists, its path will be
    returned, if not, the hash will be used for filenames
    hereafter and
2) a .tex file containing LaTeX header, footer and the code
    will be created in the tempdir,
3) the .tex will be converted to a .dvi using latex,
4) the .dvi will be converted to a trimmed picture using
    Image::Magick and saved to the user-specified directory,
    it's path will be returned.

Future versions will let users choose the conversion engine 
(e.g. mimeTeX converts oneliners to GIFs directly, but as it 
has some issues and its install-base is smaller, it will not 
be used as the default).

In case something remained unclear, let me illustrate:

# ------- example.pl ------
use TeX::Picture;

# path - where to store the pictures,
# webpath - relative path to the pics to be used in webpages
# there are a lot of other options, but the defaults are 
more or less sane
my $pic = new TeX::Picture(
                 path => '/var/www/test/pics',
                 webpath => '/pics' );

print '<html><p>According to the following formula
        <img src="'.
       $pic->to_webpic('\[ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = C\]').
       '" />, there exists a sequence such as 
...</p></html>'."\n";
# ------- example.pl ------

$ ./example.pl
<html><p>According to the following formula
        <img 
src="/pics/cc1a92b6d67b94fa759e2f02ca421334.png" />, there 
exists a sequence such as ...</p></html>

TeX::Converter::Picture?

I probably need to subclass it though and this looks rather 
ugly:
TeX::Converter::Picture::ImageMagick
TeX::Converter::Picture::MimeTeX
TeX::Converter::Picture::GhostScript

If you feel the latter doesn't look too ugly I'll use
TeX::Converter::Picture and/or the mentioned subclasses 
instead of TeX::Picture.
