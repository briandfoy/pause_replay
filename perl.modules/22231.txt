The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Separator
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Create horizontal and vertical 3d separators
  userid:      WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This widget can be used to create those 2 pixel-wide 3D lines you
    often see used to separate buttons, labels, and other widgets. I
    originally went looking for a widget with this functionality several
    months ago, however I was unable to find one. Some people on
    c.l.p.tk suggesting mimicking the behavior of separators using two
    frames each only on pixel in thickness. While this (sort of) worked,
    it was somewhat messy and the two light/dark colors used to create
    the 3D effect were unportable.

    After some experimentation I found the system defaults that
    produced the desired effects and created the Tk::Separator widget
    which can be used to easily create both horizontal as well as
    vertical 3D separators.

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::Separator       bdpOg Create horizontal and vertical 3d separators WGDAVIS
