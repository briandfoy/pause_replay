The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CDiso
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: A mkisofs interface wrapper
  userid:      JSNBY (Jason Hancock)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wanted to make .iso disk image by being able to specify which
    files I wanted to include on the disk. I was unable to find a module
    that would provide this functionality....I had to make a list of
    files to exclude from the disk image.

    I wrote this package so that others did not have to write code to
    generate their own exclude lists.

  enteredby:   JSNBY (Jason Hancock)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul 17 00:14:44 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CDiso             bdpOl A mkisofs interface wrapper                  JSNBY
