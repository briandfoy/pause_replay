Subject: Requested PAUSE ID weeks ago

Greetings,

I requested a PAUSE ID (OTTERLEY) weeks ago, but never received a
response.  However, I have examined the mailing list archives, and
other requests have been granted.

Was my request overlooked?  Or denied for some reason?

Best regards,

--MIchael
