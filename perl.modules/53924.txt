And with two trailing zeroes! <duck>

Sorry, John, I see no easy way to provide such a test environment. The
whole code base relies on the fact that it can alter the database. I
could test any distro for you on my mirroring box where it is riskless
to throw the database away and recreate it. Not so on PAUSE as you can
probably imagine. I do remember that this request came up repeatedly
but my imagination how to code this efficiently is quite poor.

Sorry,
