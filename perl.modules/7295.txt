The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Module::MetaInfo
  DSLIP:       cupOp
  description: Extract Meta Information from Perl Modules
  userid:      MIKEDLR (Michael De La Rue)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    mail to Andreas Konig (sent) perl newsgroups (will)

  similar:
    Some work in CPAN modules.

  rationale:

    Meta Information can be used in building nice binary packages (such
    as RPMs) from perl modules. It can be used in advertising perl
    modules in software lists, it can be used in various maintainance
    processes.

    There isn't an official interface for getting meta information from
    perl modules. The main reason is that there isn't (yet) a mechanism
    for storing meta information in perl modules. This module aims to
    define that interface whithout defining the underlying
    representation.

    Later, when an XML (or other) standard for perl meta information is
    developed, this interface can be wrapped around it. This will allow
    developers to use meta information now and later adapt as new
    mechanisms become available.

    The current implementation is designed to automatically guess some
    meta information (description) from the contents of module. This
    provides a nice transition mechanism.

    Also included is a simple example way to explicitly store meta
    information in the module in a specific directory. This is a
    proposed feature which will wait for debate to finalise.
