The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::DE::DTA::Create
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Create DTA files for german money transfer
  userid:      BSNOOP (Ben Schnopp)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module makes only sense for german money transactions, so I
    was looking for a Namespace, matching german financial transactions.
    Finance::Bank::DE seemed to be OK. DTA::Create comes from me.
    Perhaps I will submit a DTA::Check module later.

    I think this could be a useful module for some users. I myself was
    long looking for such a module before we created it. It is helpful
    for web-applications where moneytransactions occur (for instance an
    web-app needs to collect membership fees, or to pay commissions
    etc.) as it minimies the work. Instead of manually typing in all the
    transactions you create a DTA-file, import it into banking-software
    and you are ready.

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::DE::DTA::
::Create          RdpOp Create DTA files for german money transfer   BSNOOP
