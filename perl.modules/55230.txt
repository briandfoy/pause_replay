Shlomi,

Sorry for taking ages to get back to you but health concerns and other 
mundania have been severely taxing my time.

I'm very pleased to have you as a co-maintainer on XML::SemanticDiff. 
Its a decent module that meets a fairly common need; I just haven't been 
able to give it the time it deserves. Feel free to patch and extend to 
your heart's content, I would only ask that you give me a heads-up 
before jumping into any major architectural changes.

The license should remain the same.

And thanks to you CPANistas for following up on this. For future 
reference: I'm not dead, I'm only pining for the fjords.

Cheers,
