Ron,

With all respect, I believe it is fundamentally wrong to impose your personal
preferences about how to version modules to the whole community. There is no
such thing as to "modules need version number" official guideline for module
writers, and I believe it should stays so.

And don't take just my word to it. Here's one of perl flagship modules,
Catalyst, for example.  The only place where version is declared is in the main
module file. And there's so many many others.

We can definitely discuss that it would be a better scheme for versioning in
the future though, but as for now I certainly don't agree with you that it is
up for me to fix the problem.

Sincerely,
Dmitry
