Hello!
Sorry, i am only right now found this page, with yours answers..


About AZ::Splitter:

> how is this different than split()?

you will not using split() function on big or giant volume data.

> You could choose a different name of the module.  AZ::* means nothing
> to anybody but you, and Splitter isn't that much more meaningful outside
> of any context.

yes.. i am recognize my mistake, it was not good idea. but, how do you think?
it not too late to change this name to anther name? Here
http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/AZ-Splitter one man call this module stream
tokenizer. maybe it is good idea? And if this is real, then tell me please, -
where will be better to talking with people about interface?

----
ps: main idea of this module is, - safely and fast parsing giant volume data
"on the fly". 


About AZ::CGI:

for first about module name. here situation the same as in AZ::Splitter
module.. i understanding my mistake, but i don't known, exists or not an opportunity
to correct this situation? Please, answer me on that question.

> There are already plenty of CGI parsers.  Why do we need another one?

reasons:
 - fully specification support in part "Processing form data"
 - parsing POST data only "on the fly" (based on AZ::Splitter). used very little memory
 - parsing is safely! no chance to crash your script/server.
 - file upload is very simple and safely too. (example in manual)

Main idea of this module is safely work. i had studed many many of parsers
on Perl and c++ and don't found no one who can safely work with POSt data
1 or more Mb.

---
ps: at soon will be ready part for handling work with http response



last one ps: sorry by bad english..
