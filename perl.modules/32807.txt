Request to register new user

fullname: Nicolas M. Thiéry
  userid: NTHIERYA
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://lapcs.univ-lyon1.fr/~nthiery/
     why:

    A new compatible member to the Test::* familly:

    Test::Group - group together related tests

    In the longer run, other perl modules of mines, or developed while
    I was working at www.idealx.com.

    In fact, I already have a pause account (nthiery), but lost the
    password a long long time ago. Since then the email address for this
    account does not work anymore, so I can't request the password. I
    would appreciate to reuse my old account instead of making a new
    one.

    Thanks in advance!
