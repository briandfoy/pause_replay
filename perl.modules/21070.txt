I am AMGarland on PAUSE  amgarland@cpan.org

I have recently uploaded DirList_1_0.zip containing DirList.pl .

This is a command line utility developed on Windows 98 for creating a
listing of file information for the current (or target) directory and its
subdirectories. The listing is in CSV format, suitable for loading into
Excel for further sorting and analysis.

I looked around on CPAN and found nothing similar.
Does this belong on CPAN?
Would you have any suggestions for whether this is useful and where to list
it?
How is a utility such as this announced and indexed for wider use?

Regards,
  Andrew Garland

--------------------------

# Usage
# DirList.pl -switches
#
# Creates file dir.csv in the current directory
# One line for each file in the current dir and subdirectories
# As a comma separated list (.csv format):
#   root dir, current dir, name, ext, modify date-time, size
#
#  Say current directory is C:/bug/ant
#  Then: rootdir is C:/bug
#      : current dir is ant, ant/sub1, ant/sub2, ant/sub1/ssub1, etc.
