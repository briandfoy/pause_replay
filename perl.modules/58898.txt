Subject: Question concerning new text transliteration module

Hello,

we are a small team of self-employed computational linguists who would
like to contribute an easy to use, object-oriented text transliteration
module to the Perl community.

The module handles transliteration of (UTF-8) text from one writing
system to another, uses only standard modules at runtime and can easily
be extended as its transliteration tables are generated at build time
using XML based definitions.

However, there is a module on CPAN already that handles text
transliteration: "Unicode::Transliterate", which is in fact a wrapper
around IBM's ICU (International Component for Unicode) library.  In
contrast, our module is written in plain Perl only and doesn't depend on
other third party software other than Perl and its standard modules,
except XML::Simple is used to process the XML definitions once.

Beside that, CPAN already holds some language specific transliteration
modules like "Lingua::RU::Translit", while our module is language
independant by design and already covers the complete ISO 9
transliteration of Cyrillic to Latin characters as well as the Greek
transliterations according to ISO 843. Others will follow...

Is there interest in having our module available at CPAN?

If so, we would like to introduce it to the "Lingua" namespace, because
it deals with natural language processing, and propose
"Lingua::Translit" as package name for consistency with the existing
language dependant implementations.

Thanks in advance,
