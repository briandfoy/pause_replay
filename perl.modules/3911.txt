Hi all,

I uploaded a new module to PAUSE, Iterator.pm.
The archive is currently located at

https://pause.kbx.de/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/H/HC/HCAMP/Iterator_0.02.zip
http://www.creagen.de/downloads/Iterator_0.2.zip

The archive file "Iterator_0.02.zip" should soon arrive on CPAN.

What do I have to do to get the module listed in the Perl module list?
Iterator.pm uses the "Data"-namespace, as far as I can see there are 
no conflicts with any modules (from The List) under the Data::-item.

Excerpt from the readme-file:


	Iterator.pm - shows paths/values of complex data structures

DESCRIPTION

	Iterator.pm is an object orientated (plain) Perl module to 
iterate over complex data structures (LoL, LoH, HoL, HoH etc.).

	While Perl's built-in functions foreach(), each(), keys() and 
values() handle just a given level of a structure, Iterator digs 
deeper - handling a structure like an one-dimensional hash.

	For each element of a nested data structure the symbolic name 
("data path"), The Value - as is! - plus some additional information 
are retrieved.

	That is, Iterator provides an unified syntax for simple handling 
of data sources of different types.

	Iterator does not alter the referenced structure, though values 
may be explicitly modified by the user.

	Iterator does not export any variables or functions. You /can/ 
call arbitrary packet subs via &Packetname::subname(), but you 
/might/ be surprised of the results :-)


INSTALLATION

	Just copy/move Iterator.pm into your Perl's [site/]/lib/Data-
directory. In your script,

		use Data::Iterator;

	If you want to keep Iterator.pm in any directory not in @INC, 
BEGIN unshift()ing this dir to @INC or

		use lib 'your/dir/here';

	In your script,

		use Iterator;
