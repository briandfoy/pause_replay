The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Calendar
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Date calc. w/ holidays & calendar profiles
  userid:      STBEY (Steffen Beyer)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    personal email (+ group reply) (although subscribed, I don't receive
    modules@perl.org)

  similar:
    None available so far to my knowledge

  rationale:

    Date::Calendar is an add-on to Date::Calc. It provides date
    calculations which involve holidays (and consequently, business
    days, i.e., work days). For that it provides a large number of
    national holiday schemes for many countries of the world. These
    holiday schemes also allow to generate calendars for many countries
    automatically: see http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/calendar/.

    Since the module deals with calendars, and since it's an add-on for
    Date::Calc, I suggest the name "Date::Calendar", which shows what it
    deals with, and which is an allusion to the name "Date::Calc", since
    the first 9 characters of both names are the same.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::Calendar        RdpOp Date calc. w/ holidays & calendar profiles   STBEY
