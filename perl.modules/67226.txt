The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Application::PageLookup
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: generic model component for Titanium
  userid:      SILASMONK (Nicholas Bamber)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    cgi::application mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have attempted to discuss the module under the name
    CGI::Application::Model but I am beginning to feel that this name is
    more descriptive, less abstract and less needlessly hubristic.

    The basic idea is that given you have a table of pages and given a
    page id you can look up the template and temtplate parameters from
    this. Some additional tables handle certain other cases such as
    loops and parameters that are scattered across a website. Thus a
    single run mode can handle a lot of a website. More complex pages
    would require their own run mode but would still be able to leverage
    a lot of the infrastructure. The system is extensible both through
    OO and a system of callbacks.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Application::
::PageLookup      cdpOp generic model component for Titanium         SILASMONK
