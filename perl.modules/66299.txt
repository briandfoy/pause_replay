Config::JFDI already supports most of that as a "like Catalyst's ConfigLoader
plugin but external" - can't you just patch that? (it uses Config::Any so your
patches would support any/all config handlers as a bonus)

Alternative, clinton as moved his Config::Loader module to the Config::Merge
namespace with a view to re-using Config::Loader as a namespace for a good
new standard for configuration handling - there's a list at

http://lists.scsys.co.uk/

where people have been discussing APIs. Seems like we should have a couple of
really good config modules on CPAN rather than lots of little ones that only
handle what one person wants ... :)
