File::Find::Iterator is taken, although I can't make that module
work, and haven't gotten an answer to an email to its author (though
I only sent it a few days ago, he may be on vacation).

My module has a trivially simple API, and a straightforward internal
implementation of that API without dependence on any other modules.

What I can't figure is where in the namespace it should go. I could
use File::Find::Iterator::Simple, but that's getting kinda verbose.
File::Find::IterSimple would work. I just don't have a good feel for
this.

Suggestions, please, anybody?

Here's basically the complete spec of the interface:

    my $finder = whatever::Find->new("dir" [,"dir2" ...]);
    while (defined($_ = $finder->next()) {
        # $_ is path, including one of the dir prefixes
	# lstat _, stat _, -X _ pre-loaded w/ lstat
	$finder->prune(); # prune last-returned dir
    }

Thanks,

-Bennett
