Request to register new user

fullname: Torsten Knorr
  userid: KNORR
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.planet-interkom.de/t.knorr/index.html
     why:

    In order to mirror my locally created homepage via FTP-Server to
    the remote location, I wrote a small program. Maybe the functions
    are useful also for other ones. I would develop two modules from
    this. The possible namespace could be as follows:

    "Net::FTP::UploadMirror" for the functions

    "Tk::Net::FTP::UploadMirror" for the user interface

    In further future I would like to write modules to the network
    analysis. However, at the moment I want the working method of the
    CPAN becoming acquainted.
