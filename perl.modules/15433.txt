                                                  <li>For example, the Royal

                                                  <li>The numbers work like this

                                                  $10,000 a year on their card, 
                                                  and if Amex pays 0.25% on 
                                                  usage, then the RSPCA will

                                                  supporter is unlikely to be in

                                                  unlikely to spend $10,000
