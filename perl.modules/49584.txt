The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebPresence
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: OO online presence data retrieval interface
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've suggested a root level namespace because while this module and
    its subclasses *use* LWP and HTML parsers, etc, the interface itself
    does not and the original location of the data is only incidental.
    Further, it's not inconceivable that non-HTML based data might be
    retrieved in a subclass.

    I intend to have a few other modules sit alongside for gathering
    other types of data (as the current ones are geared towards user
    profile data). Some of the idea include image retrievals, image
    gallery retrivals, and so on, all of which will be other WebPresence
    based works.

    The goal of these modules is to simplify the 'screen scraping' and
    data collation that Perl programmers often find themselves doing and
    to make a single standardised interface to interact with that data.

    Metaphorically speaking, to avoid all these wheels being invented
    over and over again, I'm inventing the tank-tread.

The resulting entry would be:
