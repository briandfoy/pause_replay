The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       perlcassa
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: An Apache Cassandra Client for Perl
  userid:      MKJELLMAN (Michael Kjellman)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/mkjellman/perlcassa

  similar:

  rationale:

    -I took the name from the already existing projects phpcassa and
    pycassa. I believe that having a name closer to the established
    defacto Cassandra clients will make the project more in line with
    the goals of the Cassandra Community.

    -I have included full support for serializing and deserializing
    data between Cassandra and Perl. All Perl Cassandra implementations
    to date have not dealt with this which limits the ability to use
    things such as CompositeType columns and non BytesType validators

    -We are currently using the code internally in production on
    multiple projects and while it still needs work to make it perfect
    it is working reliably for us at this time.

    thanks!
