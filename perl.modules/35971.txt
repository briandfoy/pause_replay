My names are Dr. Mahmoud Sa'id. I am an Iraqi indigene. I am presently a =
member of the Iraq Project and Contracting Office (PCO) formerly known as the =
Program Management Office (PMO) in Iraq. The responsibility of this said =
committee as it is declared on section 3 (1) (Contracting Authority) of the =
Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 87 (CPA/ORD/14 May 2004/87), =
states that;"The authority to obligate government funds, award and sign =
government public contracts, enter into and authorize material modifications =
to such contracts, and authorize the payment of invoices and claims, shall =
rest solely with a qualified government agency or a committee within each =
governmental unit or agency, duly appointed under the authority of this =
Order".

As members of this committee, my colleagues and I have until recently watched =
with astonishment how our aforementioned responsibility (mainly choice of =
contractor) has been greatly influenced by United States government officials =
on the committee. The latter has been very influential on "Who" gets "What", =
as it concerns large value contracts. These are by and large contracts whose =
value exceeds twenty million United States Dollars ($20m). Contracts with =
lesser value, they have habitually left to us to oversee in accordance with =
the laid down regulations governing contract matters.

My colleagues and I after much 'brainstorming' have discovered a means =
through which we can make some money. In our most recent processing of =
contract tenders, we awarded two (2) contracts totaling nearly thirty million =
($30m). These said contracts; we have listed on the CPA-CA Register of =
Awards. Once a 'Request For Proposal' (RFP) on a project has been developed, =
it is evidenced as being identified in a 'contract capacity', by listing it =
in the CPA-CA Register of Award. A contractor is at the right time allocated =
to execute the job. By next week, it would be time to allocate contractors to =
these two aforementioned contracts amongst others. This is the reason why I =
am contacting you. We are seeking a bona-fide individual, whom we can =
negotiate with to 'fill' this key opening (the contractor). 

This is our intention for you;
The role would be for you to nominate a company for us to 'fill-in' as the =
beneficiary contractor. You have to of course own controlling 'shares' in =
your nominated company. As soon as the contractor list is published, you =
would in-turn elect to sell the said contract title to a major contractor =
vast in Iraqi contracts. We already have a contractor whom we are familiar =
with, that can buy the said contract title from you. You might ask why we are =
not just going ahead to list this said major contractor as the awardee.

As it concerns Iraqi contracts, there is an extent to which one contracting =
firm can be directly awarded several contracts in the same dispensation. Our =
nominee is a major player in contracts in Iraq. Based on the extent of =
contracts he is handling in Iraq, though he has the capacity to handle more, =
he cannot be awarded more jobs directly. He can now only afford to buy =
contract titles from those whom have won the right to execute these =
contracts. The buying of contract titles in Iraq is a common occurrence these =
days. A lot of the contract beneficiaries in Iraq decide to sell to other =
major contractors due to the security/safety concerns prevalent here. The =
fear of kidnapping mostly does not allow them to execute the contracts =
themselves.  

Following negotiations with our nominee contractor, whom would buy the =
contract title in your name, you stand to benefit to the tune of at least Two =
Million United States Dollars ($2m). This is achievable within a time frame =
of twenty (20) working days. Take note that we have perfectly rehearsed the =
entire process to achieve our objective. You only have to signify your =
interest to make money with us, to enable us furnish you with the =
nitty-gritty of the entire process. Also take note that this transaction is =
entirely risk-free. You do not have to set 'foot' in Iraq. 

Due to the system of governance in Iraq, transparency and accountability is =
assured. All contract data is clearly published on Iraqi government websites. =
You would this way, be able to monitor very vital aspects of this =
transaction.

My colleagues and I await your response to enable our further action. You can =
respond through mahmouds@sify.com.
