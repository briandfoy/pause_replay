Description of first planned contribution:

  A class providing the ability to parse email newsletters from
  http://www.versiontracker.com.

DSLI entry:

  Mail::
  ::VersionTracker cdpO Parses newsletters from versiontracker.com AFOXSON

Discussion:

  There has been no public dicussion of this module. There however already
  exists Mail::Freshmeat which implements similar functionality for a
  different mailing list. I therefore suspect that there shouldn't be
  any objections to this submission.
