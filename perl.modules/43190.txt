The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Jeens
  DSLIP:       inphg
  description: A Wiki/Blog/PIM Manager/Photo Album tool
  userid:      JESSESTAY (Jesse Stay)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.jessestay.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    Jeens is a concept I believe not yet developed fully, especially in
    Perl. It is intended primarily under the idea of a blogging tool,
    but within each blog entry will be allowed easy creation of
    wiki/user-editable text, with easy addition of images, management of
    calendar events, tying all of those events and images together into
    an excellent organizational and collaboration tool. It is an idea in
    development at the moment and you can see my thoughts on
    http://www.jessestay.com, but it's intent is to be very expandable
    and encourage others to add their own plug-ins and extensions down
    the road, hence why I think it deserves its own namespace.

  enteredby:   JESSESTAY (Jesse Stay)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 25 21:44:49 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Jeens             inphg A Wiki/Blog/PIM Manager/Photo Album tool     JESSESTAY
