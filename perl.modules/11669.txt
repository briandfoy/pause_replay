Chris,

This is really all my fault.   I just needed my
"." (root) patch fix that Mike applied to 0.19
(but is not in 0.12) at CPAN so the systems guys
here could trust it enough to install it on our
machines.  I did the upload straight off fuhr.org
over a month ago:

===============================================


Sorry to cause the problems.  No wonder I've
been getting spammed with all these Net::DNS
issues from people.  I have not had much
involvement with Net::DNS, so you don't need
to worry about stepping on my toes.  I would
appreciate at least anonymous CVS access to
your Net-DNS repository so I may submit more
accurate patches to the latest developmental
source tree, but it isn't crucial.  To "resolve"
the matter, just upload your 0.20 tarball to
CPAN so it will bounce back to you.  But
please do so soon.  Though it is usually a
bit more work, I think it is best to release
often and have lots of versions as opposed to
changing very many things and releasing
less frequently.  It makes for easier bug
pinpointing for the users to report to the
developer, provides fewer code changes per
version change, allows users to test against
more current code base, and reduces multiple
reports of identical bugs.

Sorry again,

Rob Brown
