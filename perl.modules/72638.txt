Hi,

I'm quite unhappy with the current situation of Sub::Name.

A while ago it has been broken by changes in the perl core. Sub::Name is
near the root of many huge dependency trees on CPAN, so since then a
whole lot of code couldn't be tested properly on recent versions of
perl.

A [1]patch has been sent to Matthijs, the author, via RT and, since this
seems to be quite an important issue, several people, including Steffen
M=C3=BCller and me, have been trying to contact him with offers to build a
fixed distribution or to become a co-maintainer for several weeks
now. All to no avail.

1. https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3D59558


Additionally, there are a couple of other patches in Sub::Name's RT
queue, most of them quite old. None of them seem to have ever received a
reply by the maintainer.


Does anyone know how to get ahold of Matthijs?

Is there anything we can do to get Sub::Name into shape again?
