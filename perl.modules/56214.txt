Subject: Module submission TL1ng
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TL1ng
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Flexible, accurate, simple handling of TL1
  userid:      SSCAFFIDI (Stephen R. Scaffidi)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    Net::TL1

  rationale:

    Net::TL1 simply did not meet my needs - it was not compatible with
    the devices I manage, and does not handle the type of asynchronous
    communication that I required.

    Another non-cpan module exists, TL1. It, too, was not compatible
    enough for my needs.

    TL1 is a machine-man language (MML) that defines a format for
    messages passed between network elements (NEs) and a manager, either
    a human or program.

    While the most common means is access via Telnet, I have seen NEs
    that use a direct Serial link, pairs of FIFO files, and even FTP
    (for batch command submission and result retrieval)

    Therefore, while I considered asking for Net::TL1ng, TL1 is not
    necessarily a network protocol.

    -- Additional Info --

    My module offers: - Already in use in a large production network -
    An interface that is simpler than Net::TL1 - Greater compatibility
    with more devices (I've tested it with 5 NE types from 3 vendors,
    with several more to come soon) - Greater, simpler flexibility than
    other similar modules - The parser and communication back-ends can
    be changed through OO composition/polymorphism (TL1ng::Parser,
    TL1ng::Source) - NE-specific functionality can easily be created
    through OO inheritance (TL1ng::Base) *or* using TL1ng in another
    script or module.

The resulting entry would be:
