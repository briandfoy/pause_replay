The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::StreetAddress::Canada
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Module for parsing Canadian street addresses
  userid:      TEEDOT (Scott Burlovich)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    List: module-authors

  similar:
    Geo::StreetAddress::US - Parses only US addresses, I based my module
    on this code to parse and handle Canadian street addresses.

  rationale:

    Namespace choice is obvious, this module is for parsing Canadian
    street addresses. I created this module out of necessity for a
    project I am working on as I could not find any existing modules
    that could handle Canadian data. Only other module that came close
    didn't even do what I wanted, it simply geocoded an address and
    turned it into a relative Lat & Long.. I'm sure there are others
    looking for something similar so I would like to give my work back
    to the community.

  enteredon:   Tue Sep 10 05:09:13 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::StreetAddress::
::Canada          Rdpfg Module for parsing Canadian street addresses TEEDOT
