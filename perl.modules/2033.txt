Thanks!

As a request can the PAUSE webpages be modified to have an "Add Module
Metadata" form?  That would reduce the likelihood of errors with the
module list format (which I for one find confusing), and make it
really easy.  I would further suggest that you tie it into the process
of uploading a module, to reduce the chance that a person might do one
without doing the other.
