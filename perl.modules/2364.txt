Subject: namespace: Qtk::QuickTk proposal.  Comments?

  I'd like comments on use of Qtk::QuickTk namespace for a
module I wish to submit to CPAN.  QuickTk supports a
streamlined syntax (mini-language) for specifying GUIs,
and generates and executes perl-tk (Tk.pm and friends) code
to implement it.

  I chose Qtk as a top-level namespace for this module
because I anticipate submitting a series of related modules
that all use the same mini-language syntax.  I'm currently
exploring the possibility of generating calls to the gtk
(Gtk and friends) library as a richer alternative to perl-tk.
I've implemented nearly a dozen applications using the QuickTk
module, and expect to submit modules for a number of them.
I suspect that a set of common facilities might usefully be
abstracted out from all this, to become a Qtk.pm module which
would support the rest.

  The module I've been calling QuickTk uses my Text::TreeFile
module (currently listed, and soon to appear on CPAN) for
low-level file format support, which includes syntax support
for comments, file-includes and continuation lines, as well
as interpreting a strict indentation scheme to indicate
parent-child nesting for the tree structure.

  Full details on both of these modules appears at:

         perl.dystanhays.com/jnk

(the code, sample data and drafts of documentation).

  Does this choice of namespace make sense?
