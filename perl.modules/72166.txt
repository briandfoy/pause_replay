Nobody really owns entire namespaces, so you can add to BigBrother::*
as long as someone hasn't already used that particular package name.

If you'd like to take over some of the BigBrother modules because the
author has disappeared, see the PAUSE instructions for the process. We
can help you do that once we know the author either affirmatively
abandons the module or never responds.
