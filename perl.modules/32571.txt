    Thread::PriorityQueue

    A priority queue, as implemented by C<Thread::PriorityQueue> is a
    thread-safe data structure much like a standard Thread::Queue
    object. The difference is, you specify a priority level when
    enqueuing items in the priority queue. Items with a higher priority
    (lower number) will come off the queue before items with lower
    priorities. This can be used to prioritize the order in which items
    are processed by threads. Within the same priority level items are
    returned in the same order they were enqueued in.
