OK.  I joined the DateTime mailing list, and posted a week ago (Date: Thu,
15 Jun 2006 09:42:45 +0100) inviting review of Date::JD.  I also asked
about my Date::ISO8601, which is in a similar position as a low-level
calendar module.  I have received absolutely no responses whatsoever.
How is this to be interpreted?

Re my Time:: modules, it seems to me that the DateTime people are far less
likely to take an interest in those, which are concerned with precision
time scales, than in calendar modules.  With such little interest shown
in Date::JD, surely there must be a better group to review Time::*?
