Jarkko,

Thanks for the feedback.  In my initial need that inspired the module, I 
was working with a set of numbers in the same order of magnitude and 
just needed a single precision so wrote to that spec.  I completely 
agree with the need for a test-specific one, but I just disagreed with 
brian's quick suggestion of an additional optional parameter -- I felt 
it had too much potential for confusion and user-error.  It's addressed 
in the new Test::Number::Delta by having a more specific version of the 
function:

     delta_within( $a, $b, $precision, $test_name )

compared to

     delta_ok( $a, $b, $test_name )

which uses the module-wide default.

Regards,
David
