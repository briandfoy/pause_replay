Hi,

Based on the Net::LDAP::Control::Paged, it was created a module for DirSync
control, allowing to synchronize application data with MS Active Directory
via an incremental search.

I've got some requests to share this DirSync wrapper.
Does it make sense to share it via CPAN and if yes
can you provide me an assistance, how to better allocate it on CPAN?

I thought it's reasonable to place it in namespace somewhere
under Net::LDAP::Control (maybe Net::LDAP::Control::ADDirSync),
because this module is just a sub-class of Net::LDAP::Control.

Yet perl-ldap team have objections to using Net::LDAP namespace,
because this control is a proprietary, non-RFC based.

I was suggested to use something under Win32::AD
Maybe Win32::AD::Control::DirSync and appropriate constants will be
in Win32::AD::Constants?

Does Win32:: indicate that the module runs only under windows platform?
I guess it could be misleading because the module itself is not
platform-specific.
(yet, the server side is AD, that is it runs on windows only of course)

And this module inherits from Net::LDAP::Control.
Will not placing it into quite different namespace be misleading also?

Best regards
Alexey Kravchuk
