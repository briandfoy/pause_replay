The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       API::ReviewBoard
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Interface to work with ReviewBoard 2.0 APIs
  userid:      CHETANG (Chetan)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://technobeans.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/perl-package-to-work-with-reviewboard-2-0-apis/

  similar:
    WebService::ReviewBoard

  rationale:

    Namespace choice: As the library works with ReviewBoard2.0 APIs
    adding this library as API::ReviewBoard.

    Approach: This package gives the following info: - Gets the review
    board link for a ACTIVE change request number. - The new review
    request description from ACTIVE change request. - Gets the date on
    which ACTIVE change request was added. - Gets the date on which
    change request was last updated. - Gets the name of the reviewers
    assigned for ACTIVE change request number. The function returns an
    ARRAYREF to the user. - Gets the name of the submitter who submitted
    the ACTIVE change request. - The review request's brief summary of
    ACTIVE change request. - Get the list of bugs closed or referenced
    by the ACTIVE change request. - Gets the count of comments received
    for an ACTIVE change request. - Gets the count of review requests
    made by a user. - Gets the count of review requests made by a user
    during time interval. - Gets the count of review requests made by a
    user with status in [all | pending |submitted | discarded]. - Gets
    the count of review requests made to a user. -
