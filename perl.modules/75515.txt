How does this relate to STAR::TV::ProgrammesSchedules? Is one of them a
mistake?

Also, namespaces that start from the general and go toward the specific
tend to be better:

   TV::ProgrammesSchedules::Sony

The spelling of "program", I guess, is left up to the first person to
make the module, although I have an obvious preference. :)
