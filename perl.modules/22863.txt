The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Strip
  DSLIP:       RdcOp
  description: Efficiently removes HTML markup from text
  userid:      KILINRAX (Alex Bowley)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Whilst the module quite happily strips SGML/XML-like markup from
    text as well as HTML; I believe it should exist in the HTML
    namespace simple because I can envisage no circumstances under which
    someone would want to blanketly remove SGML/XML markup - whereas
    stripping extraneous HTML markup is occasionally very desirable. A
    common application is preparing HTML snippets for indexing by a
    search engine. As this module is written bare-minimum C, it tends to
    be about 7 times faster than using regular expressions to do the
    same thing.

  enteredby:   KILINRAX (Alex Bowley)

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Strip           RdcOp Efficiently removes HTML markup from text    KILINRAX
