What does this hve to do with CGI?  Why is TAX in all uppercase?

Also, the USA is not the only country with taxes.  What kind of taxes?
Sales tax?  There is no "Internet tax" that I am aware of.

There is already a Business::Tax::VAT module.  I would suggest, unless
your module actually does something relating to CGI (such as HTTP
and/or HTML in the module) that you place it under Business::Tax::
instead of CGI::.  Perhaps Business::Tax::US::Internet if that's what
it is really about...?
