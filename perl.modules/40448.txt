Hi Friend,

First things first, 

I've got something personal to reveal to you today and believe me NOW - you better hang on my every word. 

As always, I'm gonna talk straight with you. No B.S., no sugar coating - just the truth. 

So let me go straight to... 

My 3 Secrets for Making Major Buckolas 

1. I really DO invest in real estate. I don't just write about it or create products about it. As of January 2005, I've bought 3 condos (in the pre-construction phase), 11.5 of acres of land, and two single family homes. Right now I'm in the process of tying up an additional $12,000,000 worth of new condos in Miami, Florida. The deal should hopefully be done this week. 

But you know what. I've helped people like YOU do likewise. I have friends and clients all over the U.S. who are doing exactly what I told them to do, as I hope you do, and they're being wonderfully rewarded. 

2. Now this secret may surprise you - but here it is. I sell info products about how money is being made in real estate, and these products don't just help me bring in a passive residual income, an income that flows to me even while I sleep or travel (or look at properties), but these products also put me in touch with the real PLAYERS out there. I meet tons of joint venture partners as a result of the contacts I make from my courses. 

I can't tell you how many contacts I've made that have helped me get in on deals I never would have heard about if I didn't have a database of people who hung on my every word, trusted what I told them, acted upon the advice and profited. That alone is worth many, many fortunes to me. 

3. Here comes the clincher: I always dreamed of having multiple streams of income. When I was making my fortune in real estate (and I continue to do just that), I was already thinking, "Hey, what if I taught other people how to do what I do" and so on. This led to me getting a website, my first product and eventually, contact with YOU. 

One year ago today I was doing "better than most" online. But if you've followed me for a good year, you will have noted a distinct change in how I communicate, how often I communicate, the words I use. I cannot give you all the details, but I will say that I met a guy that I call "The Zen Master of the Internet" - and over the last seven months he has helped me quintuple my internet sales. 

Again, I don't want to give you exact numbers as I'm superstitious about doing so - but what I can tell you is that this Zen Master guy will help me put MORE than an additional two million buckolas in my account this year alone. All done "online" - in my spare time, while I'm engaged in other activities. Because of this guy, I now have the #1 real estate website and presence on the Internet. That, my friend, is HUGE. 

What this got to do with YOU. 

A LOT. 

Matter of fact, I think you should be learning this Zen Master's stuff, too. 

You could quadruple your real estate business in only a few weeks. 

You could triple your current income inside of 90 days if you do it the right way. 

So do yourself a favor and head on over to http://www.knockoutmarketing.com/lou_vukas.html so you can see exactly what I'm talking about. Go there NOW. 

Lou 


P.S. Friend, you need to check this out right away, because I'm only posting it for a few days. Don't put this off. Go to http://www.knockoutmarketing.com/lou_vukas.html and see exactly how you can build an online "passive" income.
