Hi,

I'm trying X11:GUITest module on Solaris 8 environment.  And I got 
problems on using GetWindowName and ClickWindow.  Any advice and 
suggestions are  appreciated.  Thank you very much.

1) GetWindowName:
I found that GetWindowName seems can't work on OUI (Oracle Universal 
Installer) which is a window made by java for installation.  I can see 
the title on the window but the return value is empty.  BTW, all others 
apps (such as terminal, xclock and xtext) are fine to use this funtion.

2) ClickWindow
Getting failure and some error messages when using this function.  Is it 
a known issue?  Or is it something wrong in my environment.

Thank you very much and Regards,
Gary Chen
