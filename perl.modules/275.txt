1) I'm quite impressed, Raphaël, that you could extract enough
   parameterizable, reuseable material out of my giant script to 
   create a module out of it.

2) The "underscores in the root namespace are reserved" thing is new
   to me.  If so, it needs to go in perlmod.  But first, some questions.
   Reserved unto whom?  To the compiler?  Isn't that what the pragmata
   are for?  To the CORE distribution?  Typically compilers reserved
   namespaces with one or two leading underscores, but doesn't care
   about anything in the middle.  There seem to be a lot of "common
   knowledge" reserved-unto out there that aren't that common, or aren't
   written up.  I've recently tried to write up the "all lower case means
   a compiler-owned pragma" thing, and the "all capitals might look like
   a built-in" bit.  If there's more, please let's write it down.

3) I like the "Mx" part. :-)
