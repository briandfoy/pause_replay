     why:

    We want to get an account to be able to co-maintain a module that
    has just been posted on your site by a colleague (with his
    permission). Subsequently, we will certainly have to contribute to
    CPAN by submitting other modules used in particular for processing
    of bibliographic data.

    Best regards
