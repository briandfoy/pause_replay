Hi Brendan,

it has been brought to my attention that the module
DateTime::Cron::Simple has a copyright notice but not a license how
the module is to be used, altered, distributed and re-distributed.

This is very unfortunate. If this cannot be changed, I do not think
that it can be kept on CPAN. Primary prerequisite for being hosted on
CPAN is that there must be a clear statement what kind of license you
have in mind for the code and there's a secondary need that the
license is accepted by the community (i.e. it is free in the broadest
sense).

If this was not clear to you from the first contact with CPAN, please
let us know what you think about the licensing issue. I think I must
be very clear on this one prerequisite and I will review our wording
on all pages and emails: CPAN cannot distribute any material that has
legal caveats about use, modification, distribution and
re-distribution of the IP in the distributed material.

Can you please either clarify your license or remove the module from
CPAN or otherwise clarify your position?

Given that your code has been living on CPAN for more than two years,
I think there is no immediate need that I remove the code immediately.
I suppose you have already accepted that your code is being distrbuted
worldwise. But please let's resolve this matter as soon as possible.

Thanks,
