hi all,

it has been a lousy 20 months looking for work and i let all my modules 
slide due to lack of emotion due to the job search. i do have something 
lined up but the federally required background check is taking forever.

i would like to give co-maintenance to chase for File::Slurp. i am 
somewhat surprised at the interest since i have seen it slammed so often 
on various forums but it still has over 500 reverse dependencies on cpan.

i only have one request, that i get to do code review on new patches so 
the code quality is up to my standards

also i have some ideas for new features that i would like to see 
implemented. one is a shortcut module called FS that you can use on the 
command like and it will export all the module subs as 2 or 3 letter 
shortcuts like rf(), efl(), etc. then you can do something like this:

perl -MFS -e 'ef {s/foo/bar/g} shift' filename

instead of the -il000 option which is hard to remember

another feature would be to add backup files to edit_file and 
edit_file_lines. i don't see any easy way to make that atomic though.

anyhow, let's get the co-maint going and i suspect it will spark me to 
get back to being involved in slurp. positive outside energy is a good 
thing for me.

i do have a repo on github but not used in a while. i think the name is 
perlhunter. i can give edit perms there as well. i may need some help 
with the admin of that. when the cpan co-maint is done (or in parallel) 
we can tackle that too.

thanx,

uri
