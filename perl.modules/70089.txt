     why:

    I'm a casual Perl programmer but from time to time I produce some
    module that I think may be useful for others. For example I just
    made a small Perl binding to the GNU Source Highlight library (the
    code can currently be found here
    https://code.launchpad.net/~chust/+junk/SourceHighlight) and at
    least two people from the German Perl community
    (http://www.perl-community.de) asked me whether I couldn't publish
    it on CPAN. So here I am requesting an account so I can do that :-)
