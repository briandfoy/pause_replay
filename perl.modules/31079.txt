First, let me quote your previous reply:

I feel that the module name should indeed reflect that LaTeX 
will be converted to an _image format_, as you proposed. 
However, plain
TeX::Convert::(ImageMagick|MimeTeX|GhostScript)
isn't very informative assuming that not everyone knows what 
ImageMagick or mimeTeX is. TeX::Convert::GhostScript is even 
misleading (a PostScript converter comes to mind).

Any further suggestions?
What about plain TeX::Convert::Picture (I can use the 
(ImageMagick|MimeTeX|GhostScript) subclasses internally)?
Maybe the toplevel category is wrong, should we use 
something like Image::FromTeX (in 18* Images, Pixmap and 
Bitmap Manipulation, Drawing and Graphing)?

What's your general advice on the subclasses -- should they 
be internal or visible in the module list?

Thanks for your time and patience,
Mart
