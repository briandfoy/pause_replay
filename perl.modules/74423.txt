Hi-

With respect to PDL module permissions for
Tuomas Lukka, per his e-mail below, he has
transferred all his modules to me.  However,
in trying to clean up outdated PDL releases
from CPAN I can find no way to remove the
old PDL releases from CPAN if submitted with
another PAUSE account.

Is there any way to remove the old PDL
releases from CPAN so that new PDL users
don't get confused?

Regards,
Chris Marshall
PDL Co-maintainer

Hi, really sorry to not have responded earlier - I've been swamped with my duties in my new startup, zendroid.com <http://zendroid.com>.

(And hi Karl, Christian - long time no see :)

I have now transferred the primary maintainership of *all* modules I had it on to you as I'm no longer involved in Perl. You can transfer them onwards or do whatever you see fit.

Tuomas

     This is a final attempt to contact you regarding PDL namespace

     Please replay at your earliest convenience.

     Mr. Lukka,

     PDL is looking to release a PDL-2.4.4 but you
     currently are the maintainer of record for many
     of the existing, internal PDL namespaces.

     To make possible continued PDL development
     and releases, we need to obtain the permissions
     for the PDL namespaces you control, see

     https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=a&paupausese99_peek_perms_query=lukka&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit <https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=a&pause99_peek_perms_query=lukka&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit>

     for a list of your current PAUSE ID perms. You'll
     need your PAUSE id login to view.

     If you could please transfer primary maintainership
     status to me (PAUSE id CHM) that will allow us
     to sort out the correct permissions for the coming
     release.

     One of my PDL projects you may be interested in
     is refactoring the TriD graphics to use GLUT
     rather than X11+GLX as the base dependency.
     This should improve portability and uniformity across
     many more platforms.

     I look forward to hearing from you soon.

     Best regards,
     Chris Marshall
