NEW SERVICE ADDED 1 JAN 2004<br><br>

Many people have Egold in their account but it is of little use to them as they can only cashout via Paypal. I will send you paypal for your egold plus give you an extra commision on it. I will pay whatever my broker fee is at the time to buy your egold. For example your $1000 egold will be able to be sold for $1020-$1055 Paypal, not only will you make your $1000 egold able to be cashed out but also make a profit. You will also be trading with a reliable source, guaranateed not to reverse the paypal funds or not complete the trade, so you will not need to worry about being scammed when trading, I have a reputable trading and forum background behind me<br><br>

Only orders of egold that are $50 or over I will buy<br><br>

<b>Egold Available At The moment</b><br>
Unlimited funds available<br><br>
