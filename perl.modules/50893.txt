The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Trap
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Trap exit codes, exceptions, output, etc.
  userid:      EBHANSSEN (Eirik Berg Hanssen)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Exception, Test::Warn, Test::Output

  rationale:

    This test module is addressing much the same as Test::Exception,
    Test::Warn, and Test::Output, but it is taking another approach:
    Rather than provide a new syntax for every thing to be tested, it
    provides one new syntax and a single object -- with methods for
    every thing to be tested. This makes it easier when you want to test
    more than one of these things at the same time. Compare:

    # Test::Output and Test::Exception (untested ...): stdout_is {
    stderr_like { throws_ok { my_code() } qr/xxx/, 'Test name 1'; }
    qr/yyy/, 'Test name 2'; } '', 'Test name 3';

    # vs Test::Trap: trap { my_code() }; $trap->die_like( qr/xxx/,
    'Test name 1' ); $trap->stderr_like( qr/yyy/, 'Test name 2' );
    $trap->stdout_is( '', 'Test name 3' );

    Additionally, it will attempt to trap calls to exit() where that
    makes sense. I believe this is unique:

    trap { pod2usage(1) }; $trap->exit_is( 1, 'Should exit with code 1'
    ); # Same as, but with better diagnostics than this: is(
    $trap->exit, 1, 'Should exit with code 1' );

    While the bare accessors make it useful beyond them, the motivation
    lies in writing test scripts, so the Test:: namespace should be
    right.

The resulting entry would be:
