Adam K.:  

Thanks for your thoughtful response.  

And for pointing me toward Business::.  I see some code in
there I'd love not to reinvent. 

I'm open to hearing more about the international
perspective on the words, but I need to say that in my
other profession (when I'm not coding) we use "organize" to
refer to community, labor and electoral work.  And I
suspect that internationally, at least among
English speaking organisers, we share an understanding about
that. We even have professional organizations in which we
all come together as "organi[sz]ers", in spite of
constituency (although we still tend to segregate
ourselves by our politics). See http://www.noacentral.org/. 
And many of these tools are going to be most useful to 
not-for-profit NGO's, non-governmental __organisations__.  

Granted folks looking for someone to organize their closets
may be confused when they find us, and I supect that
perhaps outside the circle of labor, community
and political organizers, perhaps too many folks are
completely unaware of the work we do, much less which word
we choose to describe ourselves. But a brief search of
"organise" found the word in use in the sense I intend here
on English language sites in Europe, Asia and Africa,
besides here in the Americas.  

I'm reluctant to choose a banner, Politics::, which would
exclude the folks doing community and labor organizing who
could benefit from these tools.  Or which would create a
hard fit as we attempt to shoehorn a tool useful to
workplace organising into a Politics:: namespace.  Though
perhaps that word has a broader meaning in the
international community than I'm used to considering.  

I'd be happy to spell it right: Organise::.  Is there some
other alternatives we might consider?  Are there further
thoughts on the matter?  

Our first contribution is likely to be Registration,
described at: http://www1.campaignfoundations.com/node/2.  

Calling it Politics::Registration seems to hide it from the
non-profit NGO's who need a tool like that but who are
predisposed by tax laws, at least in the US, to avoid
involvement in politics.
