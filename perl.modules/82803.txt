Thanx for the reply.

> What do you see that is moving slowly? Some things are slow on purpose.

The trigger was trying to get corrections to maint and co-maint of 
Tree::Persist.

Rob Kinyon emailed me saying he's made a mistake making me co-maint in 
that he seemed to have only removed himself as maint.

He did previously give me co-maint of Tree.

BTW: Since then Stevan Little has given me co-maint of Tree::Binary, 
which unfortunately shares a module name (Tree::Binary) with Tree.

As for moving slowly, I can understand the great need for caution 
amongst custodians of CPAN. I'm not completely stupid!

Case study: Indeed, just a couple of days ago I found out a small-scale 
crime syndicate here in Melbourne is going around clubs, including the 
Melb PC User Group, getting themselves elected to committees, and paying 
each other 'commissions' (i.e. asset stripping) under the pretence that 
their buddies will 'bring business to the club'. Even with forensic 
proof of criminal activity on the ring-leader's PC, he denies everything 
- a bit like Lance Armstrong...

> That's not to say that you can't help, though. :)

Well, I thought rather than just complain perhaps I'd better offer to be 
one of the CPAN admins. My long-term support has been writing modules, 
and some articles, but I could do other things...
