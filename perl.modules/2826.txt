Hello,

I've been developing a number of SNMP and network monitoring scripts and
modules that I'd like to contribute back to CPAN.  In particular, I'm
working on a module to simultaneously query an arbitrary number of SNMP
agents using the SNMP.pm module.  I've been working with Joe Marzot, the
author of the SNMP.pm module, on this code, and have provided a number of
bug fixes and performance enhancements to him.

Here is my information:

        Name:  Rat (karl schilke)
        Email: rat@eli.net
        URL:   [none]

My preferred author ID would be "RAT".

Thank you for your time!

        -Rat
