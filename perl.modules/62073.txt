The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Stats
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Easy way to test timing
  userid:      PMICHAUD (Patrick Michaud)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Time::HiRes

  rationale:

    This module is designed to be an easier way to get a substantial
    amount of Time::HiRes data about your code. If I get bad results
    from dprof when profiling, I turn to Time::HiRes, but remembering
    [gettimeofday] and tv_interval is somewhat cumbersome, and tracking
    a bunch of timing variables is even more so.

    The namespace made sense to me due to the relationship to
    Time::HiRes, and I'm imagining that future releases might include
    more statistical info on timing inside of loops.

    It should be in the module list because it could be useful to
    anyone who's working on improving the performance of their perl
    code.

The resulting entry would be:
