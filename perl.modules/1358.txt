*	Multi-file Distribution Script for improving the project cycles of
both legacy and future perl code  

*	Not a module 

*	This is a multi-file project tool patterned after sdist which builds
a Makefile.PL for multiple perl scripts and modules, together with the
necessary files to make a distribution.  It can also take existing code and
package those scripts quickly.  It defines an easy way to add tests which
are a part of the source code for both scripts and modules. 

*	I worked with Randy Kobes over the last 6 months to use his "sdist"
script for a general project solution.  Overtime we have added enough to it,
that it can be a "multi-file generation script".  I would put it under the
same category, CPAN.  I updated the script to be self-testing in the
paradigm of Test.pm and Test::Harness -- it encourages the use of module
tests that are tied to the source code of the module.
