The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Large
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Large and giant text file performance reader
  userid:      MEWSOFT (Ahmed Amin Elsheshtawy احمد امين الششتاوى)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    http://www.mewsoft.com/forums/

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module solves the problem with reading large and huge text
    files in Perl. It is designed to read only block by block as needed.

    It does not load the whole file into memory, it only reads one
    block at a time and once the last sequential line reached, it reads
    the next block from the file and frees the previous block from
    memory, so at all times only one block of the file is kept in
    menory.

    For example if you are reading a 2GB file, once you start reading
    lines from the file, the module reads the first block from the file
    on disk, while you loop through the lines, when you reach the line
    at the end of the read block, the module delete this block from
    memory and read the next block from the file on disk and parses it
    to lines and so on.
