Hi everybody,

first of all, I want to thank you for your support.  I was very very
impressed on how developers drive CPAN.  I didn't expect such a smooth 
and seamless organization.  Thank you all.

I wrote you this email because I had an error with my first module 
upload.  There seems to be something wrong with my META.yml file.  If 
you could give me a hint or a link where to gain valuable information, 
I would much appreachiate it.

Thanks,
