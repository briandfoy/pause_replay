     why:

    I have been writing Perl and making "DarkPAN" modules for a fair
    while, especially for my employer, and have recently become more
    interested in properly packaging and sharing modules in
    distributions. I would like to have a try at contributing some of
    this work to CPAN.

    I have one relatively simple module I made on my own time called
    List::Filters, and another few I'm hoping my employer will allow me
    to open-source. One of these is a simple Perl client for New
    Zealand's road warnings system (NZTA TREIS).

    Here is List::Filters:

    <https://sanctum.geek.nz/cgit/List-Filters.git/tree/>

    It does something comparable to the existent List::Categorize. I
    have aimed to support older Perls as I'm interested in backwards
    compatibility.

    I am willing to put this up on PrePAN first for review if that is
    advised.

    Thanks for considering my application!
