I've written a module called Apache::NoParse which allows
server-side scripts such as those written in php, SSI, or CGI, to be
returned as source to WebDAV clients.  This is a successful attempt
to solve the issue noted at 
http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/install.html#problem.  I believe this
can be of great use to other web developers.
