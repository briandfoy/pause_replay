     why:

    In preparation for a scientific publication, I would like to
    contribute NEXPL (NEXUS Perl Library), an applications programming
    interface for the NEXUS file format of Maddison, et al [1]. NEXUS
    files are used in evolutionary analysis to represent character data
    (attributes of organisms, genes, proteins, etc) and phylogenetic
    trees. NEXPL provides an object-oriented interface to NEXUS data
    that includes 310 methods, each documented internally with POD.
    NEXPL is used in the Nexplorer server of Gopalan, et al. [2] as well
    as other projects.

    [1] Maddison, D.R., D.L. Swofford, and W.P. Maddison. 1997. NEXUS:
    an extendible file format for systematic information. Systematic
    Biology 46: 590-621.

    [2] Gopalan, V., W.G. Qiu, M.Z. Chen, and A. Stoltzfus. 2006.
    Nexplorer: phylogeny-based exploration of sequence family data.
    Bioinformatics 22: 120-121.
