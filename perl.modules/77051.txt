Subject: Naming a new module USB::Descriptor?

My day job has me manually creating descriptors for USB devices more =
often than I care to, so I've created a module for auto-generating said =
descriptors. The resulting object tree can then be output as a structure =
suitable for compiling, or assembling, into a device's firmware. Where =
in the namespace hierarchy should I put these objects?

For the moment I'm using USB::Descriptor::Device, =
USB::Descriptor::Interface and so on. Eventually I'll also have =
USB::HID::Descriptor::Device, etc. But, it seems there is no USB =
namespace in CPAN. I see that packages that represent, or interface =
with, specific devices live under Device::, and Device::USB in =
particular. However, that doesn't seem like a proper home for a module =
that deals with concepts at the specification level, as opposed to =
interacting with a particular connected device. That, and =
Device::USB::Descriptor::Device seems a little silly.

Suggestions? Thoughts? Any problems with me creating a top level USB =
namespace?
