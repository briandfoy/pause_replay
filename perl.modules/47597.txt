     why:

    I have several pieces of software including modules that fall into
    the following categroies: Bioinformatics (Perl/Tk interface
    components (including 3D wireframe and HTMLish browser); proteomics
    systems integration; statistical analysis) Music (a module that
    works out the name of a chord when given some notes;
    Tk::MusicSheet... already in the forums but only in planning stage
    at the moment!) Webdeign (a few colour/style-sheet helper
    modules/programs) Misc. (things like... a LZW-like compression
    algorithm than outputs ascii (good for databases... leaves 1 copy of
    each word so the field is still searchable without decompression), a
    few very complex encryption algorithms that output in ascii (again,
    nice for databases because I can upload my DB files to a different
    locale and they still decrypt properly), etc...) I'm always writing
    modules... it would be great to upload the final, tidied-up versions
    to CPAN for all to share.
