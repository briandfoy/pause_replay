This is the second sending of this message; I have not gotten response
back from the first.

I've recently created the first release of GnuPG::Interface, the successor
to my PGP::GPG::MessageProcessor, and am looking for approval.  I already
have an account on CPAN (FTOBIN).

Desired contribution: GnuPG::Interface

Description:

GnuPG::Interface is a heavily object-oriented interface to interacting
with the GNU Privacy Guard.  It also consists of a rich object-oriented
GnuPG key structure.

DLSI:	bdpO

44-char description:	OO interface to GNU Privacy Guard

I have discussed this module a little on the gnupg-users@gnupg.org mailing
list, but have mainly received input based on its predecessor,
PGP::GPG::MessageProcessor.  GnuPG::Interface is also a central module for
another program of mine, pgpenvelope.

Thank you for your time in advance.
