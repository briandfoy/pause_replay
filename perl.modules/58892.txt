The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OOP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Object Oriented Programming Class
  userid:      MILAN (Milan Adamovsky)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms

  similar:

  rationale:

    I would like to develop an API for OOP development that will
    automatically take care of many conventional concepts by way of
    simply throwing switches on and off (more or less) rather than
    having an in-depth knowledge of the concepts themselves. In other
    words, reap the benefits without all the hard work.

    I believe OOP is a great namespace to build on top of as it makes
    sense as a rootlevel namespace to be built and expanded on.

    Right now this module only supports constructor properties features
    but eventually it will have various features such as accessors,
    setters, methods dealing with inheritance, etc... all by way of a
    flexible API as I have begun.

    Right now this module allows a developer to specify what parameters
    a constructor is allowed to take and the developer can specify (or
    ignore) various behavior permissions for each individual property
    element or property group (i.e. hash). Everytime a user uses those
    properties they are checked against various rules enforcing (or not)
    encapsulation, manipulation rights, sizing, etc... So one can say
    for example: I want this property to be a hash that HAS to have a
    the following elements... just as one can say I want this property
    to be a hash that MAY have the following elements.... just as one
    can specify a mix of these two in an indefinite deep hierarchy of
    properties!

    Hopefully more people will see the benefits and I hope to get
    feedback to grow this into something we all can use to enhance our
    OOP development!
