The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::InHTML
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Get Text in HTML form for variouse formats
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  similar:
    Surprisingly not many, most are overly complex for such a simple
    task

  rationale:

    Transforms a string into HTML so that it is rendered in a browser
    and look like plain text but can be included in HTML safely.

    Similar to a <pre> tag in the sense that whitespace is preserved,
    but HTML is not rendered because it is HTML::Entities::encode()ed
    first.

    This is very useful for outputing raw text to web page that looks
    like plain text (IE an error message, a diff, etc) but without
    unwanted rendering, having to use <pre> tags (or CSS equiv), or loss
    of whitespace.

    my $text = <<'END_TEXT';

    Hello, My name is <Dan>.

    Have a super day!

    - Dan END_TEXT

    my $html = encode_plain( $text );

    $html is now:

    <br /> Hello,<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is &lt;Dan&gt;.<br /> <br
    /> Have a super day!<br /> <br /> &nbsp; - Dan<br />

    Also has automethod for syntax highlighting if available:

    my $hightlighted_source_in_html_format = encode_perl( $source_code
    );

    encode_diff, encode_[AUTOMETHOD]

The resulting entry would be:
