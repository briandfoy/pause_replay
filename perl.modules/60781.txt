Hi All,

I'd like to nominate José Castro (cog@cpan.org) as a new PAUSE admin. 

I just got back from the Portuguese Perl Workshop where José held a
CPAN hackathon. He went over his "José's Guide for Creating Perl
Modules", after which I helped several people register in PAUSE and
start their first modules. He hopes to run similar workshops for people
at other conferences, and I think it wold help him quite a bit to be
able to help people with PAUSE using admin powers. Even the act of
approving their account right away so they can log in and look around
was very valuable since it showed many people that it's really not all
that hard.

He told me that if accepted, he'd pay attention to modules@perl.org for
a bit to see how we work, then slowly integrate himself into the
process. He's a guy that I trust, and we haven't developed any new
blood recently. ;)
