     why:

    Some modules I wrote (and still write) - mostly things I couldn't
    find on CPAN, but which are pretty useful. I now have 2 modules to
    contribute, one to parse BBCode to html AND reverse it back to
    BBCode (very useful to speed up your website :-)) and the other one
    is a very simple small but very useful template system (couldn't
    find one already on CPAN -.-)
