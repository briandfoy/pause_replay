That makes sense. But what means "being indexed"?

In the case of App-Music-ChordPro, there is only one module that
is of public interest (e.g., findable via search). All other modules are
private helpers, so to speak.
However, one of these private modules contains documentation that is
referred to from the public module.

As I understand, "being indexed" means both findable and referrable. And
that is because a documentation link to another module is processed via the
index.

Is it possible to have a module that is referrable but not publicly
findable?
