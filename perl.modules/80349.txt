Hi all,

I found another email address of Tassilo's (see CC).

Tassilo, would you mind if I transfer maintenance for Inline::Lua to Rob?

On a related note, it would be great if you could log in to PAUSE to 
update your contact info. If, on the other hand, you don't want people 
to contact you about such matters, then I'd be both sad and glad to 
accept a blanket permission to hand off your modules to new homes as 
users speak up and try to get in touch.

Man, it's been a long time since we've exchanged email. That must've 
been in the early 2000s via clpm?

Best regards,
Steffen
