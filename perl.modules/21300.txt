The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chipcard::PCSC
  DSLIP:       RdhOg
  description: Access chipcard terminals using PCSC drivers
  userid:      WHOM (Wolfgang Hommel)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    MUSCLE (movement for the use of smart cards in a linux environments)
    mailing list (http://lists.musclecard.com/mailman/listinfo/muscle)

  similar:
    Chipcard::CTAPI

  rationale:

    Chipcard::PCSC supersedes PCSC::Lite, as it has been adapted to use
    the recently introduced official rootlevel namespace "Chipcard".

    Chipcard::PCSC allows the programmer to access smart card terminals
    based on the PCSC API, an industry standard with drivers available
    for almost any card terminal hardware.

    Comparing CTAPI (available for Perl in Chipcard::CTAPI) with PCSC
    in a nutshell one can say that CTAPI is more leightweight and
    popular in small projects, whereas PCSC tries to provide more
    transparency and often gets chosen for applications which primarily
    focus on chipcard communication.

    Whether CTAPI or PCSC should be used in a project fully depends on
    the project, but with both Chipcard::CTAPI and Chipcard::PCSC
    available, there's more than one way to do it, thus I'm requesting
    to have Chipcard::PCSC added to the module list.

  enteredby:   WHOM (Wolfgang Hommel)
  enteredon:   Sun May 25 08:50:12 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Chipcard::
::PCSC            RdhOg Access chipcard terminals using PCSC drivers WHOM
