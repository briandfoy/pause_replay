This would be a really cool module, but I think it needs a 
cooler name.  Ant probably needs to be in there, and Perl too.
If no one else has a good suggestion, I think Pant (only initial
caps) is okay.

I looked into Ant when I was researching Module::Release.  It
looked like a good industrial strength solution.  Is this a
new implementation or Perl bindings to the old one?  It would
be really cool if we could use the same configuration file
for the real Ant and the Perl version :)
