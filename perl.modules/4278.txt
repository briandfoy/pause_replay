Hi,

My group are planning a release of our new product, which is Yet
Another implementation of Perl embedded in HTML, with some
special extensions to Apache::Session to do extra persistence
and true sessioning.

We'd like to release it through CPAN as well as some other places.
So, I'm mailing to apply for a PAUSE id.

Name: Ben Evans
Email: bene@chiark.greenend.org.uk
Preferred UserId: BEVANS
Planned Contributions for 2001: Extensions to Apache::Session,
HTML Widget sets, Embedded Language (ADDER), Perl/XS interface
to SMPP, Perl/XS interface to some SWF tools, Vector Graphics.

None of this work has been discussed publicly yet - we plan to as
soon as the basic module set is in final beta / release.

Other contributing authors: Steve Purkis (SPURKIS), Dave Thorn, 
Simon Wistow (SIMONW), Andrew Simmons, Adam Cohen-Rose.

I hope this is enough information for you, please mail me
if not.

Thanks,

Ben
