The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Compress::LZW
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Pure perl implementation of LZW
  userid:      MHOWARD (Matthew Howard)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Compress::*, especially Compress::LZV1, Compress::LZF and
    Compress::Zlib.

  rationale:

    Since LZW will be free tommorow, and all. We have to rub it in the
    faces at UNiSYS!! Other than that, it's a strong compression
    algorithm that has lots of potential with light overhead. Also, it
    provides the same interface as most other Compress::* modules,
    promoting choice between them. The implementation itself is
    well-written, just needs some extra management built around it.

  enteredby:   MHOWARD (Matthew Howard)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun 19 18:02:21 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Compress::
::LZW             adpfp Pure perl implementation of LZW              MHOWARD
