The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Stag
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Recursively nested tag-vals; XML processing
  userid:      CMUNGALL (Chris Mungall)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://stag.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    I discussed this on module-authors; originally I was going for an
    XML:: namespace but it was decided that whilst this module was
    useful for XML processing, it works with only a subset of XML. I
    opted for the Data:: namespace since I find it useful as a complex
    data handling library

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Stag            bdphp Recursively nested tag-vals; XML processing  CMUNGALL
