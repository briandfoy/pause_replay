Planning to contribute:
	HTTP::Lite		http://www.thetoybox.org/perl/

	A lightweight implementation of HTTP/1.0 GET and POST.  This is an
alternative to LWP designed for use in CGI scripts and embedding within
other packages.  It is not an LWP replacement, and will never incorporate
the level of sophistication that LWP has acheived.  I wrote this module in
response to lengthy compile times and the large number dependancies
necessary for LWP.  I needed a way to install a single module rather than a
dozen or more.  This module was my answer.

HTTP::Lite     bdpO  Lightweight implementation of HTTP GET/POST  RHOOPER


Discussion in Public:

I only briefly discussed this openly with two people, who were both very
keen on the idea of a lightweight, fast-loading HTTP GET/POST interface for
PERL.

Prior to implementation, I scanned CPAN for a similar module, but was unable
to locate one.
