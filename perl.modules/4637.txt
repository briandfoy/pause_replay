Greetings,
  I wrote once previously, but am afraid that my message took a wrong turn and
ended up in the bit bucket.  I'm developing some modules which run only on the
MPE operating system, and I have two of them nearly ready to post.  The first
is MPE::QeditAccess which enables Perl to call the QeditAccess routine created
(and freely distributed) by Robelle Solutions Technology.  The second,
MPE::IMAGE, allows access to the IMAGE database instrinsics built into MPE.

Thanks,
Ted
