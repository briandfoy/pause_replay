As announced in my email of Tue 7 Dec 1999, which didn't attract any
followups:

Submitting for inclusion in the modules list (available from CPAN):

userid: MVERB


Package GDgraph

modid: GD::Graph
stat[dsli]: RdpO
Description - Generate charts using GD
chapterid: 18

GDGraph contains various modules in the GD::Graph name space to create
charts with GD. It is basically a (output format independent)
replacement for GIFgraph, which from now on is a mere wrapper around
GD::Graph. None of the modules need to be or should be independently
listed.


The package GDTextUtil 

stat[dsli]: RdpO
chapterid: 18

containing the modules

modid: GD::Text
Description: Handle text (dimensions) independent of font.
modid: GD::Text::Align
Description: Draw text aligned.
modid: GD::Text::Wrap
Description: Wrap long text between boundaries.

Cheers,
Martien
