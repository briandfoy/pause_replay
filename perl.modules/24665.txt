The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plugin::HashLoader
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: fold various formats into a simple hash
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    a little on tt mailing list

  similar:
    Template::Plugin::Datafile

  rationale:

    Template::Plugin::DataHash provides a simple way to turn conf
    files, gathered from your INCLUDE_PATH into a single hash ref (no
    support for non hashes). I walk the INCLUDE_PATH, tack on the
    filename onto the end of each directory and this gives me the
    full_path of the file I will check. If the file exists, I run all
    the regexes in $self->{extension} (going in the order specified in
    $self->{extension_order}), to see which $type of conf I have, and
    then look for either a load_$type method or $self->{load_$type} (a
    CODE ref) and run the appropriate method. Each load_$type method
    takes a refence to $self and the full_path of the file, and returns
    a hash ref.

    For example

    [% USE conf = DataHash %] [% hash = conf.conf('conf.yaml') %]

    Would walk your INCLUDE_PATH in reverse, change all the conf.yaml
    files it finds into hash refs and fold all the hash ref into a main
    hash.

    Thanks, Earl
