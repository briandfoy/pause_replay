Subject: Advice on naming some Macintosh file parsing modules

From: wiml@hhhh.org (Wim Lewis)

I'm thinking of packaging up one of my modules for release, and I'm  
looking for advice on what its name should be.

It reads & writes the window/desktop settings files that the  
Macintosh Finder uses (.DS_Store). I'm thinking of a name like  
Mac::Finder::DSStore. There is also a MacOSX:: hierarchy, which would  
be a reasonable place since I think the pre-OSX finder stored this  
information in a different way. But MacOSX:: is nearly empty (only  
two modules), so if I were looking for this module I'd probably  
expect to find it under Mac::.

One part of the module is a somewhat generic "buddy allocator"[1] for  
allocating variable-sized relocatable blocks of data in the file.  
This could become independently useful, so although I'm not planning  
to release it independently right now, I'd like to give it an  
independent name, perhaps File::BuddyAllocator. On the other hand,  
File:: mostly contains modules for manipulating files as a whole, not  
for manipulating the contents of files.

Thoughts?

Wim.
