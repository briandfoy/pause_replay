     why:

    For now, I'm interested in sending an abstract Persistence
    framework similar to ``Persistent''--but with support for table
    relationships. It also has a different notation from Persistent. I
    had originally intended to extend ``Persistent'' itself, but I was
    never able to contact Winters to make suggestions and I'm not sure
    some of them would fit well into his API.

    I have a couple other Perl-centric projects (a mod_perl app and a
    Tk app) that I am also working on, but I don't know that I would be
    submitting those to CPAN anytime soon, if ever.
