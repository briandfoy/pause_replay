Subject: Module submission Date::MSD

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::MSD
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: conversion between flavours of Mars Sol Date
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Just like the Julian Date and related systems used on Earth, there
    are day count systems used for Mars. There's more than one of them,
    but fortunately not as many as Earth has. This module performs
    conversions between them.

    The "MSD" in the module name refers to the Mars Sol Date, which is
    the foremost day count system for Mars.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Sat Feb 17 10:31:44 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::MSD             Rdpfp conversion between flavours of Mars Sol Date ZEFRAM
