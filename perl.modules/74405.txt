The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Input
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: A simple drop-in substitute for <STDIN> that
  userid:      REEDFISH (Brian Kelly)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Term::TransKeys

  rationale:

    I needed a ridiculously simple function that behaved exactly like
    $input=<STDIN> in scripts, that captured user input and and
    populated a variable with a resulting string. BUT - I also wanted to
    use other KEYS like F1 and DELETE and the RIGHT ARROW and have them
    captured and returned. So I really wanted this:

    my $prompt='PROMPT : '; ($input,$key)=input($prompt);

    ... where I could test the variable '$key' for the key that was
    used to terminate the input. That way I could use the arrow keys to
    scroll a menu for instance.

    I looked through the CPAN, and could not find something this simple
    and straight-forward. So I wrote it. Enjoy.

    NOTE: Backspace is not captured - but used to backspace. DELETE is
    captured. Also, no Control combinations are captured - just the
    non-standard keys F1-F12, INSERT, DELETE, ESCAPE, HOME, PGDOWN,
    PGUP, END and the ARROW KEYS.

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::Input           Rdpfg A simple drop-in substitute for <STDIN> that REEDFISH
