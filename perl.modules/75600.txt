The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::OpenSRS::Email_APP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: OpenSRS Email Services APP protocol
  userid:      MARKG (Mark Goldfinch)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    https://github.com/goldie80/Net-OpenSRS-Email_APP

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module implements the OpenSRS Email Services Account
    Provisioning Protocol as specified here:
    http://www.opensrs.com/docs/OpenSRS_APP_Dev_Guide.pdf

    This module permits OpenSRS resellers to provision/manage their
    customer's email services. It should be noted this is a different
    protocol to that implemented by Net::OpenSRS.

    OpenSRS releases a PHP package for communicating to OpenSRS Email
    APP. However in my opinion this module implements the protocol much
    closer to their own specification.

    My own employer is utilising this module to manage our own
    customer's mail services, and I hope this module will be useful to
    other Perl users.

    Cheers, Mark Goldfinch.
