Well, it's only a suspicion.  I was trying to figure out why  my 
directory (or a link to it) didn't appear in the Tk modules directory 
like pretty much everyone else who has created a Tk module, and I 
thought perhaps the directory might have been ignored  because of some 
glitch. 

Then again, I guess it could be because I didn't set something up 
properly. Any thoughts?  In retrospect, I guess it is a dumb reason to 
change the account name.
