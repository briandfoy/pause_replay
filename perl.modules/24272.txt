<b><i>"NEW Switch, Terminal Block, Power Supply, and Relay Catalogs"</i></b>
</h1></font>
</center>
<p>
Most ASI products, along with specifications, pricing, and delivery, are online at <a href="http://www.asi-ez.com">
www.asi-ez.com</a>. However, there are times when you would like a printed catalog that summarizes the products, 
gives you technical information, and lets you know what products are available. With this in mind, ASI has recently 
released 3 NEW catalogs that show all of our push button switches, selector switches, joysticks, control relays, IEC 
terminal blocks, power distribution blocks, signal conditioners, super compact relay modules, PLC interfaces, and 
compact, din-rail mounted power supplies.
<p>
You can request these catalogs on-line or call toll-free at 1-877-650-5160. The catalogs include:
