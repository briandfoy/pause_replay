Hi,

Here's my information as requested on the PAUSE registering page:

Mike Wong
mike_w3@pacbell.net
userid: "mikewong" would be great!

I've written an XS module that wraps John Seagull's Intel Pocket Concert
C API (with his express permission and cooperation).

I've called the module: MP3::Player::PktConcert, which as last I
checked, is unique in its namespace (mostly because it's three levels
deep). I plan to wrap John's Nomad library at some point as well, so the
MP3::Player tree will grow.

I've also written GPIB::Sicl and GPIB::Visa modules, but am requesting
permission to release those modules under Artistic License from my
manager. They're modules which use the HP Sicl and NI Visa libraries to
control instruments such as oscilliscopes and (in my case) spectrum
analyzers.

I also plan on writing a GPS::Navman module, which handles the USB GPS
sold by Rand McNally, but that's still in the works. More recently, I've
started on writing an AI::Pathing::Floodfill wrapper to a C
implementation of a Dijkstra's shortest path variant.

- m.
