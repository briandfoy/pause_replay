"Procmail" as part of the name is to indicate the very comparible
application.  I have plans to support procmailrc files as well, probably
using Mail::Procmailrc.  Then it simply is procmail++

By using this name, I hope to attract more people into reading where this
module is all about.

There is already a Mail::Procmail (from Johan Vromans) which is a
procmail implementation as usual.  Besides, the "Mail::Box" in the
name is to explicitly state that it uses the Mail::Box library.  I do
not want to distribute this software as integral part of the library,
because it would grow even larger than it already is (>100 modules)
But in many ways, like in the HTML documentation, they will be published
as one.
