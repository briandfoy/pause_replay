Yes, it's still something Andreas might want to look at. PAUSE is
supposed to support the three dot version numbers through version.pm,
but I'm not sure if the qv() thing causes problems. I recall in the
deep recesses of my mind that people have had to use some workarounds
for v-strings.

There's a fairly new page in PAUSE that I just discovered. It resets
what PAUSE thinks of the latest version of a module is (well, makes it
forget it, really). I haven't tried this before, but you might tell it
to forget the version for the current (non-3-dot) Tie::DxHash, then
upload again. The indexer should pick up the new version and use that
in the new sequence.

If something breaks, let us know.
