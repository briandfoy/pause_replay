Hi There,

I have written a Perl module that i would like to upload to CPAN, to do
this i need to register, here are my details:

Name: Stephen John Quinney
Email: sjq-perl@jadevine.org.uk
Homepage: http://www.jadevine.org.uk
User-ID: SJQUINNEY

Description of the module i would like to upload:

Astro::IRAF::CL (version 0.1)

URL: http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/~sjq/Astro-IRAF-CL-0.1.tar.gz

This is a Perl module that provides an object-orientated interface to the
IRAF CL interactive session, it is built on top of the Perl Expect module.
You can script almost anything through this module that you can do in a
normal interactive CL session.

This module provides several improved, and more Perl-like, interfaces to=20
various IRAF systems, such as session variables, the management of
loading/unloading IRAF packages and the session history. It also provides
the ability to specify maximum run times for commands, and the clean
handling of these time outs and other types of errors and exceptions. All
functions are called in an object-orientated fashion allowing several
concurrent interpreter sessions if desired.

IRAF is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, a general purpose
software system for the reduction and analysis of astronomical data. See
http://iraf.noao.edu for more details.

This module is available under the GPL.

Although i have given this a low version number for public release it has
been used extensively in my data reduction systems for the last 3 years
and has evolved into a stable and powerful system for Perl scripting of
IRAF data reduction systems.

I am proposing to create the IRAF sub-section within the Astro namespace
as with such an extensive system as IRAF i can foresee other people
wanting to upload their own IRAF modules in the future, possibly built on
top of this generic module.=20

Any comments or suggestions are very welcome, thanks

Stephen Quinney
