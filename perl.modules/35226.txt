The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Find::Closures
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: ready-made \&wanted functions for File::Find
  userid:      BDFOY (brian d foy)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Finder

  rationale:

    Every time I use File::Find, I have to remember how to write a
    \&wanted function for it.

    So, how about some code re-use? File::Find::Closures is a library
    of subroutines to give to Find::Find::find(). Each thing in
    File::Find::Closures supplies a closure to use with
    File::Find::find() and another closure to access the results.

    Randal has File::Finder which is the same idea (make two closures),
    but you still have to build up the finder closure. I hide all of
    that behind a function name.

  enteredon:   Tue Sep 28 18:10:18 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Find::
::Closures        cdpfp ready-made \&wanted functions for File::Find BDFOY
