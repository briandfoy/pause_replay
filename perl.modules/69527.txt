I'm not really sure what sort of answer you'd like. Is it something
like "The HTML namespace contains thinks related to HTML?". It's not a
very useful answer because for the good names, the top-level is what we
expect to be under it.

There's not a general concrete answer to what a good name for a
particular module is. Our best advice is our naming guideline:
