Log into pause.perl.org using your CPAN ID and password. Then select 
View Permissions. It should list your four modules as "first-come" 
unless you registered them via the modules list. In that case, they 
would be listed as "modulelist". To "own" a namespace, you only have to 
be the first to upload a module that uses it. Registering it is a good 
idea, but not necessary.

Now, to grant co-maintainer status to somebody else, select "Change 
Permissions" and then 3.1 -> Make somebody else Co-Maintainer. Select 
the module(s), enter a CPAN user id to give maintainership status and 
hit "Make Co-Maintainer".

Oh, and don't *give up* maintainership status unless you have granted 
somebody else ownership.

If you would like to give up maintainership altogether, use option 2.1.

Hope this helps,
Steffen
