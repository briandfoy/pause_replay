The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::SecSess
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Secure multihost, multiDNS login sessions
  userid:      PLIAM (John Pliam)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.announce

  similar:
    Apache::AuthCookie Apache::AuthCookieURL

  rationale:

    Most Apache authentication systems use names like
    Apache-Auth<MECH>, where <MECH> is the underlying mechanism to carry
    identifying data: Cookie, Ticket (which uses AuthCookie), CookieURL
    which modifies AuthCookie source code.

    For me the mechanism cannot be part of the name, because by its
    very design this package was meant to support multiple mechanisms,
    and it currently supports cookies and URL's, both interoperability
    and independently.

    My credentials are more highly structured than the others for
    security reasons which become relevant in a large DNS domain. Yet I
    cannot simply subclass other packages because a large part of the
    security protocol involves careful handling of multiple cookies,
    parsing them and making certain decisions based on internal proofs
    of authenticity (of the cookie itself -- not just of its owner). The
    code of Apache::AuthCookie::recognize_user($$) makes it clear that
    this package was designed for single cookies, and thus cannot be
    used.

    The name Apache::SecSess::* is short for Apache::SecureSession.
    Since my class hierarchy is 3 deep (not counting Apache), a short
    name is highly desirable.

    Further justification is contained in README, man pages ...

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
