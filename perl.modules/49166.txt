Well, as I mentioned, I'm not sure everything under one place is right.

There's a few things there that are obviously part of Business::, some 
that would fit into Politics:: right (like Politics::US::LegisTrack).

And the rest probably don't belong in either...

Community::Registration perhaps?

I think it's worth putting the obvious ones into the most-correct places 
and then looking at the remaining ones on a case by case basis.

As for the spelling, unfortunately for me software APIs generally _are_ 
done in American spelling. So Organize:: would be the "correct" name in 
that sense, it's just that the rest of us aren't going to like using it :)
