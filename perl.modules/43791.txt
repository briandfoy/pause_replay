Hi,
Last week we sent out listing notices for the new script listings in
our index, and have been overwhelmed with the response.  I am sending
this follow-up note just to say thank you for the tremendous response,
and for all of the votes of support!  We did not expect this warm of a
welcome from the script community on the first go around.  A hearty
thank you to all who responded.

As your resource is listed in our search engine, you will be
interested to know that next month we begin a very large marketing
push both online and in several trade journals, and have a 5 minute
video segment that will air on CNBC towards the end of next month.  We
have already picked up American express, and Discover card as
quarterly advertisers, and have retained Alaska airlines and a few
other majors for next quarter, so look for big improvements to our
service on the backs of the big advertisers!

If you have not already done so, it would be a good idea to take the
time to check your listings in our index before our big marketing push
next month.  We did our best, but I am sure that everyone would like
the chance to tweak things before next month.

Once again, To do this:

1.Navigate to www.scriptworm.com, and register for a complimentary
account.
2.Using the search function, lookup your listings and add your own new
version each listing already in our index.
3.If you can't find your listing, don't worry, Once you add 1 listing,
our content team will insure that there are no listings in our index
for your web site (URL) that you do not control. When you submit your
new listings for approval, our review team will delete the old
duplicates in our index.

IMPORTANT:
make sure to be as complete as possible in your listing. Include 10-12
keywords in the keywords field (separate keywords by comas) as these
items are used in the headers of your listing detail pages and get
crawled by Google and the other major search engines every few days
giving you greater exposure.

OPTIONAL BUT WORTHWHILE:
There is no limit to the number of listings you may have. Please feel
free to add listings in any category you feel is appropriate, and for
as many products or services as you offer. 

Basic listings are offered at no charge.

Many thanks again for the warm reception,
Jonathan Wilson.
