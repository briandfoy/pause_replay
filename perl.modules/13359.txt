I plan to contribute two modules:

XML::NestArray

for dealing with xml and sax events as simple nested arrays / trees, along
with methods for querying and manipulating these arrays. Uses a simplified
subset of XML - attributes are treated as elements. Lisp influenced.

DBIx::DbWhiz

general database utilities - uses the former
