I'm sorry, the Tuits shortage is entirely my own fault, I'm back for a
few days. I'm trying to get something done.

Out of curiosity: why?

I see nothing grossly wrong with Geography::States and am going to
register it now in the module list. Locale:: on the other hand is
associated with what you can read in locale.pm, a highly confusing and
incomplete standard that has nothing to do with states. I wouldn't
endorse a name change to Locale::

Maybe it helps to think about it as a failure tolerant system. Somehow
it works even if some key positions are vacant or dormant or just
sick. It produces unnecessary frustration, but at least it keeps
going. Thanks for caring.
