OK. (From what I hear I could imagine the XML people would have a hint
for you where to look)

I have no personal experience with any config module, I can only tell
that there are quite a bunch. I'd be pleased to see a document that
gives an overview about some or all of them.

See the archives of this registration list
(http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/): I have just
argued against having CONFIG all uppercase. If you consult the m
command in the CPAN shell, you get listed everything that has been
uploaded to CPAN, not only those we have included into the module
list.
