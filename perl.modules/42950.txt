The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::StreamNames
  DSLIP:       idcfp
  description: List stream names for a file on NTFS
  userid:      CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    So far as I can tell, there is no way in Perl of getting the names
    of streams associated with a file on NTFS. This module will address
    this. The term "streams" is overloaded, in this context it relates
    to a specific attribute of files from NTFS 5 (Win2k) which MS call
    "File Streams". File::Streams already exists, and does something
    totally different, and Win32::File::Streams would be confused with
    it (and Win32::File exists as a package). NTFS File Streams are
    really hidden file names associated with a base file name. I had
    considered Win32::NTFSFileStreamNames, but that was far too long.
    Win32::StreamNames seems reasonable.

  enteredby:   CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  enteredon:   Sat Aug 20 21:20:06 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::StreamNames     idcfp List stream names for a file on NTFS         CLIVE
