Alright, this seems to be fixed. Thanks for letting us know: That error =
meant that it was still trying to execute it as CGI (though there were 2 =
permission failures that were preventing it). Now both the backpan and =
cpan mirrors on cpantesters do not even know what CGI is, so you can =
download those scripts. Apache thinks they're text, and I'm not =
presently concerned about arguing with it, but I could force it to be a =
real "download" if anyone thinks that's better.
