Subject: Didn't receive failed tests mails

Version 0.06 of Text-Ngram failed the tests (done by four testers,
apparently).

I didn't receive any email with this information (found it out because
one of the testers used the RT to notify me).

I was used to receive emails when tests failed... is there something
wrong atm? :-\

Regards,

jac
