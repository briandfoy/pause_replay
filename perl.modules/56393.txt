Thanks for clearing that up and sorry for the error. I'm removing this
from the deletion list.

However, the module doesn't seem to be indexed correctly because the
"main" namespace has no implementation, but just a POD document. You can
see this by clicking on the namespace in the "registered Modules" list
on your search.cpan.org author site (/~cerney/). It links to nothing. I
suppose if you add a "package PDL::IO::HDF5; 1;" to that document (with
a .pm ending, of course), the indexer will happily find it. Whether
that's worthwhile or not is up to you, of course.

Best regards,
Steffen
