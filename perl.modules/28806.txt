     why:

    I am in the process of finishing off testing of an extension to
    POE::Component::IRC for writing IRC Services. I have discussed with
    Dennis Taylor (via email) the module namespace to use and have
    between us come up with POE::Component::IRC::Service This will be a
    wrapper for various modules for dealing with different IRCd
    implementations such as POE::Component::IRC::P10 for ircu type and
    POE::Component::IRC::Service::Hybrid for Hybrid etc.

    I have some POE::Filters that would go under POE::Filter::IRC::*
    and POE::Filter::CTCP::*

    Cheers.
