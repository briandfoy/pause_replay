From: rsaran@organox.com.br (Rogerio Saran)

Hi, my name is Rogerio Saran (to be exact, Rog&eacute;rio Saran). I want 
to register at CPAN to contribute with a few Perl modules, mostly 
related to http clients and automated web browsing.

The first one will be an add-on to HTTP::UserAgent, enabling it to use 
"libcurl" as its http client library.

My personal e-mail address is rsaran@csf.com.br and my preferred id at 
CPAN is RSARAN.
