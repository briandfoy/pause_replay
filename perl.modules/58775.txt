     why:

    I want to contribute a module called Tk::GridColumns. It's an
    alternative for modules like Tk::MListbox or Tk::Columns, which fill
    the needs in most cases, but for some projects I needed something
    simpler and I also needed the ability to have some "main"-columns,
    which will stretch if the Frame the widget is in provides more space
    then they'd need to display their column's values. That's why I
    wrote the module.

    PS: I'm from germany, so please forgive me my bad english.
