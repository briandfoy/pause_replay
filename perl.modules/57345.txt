Subject: I would like to adopt IO::CaptureOutput

To whom it may concern:

About a month ago, I emailed Simon Flack asking about patches to
IO::CaptureOutput and offering to help as a co-maintainer (see
forwarded message, below).  I followed up in early October to his
cpan.org address in case the email address on his search.cpan.org page
was no longer correct.  I have not received any reply to these
messages.

If anyone knows how to reach Simon more directly, please let me know
or forward this to him.

Barring a response from Simon to this email within a reasonable time
frame, I would like to petition the PAUSE admins to grant
co-maintainer status to me on IO::CaptureOutput for the purpose of
applying RT patches, putting out a dev release and -- after suitable
testing -- a production release.

Sincerely,
David Golden
(DAGOLDEN at cpan.org)

Dear Simon,

IO::CaptureOutput is a workhorse for me in CPAN::Reporter and other
modules I've written.  However, I've noticed several patches building
up in the RT queue to fix minor bugs here and there.  Do you have any
plans to apply them soon?  If not, would you be interested in a
co-maintainer to apply bug-fix patches and put out a new release?

(FWIW, I have a successful track record of careful co-maintainership
on Sub::Uplevel and File::chdir -- development releases first,
followed by full releases when changes are proved stable by CPAN
Testers.)

Regards,
David Golden
