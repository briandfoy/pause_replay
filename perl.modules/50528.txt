Actually, there will probably be some additional features as
I am not building the module for its own sake alone. I am
building a controll system to automate a formerly manual fixture
used to perform contamination tests on jet engine fuel nozzles.

I am starting with OO commands of the listed LabJack functions
as a base for what I shall write into the test stand control
script. Beyond those listed LabJack functions, whatever there
may be of general utility to the control script, all those
features I plan to incorporate into the module.

As for the name, I don't really care except that it be as
general and widely indicative as may be. My aim is to control
equipment with the LabJack, all manner of equipment, test
stands, mainly...inasmuch as I am a test engineer who also
programs...not a programmer who also does tests.

I picked ::Control toward that end as an initial proposal
because I had to put "something" in that place on the form.
Having received confirmation, though, I thought the name was
already approved. Am I mistaken?
