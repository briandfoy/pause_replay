Is this a general WSDL generator for all SOAP modules, or only those 
that use SOAP::Lite?

If it is SOAP::Lite specific, something like SOAP::Lite::WSDL might be 
more appropriate, unless SOAP::Lite is treated as a reserved namespace 
that others are not supposed to be adding modules.

But SOAP::WSDL::Generator doesn't seem too bad either.
