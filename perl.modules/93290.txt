Hi Mikhail,

Because of this it seems to me that you possibly lost interest in this =
module or maybe you're too busy and have no time to renew the module.

And then David, the author of XML::WBXML, replied:

And Jesse Vincent had owner permissions for the module, so I checked =
with him, and he was happy for it to be transferred.

So I have transferred ownership to you (Mikhail), and dropped Jesse=E2=80=99=
s permissions entirely, as requested.

Thanks for taking this on Mikhail.

Cheers,
Neil
