power regulators aren't the only sort of regulator though.  i think
you have to say something about power.

Device is the right top-level namespace.

what other sort of power devices are there?  i guess regulators
are different than batteries, but i can't think of other
examples.

is the Plasmatronic a product name or a company name?  that is,
does Plasmatronic completely identify the device, so is it like
calling every modem a 3Com?  if it is very specific, you might
get around the Regulator part of the name.
