Subject: Module submission RRD::Simple

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RRD::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Simple interface to RRD files using RRDs
  userid:      NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    IRC, talkers, livejournal communities

  similar:
    RRDTool::OO is similar, but is not designed specifically to be a
    simple interface to RRD as RRD::Simple. RRD::Simple also offers some
    additional functionality outside of RRDs + RRDTool:OO. RRD::Simple
    will try and fill the gaps where paramaters are not always known or
    provided.

  rationale:

    RRD::Simple has a spread of functionality, (graphing, db
    manipulation as well as data storage and retrieval) and as such
    doesn't immediately or obviously fit under any existing root
    namespace - or at least not intuitively. For this reason I think
    RRD:: as the root namespace fits best, and follows other RRD modules
    that have used the same. ::Simple is because it tries to be a very
    simple interface that is not overly complicated or confusing.

  enteredby:   NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  enteredon:   Wed May 24 13:22:42 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RRD::
::Simple          RdpOo Simple interface to RRD files using RRDs     NICOLAW
