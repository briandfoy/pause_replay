The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::DE::SpardaBank
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Check your SpardaBank accounts from Perl
  userid:      RMORIZ (Roland Moriz)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    no public discussions yet

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::BNPParisbas, Finance::Bank::Postbank_de / search for
    Finance::Bank on cpan

  rationale:

    Up until today all the Finance::Bank modules are only named after
    their supported Banking Corporation - not the Country. Especially in
    "Old Europe" there are several countries with a "Postbank" so it
    would be better to name the modules Finance::Bank::<ISO
    COUNTRY>::<INSTITUTE>.

    I would like to do that for my upcoming module that supports German
    SpardaBank because there is at least in Austria a same called bank
    without any technical relationship with the German one.

    It would be nice to have a naming standard for that Bank modules.

    regards, Roland

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::DE::
::SpardaBank      idpOp Check your SpardaBank accounts from Perl     RMORIZ
