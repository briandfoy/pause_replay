     why:

    Initially, I will be working with Elizabeth Mattijsen (user:
    elizabeth) to handle maintenance of one module I have been
    contributing much work to but that she does not have time to
    integrate changes into herself. I also am hoping to begin
    contributing to the Spread.pm module, as well as potentially adding
    several modules of my own that I have been using for personal work
    up to now.

    Up to now, I have worked directly with multiple CPAN authors to
    help patch bugs, expecially those regarding 64-bit
    compilation/build/compatibility issues.
