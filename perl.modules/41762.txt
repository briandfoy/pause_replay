The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Archive::Chm
  DSLIP:       RdhOp
  description: Access HTML Help (.chm) files.
  userid:      APALADE (Alexandru Palade)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Chm

  rationale:

    The only other module on CPAN offering .chm access is Domenico
    Delle Side's Text::Chm. We both worked on our modules in parallel
    but he finished his first. However, Archive::Chm is more complex,
    offers more options, better logging and error handling capabilities.
    It can basically do anything Text::Chm can, and more. I've talked to
    him and received his permission to use his code (one of the options
    in Archive::Chm is actually entirely taken from Text::Chm).

    HTML Help files are ITSS type archives so this module obviously
    belongs in the Archive namespace in my opinion. It offers access to
    an archive type that is otherwise unaccesible under non-Microsoft
    OS's.

  enteredby:   APALADE (Alexandru Palade)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul 19 10:38:28 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Archive::
::Chm             RdhOp Access HTML Help (.chm) files.               APALADE
