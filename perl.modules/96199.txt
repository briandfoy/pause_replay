Users making agreements with PAUSE admins about what can/can't be done with
their permissions and those being honoured has plenty of precedent, though.

Had I not got explicit agreement before transferring anything that all I
was doing was easing co-maint addition, I would absolutely not have gone
down this route.

So I don't believe that, no matter what the outcome, this sets nearly as
widespread a precedent as you seem to be worried about here.
