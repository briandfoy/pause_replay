Subject: Module submission SOAP::XML::Client

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAP::XML::Client
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Talk with SOAP/.net/web services easily
  userid:      LLAP (Leo Lapworth)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    London.pm IRC and tech meets and LPW and module list

  similar:
    SOAP::Lite is the complex version

  rationale:

    This module combines SOAP::Lite, SOAP::Data::Builder and
    XML::LibXML to make building a SOAP client very easy (it could be a
    pain before).

    Unfortunatly I can not use SOAP::Client as that is a part of
    SOAP::Lite which the module relies on.

    The reason for SOAP::XML::Client is that the default is to return
    an XML::LIbXML object, equally the input for the call is XML so this
    seems to fit.

    I will then put in a place holder for SOAP::Lite::Simple (which is
    the version currently on CPAN) making people migrate to the new
    namespace if it is approved.

    One of the reasons for this module is SOAP is _meant_ to have a
    standard interface, but as with all standards there are differences!
    - hence one call for DotNet and another for Generic - but the module
    means you don't have to worry about the details - just switch to the
    relevant one depending on the type of server you are talking to.

The resulting entry would be:

SOAP::XML::
::Client          MdpOp Talk with SOAP/.net/web services easily      LLAP
