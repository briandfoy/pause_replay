Hi, and thanks for mailing modules@perl.org. This is an automated 

response to your email. 



We get lots of mail, and sometimes it takes us a while to get to yours. 

Please be patient, we *will* try and respond as soon as we can gather 

enough tuits. 



In the meantime, here are some pointers which may help you find your 

answer, along with some hints for making your modules@perl.org 

experience easier. 



modules@perl.org has several roles: 



1. creating PAUSE accounts 

2. keeping the CPAN module list updated 

3. responding to enquiries about modules and especially module naming 



If you mailed us about getting a PAUSE account 

---------------------------------------------- 

It will probably be set up in the next few days. You will receive email 

notifying you when your account has been created. In the meantime, read 

the PAUSE documentation at: 

http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about 



If you mailed us to register a module namespace 

----------------------------------------------- 

This may take up to a week. If you haven't received email confirming 

your namespace registration by then, please poke us (gently). 



You can make it easier for us next time by using the namespace request 

form on PAUSE; this gives us your request in a standard format with 

links we can just click on to approve it. 



If we have problems or comments with your proposed namespace, we'll 

respond within a week with our opinions. Note that you can still upload 

a module before we approve the namespace -- it just won't appear in the 

official modules list, and we may ask you to change the name before 

we'll list it there. 



In the meantime, or for next time, we recommend you discuss your 

proposed namespace with any appropriate mailing lists or other fora of 

Perl developers. Some of these include: 



Places to post your ideas etc (general):
