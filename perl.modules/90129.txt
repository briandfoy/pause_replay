Hi Tobias

Nothing much to be done here. It just means Kartik beat you to it, re 
the case-insensitive name SDL::Cdrom/CDROM.

There are 2 things you can do:

o Change your SDL::CDROM to something like SDL::Device::*.

o Change your whole distro to SDL5::* or whatever.

The first one is what I would do.

I don't recommend asking or expecting Kartik to change his code, since:

o He was here first.

o Old copies of his code and yours could still cause a problem even if 
he or you changed the name of your modules by fiddling the case. Please 
don't do that.

Cheers
