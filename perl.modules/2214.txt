Hi folks.

A while ago I uploaded a module called IP::Address. Since then it has =
been used by quite a few people in different platforms. Since it has =
been tested by a few tens of persons I would like to add it to the =
module list.

Is this name acceptable or does a new name need to be figured out?

Regards.
