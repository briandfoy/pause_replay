The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SFTP::SftpServer
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Perl implementation of SFTP server subsystem
  userid:      SIMM (Simon Day)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::SFTP Net::SFTP::Server

  rationale:

    This module implements the server side of the SFTP protocol
    (without the encryption layer) it is designed to be used as a
    replacement to the sftp-server binary subsystem provided in many ssh
    distrobutions (eg openssh)

    It is related to Net::SFTP in that Net::SFTP implements the client
    side of this protocol.

    Net::SFTP::Server is another implementation of the protocol that
    was not available when I wrote this, Net::SFTP::SftpServer is
    currently being used and maintained in a commercial, mission
    critical deployment and has been thoroughly tested.

    The aim of this module is to provide a more secure and configurable
    sftp server than what is shipped by openssh by adding virtual chroot
    and per command permission options.

    As the module is to be loaded from a script the permissions options
    could be set on a per user basis with this being stored in LDAP or a
    database, this would be for any users for the module to implement -
    a simple sample script is provided

The resulting entry would be:

Net::SFTP::
