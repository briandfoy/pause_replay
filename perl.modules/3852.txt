PL_FILES isn't it. AFAIR, you need to define a subroutine that adds
the necessary lines to the Makefile. Something like

sub MY::postamble {
        return qq{
install::
        $(CP) foo /usr/local/etc/http-webtest/
        $(CP) bar /usr/local/etc/http-webtest/
};
}

Please consider using File::Spec instead of hardcoded slashes as
directory separators and be warned that the user really needs a chance
to decide if he considers /usr/local/etc/ being the right place. mysql
for example puts its databases there, nessus puts its configuration
there, and when I run

    mysqlshow nessus

I do get a very useless answer. Annoys me.
