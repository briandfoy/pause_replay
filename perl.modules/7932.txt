There is already a PDF:: and a Text::PDF:: namespace for working with
PDF files. Wouldn't it be clever to name the module PDF::ReportWriter
or some such?

You could, of course, keep a PDFREP.pm that cares for backwards
compatibility, but for the module list it would look much better to
put the module into an already existing namespace.
