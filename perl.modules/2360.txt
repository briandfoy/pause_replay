Hi Matt,

Thanks for this.  As you say it looks pretty clear from this.

I have now registered as a developer and have packaged up my updated 
version of the module.

One question to PAUSE team...

In the new README file that I have created, I have put the following, do you 
think this suitably recognises Stacy's contribution or do you have some other 
form of words:

"AUTHOR
    Anthony Peacock, a.peacock@chime.ucl.ac.uk (After July 2000)
    Stacy Lacy (original author)

COPYRIGHT

    Copyright (c) 1997 Stacy Lacy (original author).

    modify it under the same terms as Perl itself."
