My module, Tie::File, will be included in Perl 5.7.3 when it is released
(imminently) and I expect with 5.8 when that is released.

However, the CPAN module reports that Tie::File is registered to 
some guy named Andrew Wilcox who got the name a long time ago
and is now sitting on it.  Since my module exists and is in the core,
I think it would make sense for you to transfer ownership of the name to me.

I didn't know that the name was taken when I picked it, but I do think
that my proposed use is a lot more sensible than Andrew's.

Thanks.
