     why:

    Over the years I've noticed that documentation for certain modules
    can sometimes be improved in mostly minor ways, and occasionally
    code improvements too (usually minor, but sometimes I've had ideas
    for adding useful subroutines).

    I believe that getting an account set up on CPAN would be helpful
    to me for making contributions in a formalized way that is
    consistent with what other Perl developers expect, and could be a
    major step up from merely making suggestions.

    Thank you.
