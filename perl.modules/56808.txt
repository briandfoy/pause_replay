The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sendmail::M4::mail8
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: short program that uses Sendmail::M4::Mail8
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Sendmail::M4::Mail8 is purely a module and needs a program to wrap
    it.

    mail8 was used to test Mail8, and has user configuration options
    within the program, allowing end users to hand edit the program
    without fear of messing it up. The most important part being able to
    test all mail systems that should work or fail.

    Contains a few lines that where used here at celmorlauren, but will
    need changing for testing at other sites.

  enteredby:   CML (celmorlauren limited)
  enteredon:   Fri Sep 21 14:19:18 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sendmail::M4::
::mail8           bdpfp short program that uses Sendmail::M4::Mail8  CML
