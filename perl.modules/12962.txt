As the years go by more and more modules will be "processing XML files".
Putting them all under XML::* just isn't scalable. We're trying to keep
the XML::: namespace to only *very* low-level stuff now.

Since "Template Attribute Language" has a formal spec
    http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ZPT/TAL%20Specification%201.4
and perhaps multiple implementations,
    http://lists.webarch.co.uk/pipermail/petal/2002-July/000016.html
how about:

	TAL::Petal

Then any other TAL related modules have a natural home.
