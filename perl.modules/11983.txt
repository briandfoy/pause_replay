I've already looked to it.
First of all, there's a name convention,
that Module-Names starts (without special reasons) with capital letters.
Second, your module doesn't seem to be really artificial intelligent.

You try to calculate the inverse f^(-1)(y) for a given subroutine f(x).
It could be in AI if you would calculate with fuzzy methods, 
estimate the value like human do or so.

So it should be better under Math:: or Algorithm:: namespace.
(E.g. Math/Algoritm::InverseFunction::BinarySearch).
InverseFunction - that is it what your module try to do
(if I right understood).
BinarySearch is perhaps the best description like your algorithm works.
(In fact in the most cases (non-stetic && non-monotonic function) 
 your algorithm doesn't seem to work)

Of course, it could be wrong of me ;-)

Greetings,
Janek
