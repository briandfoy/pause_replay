The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Color::TupleEncode
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Encodes a tuple (vector) into a color.
  userid:      MARTINK (Martin Krzywinski)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)

  similar:
    Color::Mix Color::Scheme

  rationale:

    Color::TupleEncode implements a color mapping scheme that
    transforms 2- and 3-tuples into a color. The purpose of this kind of
    encoding is to transform a vector into a color that encodes
    meaningful (to the user) relationships between components.

    The 3-tuple encoding is due to Baran et al.

    Visualization of three-way comparisons of omics data Richard Baran

    Bioinformatics 2007, 8:72 doi:10.1186/1471-2105-8-72

    http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/72/abstract

    This scheme is useful in comparing three samples and is ideal for
    identifying the sample that has the most different value.

    The 2-tuple encoding, created by the author of the module, performs
    an analogous encoding, but for 2-tuples.

    The module makes it easy for the user to implement their own
    encoding scheme classes.

The resulting entry would be:
