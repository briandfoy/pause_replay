It's not exactly what I *chose*. It's the notation specified by Nachum and
Dershowitz in Calendrical Calculations.

Which is ICal (Well, almost). At which point, there's no reason to have Date::ISO
and Date::ICal, as they have identical behavior. Right? Of course, most
folks would agree that there's very little need for *most* of the Date::
hierarchy, but that's a different discussion! :-)

Sure, that's more "useful", but most of the Date:: modules that I have
produced are not, strictly speaking, aiming at being useful, but are
aiming at being implementations of a particular calendaring scheme, to
the best of my understanding. And although I have been encouraged to
have Date::ISO output different formats, I'm still rather torn on this,
since a re-reading of Nachum and Dershowitz confirms that I'm doing it
"correctly". I think that what I will probably end up doing is adding
another method to output a more "useful" format. Alternately, one can
just call the ->ical method to get the ical string, which is almost what
you have above (minus some punctuation).

% perl -MDate::ISO -le '$d=Date::ISO->new; print $d->ical;'
