Thanks for the link, and I apologize that it's taken me so
long to get back to you.

I'm not sure about the "Solver1" part of the name.  If you
are implementing parts of the GNU Scientific Library, maybe
the name should say that.  Even if you are only doing part
of it, maybe someone else could fill in the other bits.

I looked around for things that refer to "solver1" and didn't
find much.  Perhaps there is another name which might lead
people to your module?
