Subject: Module submission Logfile::Read
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Logfile::Read
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: Read log files, resume reads, rotated files
  userid:      JANPAZ (Jan Pazdziora)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    None

  similar:

  rationale:

    When reading log files, you only want to process the line once,
    while also be able to find new lines that were appended since the
    last read, and while also recovering (and not losing data) if the
    log file got rotated. This is what Logfile::Read attempts to do.

    I'm selecting chapter 23 as that's what the root Logfile module has
    but I believe 10 would be more appropriate.

  enteredby:   JANPAZ (Jan Pazdziora)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 13 21:46:18 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Logfile::
::Read            bdpO2 Read log files, resume reads, rotated files  JANPAZ
