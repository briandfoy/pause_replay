That's impossible due to a lack of resources. We are not a funded
institution.

That's sensible and good for the community. I wish everybody would see
it as you do.

Tk, Apache, and XML have their own module lists that are maintained
separately and discussed on the respective mailing lists.

Yes and no. Yes, it would be nice if this list would be available with
good advice on a 24/7 basis. No, you do not really need us, you really
need cooperation with fellow hackers and you need to get an approved
status in the long run (not immediately).

IANAL

You are not going to go to the small claims court with us, are you?
We've tried in the past to find wordings for what we believe the legal
basis of our doing is, but when we have reached the day at which we
need to write it down facing the judge's eye, we will need to let
lawyers find the proper wording and this process will be difficult
enough.

Informally we deal with it such that you do not own the namespace and
do not have the final say. We'll seek your advice on everything
related to "your" namespace, but other interests may need to be
balanced against yours and we will try to never be rude and always be
Salomonic. Sometimes this doesn't work out and then we do not sleep
well (or not at all), but more often it workes somehow, magically.

Good. Not only for us but also for others who visit the archives of
this list.

See above.

But you're free to do so anyway.

You're right:-) Yes, we could add something like, "but don't take our
words seriously because they really aren't true!", but wouldn't people
be upset then? There's no way out. We are an institution and we are
not an institution at the same time. If you know what I mean.

I'm pretty sure, it will always be annoying to somebody and you cannot
streamline out the annoyingness. All you can try is to minimize the
annoyingness. What I read in Kurt's words is that by making it easier
for clueless newbies, we'll have some trade-offs.

You have write access to the list. If we add the comfortable
read-per-mail access, we have nothing but an ordinary mailing list.
But we want a place to *work*. This is publically accessible, as to
make our decision making process visible to the community. But if we
start using it as an ordinary mailinglist, we will have to go
elsewhere to get our work done.

modules-authors@perl.org exists. All of us (I believe) are subscribed
there.

"Me too" (no sarcasm). I'd really like to see things progress. Your
thoughts are very welcome.
