The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::AutoBuild
  DSLIP:       MmpOg
  description: Build automation framework
  userid:      DANBERR (Daniel P. Berrangé)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://autobuild.org/

  similar:

  rationale:

    Test::AutoBuild provides a framework for creating build and test
    automation systems. The base module distribution provides a general
    purpose build engine suitable for doing applications builds directly
    from SCM repo checkouts. Unlike many automated build systems it has
    ability to do chained builds, automatically of a large set of
    modules based on their declared dependancies. The build workflow
    engine is heavily modularized allowing customization & extension of
    the workflow process through writing new Perl modules. This allows
    the framework to be re-purposed as needed to accomplish a variety of
    build & test automation tasks.

    Since this is a tool primarily aimed at automated the software
    build & test process, Test::AutoBuild was the natural choice of name
    and not previously used by any other applications.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
