Hi

Today I uploaded a new version of Tie::DxHash and, in doing so, changed from a two to a three digit versioning scheme (0.93 => 1.0.0).
The relevant line in my module is as follows:

    use version; our $VERSION = qv('1.0.0');

The PAUSE namespace indexer does not recognise this, reports the version as HASH and states that the module cannot be indexed
because the previous version has a higher version number.

I switched to using extended version numbers as this is the style recommended in Perl Best Practices.  Am I doing something wrong
or is the problem just that PAUSE does not recognise extended version numbers?  If the latter, I suppose that the best course
is to release a new version of 1.01.

Many thanks for your help.  I have included the upload report below.

Regards
Kevin
