The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Reshape
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Reshape blocks of text
  userid:      PBARLOW (Pete Barlow)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Wrap Text::Format

  rationale:

    Functionality extracted from application designed to present song
    lyrics/poetry using LCD projector. Objective is to use the largest
    possible font size to enable readability. Splits text lines
    approximately in half but tries to split at a punctuation point if
    possible. Splits a verse (a set of lines) approximately in half but
    again at a punctuation point if possible. The idea being to reduce
    the number of words displayed in both vertical and horizontal
    directions but without introducing breaks at inappropriate points.

    So for example:

    Let us go then, you and I When the evening is spread out against
    the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through
    certain half-deserted streets,

    becomes (with suitable centering)

    Let us go then, you and I When the evening is spread out against
    the sky

    Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go through certain
    half-deserted streets,

    The exist wrap/split/format modules are pitched around text
    justification for normal text and not poetry/song lyrics. In
    particular with poetry and song lyrics while it is ok(ish) to add
    additional line breaks all existing breaks must be honoured.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
