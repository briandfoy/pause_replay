Hmm, well any kind of device can use Bluetooth (USB adapater, PDA,  etc).
Bluetooth I guess is really just a specification/protocol that is used  to
communicate between devices, and that other protocols are built on top  
of (L2CAP, RFCOMM).
 
The module I am almost ready to upload, contains an API that allows you  to
discover local Bluetooth devices (what USB adapter you are using, etc), to  
search for remote Bluetooth devices that are in range, to discover what 
services  the remote devices have available, and to connect to them via RFCOMM or 
L2CAP so  you can send or receive data.
 
This is all independent of the device as long as it is Bluetooth enabled,  so
I am guessing the Net:: namespace might make the most sense, but what do  you
think after reading what the module will support?
 
Cheers,
Ian
