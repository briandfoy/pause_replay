Hello,

This is a friendly wake-up message. I posted the message below some weeks ago,
but got no response yet. That must have been because of the holidays. Everyone
was/is out ofcourse. Did _you_ have a good time? I hope so :-) BTW, this
message is slightly modified from the original. This message is also posted on
clp.misc and clp.modules.

The best way to introduce the module is by displaying the README.
Below the README you'll find my actual questions.


======================== BEGIN README ============================


CGI::Tabs version 1.0
=====================

DESCRIPTION

CGI::Tabs lets you simulate tab widgets in HTML. You could benefit
from tabs if you want to serve only one page. Depending on the tab
selected you fetch and display the underlying data. There are two
main reasons for taking this approach:

1. For the end user not to be directed to YAL or YAP (yet another
link, / yet another page), but keep it all together: The single point
of entry paradigm.

2. For the Perl hacker to generate and display multiple data sources
within the same script environment.

The nice thing about CGI::Tabs is that the tabs now their internal
state. So you can ask a tab for instance which tab page is
highlighted. This way you get direct feedback on what the user
clicked.



EXAMPLES

      __________      __________      ____________	_______
     / Software \    / Hardware \    / Lease Cars \    / Xerox \
 -------------------------------------------------------------------


      __________________      _________      ___________
     / Personal Details \    / Pension \    / Insurance \
 ----------------------------------------------------------


These trivial examples could be used in for instance a maintenance
application or a human resources application.



DEPENDENCIES

- CGI, CGI::Minimal or another CGI "object broker"
  with the param() method and with similar behaviour
- HTML::Entities
- URI
- A CSS style sheet for the tabs markup
