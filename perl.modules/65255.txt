Hi,

Not sure if you folks are aware, but sadly Ivor Williams (IVORW) passed
away recently [1]. 

[1] http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=752315

As I currently use a couple of his distributions on CPAN, I'd like to
offer myself as maintainer of them, unless anyone else has already put
in a request for them. The distributions in particular are:

* http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Plugin-WikiFormat
* http://search.cpan.org/dist/VCS-Lite

Thanks,
Barbie.
