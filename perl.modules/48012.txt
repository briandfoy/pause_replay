If I've come to the wrong place, please re-direct me...

Is the module "Mail::IMAPClient" actively maintained?

You'll see from RT 17056 and 17293 that I'm trying to contact David J.
Kernen (whom I understand to be its custodian) without much luck.  And
there doesn't seem to be much response (or am I mis-reading?) to the
module's discussion board:
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Mail-IMAPClient

Response seems to have been dormant for around two years or more, yet
there are still people logging issues.

I have no real desire to adopt the module, but I am keen to see one
particular problem addressed.

Ideally, I'd find that Mr Kernen is still the active maintainer.  Failing
that, it would be good if someone else could be found who was eager to
maintain it.  Failing even that, I could investigate whether I could adopt
it myself.

What should I do next?

Thanks in advance.
