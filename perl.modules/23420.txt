The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::BeepLite
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: lightweight BEEP framework
  userid:      DBLACKA (David Blacka)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    iris@lists.verisignlabs.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a BEEP protocol framework (RFC 3080, 3081), and, as such,
    it is a bit like other internet protocol frameworks (Net::FTP,
    Net::DNS, etc.).

    It is named BeepLite because it is a lighter-weight implementation
    of BEEP than exists in other languages. It does not support the
    (often) complex threading models that other BEEP implementations
    have. Because of this, it does not directly support some of the use
    cases that BEEP is known to handle (specifically highly-multiplexed
    or peer-to-peer appliations).

    As far as I could tell, there are no other Perl BEEP
    implementations of any sort.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::BeepLite        bdpOl lightweight BEEP framework                   DBLACKA
