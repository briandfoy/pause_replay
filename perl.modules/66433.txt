The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plugin::WikiCreole
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Template filter that wraps Text::WikiCreole
  userid:      MARTINELL (Martin Andrew Ellis)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Discussed with Andy Wardley (ABW) and with developers in person

  similar:
    Template::Plugin::WikiFormat - Simple basic wiki language filter.
    Text::WikiCreole - The module that does the actual conversion from
    Creole to HTML

  rationale:

    Creole is fast becoming the standard Wiki format, at least there is
    push for this.

    The ability transform Creole mark up into HTML inside template
    toolkit via filter allows developers to use Template ToolKit as the
    basis for Wiki software without having to pass pre-rendered HTML.
    That is, the Template file becomes responsible for the entire
    rendered document.

    Further I have creating a simple static web site for my wife. To
    get constancy of style each page is rendered though a template using
    ttree.

    By employing this WikiCreole filter am able to express the content
    in Wiki markup plus a little template mark up, separately from the
    page layout.

    I found this very fast way to do my work and gets consistent
    results.

    Template::Plugin::WikiFormat was a start and made good proof of
    concept but lack too many features to be useful.
