Subject: Module submission Splunk::API

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Splunk::API
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl client library for the Splunk REST API
  userid:      PFIG (Pedro Figueiredo)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/splunk-labs), Git repo
    at Github (currently unde the name Log::Splunk, which I think is
    inaccurate and want to change):
    http://github.com/pfig/log--splunk/tree/master

  similar:

  rationale:

    I initially named this set of modules Log::Splunk, as Splunk is
    used to aggregate and search through log files. Then I realised that
    all the Log::* modules did logging, so Log::Splunk was inaccurate,
    hence the name change to Splunk::API.

    Splunk officially supports a Python interface, and have only
    published a very basic Perl script as an example of a search. I
    think that a proper Perl library is very much needed, not only
    because it's my programming language of choice :) but also due to
    the use of Perl in systems administration.

    I have announced my efforts on the splunk-labs Google group, and
    have exchanged a couple of emails with the developers in charge of
    Splunk's API, and they've shown to be very supportive.

The resulting entry would be:

Splunk::
