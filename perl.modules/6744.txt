The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GSM::SMS
  DSLIP:       Rmpha
  description: Modules for sending and receiving SMS.
  userid:      JOHANVDB (Johan Van den Brande)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.tektonica.com/projects/gsmsms/

  similar:
    NET::SMS ( ? )

  rationale:

    One thing Perl was missing was connectivity to SMS. As GSM is a
    global standard for wireless communication and SMS is a subset of
    GSM, I think it is reasonable to use GSM::SMS as a prefix. GSM is
    not going to get away very soon, GPRS for example is also a GSM
    standard. The usage of the GSM 'toplevel' module space, will allow
    for modules like GSM::ATCellular ( interprets AT command set for
    cellular phones), GSM::SMS etc...

    If we look at the availability for Smart Messaging API's, there is
    none for Perl, the rest are commercial or not for Perl. My approach
    uses a 'vendor' independent one, I'm not linked to a certain web
    based SMS center, hence the Modem support. What I try to accomplish
    here is a generic API on which to build SMS support for Perl,
    independent of the transport used for the messages themselves ...

    Please have a look at this and let me know!

    kind regards,

    Johan Van den Brande
