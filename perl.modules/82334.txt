Subject: Module submission EAV

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EAV
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Entity-Attribute-Value database layer
  userid:      REVOLET (James Barton)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    #eav on irc.freenode.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    The EAV namespace will contain modules that provide a general
    implementation of the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) data model,
    providing a simple and unified interface to access data on several
    different types of storage backends.

    See
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model
    for information about EAV.

    The primary advantage of an EAV interface is that it only requires
    a simple, static schema when used with an RDBMS like MySQL or
    PostgreSQL. Other storage backends such as Riak and Redis are
    supported.

    Features of this EAV implementation include support for
    relationships between entities, even across different storage
    backends, optional data typing with validation, and unified
    indexing.

    EAV is not a general solution for every project, and is even an
    anti-pattern in many cases. It is, however, useful in some specific
    situations where flexibility in schema management and backend
    storage are more important than data structure and normalization.

    Reddit.com is a good example of a project that has benefited from
    using an EAV data model to help scale up operations and simplify
    database management.

    When I first learned about Reddit.com's use of an EAV model, I
    immediately searched CPAN for EAV and didn't find anything. I think
    it's likely other Perl developers have done the same thing, and so
    it might be useful to have a set of EAV modules available on CPAN.

    Thank you for your time and consideration.
