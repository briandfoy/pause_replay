Hi Bill, hi Shishir,

please have a look at

http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover

which describes our module adoption policy. Considering that Shishir 
hasn't been active in over a decade, I'm willing to give you 
co-maintenance permissions for the module more quickly than we usually 
do. In fact, I have just done that.

Shishir, if you object to this, please speak up. This is all reversible!

Best regards,
Steffen
