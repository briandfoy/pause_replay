Hi all!

I would like to request COMAINT on https://metacpan.org/release/Crypt-CFB by
https://metacpan.org/author/KJH . There hasn't been a release by KJH since =
Feb,
2011 (over 4 years ago).

My plans for it are:

1. Fix https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D85576 .

2. Create a Git/GitHub repository for it.

3. Modernise the synopsis code in https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::CFB (indi=
rect
object notation/etc.)

4. Convert test.pl to Test::More and modernise it.

5. Add tests for POD, trailing space, CPAN::Changes, etc.

6. Ongoing maintenance.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
