Done.

Just as a reference point, just in case for the next time: The "Repair
a Pending Upload" menu would have been useful in this situation for
you. You could have

1. told PAUSE to upload the broken file. PAUSE would have tried and
   refused because the file didn't uncompress. Then you would have

2. uploaded your file as, say, HTML-Template-replacement.tar.gz (any
   name would work). And then you would have

3. told PAUSE to take that other file instead of the broken
   incoming/HTML-Template-1.8.tar.gz.

Good night,
