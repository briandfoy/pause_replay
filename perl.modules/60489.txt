That seems to be the least of your features since almost every log
package does that. :)

If you're making a completely new logging system, you might look at
what Log::Dispatch and Log::Log4perl have done in separating out the
various features. I suppose Log::DWIW would just as good a name in that
case as anything else since it would really have no features until the
programmer loaded some sub-packages.

I think anything you do is going to end up being heavy, though.
