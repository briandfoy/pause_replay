The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fortran::F90Namelist
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Parse F90 namelists and re-export
  userid:      WDOBLER (Wolfgang Dobler)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Fortran::Namelist

  rationale:

    Parses F90 namelist files/strings into hash structure and allows
    re-exporting in different formats.

    We use this for a CFD code to import the input parameters of the
    Fortran code into the visualization software. Another application is
    verifying input files that are in namelist format and possibly even
    fixing them automagically if there are errors, attempts to set
    variables that have disappeared, etc.

    The existing, somewhat similar module Fortran::Namelist by Victor
    Santillan, has (as I understand it) the much narrower scope to add
    parameters or whole namelists to existing large namelist files. On
    the other hand, it is vastly more efficient compared to my module
    (think 0.5 sec vs. 1 min for the large files Victor is interested
    in; yes, I am working on profiling and optimization...).

    We are aiming at consolidating the situation, but both modules will
    likely (peacfully) co-exist for quite some time.

The resulting entry would be:

Fortran::
