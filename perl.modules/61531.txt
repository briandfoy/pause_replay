Subject: Module submission App::ZofCMS
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::ZofCMS
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: small web-framework/templating system
  userid:      ZOFFIX (Zoffix Znet)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    IRC (#perl on irc.freenode.net)

  similar:
    Catalyst

  rationale:

    The module, or rather a distribution, provides a person a small
    web-framework/templating system, Content Management System (hence
    the CMS in the name). Since the final product is more of an
    application the App:: namespace was my choice.

    The goal of App::ZofCMS is to be easily deployable on very limited
    servers, e.g. servers which do not allow you to install perl modules
    directly from CPAN, do not have ssh access and even do not have any
    SQL databases.

    Catalyst is also a great framework but I find it very hard to
    install even on servers which offer installation of some modules
    directly from CPAN.. the main reason why I created App::ZofCMS.

    App::ZofCMS has plugin support, thus additional functionality will
    be released under App::ZofCMS::Plugin::

    Feel free to inquire for more information.

    Thanks.
