The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::TableHash
  DSLIP:       MnpOp
  description: Hash refs tied to full/partial SQL tables
  userid:      CHTHORMAN (Chris Thorman)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::Table, DBIx::Recordset

  rationale:

    This is a helper module for DBI, so it belongs in DBIx.

    It is similar to DBIx::Table in functionality, but has some other
    features, too and a different style of interface and usage.

    TableHash is most often used to create tied hash refs that connect
    to an entire table or subset of a table in an SQL database via DBI
    (currently only tested with mysql).

    The tied hashes can be used to add, update, retrieve, or delete
    either entire records OR individual fields from the live database
    using simple hash assignments.

    "copy" options can be used to simply get a non-tied, static hash in
    memory that is no longer tied to the database but required only one
    query to retrieve.

    The tied object also has a number of utility methods for
    constructing a few of the more common general-purpose SQL queries
    (using the same DBH handle owned by the object).

    It has some similarity to DBIx::Recordset but is less ambitious.

    However, it has several more-flexible options as well.

    It is designed for ease of sub-classing, and has been in production
    use on a major, high-availability Web site for many years.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
