I'm glad to help, in general modules@perl.org is the best place (CC'd)

No

No

Yes

There are so called mailing list accounts that have no login and hence
no upload right. Look around for APML on CPAN. This is the apache
mailing list. Each contributor has his own account for uploading, but
whenever a new namespace appears that is relevant for the group, the
creator passes the ownership to APML and all members of the group get
co-maintainership rights so that they can upload with their own
account.

Mailing list accounts are maintained by one or more members of the
group. Just tell us who that should be and I give those people the
role manually. There is no web interface for doing that yet because it
is rarely needed and I have not really thought about how to do it.

The whole mechanism is a bit cumbersome and not perfectly transparent
but at least we have seen that it does work for APML. Let me know if
you have suggestions for improvement or different needs.
