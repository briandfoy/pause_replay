     why:

    Mostly ham radio (amateur radio) related modules. I have been
    creating an increasing number of ham radio-related perl modules for
    my own use that I believe others might be able to use. Examples
    include callsign lookups, solar data lookups, APRS/findU lookups,
    emissions reference, radio related calculations, etc. I might have
    other miscellaneous contributions as well, as I often create modules
    for my own use that extend other modules found on cpan.
