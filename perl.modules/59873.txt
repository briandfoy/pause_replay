Subject: Module submission POE::Component::Client::opentick

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Client::opentick
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: POE component for real-time market data feed
  userid:      INFIDEL (Jason McManus)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    opentick community forums; Freenode IRC

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    This module suite provides a POE component for handling
    opentick.com's asynchronous market data feed in a POE-oriented,
    event-driven fashion. The official otFeed's Perl distribution is
    ridiculously outdated and uses Perl ithreads (eep!) to implement its
    asynchronous protocol support.

    It fits into the POE::Component::Client::opentick namespace, as it
    provides a client component within the POE environment.

    Despite Perl's recommended practice of using lowercase names
    exclusively for pragmas, I chose to keep the last portion lowercase
    to jive with the Look-and-Feel of opentick.com's logo and
    documentation. (note: I do not work there, and this is not a
    commercial project) I do not feel that this will be a significant
    source of confusion, due to it not being lowercased at the root
    level.

    It has already been uploaded into this namespace, and has a few
    users, before I became aware of this request form.

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Client::
::opentick        bdpOp POE component for real-time market data feed INFIDEL
