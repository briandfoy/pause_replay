The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Gzip
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: CGI with automatically compressed output
  userid:      CLOTHO (Chris Dolan)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Apache::Compress Apache::GzipChain

  rationale:

    Intended to be a drop-in replacement for CGI.pm, this module adds
    automatic Gzip filtering of CGI script output when the content-type
    would benefit and when the client browser indicates gzip support.
    This module is a subclass of CGI.pm and incorporates the
    functionality of IO::Zlib in a helper class.

    Similar functionality is often provided by the mod_gzip module for
    the Apache webserver as well as by the Apache::Compress and
    Apache::GzipChain modules. However, those are all strongly connected
    with the server configuration and are not controllable by individual
    scripts. CGI::Gzip works at the script level, thus may be more
    portable and more flexible (the latter because the programmer can
    choose to turn it off when compression may not be advantageous).

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::Gzip            adpOg CGI with automatically compressed output     CLOTHO
