<p>
Do you currently use control wiring terminal blocks? Do you have a project now or in the near future that could 
use a control wiring terminal block? Are you tired of paying high prices for quality terminal blocks such as Allen 
Bradley, Phoenix Contact or others when you know there must be a more cost-effective supplier?  If you answered yes 
to any of these questions, you owe it to yourself to check out the CBD series of terminal blocks from ASI.
<p>
We would like to have some summertime fun, increase business and show you that we can provide the best terminal 
block on the market at extremely good prices. That is why we are creating the <b>"Summertime CBD.2 Terminal Block 
Bonanza!"</b>
<p>
The CBD.2 is a 5.5 mm wide IEC terminal block that is UL rated for 20 to 12 AWG, 25 amps at 600 volts. This terminal 
block has amazing features that are comparable and surpass what you thought were the best screw clamp terminal blocks 
on the market. It features a full metal body construction, which others used until they had to find a way to reduce 
the cost of their products. The CBD.2 is made with nickel-plated copper alloy metal bodies, UL 94 V0 housings and 
comes with a wide variety of accessories.  If you do not think that it is the best terminal block that you have ever 
used, you can return them!
<p>
Check out these features:
