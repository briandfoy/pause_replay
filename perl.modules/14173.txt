Well, looking through the PAUSE mailing list archives, I see that there
already *was* a namespace for XML::OCS back in 2000 but it got removed or
something.  Then when I asked for that one it was created but I was
encouraged not to use it.

It honestly doesn't really matter to me where it's put, I'd just like to get
the module out there.

i know Tim Bunce said that we're trying to keep the XML namespace
free of XML applications, but there must be a better way than
creating new top-levels.  Perhaps something under XML::* could
hold all of the applications.  Any ideas, like...

   XML::App::*
