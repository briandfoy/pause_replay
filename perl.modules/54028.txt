Subject: Module submission Lingua::FR::Ladl

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::FR::Ladl
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Access to a French linguistic resource
  userid:      INGRIF (Ingrid Falk)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Ladl tables are a French linguistic resource describing
    syntactico-semantic properties of basic French sentences - this is
    the reason for Lingua::FR

    Part of them are available as a set of excel tables. They represent
    a very large scale, high precision, French linguistic resource,
    developed over several years by a group of skilled linguists and
    according to well defined linguistic criteria. But the information
    is difficult to access and not yet suited for automated processing.

    This is an attempt to share some work in this direction.

  enteredby:   INGRIF (Ingrid Falk)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 17 13:33:38 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::FR::
::Ladl            bdpOp Access to a French linguistic resource       INGRIF
