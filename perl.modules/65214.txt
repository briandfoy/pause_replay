Subject: module naming question

I've written a Perl module that I'd like to upload to CPAN. I'm reading all
the relevant docs, and have been admonished to check with whoever is on the
other end of this e-mail address about my naming decision.
The module is a wrapper for the REST web services exposed by the CiviCRM
application (http://www.civicrm.org/), an open-source CRM for the non-profit
sector written in PHP.

My module uses AUTOLOAD and an OO interface to let you call these web
services by doing things like:
$civicrm->contact_create( first_name => 'Wes', last_name => 'Morgan' );

I'm thinking of just calling this module "CiviCRM", but also wonder if
"CiviCRM::Client" or "CiviCRMClient" might not be a better choice.
Salesforce.com is another CRM tool and it's similar web service wrapper is
just called "Salesforce". It's here:
http://search.cpan.org/~bayside/Salesforce-0.57/lib/Salesforce.pm

So I'm leaning towards just "CiviCRM". What do you (all) think?
