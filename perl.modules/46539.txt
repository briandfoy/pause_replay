Subject: Module submission Test::CPAN

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::CPAN
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Test interaction with CPAN before uploading
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    cpan-discuss@perl.org, module-build-general@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Test::Distribution

  rationale:

    Test::CPAN fools CPAN into thinking it has downloaded and unpacked
    your package, then has it attempt to generate a C<Makefile> or
    C<Build> script. After this process completes, it asks your CPAN
    module what dependancies it thinks exist.

    If you just want to make sure your distribution is packaged in a
    way that is good for CPAN, consider using
    L<Test::Distribution|Test::Distribution> instead. The main time that
    C<Test::CPAN> is useful is when you depend on modules inside your
    C<Makefile.PL> or C<Build.PL> script and you want to make sure that
    you degrade gracefully if those modules are not available.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
