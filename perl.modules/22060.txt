The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::HTTPServer
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: HTTP Server  Lite - embedable or stand-alone
  userid:      REATMON (Ryan Eatmon)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    HTTP::Daemon

  rationale:

    I chose Net::HTTPServer to mimic Net::FTPServer. And because when I
    went looking for a module that did this, I first went to Net::HTTP*
    and didn't find anything except Net::HTTPTunnel.

    This is different from HTTP::Daemon in that HTTP::Daemon gives you
    a low level access to a web server. HTTPServer gives you a full web
    server that can serve files right out of the box, but is very light
    weight. It is meant to be used in several ways:

    1) embedded in another program that needs to serve files on the fly

    2) stand alone application that can serve up existsing
    documentation, and provide an internal search functionality to
    search that documentation

    3) Turn your CGI program into a stand alone program.

    and lots lots more possibilities.

    I didn't depend on HTTP::Daemon because to get that, you have to
    get ALL of the libwww modules and files. HTTPServer is a single
    file, and thus sticks with my light weight goal.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::HTTPServer      adpOl HTTP Server  Lite - embedable or stand-alone REATMON
