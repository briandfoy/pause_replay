Request to register new user

     why:

    I'm already BOWMANBS, but got that name when I owned the bowman.bs
    domain name in the Bahamas. They got pricey and so I'd like to
    change/migrate my pause id, if that's not too much trouble.

    I thought BSB was free, as there's no modules, but I see there is a
    user registered:

    http://search.cpan.org/~bsb/
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2009/03/msg65138.html

    Any hope I can have BSB? Or can get the details of the owner to
    ask?

    Thank you (even if it is too much trouble)
