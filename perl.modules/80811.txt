Brian,

Thanks for the advice. I can see how that could be misunderstood. In
fact, there is also a Scope::Cleanup that does something similar (I
discovered in my blog post on blogs.perl.org). Really, this is more
along the lines of a "finally" statement than error handling. Take a
quick look at the readme file:

https://github.com/jsober/Filter-Cleanup

The fault is my own - stackable error handling was a poor - and
inaccurate - description. Statements are really there for cleanup of a
scope, regardless of whether the code threw an error.

I would appreciate it if you would please reconsider. However, if you
still disagree, I am happy to rename it, although
StackableErrorHandler is probably also misleading, since it implies
the code is only called in the event of an error. Do you have any
other suggestions for naming it?
