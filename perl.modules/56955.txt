Kill it.  The module was a hack.  That was years ago, so now it's an old
hack, and one that probably doesn't work anymore.  I don't even use the
module internally anymore either, we gave paying our employees years ago.

Feel free to purge the registration whenever you find it convenient to do so.

All the best,

	Paul
