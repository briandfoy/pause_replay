Hi Steffen

I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

(As a PAUSE admin) I have changed your PAUSE account email redirection 
as you requested.

And I have added STBEY@cpan.org to this email's Cc list, so if it does 
get thru, as it should, please let us know.

And since you don't have time to fix the issues, what is you preference 
for how we proceed from here?
