Hi Todd,

I sorry to have to say, you lost your permission around Thu Apr 19
21:17:26 2018. That's the date of the commit
863c5102d4f9b3c2d2128330db8c7860f738a99a in the repo
https://github.com/batchpause/PAUSE-git

Pause has recorded a couple of activities by a user TODDR in the hour
before that. We did not record all the details of what happened during
these session, but ACTION=share_perms was involved three times in that
hour.

Do you remember, what you might have done during these visits?

  > He recently asked me to do a release and I have published 2.30 to

  > https://metacpan.org/release/TODDR/autodie-2.30

Confirmed, I have seen the red unauthorized tags for eight namespaces
within the link you give here.

  > However in PAUSE, I'm listed as co-maint on the autodie
  > distribution.

Confirmed, I just now have seen your name on the page you mentioned in
IRC:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=peek_dist_perms&pause99_peek_dist_perms_by=de&pause99_peek_dist_perms_query=autodie&pause99_peek_dist_perms_sub=1

00:15:41 < Grinnz> the pause dist page once again being misleading :/
00:15:59 < Grinnz> dist perms don't exist, that page is just a convenience

I agree with Grinnz.

  > Can you guys help me out with this?

What did the email tell you that the indexer sent you? Usually it gives
a better picture of what we know about the relation of a distro and the
uploader. Here is the relevant piece on onformation you got from pause
via email:

 : This distribution name will only be indexed when uploaded by users with
 : permission for the package autodie. Either someone else has ownership
 : over that package name, or this is a brand new distribution and that
 : package name was neither listed in the 'provides' field in the META file
 : nor found inside the dis tribution's modules. Therefore, no modules will
 : be indexed.

This is crucial. If a distro is called "Foo" and you do not have perms
for the namespace "Foo", Pause is not as friendly and helpful to you as
one would wish.

And here is the other page at PAUSE that is not misleading, URL is
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=peek_perms&pause99_peek_perms_by=me&pause99_peek_perms_query=autodie&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit

 : module          userid          type            owner
 : autodie         NTHYKIER        co-maint        PJF
 : autodie         PJF             first-come      PJF

The fuller table for all LIKE 'autodie%' modules would be: https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=peek_perms&pause99_peek_perms_by=ml&pause99_peek_perms_query=autodie%25&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit

Could you ask Paul to give you the perms again, that you need, please?

Thanks&&Regards,
