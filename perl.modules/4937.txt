CPAN Registration Request

Name:		  Andy Ferguson
eMail address:	  andy@moil.demon.co.uk
Homepage:	  www.moil.demon.co.uk/cmenu/cmenu.html
User-id:	  drewf
Contribution:	  Module and support files as Cmenu-1.0.tgz
		  with module, Makefile.PL, sample scripts and some documentation
Description:	  Cmenu.pm
   Name:	  Cmenu
   DSLI:	  bdpf
   Description:	  Curses-based menu and data entry functions
   Info:	  DREWF

Required modules: Curses
		  Text::Wrap

Note 1:		  Initiative grew from perlmenu.pm v4 which does not support Curses,
		  colour and some other functionality I would have preferred.
		  Initially attempted to revise perlmenu but eventually created a
		  completly new module - it was getting too cumbersome to keep
		  backward compatibility.

Note 2:		  Alpha module offered to members of BLUG (Belfast Linux Users Group)
		  for assessment and testing. Got tiny amount of feedback which led
		  to a couple of repairs.
		  Module deemed to be stable enough for wider release

Note 3:		  Module offered to perlmenu author as replacment/update but heard
		  nothing after 1 month so now offering indepedently to CPAN. Module
		  renamed to meet CPAN register.

Note 4:		  Quite possibly would have been better to develop as an integrated module 
		  for Curses directly; also Dialog.pm a direct alternative - ce la vie
