I'm pretty sure the ::FR:: in this module's proposed name is a _country_
rather than a _language_ identifier, and I do think that that's
important in general, because there are banking providers who 'share'
names with each other but operate in different countries.

For example there is an organization called the Nationwide Building
Society in each of the UK and the Republic of Ireland; they are
independent of each other.  Similarly there is a Postbank in each of
Germany and The Netherlands.

Most people are not particularly familiar with the names of banks in
countries other than their own.  But most people _do_ know the name of
the country they live in!  Therefore it makes a great deal of sense to
group banks by country.
