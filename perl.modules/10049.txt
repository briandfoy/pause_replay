The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       webtools
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: WebTools is a base module for the Web.
  userid:      JLISHEV (Julian Lishev)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.proscriptum.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    The experience collected over years in Web programming bring to us
    wonderful Perl module: WebTools. That system has been created at the
    beginning of 2001 and continues to extend every blessed day, owing
    to desire that guide us! We are witness on great number of special
    Web languages, but all of us, that love Perl can not reconcile with
    "hardness" of Perl scripts writing for the Web! Please do not
    understand us wrongly! We talking about trivial problems in every
    our Perl project, we talking about for ways and means that
    programmer commonly use to provide yourself with security and high
    performance. Main features of WebTools are:

    - Embedded Perl into HTML files (default) - Buffered/Non buffered
    output - Easy read of input forms and cookies using global perl
    variables - Flat database support - MySQL/MS Access support -
    Sessions support (via DB/Flat files) - Easy user support (all DB
    engines supported by webtools) - Cookies support - Attached
    variables - Html/SQL templates (perl
    functions/INLINE/INPERL/INCLUDE) - Mail functions (sendmail or
    build-in mail client - pure perl) - Upload/download via Perl scripts
    - DES III encription/decription in MIME style - Security settings
    for your scripts - Php subset of functions in perl variant
