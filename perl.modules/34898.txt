     why:

    I'd like to apply with Andy Lester to take over the maintence of
    Simon Cozens' Finance::QIF, that would require a PAUSE ID. I care
    about that module and have a lot of code that relies on it - I don't
    want it to die.

    Also: A weblog updates pinger module. It would offer the just ping
    functionality of the functionality that WebService::weblogUpdates
    offers for weblogs.com. But it would offer it for a wider range of
    sites (technorati, blo.gs etc). It would also present a simpler
    interface: a little set up and one call to notify whomever you want
    that a blog has been updated. That level of simplicity would be nice
    for people rolling their own weblog software. I know it would have
    been nice for me.
