                                                The examples are not geographic specific - like the internet, the examples come from everywhere.    Here are some examples of what is happening in the world-wide nonprofit sector:</p>
                                                <p><b>Comic Relief raises £3.6 m. on-line</b><br>
                                                In mid 2001, the UK charity Comic Relief completed its Red Nose campaign - a six-week program of events held every second year.    Overall they raised £45 million, but significantly £3.6 million was raised on-line, and 85% of that came during the six-hour television (comedy) special.
                                                Only £400,000 was raised on-line during the whole of the previous 1999 campaign.&nbsp;</p>
                                                <p><b>Best fundraising auction sites</b><br>
                                                Auction sites on the internet are proving popular with community business enterprises with product to sell.   Goods such as pottery items produced by clients of a medical rehabilitation agency, second hand clothing, toys, furniture and first aid kits are among those finding a ready market.   The method adopted is generally to advertise the selling price as the "minimum bid".</p>
                                                <p><b>Charity Flowers in expansion mode</b><br>
                                                The earned income venture Charity Flowers - started 18 months ago by the Adelaide Central Mission and Variety Australia - has gone onto the net
                                                under the umbrella of Wesley Mission with financial support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.   To put some marketing voltage into the venture, it placed 50,000 inserts into the Australian Women's Weekly.&nbsp;</p>
                                                <p><b>Shareware still available</b><br>
                                                Small organisations may not be fully aware that shareware still remains available on the internet for simple applications.  For example, if you want to save on the costs of having raffle tickets printed or like the convenience of creating your own raffle
                                                tickets.&nbsp;</p>
                                                <p><b>Exceptional CBE website</b><br>
                                                A truly exceptional website is uncommon for community business enterprises.    However one particular exception is the website sponsored by the St George Foundation for the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children.
                                                It will set the benchmark for some time and is definitely worth a look.</p>
                                                <p>I<b>nternet encourages niche associations</b><br>
                                                The internet is a boon for niche associations such as the Professional Résumé Writing and Research Association.  This association was created to provide a standard for résumé writing excellence.   By offering accreditation and on-line peer networking opportunities, these niche associations attract isolated and remote specialists that feel the need to provide credentials to their client base.&nbsp;</p>
                                                <p><b>The check is in the e-mail</b><br>
                                                The internet auction industry has spawned a direct-payment industry to enable cash transactions to be made via e-mail.  The system is much less expensive for charities than having a credit card merchant account and anyone with an e-mail address can send money to anyone else with an e-mail address, whether the recipient has an account or not.    The largest niche player with this new financial service is PayPal - bigger even than Citibank.&nbsp;</p>

                                                The Institute of Direct Marketing has commissioned electronic marketing firm StreamCity to produce a video email campaign to promote their forthcoming charity event.
                                                Features of the video email include online registration, the facility to send to a friend, and subtitling.</p>
