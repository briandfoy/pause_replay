The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::OCR
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: get ocr and images out of a pdf file
  userid:      LEOCHARRE (Leo Charre)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    newsgroups, online

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a collection of tools to make life with ocr a little easier
    on linux. For example, if you have an image and you want to read it
    with tesseract, it needs to be a tif- the included script bin/ocr
    will make a temp tif file for you and read that instead

    So you can run ocr on any image type without bothering with the
    details of image format.

The resulting entry would be:

PDF::
::OCR             bdpOp get ocr and images out of a pdf file         LEOCHARRE
