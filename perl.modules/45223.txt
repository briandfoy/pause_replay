Subject: Module submission Crypt::GCrypt
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::GCrypt
  DSLIP:       RdcOp
  description: Perl interface to the GNU Crypto library
  userid:      AAR (Alessandro Ranellucci)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    #perl and #linux-it (FreeNode)

  similar:
    GCrypt.pm

  rationale:

    The old GCrypt.pm module sitting in CPAN from 2002 is totally
    outdated as: 1- it doesn't compile because libgcrypt changed its
    interface in 2003 and the author didn't update it; 2- it is buggy
    (no padding, bad memory allocation etc.); 3- it was not possible to
    contact the author; 4- the name GCrypt.pm doesn't match any
    namespace politic.

    I believe Crypt::GCrypt should enter the module list because
    there's no other module there with similiar functionality (I'm
    referring not only to the use of libgcrypt, but even to some ciphers
    such as AES).

  enteredby:   AAR (Alessandro Ranellucci)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 11 07:47:21 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::GCrypt          RdcOp Perl interface to the GNU Crypto library     AAR
