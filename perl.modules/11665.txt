Subject: Issues with Net::DNS

From: ctriv@dyndns.org (Chris Reinhardt)

Hello,
    I'm the official maintainer of Net::DNS.  Mike Fuhr recently handed
over the reins to me earlier this year, and I've been working towards a
new major release (version 0.20).  It seams that while I have been working
on this new version, Rob Brown has uploaded a copy of Mike Fuhr's old
developement branch onto CPAN.
    The last thing I would like to do is step on anyone's toes, Mr.
Brown's especially.  However, I do feel that this is not only confusing to
the users of Net::DNS (I have had one person email me to ask me if I am
still the author, and another email me complaining of bugs in the devel
version).  If at all possible,  I would like to move towards some sort of
resolution in this matter.

Chris R.
