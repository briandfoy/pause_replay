     why:

    I intend in the first instance to create a perl interface to the
    Apache Sling web framework (http://sling.apache.org). This will
    provide a perl layer of abstraction on to the Sling REST based web
    frameworks and HTTP endpoints.

    An extension to this will be to create a perl interface to the
    Sakai Kernel (http://groups.google.co.uk/group/sakai-kernel). This
    project is based on the Apache Sling framework but is intended
    specifically for an educational setting and exposes further rest
    interfaces appropriate for that purpose.

    These two perl interfaces combined are intended to allow easier
    development of perl applications that can sit alongside or in front
    of the Apache Sling framework. Thus, you could have, for example,
    the catalyst framework running alongside the sling framework,
    leveraging the power of both simultaneously.
