The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NetApp
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: NetApp Filer Sys Admin API
  userid:      WPMOORE (Phillip Moore)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    NetApp forums, similar mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    NetApp makes a line of NAS devices which has a very complex
    administrative interface. This module provides a high level OO API
    for managing the filers, that hides the complexities of the ONTAP
    CLI. This entire API is implemented around the ONTAP CLI, accessed
    over ssh, although telnet will also be supported, although not
    recommended (error checking over telnet is far less robust than
    ssh).

    I am developing infrastructure for managing our global NAS
    infrastructure, and this API is a critical layer in that software,
    since the vendor (NetApp) doesn't provide a very good perl API at
    all. Working with the vendor, I intend to extend this API to cover
    the majority of the system management functionality of ONTAP, and
    intend for this API to become the standard perl API for their
    products.

The resulting entry would be:

NetApp            bdpOp NetApp Filer Sys Admin API                   WPMOORE
