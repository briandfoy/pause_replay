This is a bit sticky because the author has very recently (three months
ago) noted interest in this module. That's not a very long time to have
disappeared, in my opinion. Charles, if you're listening, speak up even
to say "yes" or "no".

Is there another name that you might use for your distribution, even if
temporarily?

We typically don't make these judgements on anything other than
respecting the intent of the person who got there first. We don't
select on better, etc. We just try to make peacable transfers when
necessary, but in most cases try to get the people involved to work it
out themselves. :)
