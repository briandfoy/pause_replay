Hi Andreas, hi Robert, hi Barbie,

I assume this is something where only you can help and only to some 
extent by doing an insta-delete from PAUSE and (if memory serves me 
right and Robert maintains backpan.perl.org) removing it from at least 
the two most well-known backpans.

Thanks and regards,
Steffen

Hi People,

I make a big mistake !

I upload a source code of my work to cpan !

I try to delete the file in pause, but I don't find the better way to do 
that. I'm afraid because search.cpan.org doesnt index the file, but 
metacpan do that now. How can I fix that ?

Please, help me with this problem, it's very urgent, sorry....

Many thanks!
