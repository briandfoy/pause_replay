I have been working on the HB extension to Perl (allows you to call HB
<http://bachue.com/hb> from Perl) as well as the Perl extension to HB
(allows you to embed Perl code in HB scripts). I thought it could be
listed at CPAN.

http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html reads:

    If you have written a module, script, or documentation, if you have
    some porting material or patches you would like to contribute to
    the archive, send the following to the mantainers at modules@perl.org.

My name: Alejandro Forero Cuervo.

My email address: bachue@bachue.com

My homepage: http://bachue.com/alejo

My preferred user-ID on CPAN: AZUL.

A description of what you're planning to contribute: The HB Extension
to Perl (allows you to call HB <http://bachue.com/hb> from Perl) as well
as the Perl extension to HB (allows you to embed Perl code in HB scripts).

A description in module list format:
DSLI  Description
bmcO  Use HB from Perl and Perl from HB

Some background info:

HB is a recently implemented language used to build dynamic web
content. It is extended at runtime dynamically loading shared objects. It
provides an extremly simple interface to create web sites. It plays the
role of PHP, ASP or Perl+CGI, but is much easier to use and sites made
on it are much easier to update/modify. You can find more information
about it in <http://bachue.com/hb>.

More information about PerlHBM can be found at
<http://bachue.com/hb/perl>.

Please let me know if your interested in listing it.

Alejo.
