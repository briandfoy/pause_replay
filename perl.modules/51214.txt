     why:

    As a first step, I would like to publish some Perl scripts.
    photo_rename.pl will rename a set of photo files given a pattern
    that can use the EXIF date. parallel.pl will launch a set of
    external commands, no more than N among M (M > N) at a time.
    create_patch.pl will analyse two file tree and create a patch of
    entire files, with a very usefull --dry-run mode and a convenient
    output to parse.

    As a second step, I need to ask my company if I can publish some
    internaly developed scripts. These scripts are related to Oracle
    structure export as parseable text, Oracle data export in text, text
    data comparison and Oracle queries generation resulting of
    comparison. Last script is about executing a list of Oracle SQL
    scripts with automatic log generation, live error check.

    Third step, as a Talend [1] developer, I will certainly need to
    offer patches to Perl modules we use, and to publish some new
    modules for specific data sources.
