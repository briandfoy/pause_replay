I'd suggest you discuss your ideas publicly first. They partly look
familiar and yet slightly different to existing solutions. It would
certainly help if you could present them in comparison with your
competitors so one can see the differences to closely related modules
and concepts better. This would also help to find the proper
namespaces. OTOH, if you want to code a proof-of-concept first and
need a namespace for the first draft, feel free to take anything that
is not yet taken, but make clear in the documentation, that the
namespace still is subject to change.
