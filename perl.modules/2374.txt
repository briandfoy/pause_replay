From: makarow@mail.com (Andrew Makarow)

My name is Andrew V Makarow <makarow@mail.com>. Preferred user ID may be
'makarow'. Modules I'd like to contribute are:

DSLI
bdpr	Script - (Win32) system administrator`s library.
adpO	Tk::TM - User interface for database applications.

Script module was written at first for system administrator
needs in centralised administration of Win32 clients - logon and
application startup scripts. Later several functions useful in
Windows NT server scripts was added. Now many functions may run on UNIX or
may be developed for it. But the area of Win32 servers and clients is very
specific.

Tk::TM is abbreviation of 'Tk Transaction Manager' to control
transactions of the screen in GUI database applications. It is element of
database application between user interface and database interface. It is
something like 'Transaction Manager' in JYACC JAM or 'DataWindow' in
PowerBuilder.
