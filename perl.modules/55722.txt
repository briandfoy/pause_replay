Subject: Module submission DBIx::MySperql

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::MySperql
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: Easy one line SQL calls w DBI and MySQL.
  userid:      ROGERHALL (Roger A Hall)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    bioinformatics.ualr.edu, iosea.com

  similar:
    unknown

  rationale:

    This module is very effective for new programmers and coders from
    other fields, like in Bioinformatics. Many of our clients are
    researchers with backgrounds in Life Sciences who want technical
    skills in order to have more control over their own data, but are
    not excited by OO.

    MySperql is simple once you understand sql statements and perl
    references, which inspire the "type" parameter below, which map to
    the various DBI fetch statements ($type = ['@' | '\@' | '\@@');

    use DBI::MySperql;

    $dbh = &DBConnect(%parameters);

    $return = &SQLExec($sql, $type, \%parameters); @return =
    &SQLExec($sql, $type, \%parameters);

    The code has already been in use for six years, and has been
    recently packaged and sligtly enhanced.
