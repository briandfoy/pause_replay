The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::Wachovia
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: access account info from Perl via OO module
  userid:      JGARVIN (Jim Garvin)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I saw that's how all the other hackers were naming their
    bank-accessing modules, so I did this one the same. This module is
    designed a bit differently from what's already out there for other
    banks, but in a good way (IMO).

    There are a couple package names used as part of the module distro
    underneath the Finance::Bank::Wachovia package:

    Finance::Bank::Wachovia::Account
    Finance::Bank::Wachovia::Transactions
    Finance::Bank::Wachovia::DataObtainer::WWW
    Finance::Bank::Wachovia::DataObtainer::WWW::Parser

    Do all of these get registered? or just the top one? Whatever you
    guys decide. This is my first CPAN contribution, so I'm learning as
    I go.

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::
::Wachovia        bdpOp access account info from Perl via OO module  JGARVIN
