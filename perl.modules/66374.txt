The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::IATA
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Search Airports airports by IATA, ICAO codes
  userid:      JMELTZER (Joerg Meltzer)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Geo::ICAO

  rationale:

    Hello,

    I would like to register the namespace Geo::IATA.

    There is currently no module for looking up IATA airport codes on
    CPAN.

    The Geo::ICAO module is similar. However it only handles ICAO codes
    and is very slow.

    With Geo::IATA you can lookup airport information with both IATA
    and ICAO codes (even with airport names and their locations). The
    engine is based on SQLite.

    Geo::IATA looks like a good namespace because it uses the Geo top
    level which should be ok for something that lists worldwide
    airports.

    IATA rings the bell for those who explicitly search for iata codes.

    Regards, Jörg
