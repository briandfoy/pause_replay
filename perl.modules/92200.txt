Hi

I assume you're asking about copyright issues.

If the web pages which will be scraped have no copyright statement, then 
there is no issue.

Some web sites use (c) or (C) as a attempt at a fake copyright symbol, 
but (warning: IANAL) under Australian law that is not a copyright 
symbol, because the parentheses do not form a circle around the letter. 
Â© is a copyright symbol (if you email client displays it the same way I 
see it).

If there is a copyright symbol, then western law still allows copying 
for various purposes (e.g. research, quoting, etc).

But these are all issues for people who use your code. Just because you 
are the author of the code does not mean you are responsible if other 
people misuse the code. This is the same issue as with photocopiers - 
the manufacturers of such equipment are not responsible for what people 
choose to copy, are they?

And of course there are already many modules on CPAN which perform web 
scraping. You can type WWW::Scraper into MetaCPAN.org and see many 
listed there, so obviously a lot of authors publish code without being 
too worried about how is is being used. Yes, they might be worried, but 
they are not too worried.
