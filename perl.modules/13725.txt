Hello.  I'd like to register in PAUSE, please.

If possible, I'd like to use an id of JLABOVITZ.

I'm working on a module called Mac::AppleScript::Glue that links Perl and
AppleScript on a Mac.  I'll be giving a talk about it (and hooking it up to
graphic design tools) at the O'Reilly OS X conference later this month.

I've also got an expansion of WWW::Search that seraches real estate property
listings (MLS) that eventually I'll get packaged up.

I don't really have a homepage specifically for my Perl stuff, but my
general home page (and email) is listed below.

Thanks!
