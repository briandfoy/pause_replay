Hi Kimoto-san,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat.

Your SPVM distribution used to include a module called SPVM::Std, and so =
you have the first-come indexing permission on that package.

It looks like you also released it with SPVM::std (different only in the =
case of =E2=80=9Cstd=E2=80=9D vs =E2=80=9CStd=E2=80=9D) at some point.

Currently when you release do two releases with different versions of =
the same package name, differing only in the case, you can end up with =
first-come on both packages.

So you also have first-come on SPVM::std.

We=E2=80=99re changing this behaviour in PAUSE soon, so that if you =
released SPVM::std and then SPVM::Std, all permissions would be =
automatically updated to refer to SPVM::Std.

In preparation for this we=E2=80=99re resolving all the existing clashes =
in PAUSE.

Normally I would suggest dropping your permission on SPVM::std, but I =
wonder if we should also drop the other one?
If I look in the CPAN Index, I see that SPVM::Std refers to =
K/KI/KIMOTO/SPVM-0.0338.tar.gz, an old release of your distribution.

This means that if someone ran =E2=80=9Ccpan SPVM::Std=E2=80=9D, they =
could accidentally install an old version of SPVM, overwriting perhaps a =
more recent version. Not very likely, but still probably not good.

So in fact I have three suggestions:
Are you happy for us to drop the first-come permission on SPVM::std? I =
can do this on your behalf, or you can do it?
Would it make sense to drop the first-come permission on SPVM::Std as =
well, since you=E2=80=99re not using it?
Could you delete all the old releases from your PAUSE author directory =
please? This will not only free up some space, but removes the =
possibility of an old release appearing in the CPAN Index.

If you=E2=80=99re happy with one or more of these, you could do them =
yourself via the PAUSE web interface, or I can do them on your behalf.

Please ask if you=E2=80=99ve got any questions about any of the above.

Cheers,
Neil
