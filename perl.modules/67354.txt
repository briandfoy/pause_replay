The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CAM::PDF::Annot
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Interface for annotation objects on PDF docs
  userid:      DONATOAZ (Donato Azevedo)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Rio de Janeiro Perl Mongers mailing list

  similar:
    CAM::PDF

  rationale:

    This module extends CAM::PDF in order to deal with annotation
    objects on PDF documents. The purpose is to extend CAM::PDF
    functionality to append, create, alter annotation objects and check
    for intersections between annotations. This module came to life
    because of the need to merge annotations between different copies of
    the same PDF document so as to have one single matrix with all the
    annotations for its copies.

    The submitted version only appends already existing annotation
    objects (thus fulfilling its original purpose) but there is a
    development version which does the altering and checking for
    intersection.

The resulting entry would be:

CAM::PDF::
