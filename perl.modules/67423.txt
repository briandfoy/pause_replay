The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::ConsistentVersion
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Ensures distribution versions are consistent
  userid:      CEBJYRE (Glenn Fowler)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Version

  rationale:

    This module is for testing for consistency of version number across
    a distribution - Test::Version only tests for the existence of a
    version number within modules, whereas Test::ConsistentVersion is
    designed to make things as easy as possible for the distribution
    author - reading the list of modules to test from the MANIFEST file,
    etc

  enteredby:   CEBJYRE (Glenn Fowler)
  enteredon:   Sun Aug 30 13:24:46 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::ConsistentVersion adpfp Ensures distribution versions are consistent CEBJYRE
