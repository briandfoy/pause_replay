These are the current permissions for that namespace.
module	userid	fullname	type	owner
MQSeries::Command 	HBIERSMA 	Hildo Biersma 	first-come 	HBIERSMA
MQSeries::Command 	WPMOORE 	Phillip Moore 	co-maint 	HBIERSMA

Therefore, you will have to talk to HBIERSMA (Hildo Biersma) about it. 
He can give you co-maintenace or primary maintenance status. If he 
agrees but doesn't know how to do it, feel free to contact us again.

Best regards,
Steffen
