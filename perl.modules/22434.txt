SYP was trying to hand over maintainership of Text::Capitalize
to me (DOOM), but made a mistake and turned himself into the 
co-maintainer, and now he can't make further changes.  The module 
only has a "co-maintainer" now, it has no "maintainer".

Could someone add DOOM as the maintainer for Text::Capitalize? 

Or alternately, if you're afraid of being socially engineered, 
could you just make SYP the "maintainer" again?
