The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bow
  DSLIP:       cdhOl
  description: A perl interface to the bow library from CMU
  userid:      IWOODHEAD (Ira Joseph Woodhead)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    inline@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The bow library of CMU is a unique and rather comprehensive body of
    code implementing all major information retrieval techniques. I was
    very surprised to find that an interface for it was not already in
    the CPAN. Having a wrapper for it would facilitate much
    experimentation in the IR field.

    Several people have expressed interest in using a Bow module in
    their own projects, for instance Ken Williams of Swarthmore with
    AI::Categorize.

The resulting entry would be:

Bow               cdhOl A perl interface to the bow library from CMU IWOODHEAD
