Planning to contribute: DBD Driver for Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere

Name             DSLI          Description
-------------    ----------    ---------------------------------------------
DBD::ASAny       adcO          Adaptive Server Anywhere Driver for DBI

This driver has been discussed on sybase.public.sqlanywhere.general and
sybase.public.sqlanywhere.linux. The driver was developed a couple of years
ago and has been embedded into several products. Recently, there has been a
steady trickle of interest on the newsgroups so I brought the driver up to
date and, in the last few months, I have sent the driver out to perhaps a
dozen individuals who have asked for it.
