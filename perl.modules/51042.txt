Can someone please make me maintainer on all of JOUKE's modules so I  
can help dole 'em out.  See http://use.perl.org/~jouke/journal/31106  
and http://use.perl.org/~jouke/journal/31109 for more.  Here's the  
mail where he agrees that I should do it.

My mistake, I had him cc: modules@cpan.org, not perl.org
