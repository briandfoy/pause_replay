Request to register new user

fullname: Kevin Mulholland
  userid: MOODFARM
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.moodfarm.co.uk
     why:

    I have been a perl developer for a long time and never gotten
    around to uploading any of my code, either due to time constraints
    or companies I work for thinking they own everything in my
    head/personal time.

    I have some modules almost ready for the real world, which make my
    life easier and hope will help others
