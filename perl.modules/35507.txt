| how's it different from DBIx::Wrapper

I ask for the individual pieces of the puzzle and then build up the connection
info without forcing the user to know how to make the DSN that DBI is looking for.

I check for and enable transaction support (commit, rollback) on MySQL if it
supports it.

I provide a feature where you can embed ##?n##, where n = 1, 2, ..., in your sql
statement and I then do substitutions based upon an array of entries you
provide.  It's similiar to the ? feature that DBI provides, but I implemented it
so you can dynamically plug in different sql snippets based upon the flow of
your program.

Those are just some of the unique things I've implemented, plus I started this
project over 3 years ago and only got my PAUSE id within the last year.  If the
DBIx::Wrapper module would have been around when I started our projects I would
have been using it instead.

| Isn't that what DBI does?  Just asking...
|

I'm providing an encapsulation layer to make it easier to setup those modules.
Once that is done, you are then working with the statement handles as any normal
DBI/DBD program would.
