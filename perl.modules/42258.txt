The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       warnings::DynamicScope
  DSLIP:       Rdprp
  description: Provides warning categories in dynamic scope
  userid:      KMIYAZAKI (Keitaro Miyazaki)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    warnings.pm

  rationale:

    The reason why I decided to write a new module which provides
    capability similar to warnings pragma is that I found the limitation
    of "warnings::enabled" and "warnings::warnif" function.

    While I'm writing my module, I noticed that the code like below
    will not work as I intended:

    use warnings; package GrandMother; use warnings::register; sub
    deliver { my $self; warnings::warnif("GrandMother", "You have warned
    by grandma."); bless \$self; } package Mother; use base
    "GrandMother"; use warnings::register; sub deliver {
    warnings::warnif("Mother", "You have warned by mom.");
    $_[0]->SUPER::deliver(); } package main; no warnings "GrandMother";
    no warnings "Mother"; my $me = Mother->deliver(); # => You have
    warned by grandma.

    In this code, I intended to inhibit warning messages from each
    class "GrandMother" and "Mother".

    But, if I run this code, warning in "GrandMother" class will be
    emitted. So that means the information by pragma 'no warnings
    "GrandMother"' would not be passed to "GrandMother" class properly.

    I thought this comes from nature of these function that these
    functions uses warnings information in static scope. (They gets
    static scope information from stack of caller function.)

    So, I started write this module.

The resulting entry would be:

warnings::
::DynamicScope    Rdprp Provides warning categories in dynamic scope KMIYAZAKI
