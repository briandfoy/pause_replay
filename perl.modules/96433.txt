Hi Ask,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m emailing you because =
I=E2=80=99m working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now =
considering package names case insensitively. This has left us with some =
situations where two or more people are owners of namespaces previously =
considered distinct, and now considered the same.

You have ownership of the sys::output module, which is part of your =
=E2=80=9Csys=E2=80=9D distribution, version 0.2 of which is on CPAN.

This now conflicts with the Sys::OutPut module, owned by AKSTE, and part =
of the Sys-OutPut distribution.

There are a number of options for resolving this conflict, including:
Rename your module to a name not currently in use, and release a new =
version of your distribution. We=E2=80=99d then be able to drop your =
permissions on =E2=80=9Csys::output=E2=80=9D.
If you=E2=80=99re not interested in this module (last released in 2008), =
we could just delete the distribution from CPAN entirely, and drop all =
associated permissions. If you=E2=80=99re not really doing Perl these =
days (Python now?), then I can do these steps for you.

Please let me know your preferred way to fix this.

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m working through the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
