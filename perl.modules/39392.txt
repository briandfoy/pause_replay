Subject: Module submission CGI::UploadEasy
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, gunnar@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::UploadEasy
  DSLIP:       bupOp
  description: Facilitate file uploads
  userid:      GUNNAR (Gunnar Hjalmarsson)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    clpmisc, clpmodules, ciwac

  similar:
    CGI.pm, CGI::Upload

  rationale:

    CGI::UploadEasy is a wrapper around, and relies heavily on, CGI.pm.
    Its purpose is to provide a simple interface to the upload
    functionality of CGI.pm.

    When creating the CGI::UploadEasy object, the module instantly
    saves one or more files from a file upload request in the upload
    directory. Information about the uploaded files is made available
    via the "fileinfo" method. CGI::UploadEasy performs a number of
    tests, which should limit the risk that you encounter difficulties
    when developing the file upload application.

    As regards CGI::Upload, the development seems to have stagnated,
    and it does not focus as much on simplicity as CGI::UploadEasy.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::UploadEasy      bupOp Facilitate file uploads                      GUNNAR
