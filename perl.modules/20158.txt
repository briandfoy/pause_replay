Yeah, BROOM is my CPAN id too, but the the email address associated with it 
became invalid when I switched domain registrars.  I'm trying to resolve the 
issue now.   So to answer your question, yes, please change the password and 
email for BROOM.   Use nathanial@linkline.com as the email.  The password I 
haven't received yet. 

Thank-you!

I signed up for PAUSE before, but I accidentally gave and invalid
email address. 


I have a CPAN id for BROOM (Nathaniel J. Graham). Is that the one that
you mean?
If so, would you like me to change the password and email for BROOM
instead?
