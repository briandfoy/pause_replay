Hi Tony Wintermute

Re Test::PostgreSQL.

Perhaps someone beat me to it, but anyway...

Firstly, TJC is associated with Tony Corkindale. Is that you? No need to 
explain/prove why there's name confusion. Yes or No will do.

And since you're primary maintainer for Test::postgresql (and 
Test::PostgreSQL) you could remove the former from CPAN, but that would 
not solve the problem.

Perhaps best would be to change your module's name. Suggestions:

o Test::Pg (I don't know if this is taken - I just got sick of waiting 
for MetaCPAN to respond. Ahh - proxy error. This sort of thing is 
happening every day from here in Melbourne, Australia. E.g. with PAUSE. 
So it could be a local issue, but then Andreas is looking in to it too)

Not taken - search.cpan.org says not anyway.

o Test::DBD::Pg

Then we could have Test::DBD::mysql etc, as per the dbi:* names.

That likewise circumvents issues with his (kazuho's) other module, 
Test::mysql.

Thus that is my favourite amongst these.

o Test::DBD::Postgres

o Test::DBD::PostgreSQL
