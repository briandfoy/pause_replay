The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::QuickCMS
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A small content management system
  userid:      TMURRAY (Timm Murray)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Various Content Management Systems (including Slashcode, Scoop, and
    Everything), but these are far more complex than QuickCMS.
    HTML::Mason is somewhat similar in spirit, though is also more
    complex.

  rationale:

    SSIs have a design flaw that forces you towards either redundancy
    or unmaintainability (often both). This is because each individual
    document must pull in the included file on its own. QuickCMS takes
    the opposite approach. Using HTML::Template, mod_perl, and a
    POD-like document syntax, QuickCMS fills in the individual documents
    into a template.

  enteredon:   Thu May 20 15:08:29 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::QuickCMS        bdpOp A small content management system            TMURRAY
