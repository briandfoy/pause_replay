Subject: PAUSE ID request (SIXAPART; SIx Apart Ltd.)

Request to register new user

fullname: SIx Apart Ltd.
  userid: SIXAPART
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://code.sixapart.com/
     why:

    This is a request for a corporate shared account.

    As we (Adam Kennedy and I) talked on IRC: Six Apart agrees that in
    case of the company acquisition/merger/shutdown, the email address
    @sixapart.com should be considered as an identification method to
    verify the ownership, and if that address bounces PAUSE can free up
    the namespace to whoever claims it. However I'm sure Six Apart will
    add proper co-maint bits to employees/collaborators in such events.

    I'm using my work email address to register because our cpan@ is
    the mailing list now and don't think it suit with the initial
    registration process. When the account is created and the password
    is securely created, I'll sign in to PAUSE again to change the
    address to cpan@sixapart.com to receive RT reports etc.

    Thanks,
