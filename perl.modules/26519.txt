The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Set::UnionFind
  DSLIP:       anpOp
  description: Manage an equivalence relation on a set
  userid:      POM (Julien Quint (Pom))
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am working on a module for weighted finite-state transducers,
    which I hope to be able to publish soon. During the development I
    ran into the need of managing equivalence classes, and thought about
    the class UnionFind data structure. It doesn't appear that anything
    related is currently available on CPAN, so I made one that I'd like
    to propose. I will try to see if people are interested in it on
    comp.lang.perl.modules, and once it's been used a bit, propose it
    for upload to CPAN.

The resulting entry would be:

Set::
::UnionFind       anpOp Manage an equivalence relation on a set      POM
