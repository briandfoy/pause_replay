The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Delimited
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: column based character delimited logging
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    perhaps Log::Agent

  rationale:

    I know there are a ton of logging packages out there, but as I look
    through them I don't see what I really need, namely a package that
    takes an array ref of columns, an array ref of information, a
    delimiter and a filename. It is sort of smart in that if it has to
    create the file it automatically puts the columns in as the first
    row. Otherwise, it just appends

    URLEncode(join($delimiter, @$info_ref)) . "\n"

    to the log file. I really do need the columns to be first. It make
    for a nice array of arrays where the 0th array contains columns, and
    the rest contain data. Looks just like a database table really. I
    talked to the Log::Agent guy and said I would be happy to write a
    new personality and use his stuff, and he wrote me back saying it
    might be possible, but he has not responded to my response for a
    month.

    This is a very simple module that I have already written, that is
    in use on my work servers. I need something that does just this for
    two or three other thing I want to submit to cpan.

    Thanks, Earl
