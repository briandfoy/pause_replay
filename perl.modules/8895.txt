In CPAN, there's an excellent module String::Strip of Dave Cross.

Look at it's function description:

DESCRIPTION

StripLTSpace - Removes Leading and Trailing spaces from given string

StripTSpace - Removes Trailing spaces from given string

StripLSpace - Removes Leading spaces from given string

StripSpace - Removes all spaces from given string

I do these things often, and these routines tend to be about 35% faster
than the corresponding regex methods.
