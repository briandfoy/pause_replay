Subject: Module submission Graph::Centrality

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::Centrality
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Computes centrality measures of a graph.
  userid:      KUBINA (Jeff Kubina)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    none yet

  similar:
    Algorithm::PageRank::XS,
    Algorithm::PageRank,Algorithm::SocialNetwork,Graph

  rationale:

    i plan to write modules that compute the various centrality
    measures of a graph where the input is either a Graph (Hietaniemi)
    or a list of edges.

    i would like to create either the name spaces

    Graph::Centrality Graph::Centrality::Pagerank
    Graph::Centrality::Betweeness Graph::Centrality::Closeness ....

    since centrality is a measure on a graph or network, the names seem
    more appropriate for a class of measures than

    Centrality Centrality::Pagerank Centrality::Betweeness

    or

    Algorithm::Centrality Algorithm::Centrality::Pagerank
    Algorithm::Centrality::Betweeness

    note the modules Algorithm::PageRank::XS and Algorithm::PageRank
    both have bugs in them and do not always return the correct pagerank
    measures. (bugs submitted and/or authors contacted).

  enteredon:   Wed Mar 25 01:20:35 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::Centrality      bdpOp Computes centrality measures of a graph.     KUBINA
