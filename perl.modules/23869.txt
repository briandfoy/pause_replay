That's me.

Andreas?  How do I go about updating my address
on PAUSE?  I've long since lost the author info.
I stopped working at elegant over two years ago and
they stopped supporting my email address about a
year ago.  My new address jmm@perlwolf.com is in my
own domain, so it will not change in the future.

I thought I had uploaded an Array::Heap module.
The system I wrote it on has been shut down for
a while - I need to fix it after a disk crash
but it hasn't been my primary system for a long
time so I haven't gotten around to it.

The Heap::Binary module (in Heap) provides a binary
heap interface as an alternative to the faster
Fibonacci and binomial heap interfaces.

However, I did write a much simpler package to manage
a caller-provided array as a heap.

Marc (or Autrijus, whichever of you was the person
offering to take over the Array::Heap namespace - I
having trouble decoding the quotation indents) please
reply to me.  If you give me a few weeks to dig out
my original code, we can compare and decide where to
proceed.  Obviously, there is no large installed user
base that depends upon the unpublished Array::Heap
code.  (The Heap module, and its component modules,
does get used from some of the Graph routines - Jarkko
had the pleasure of helping me debug the Heap routines
as he tested out his Graph routines for the book.)  My
intent for these was that the Array::Heap set would be
a small simple set of functions for managing an array
as a heap, while the Heap::* would be the inheritable
object-oriented heap mechanisms for which you provided
an Element sub-component for your own purposes - more
overhead in using them, but more power and flexibility
available as a result.
