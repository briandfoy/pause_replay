Request to register new user

fullname: Keith Burdis
  userid: SEEBELOW
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://keith.burdis.org
     why:

    Back in 2003 I submitted the Tuxedo::Admin module and I would like
    to pick this up again and finish it off as it is useful for
    something else I am working on.

    Unfortunately I no longer have access to the university email
    account I was using then (keith@rucus.ru.ac.za). Would it be
    possible to change the email address for the KBURDIS account to be
    keith@burdis.org so that I can reset my password? This PAUSE account
    was originally created for me by Kurt D. Starsinic on Wed, 4 Jun
    2003 01:58:02 +0200.

    Looking through my old emails it appears that the last time I
    changed my password was on Thu Jun 19 23:37:25 2003 GMT. I'd be
    happy to provide any other information to try to prove my identity.

    Thanks.

    - Keith
