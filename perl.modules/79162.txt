The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Dice::Loaded
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Roll loaded dice; sample discrete random var
  userid:      MGOULD (Miles Gould)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Twitter

  similar:
    Games::Dice Games::Dice::Advanced Games::Dice::Probability random

  rationale:

    All of the existing dice-rolling modules handle only fair dice:
    Games::Dice::Advanced claims to handle loaded dice, but it does so
    by punting all the work to the user.

    There are lots of inefficient algorithms for simulating loaded
    dice, and a particularly beautiful efficient one, which I couldn't
    find on CPAN. So I've implemented the beautiful efficient one. See
    http://www.keithschwarz.com/darts-dice-coins/ for a discussion of
    some possible algorithms and their asymptotic behaviour.

    Note that this module doesn't have to be used for simulating dice
    rolls: it can be used to sample *any* discrete probability
    distribution, including those which don't correspond to any die
    which might be physically constructed. I put the module in the
    Games::Dice namespace because I couldn't think of a better place to
    put it.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Dice::
::Loaded          RdpOp Roll loaded dice; sample discrete random var MGOULD
