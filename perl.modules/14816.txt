  DEAR SIR/MADAM
  
  
  COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. GRACE AND PEACE AND LOVE   FROM THIS PART OF THE ATLANTIC TO YOU. I HOPE MY  LETTER DOES NOT CAUSE YOU TOO MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AS  I   WRITE TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE CONTACT   ADDRESS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND WHO WORKS AT THE   NIGERIAN EMBASSYIN YOUR COUNTRY. PLEASE EXCUSE MY   INTRUSION INTO YOUR PRIVATE LIFE.
  
  I AM BARRISTER BALOGUN OLADELE, I REPRESENT MOHAMMED   ABACHA, SON OF THE LATE GEN. SANI ABACHA, WHO WAS  THE  OF STATE IN NIGERIA. HE DIED
IN   1998. SINCE HIS DEATH, THE FAMILY HAS BEEN LOSING A   LOT OF MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS   WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THE FAMILY. BASED ON  THIS   THEREFORE, THE FAMILY HAS ASKED ME TO SEEK FOR A   FOREIGN PARTNER WHO CAN WORK WITH US AS TO MOVE OUT   THE TOTAL SUM OF US$75,000,000.00 ( SEVENTY FIVE   MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ), PRESENTLY IN THEIR   POSSESSION. THIS MONEY WAS OF COURSE, ACQUIRED BY  THE
  LATE PRESIDENT AND IS NOW KEPT SECRETLY BY THE
 FAMILY.  THE SWISS GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY FROZEN ALL THE   ACCOUNTS OF THE FAMILY IN SWITZERLAND, AND SOME  OTHER   COUNTRIES WOULD SOON FOLLOW TO DO THE SAME. THIS  BID  BY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEAL WITH THIS  FAMILY
  HAS MADE IT NECESSARY THAT WE SEEK YOUR ASSISITANCE  IN   RECEIVING THIS MONEY AND IN INVESTING IT ON BEHALF  OF   THE FAMILY.
  
  THIS MUST BE A JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION AND WE
 MUST   ALL WORK TOGETHER. SINCE THIS MONEY IS STILL CASH,  EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT  IT   FROM THEFT OR SEIZURE, PENDING WHEN AGREEMENT IS  REACHED ON WHEN AND HOW TO MOVE IT INTO ANY OF YOUR   NOMINATED BANK ACCOUNTS. I HAVE PERSONALLY WORKED  OUT  ALL MODALITIES FOR THE PEACEFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS
  TRANSACTION. THE TRANSACTION DEFINITELY WOULD BE
  HANDLED IN PHASES AND THE FIRST PHASE WILL INVOLVE  THE   MOVING OF US$25,000,000.00( TWENTY FIVE MILLION  UNITED   STATES DOLLARS ).
  MY CLIENTS ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE
  PERCENTAGE OF THIS MONEY AS SOON AS THE
 TRANSACTIONIS CONCLUDED. I WILL, HOWEVER, BASED ON THE GROUNDS  THAT   CONTENTIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED BEFORE THE  COMMENCEMENT   OF THIS TRANSACTION. YOU MAY ALSO DISCUSS YOUR   PERCENTAGE BEFORE WE START TO WORK. AS SOON AS I  HEAR   FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU ALL NECESSARY DETAILS AS  TO  HOW WE INTEND TO CARRY OUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION.
PLEASE, DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEARS,AS ALL NECESSARY
  MODALITIES ARE IN PLACE, AND I ASSURE YOU OF ALL
  SUCCESS AND SAFETY IN THIS TRANSACTION.
  
  PLEASE, THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRES ABSOLUTE
  CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOU WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TREAT  IT   AS SUCH UNTIL THE FUNDS ARE MOVED OUT OF THIS  COUNTRY.
  PLEASE, YOU WILL ALSO IGNORE THIS LETTER AND
 RESPECT   OUR TRUST IN YOU BY NOT EXPOSING THIS TRANSACTION,  EVEN   IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED.
  
  I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.MY EMAIL ADDRESS IS oladelecahmbers@hotvoice.com
  
  THANK YOU.
  
 TRULY YOURS,
  
 BALOGUN OLADELE ESQ.
