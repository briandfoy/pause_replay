We're not really set up to rename things. However, although many people
will infer a subclass relationship based on the name, it's not actually
demanded. For instance, not all of the modules under CGI::* are CGI.pm
subclasses.

If you still want to change it, you'll have to upload a new
distribution with the right name, request a new registration, and set
the lifecycle of the old module to "Can be deleted".
