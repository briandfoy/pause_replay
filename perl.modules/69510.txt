From: xiong@sf-id.com (Xiong Changnian)

Many places urge me to submit my intended module's purposes *here* and
ask for suggestions for a name. This may be very wise in the case of a
module intended for, or almost ready for, CPAN upload; but my stuff is
nowhere near that. Still, I believe in conforming to accepted practice
and writing AS IF my code were going to be made public. 

I've read abstract recommendations: Don't arbitrarily create a top-level
namespace; noun::adj::adj; Local:: for stuff never to escape the fish
tank; etc. These are wise but insufficiently concrete. 

I'd like to see a list of *existing* top-level (or even 1 and 2 level)
namespaces, together with what is thought to belong in them. I don't see
this, not after much search. Perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places.
Suggestions?
