I understand your point about Gram-Schmidt not being the only algorithm
for orthonormalization. There *are* other algorithms, but the one I know
of involves singular value decomposition which is, as far as I know, as
yet unimplemented in Perl and will most likely not become availlable via
CPAN any time soon.

Gram-Schmidt is the algorithm you're most likely to be taught in a math
class because it's by far the most straightforward algorithm. It's just
not numerically stable.

Regardless, I imagine there is no infinite number of algorithms for this
task. That means it would be a good idea to put their implementations into
the same module with the name "Math::Orthonormalize". Of course, this is
unlikely to happen since people don't send patches, but upload a separate
module instead.

I'd prefer to keep the namespace since in my personal experience, I had a
very hard time finding modules for tasks that hid under the name of an
algorithm they used to implement whatever they do. Sometimes, you just
want a module for a specific task and don't know the name of an algorithm
to solve the problem.

My preference is supported by the fact that I don't think there's a good
chance of another implementation being made availlable any time soon.
