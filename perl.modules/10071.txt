The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nmap::Scanner
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perform nmap scans using OO perl
  userid:      MAXSCHUBE (Max Schubert)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    nmap hackers mailing list (www.insecure.org/nmap)

  similar:
    Found one author who started an Nmap wrapper but never released it
    ... talked to him and he had no problems with my work.

  rationale:

    This is my second application for a namespace ... last one was in
    December and I never heard from anyone . .. I have now uploaded my
    files so I hope I hear from someone this time about this.

    nmap is a well-known program among network types and my module is
    program-specific so i figured a top-level Nmap would work well ..
    also, the Scanner works nicely as there are other (not yet realeased
    to CPAN) module sets for use with nmap that start with the Nmap
    top-level token .. e.g.

    Nmap::Diff

The resulting entry would be:
