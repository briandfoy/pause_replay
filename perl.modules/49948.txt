Hello,

I have modified a module for my purposes, and tried to contact the
author to contribute my changes.  The email address bounces.  What
should I do?

I have thought of the following ideas:

1) take over the authorship (<-- is that a word?)
2) just push the modified module up to cpan and hope no one notices...
3) contact the author via some other method?

the module is Text::DHCPparse, and is version 0.07 as of  20 Oct 2002.
It was written by
John D. Shearer.

Thank you in advance...
