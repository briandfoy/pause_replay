Hi -

We have a better mousetrap solution for human verification; I'd like to
upload our integration to CPAN.  I'm looking at

http://search.cpan.org/~arthas/Captcha-Peoplesign-0.00005/lib/Captcha/Peoplesign.pm

as a model of how to do it.  I would like to use Captcha::AreYouAHuman for
a package namespace.  Does that seem reasonable?  Anything else I should
use?  I figured putting it under Captcha:: would be better than trying to
make a new top-level namespace?

Thanks,

Jonathan
