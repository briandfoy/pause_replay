The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Project_3D
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Project vectorial function from 3D to plane
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    I'm currently not reading any newsgroups, sorry. Try mailing me.

  similar:
    None I know of. None rhizomatic #perl could point me at.

  rationale:

    Given a function of three components and of an arbitrary number of
    parameters, the module allows you to project any point of the
    function (specified by its function parameters) onto an arbitrary
    plane in R^3 along any vector.

    Math:: was chosen because, well, it is Maths. Vector geometry.
    Project_3D was chosen because ology suggested it on #perl and I
    could not think of a more appropriate name. I'm open for suggestions
    at mail at steffen-mueller dot net.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
