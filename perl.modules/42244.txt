The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::SGF::Tournament
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: SGF-based tournament
  userid:      CLOWN (Al Nikolov)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    SGF is a file format used to store game records of two player board
    games. This module collects tournament information from a set of SGF
    files and produces statistics HTML tables. Although there is
    Games::Go::SGF namespace, application of this module is not
    restricted to the game of Go. So, i decided to register new
    namespace.

  enteredby:   CLOWN (Al Nikolov)
  enteredon:   Wed Aug  3 12:19:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::SGF::
::Tournament      adpOg SGF-based tournament                         CLOWN
