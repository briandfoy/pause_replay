Subject: Template Toolkit approaching release.

From: abw@cre.canon.co.uk ("Andy Wardley")

At long last I'm about ready to announce a 1.0 release of the Template
Toolkit.  This has been "in beta" for about 6 months and I'm happy that
it's ready for general consumption.  The modules have been drifting in
and out of CPAN for a while, and I'd like to get it indexed it in the
modules list.

The bundle comprises of 18 modules.  Most of these are Template::* and
a few are Template::Plugin::*.  There is one front-end module which
interfaces to the whole set and that is Template.pm.  Simon Matthews
has been working on a DBI plugin for the toolkit which is named
Template::Plugin::DBI.  .I imagine there will be more modules to
follow in this category (Template::Plugin::*) whereas Template::*
should remain fairly static.  The bundle is distributed as
Template-Toolkit.n.nn.tar.gz.

I'm not sure how these should best be described in the modules list.
I could list out all 18 modules with descriptions of what each does, e.g.

Template::
::Cache
::Constants
::Context
:: ...
::Utils

or I could just provide a description for the Template-Toolkit as a whole
and add descriptions separately for plugin modules:

Template-Toolkit - an extensible Perl toolkit for template processing.

Template::Plugin::
::DBI              Interface to DBI for Template Toolkit.

The DLSI for the Template Toolkit is 'RdpO'.  Simon will advise on the
DBI plugin some time RSN.

It might also be worth considering a slight re-organisation to create a
new sub-category within '11) String Processing et al' specifically for
the various template modules.  A rationalisation of the various modules
would be a good thing too, and I've had discussions with various other
module authors, some of whom are happy for their modules to be retired
where the Toolkit supercedes the functionality.  There are plenty of
modules which don't fit into this category, but we might be able to
simplify the list a little.

One that can certainly go is Text::MetaText, the predecessor to the
Template Toolkit.  I'm not supporting it any more now so it can be
deleted from the modules list for ever more.

Your guidance here would be appreciated.  Some of the users of the Toolkit
are getting restless that I'm not doing as much as I should be to promote
it, so I've been spurred into action.  We've currently got 2 different
application servers that have been rebuilt around the Toolkit and we're
discussing ways in which we can combine them together and start building
on them.  The potential is good, but now we'd like some more publicity :-)



Cheers
