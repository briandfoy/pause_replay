The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Nmap::XML
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: parse nmap xml-output data easily (-oX)
  userid:      APERSAUD (Anthony G Persaud)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is not a root namespace. The Parse::* namespace exists. The
    reason for the namespace is Parser::Nmap is such that Nmap can
    output various formats from its scans. Parse::Nmap::XML can handle
    the xml-output format produced by nmap version 3.00+. Hopefully,
    other users (or I if I have time) can write other parsers to
    different types of nmap output such as Parse::Nmap::Normal,
    Parse::Nmap::Greppable (etc).

    This module is a standalone parser for the xml-output. Sometimes
    you don't want to parse the output data directly piped from an nmap
    command (but this feature is available handled in the module also).
    Instead, you can have various nmap scans that run over night that
    are saved into xml files (or 1 huge one), and you can write a perl
    script using this module to effectively parse these files using the
    XML::Twig library (which makes it efficient to parse large XML
    files) and take the information which is easy to access, and put it
    in a mysql database (for example).

    An example of the usefulness of this module is (real-life
    application) is having an nmap scan that goes through large subnets,
    fingerprinting machines for os, services, hostnames..etc, saves all
    this information to an xml file format. The parsing of this xml
    (large) file can be done with this module, and the information can
    then be placed into a mysql network database that can be accessed by
    other applications
