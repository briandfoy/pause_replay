The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::FileSystem
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: manage tables like a filesystem
  userid:      AFRIKA (Alexander Haderer)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBI::Shell DBIx::CGITables DBIx::dbMan

  rationale:

    The module DBIx::FileSystem offers a filesystem like view to
    database tables. To interact with the database tables, FileSystem
    implements a command line shell which offers not only a subset of
    well known shell commands to navigate, view and manipulate data in
    tables, but also gives the convenience of history, command line
    editing and tab completion. FileSystem sees the database as a
    filesystem: each table is a different directory with the tablename
    as the directory name and each row in a table is a file within that
    directory.

    The motivation for FileSystem was the need for a terminal based
    configuration interface to manipulate database entries which are
    used as configuration data for a server process. FileSystem is
    neither complete nor a replacement for dbish or other full-feature
    SQL shells or editors. Think of FileSystem as a replacement for a
    Web/CGI based graphical user interface for manipulating database
    contents.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::FileSystem      bdpfg manage tables like a filesystem              AFRIKA
