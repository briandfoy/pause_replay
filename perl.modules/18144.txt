     why:

    As part of my master thesis in mathematics, I am develloping a
    bundle of modules that allow conversion of System Dynamics models
    created in Stella to any target language. I am currently supporting
    C, Java, Matlab and Perl. This allows you to run your model (much)
    faster and to plugin libraries, such as optimization algorithms in
    order to find values for policy parameters for which an objective
    functions from within the model reaches a global optimum. I have
    seperated the part the parses the (Stella) model and the part that
    does the output (in Perl, C, Java, etc.), so that it should be easy
    to add code that allows parsing of models written in other
    environments such as Powersim or Vensim. Adding additional output
    languages is very straight forward, all you need to do, is to
    subclass a class responsible for output and overwrite some methods
    specifying how the code should look like in your language of choice.

    For those of you, who are wondering what System Dynamics is, you
    might want to have a look at http://www.systemdynamics.org/

    An excerpt: "System dynamics is a methodology for studying and
    managing complex feedback systems, such as one finds in business and
    other social systems. In fact it has been used to address
    practically every sort of feedback system. While the word system has
    been applied to all sorts of situations, feedback is the
    differentiating descriptor here. Feedback refers to the situation of
    X affecting Y and Y in turn affecting X perhaps through a chain of
    causes and effects. One cannot study the link between X and Y and,
    independently, the link between Y and X and predict how the system
    will behave. Only the study of the whole system as a feedback system
    will lead to correct results."
