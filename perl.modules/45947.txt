Maybe it should. Since my old modules are in MSSQL I decided to
stick to that. There are good reasons to expect that anything
called MSSQL is most likely to run on Windows and only there,
anyway.

Not any good ones. It was only a working name originally, but I
could not think of anything better. Sqllib2 sounded fairly lame.

"Olle" is a boy's name in Swedish, and thus a small corruption of
OLE. Sort of like Pearl, if you like.
