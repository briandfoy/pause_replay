Hi,

I used the dark month of December (Northern Hemosphere) to have a
look at mail folders.  I was a little disappointed by the popular
Mail::Folder implementation, for quite some reasons (most importantly
its long status as alpha and lack of development).

There are other modules which can handle folders, but their are usually
rather limited in their functionality.

So: I gave it a try.  I have currently implemented:
  - Mbox folders
  - MH folders
  - Delay loading (it uses MIME::Entity, but that is quite slow.  My
    module try to keep messages un-parsed as long as possible.  Only
    when the message-data is needed, the content of the message is
    autoloaded and parsed.  This is an enormous speed improvement)
  - Basic thread detection.
  - Status labels and such.
  - A folder manager, which keeps track of opened folders in your program.
  - A tied interface to a folder.
  - Locking mechanisms.

All is written to be easily extendible: in cleanly seperated objects.

Module's status:
  - The functionality is implemented, but
  - many tests have to be added (currently 53 tests, but some parts of
    the code have never run, yet)
  - Detailed manual-pages are included and describe everything what
    is available now.

Eryq adviced me to go for a name-space in Mail::  and I agree.
I would like to go for   Mail::Box

Version 0.3 of my package is already uploaded into my M/MARKOV
directory.  Version 0.4 is underway and contains many more tests.

Sincerely,
