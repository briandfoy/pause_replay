From: betacomp@nagpur.dot.net.in ("Mukund")

I wish to register my perl module at cpan. The details are as under.

1. Name - Mukund Deshmukh.

2. Email - betacomp@nagpur.dot.net.in

3. Home Page - www.betacomp.com

4. Preferred ID - MUKUND

5. Description - This is a perl module for complete Interactive Voice
Response system using standard voice modem. Although it uses some code from
the SerialPort.pm, but voice interface is written by me. I had searched the
complete cpan and other archive but did not find any thing comparable and
easily usable. Following modules were found but had certain limitations.
Vgetty.pm - uses voice shell and vgetty which are slower in response and
unreliable.
Vbox.pm - Lack proper documentation and can not be used easily.

 This module easily integrates with all the requirement IVRS like tele
banking,  product information, voice mail, tele marketing, call center and
others.

5. Modules a description
Name Ivrs
::portinit - Initialized the serial port
::modeminit -initialize the modem and put in Voice mode.
::playget - play the voice file and get user data ( as dtmf tones)
::addmsg - add message to play string
::addval   - add numerical value to play string
::addtxt - add text to play string
::adddate- add date variable to play string.
::playlin - play the string created by above addition.
::recfile - record the voice message.
::pclose - close the modem and serial port.
more to  be added

6. Scripts, ports, documentation - The module uses standard perl 5.00 only,
and tested on i586 only as I do not access to other hardware. For
documentation, one readme file is included and demo scripts.

7. Release - The first version was released on Linux-India mailing list and
good response was found which encouraged me to further refined it.

8. Current development - At present complete voice mail system based is
being developed by me, which will enable telephone users to send and receive
voice mail, without a PC.

Finally further work is being done on the module and it will be ready in two
weeks.
