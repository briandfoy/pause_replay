..20 will come out tonight, if I can resolve some meta issues (email
address and the website docs).  It's not that much different from Mike's
0.19, and I think it's time to start releasing code and start patching
bugs.  You can get nightly cvs snap shots at:

http://www.dyndns.org/~ctriv/net-dns-snaps/

Net::DNS's new home will be http://www.net-dns.org/

Sorry if I got a little pissy towards you, it was a rough morning.  If
you're interested in Net::DNS, you should join the devel mailing list
(send a message to devel-request@lists.dyndns.org with 'subscribe' in the
subject).
