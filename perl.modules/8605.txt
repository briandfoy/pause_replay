Greetings!

I have written a miniature Wiki-environment with mod_perl and Apache, currently
going under the namespace Apache::MiniWiki, that I would like to contribute
to CPAN. In the future I also hope to contribute other modules and updated
versions of Apache::MiniWiki to allow people to construct their own Wikis
more easily.

My name is Jonas Oberg, <jonas@gnu.org>. I have a home page at
http://www.coyote.org/~jonas/ and I would, if appropriate, like
to have the user-ID "JONAS" on CPAN, but I'm not overly concerned
about the user-ID.

Thanks for your time.
