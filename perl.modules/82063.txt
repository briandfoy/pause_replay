We prefer that accounts point to individuals. It's never really worked
out for the company accounts that people have tried.

But, besides that, it's up to the primary maintainer to add
co-maintainers and we prefer that people try that before we mess with
things. You can check permissions with the "View Permissions":

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=me&pause9
9_peek_perms_query=Business%3A%3AOnlinePayment%3A%3ACyberSource&pause99_
peek_perms_sub=Submit

If you should be the primary maintainer, we should clear that up so you
can add co-maintainers.
