Yes.  Kind of.  One transliterates between scripts, and within a
script one transcribes between languages.

(ai kän foor iksampl transkraib inglish juusing finnish speling ruulz.)

I suggest Lingua, too.  There is already my Lingua::FI::Transcribe.

Such rules are always between two languages, of course, and often
also many-to-many (e.g. the multiple ways to spell Chinese names
in English).
