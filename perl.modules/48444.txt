The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lucene
  DSLIP:       bd+Op
  description: API to the Lucene search engine
  userid:      TBUSCH (Thomas Busch)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    PLucene, CLucene

  rationale:

    Lucene has become the industry standard for open source
    high-performance search. It was originally written in Java but has
    since been ported to C++.

    This module is a perl API to the C++ port of Lucene which maps the
    original Java API nearly 1 to 1.

    Unlike CLucene it offers full access to all functionalities of
    Lucene and is not just a reduced simplified API.

    Unlike PLucene which is a perl port of Lucene it offers true high
    performance.

    I except many programmers to build modules on the top of Lucene so
    this module really needs to be a the root of the namespace.

  enteredby:   TBUSCH (Thomas Busch)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 24 14:33:54 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lucene            bd+Op API to the Lucene search engine              TBUSCH
