Hi,

I noticed an incompatibility between EMC and dmake on windows, as it does not like the trailing spaces at Coverage.pm line 121 at all and just aborts, which makes the installation of modules like Captcha::reCaptcha fail.

I considered submitting a bug on RT, but considering that there are two unresolved tickets from 6 years ago and the last release of the dist was in 2005 i figured you're no longer interested in actually developing it further. As such i'll to cut to the chase:

Would you mind adding me as a comaint so i can get some fixes in there?
