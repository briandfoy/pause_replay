The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::UserDB
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Manage users & passwords in a (Mysql) DB
  userid:      WRW (William R Ward)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    perl.module-authors

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    I've been working on this for over 3 years, off and on, and am
    finally getting around to making it public. It uses a database
    (implemented with mysql but could be made to work with others) to
    store username, password, and user profile information for a
    website. Supports things like "forgot my password" and includes a
    reference implementation in the form of several CGI scripts.

    Initially I called it WWW::UserDB but changed it to CGI recently
    after some discussion on the module-authors list.

  enteredby:   WRW (William R Ward)
  enteredon:   Tue May 27 21:46:30 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::UserDB          adpOp Manage users & passwords in a (Mysql) DB     WRW
