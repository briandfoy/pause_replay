Hi PAUSE admins

I've had an offer from François Isabelle (ISABELLF) to help with
maintenance of the XML::SAX distro.  I'd like to give François
co-maintainer permissions but it turns out I can't because I only have
co-maintainer myself.

I emailed Matt Sergeant, who is the original owner of the module, on
November 14th but have had no reply.  It doesn't look like Matt has been
active on CPAN in the last 6 years.

I'd like to ask for ownership of the namespaces listed below to be
transferred to me so that I can manage it going forward.  The list also
includes the package namespaces included in the XML::SAX::Base distro
which is owned by Matt and I'm co-maintainer.

    XML::SAX
    XML::SAX::DocumentLocator
    XML::SAX::ParserFactory
    XML::SAX::PurePerl
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::DebugHandler
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::Exception
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::Productions
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::Reader
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::Reader::Stream
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::Reader::String
    XML::SAX::PurePerl::Reader::URI

    XML::SAX::Base
    XML::SAX::Base::NoHandler
    XML::SAX::Exception

If this is in any way controversial, can we please just get ISABELLF
added as co-maintainer?

Regards
Grant
