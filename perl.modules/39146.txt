Overview
========

In the five years since the first edition of this classic book was
published, Internet use has exploded. The commercial world has
rushed headlong into doing business on the Web, often without
integrating sound security technologies and policies into their
products and methods. The security risks--and the need to protect
both business and personal data--have never been greater. We've
updated Building Internet Firewalls to address these newer risks.

What kinds of security threats does the Internet pose? Some, like
password attacks and the exploiting of known security holes, have
been around since the early days of networking. And others, like
the distributed denial of service attacks that crippled Yahoo,
E-Bay, and other major e-commerce sites in early 2000, are in
current headlines.

Firewalls, a critical component of today's computer networks,
effectively protect a system from most Internet security threats.
They keep damage on one part of the network--such as eavesdropping,
a worm program, or file damage--from spreading to the rest of the
network. Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out
of control, dragging more and more systems down.

Like the bestselling and highly respected first edition, Building
Internet Firewalls, 2nd Edition, is a practical and detailed
step-by-step guide to designing and installing firewalls and
configuring Internet services to work with a firewall. Much expanded
to include Linux and Windows coverage, the second edition describes:

    Firewall technologies: packet filtering, proxying, network
    address translation, virtual private networks

    Architectures such as screening routers, dual-homed hosts,
    screened hosts, screened subnets, perimeter networks,
    internal firewalls

    Issues involved in a variety of new Internet services and
    protocols through a firewall

    Email and News

    Web services and scripting languages (e.g., HTTP, Java,
    JavaScript, ActiveX, RealAudio, RealVideo)

    File transfer and sharing services such as NFS, Samba

    Remote access services such as Telnet, the BSD "r" commands,
    SSH, BackOrifice 2000

    Real-time conferencing services such as ICQ and talk

    Naming and directory services (e.g., DNS, NetBT, the Windows
    Browser)

    Authentication and auditing services (e.g., PAM, Kerberos,
    RADIUS);

    Administrative services (e.g., syslog, SNMP, SMS, RIP and
    other routing protocols, and ping and other network
    diagnostics)

    Intermediary protocols (e.g., RPC, SMB, CORBA, IIOP)

    Database protocols (e.g., ODBC, JDBC, and protocols for
    Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft SQL Server)

The book's complete list of resources includes the location of many
publicly available firewall construction tools.
