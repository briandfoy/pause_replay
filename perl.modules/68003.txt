The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graphics::Asymptote
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A wrapper for Asymptote vector graphics
  userid:      DCMERTENS (David Mertens)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    PDL Mailing list, Asymptote user forum

  similar:
    Graphics::GnuplotIF

  rationale:

    This is an interface to a graphics language interpreter, so the
    naming Graphics::Asymptote seems fairly obvious. Asymptote is
    similar in flavor to TeX in that you write a script and the eventual
    product is a document (an eps figure), except that the language is
    largely based on C.

    My approach is unique in that there is no wrapper for Asymptote as
    far as I could tell, which is also why it should be listed. :)

    There is no direct relation between Graphics::GnuplotIF and my
    proposed module, in so far as I have not borrowed any code from the
    project, I have not attempted to emulate the interface, and I am not
    targetting gnuplot. However, the mentioned module operates in a
    similar fashion to mine, sending commands to an interpreter through
    a pipe, with the goal of creating plots.

The resulting entry would be:

Graphics::
::Asymptote       RdpOp A wrapper for Asymptote vector graphics      DCMERTENS
