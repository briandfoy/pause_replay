     why:

    Two Modules: 1) Serial Port Scanning Module. Scans for hardware
    devices that respond to a message at multiple com ports, baud rates
    and settings (8N1). Solves common problem for hardware enthusiasts
    where a device/controller is hooked up to the computer and the
    location and settings are unknown (common with USB virtual com
    ports). Uses Device::SerialPort or Win32::SerialPort depending upon
    OS.

    2) UBW (USB Bit Whacker) controller interface. Interfaces with a
    device hooked up to a serial port to send it command that is
    configured to do whatever: interact with sensors, motors, relays,
    etc.
