Subject: Module submission JavaScript::Lite
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JavaScript::Lite
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: Bare-bones interface to the SpiderMonkey API
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    rt.cpan.org; JavaScript

  similar:
    JavaScript.pm

  rationale:

    JavaScript.pm tries to do to much, with rich translation of objects
    and classes between JS and perl, binding JS functions to perl
    coderefs, etc.

    This is all great, except that it adds additional overhead, and it
    appears impossible to prevent JavaScript.pm from leaking memory or
    getting slower the more you throw at it.

    JavaScript::Lite aims to do less so that it can run faster and with
    less memory.

The resulting entry would be:

JavaScript::
::Lite            adcOp Bare-bones interface to the SpiderMonkey API CRAKRJACK
