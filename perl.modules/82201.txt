From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

I've just removed some co-maint bits from RKITOVER for DBIx::Class related
projects I was maint on some of them, on one set ILMARI was maint but
was aware as of April that this might need to be done and said that if he
wasn't online at the time I was welcome to use 'Select User/Action' to
complete the set (ILMARI got maint from BLBLACK when he retired as
maintainer, which I organised at the time).

There's nothing particularly exciting going on here, just a temporary
reshuffle while we re-do the development/review/release process and try to
separate the roles a bit.

There may be a small amount of noise due to RKITOVER not being entirely
pleased about this, but it's a project internal matter other than my
invoking my permission from ILMARI, which anybody who's curious about it
is welcome to confirm.
