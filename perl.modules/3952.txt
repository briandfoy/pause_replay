Hi,

I have written a module called Net::SMS::Genie to send SMS messages using
the Genie web site (for UK mobiles): http://www.genie.co.uk/. There is
already a Net::SMS module, which uses the SimpleWire messaging network, but
this doesn't apprear to work with UK mobiles (hence this module). I have
mailed Genie to inform them of this, and asked if they have any objection to
making the code availabiel publicly - no response as yet. The module still
requires the user to register on their site so I can't see any real
objection. The initial version (pending namespage approval!) is available on
CPAN at
http://cpan.perl.org/modules/by-module/Net/Net-SMS-Genie-0.001.tar.gz.
Please let ne know if you approve of the name, and if not what name you
would suggest.

Many thanks,

Ave Wrigley.
