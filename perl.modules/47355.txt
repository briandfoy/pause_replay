The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::TriLogic
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: 3-way logic and related operations
  userid:      MHASCH (Martin Hasch)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.org, mailing list if demand arises

  similar:
    Math::Logic

  rationale:

    While binary logic is the foundation of most digital systems and
    binary logical operations are built into the Perl core, 3-way logic
    (or tri-logic as I like to call it) could be the paradigm of choice
    for a computer with 3-valued "bits". A basic information unit with
    three values can represent the result of a comparison operation (-1,
    0, 1) just as well as a value of the tuple ("yes", "no", "dunno") or
    ("yes", "no", "not applicable").

    Math::TriLogic will provide a comprehensive set of logical
    operations a 3-valued-bits computer might have, through methods on
    Math::TriLogic objects. These include extended versions of boolean
    operations already covered in Math::Logic (not, and, or, xor) but
    also operations specific to 3-way-logic with no dual equivalent,
    like e.g. some sort of addition modulo 3. There also will be
    functionality dealing with the aggregation of single bits to larger
    units of information, and some operations will have both logical and
    bitwise variants.

    I feel a lot of this stuff is either too specific to be put into
    Math::Logic or falls outside its scope of pure logic. Secondly, I
    would like to keep away of operator overloading since proper Perl
    has not enough logical operators anyway (for 3-way logic, that is).
    A final reason justifying a separate module is that some of the
    definitions are still experimental and may need some polishing
    before they should be considered to be coupled with more mainstream
    functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::TriLogic        cdpOp 3-way logic and related operations           MHASCH
