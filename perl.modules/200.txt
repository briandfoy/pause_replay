Nice features would also be

	4a.  Assuming "now" is X, list all the events
	     that will happen "next".
	4b.  Assuming "now" is X, tell when event Y is going
	     to happen next.

Both these could of course be projected also backwards in time,
though I don't know how often that feature would be used.
