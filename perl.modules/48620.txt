     why:

    Project and Editor aware version of ctags (ptags.pl) for Perl.

    Uses config file $HOME/ptags.rc to get info on command line
    arguments, project directories, and libraries. Will keep tags for
    all projects and libraries up to date on each invocation.

    To speed this up, ptags.pl knows how to determine which source
    files are more recently modified than the tags files and the -u
    command line arg tells it to update only those. This is dramatically
    faster than wholesale rebuilds. It is also better than -a (append)
    since you aren't left with duplicate tag entries.

    ptags.pl also is editor aware. If your favorite editor requires
    only one tag file (Ultra Edit is an example), ptags.pl knows how to
    bring all your library and project tags together into one tag file
    and manage them there. If on the other hand, your editor is
    comfortable with multiple tag files (VIM is an example of this type)
    pltag.pl knows how to manage multiple tags files in multiple
    locations.
