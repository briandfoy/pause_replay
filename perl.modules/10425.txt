Hey, I recently uploaded a module containing a lot of miscellaneous-type
helpful functions ( D/DO/DOCG/Toolbox-0.51.tar.gz ).  Having pondered its
name for some time, I was still unable to come up with anything that fit
inside a currently existing category. In the interests of neatness, I was
hoping somebody might download the module and suggest a name or two that
DOES fit into the current categories.

Thanks very much,
j
