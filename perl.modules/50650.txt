Hi,

I'm trying to track down Bernd Dulfer (bernd@widd.de and
bdulfer@cpan.org) to write up a review of two of his CPAN modules:

Sybase::RepAgent
Sybase::TdsServer

I've received no responses from him.  I'm hoping that one of you have
better luck contacting him.  If he is unwilling or unreachable, I would
volunteer to maintain these two modules.

thanks

Jason L. Froebe

Hi Bernd,

Not sure if you received my previous email or not.  Are you still
maintaining these two modules?

thanks

Jason
