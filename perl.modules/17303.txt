Understood, and at this point I've installed the majority of these modules and
gone over examples and pods.  My impression so far is that there's already a
great deal of redundancy on CPAN, with the only real differences being
syntactical style and method of implementation.  I can understand your
reticence from that perspective.

Even so, I think what I've got here is easy to use and useful, but, then, it
fits my style of coding.  The only question is whether *you* guys think it
offers enough benefits to gain a place in CPAN.

Well, that's part of my problem.  It's a hybrid module in the sense that it
combines a couple of concepts, from containers to accessors, to events.  It's
certainly not as discrete as many of the existing modules.  A more descriptive
(and yet short) name I can't really think of at the moment.
