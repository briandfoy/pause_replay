Request to register new user

fullname: Steve Bussetti
  userid: CLONE
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://piratesandme.net
     why:

    I've been too lazy over the years about not codifying and uploading
    my modules. I plan on uploading various utility grade modules i have
    written and found useful.
