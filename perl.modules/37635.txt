Request to register new user

     why:

    A package to help build RESTful Applications which is modeled after
    "CGI::Application". My package differs from WWW::REST because that
    package is intended for RESTful clients (and is rather
    experimental). The package I wrote is intended for server side use
    in creating RESTful APIs.

    The current working name of the package is REST::Application. From
    what I hear about the strictness of the CPAN namespace I expect that
    to be changed, which I'm okay with. However, I'll deal with that
    through the process outlined in the PAUSE FAQ.
