The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rosetta
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Framework for RDBMS-generic apps and schemas
  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org, victoria-pm@pm.org

  similar:
    more than fit here; eg: DBI, Alzabo, SQL::Schema, DBIx::AnyDBD,
    SQL::Builder, DBIx::Browse, DBIx::Abstract, DBIx::SearchBuilder, ...

  rationale:

    This framework was previously announced (had an request for
    registration or comments) under the name "DBIx::Portable" within the
    last week (on Jan 5); it was renamed to "Rosetta", which is a root
    level namespace, based on the suggestions of Tim Bunce and Brian D
    Foy, that frameworks should have root-level namespaces, and that my
    framework shouldn't have "DBI" as a substring of its name.

    I haven't had the chance to rewrite a nice-sounding summary for the
    newly refocused and renamed framework, so please see the following
    urls for suitable discussion or documentation:

    -
    http://search.cpan.org/author/DUNCAND/DBIx-Portable-0.01/Portable.pm
    (this is the first POD release; that url will not work for more than
    a few weeks, but the replacement will be accessible under
    http://search.cpan.org/author/DUNCAND/)

    - http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg16666.html
    (thread root of my initial registration request)

    - http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg16777.html
    (description for part of adjusted focus to be taken up, or just a
    general addition or clarification to existing docs)

    Thank you.

    BTW, I am not subscribed to modules@perl.org, although I read it in
    the archive. Please cc any replies to this list thread to my own
    address, so I have an email copy of it, which is more reliable to
    reply to and persist meta-data that relates thread parts.

The resulting entry would be:
