Hello

I'd like to request use of the DBIx::Safe namespace for a module I've
recently released to the public. It looks as though there is already a
registered DBIx::Safe namespace, although nothing has been uploaded
there yet. I'd like to humbly propose a different namespace for the
existing module proposal, the description of which is:

"Handles all DB disconnections transparently"

My version of DBIx::Safe is actually an analog to the common Safe
module, in that it attempts to create a safe DBI object, by allowing and
restricting what can be run.

In addition, the code is finished, released, and ready to be uploaded.
More details about it can be found here:

Thank you
