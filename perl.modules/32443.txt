The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Create ties without creating full packages
  userid:      HANENKAMP (Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    modules-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Tie::Filter

  rationale:

    Awhile back I created the Tie::Filter package. We were discussing
    possible titles for the package on module-authors and it was
    suggested that a more general Tie::Simple might be even better. That
    didn't really fit my goals at the time, but for another project, it
    does.

    Therefore, I've gone back and implemented Tie::Simple. The class
    basically allows you to write an anonymous tie package. It's not yet
    implemented as well as I'd like, but it serves my current needs and
    I will probably improve it in the future (mostly it needs better
    SUPER dispatching and more @ISA flexibility).

    Thanks, Sterling
