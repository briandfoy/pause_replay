Hello maintainers of the modulelist,

I'm Michael Witthaut. I study Information technologies at the Berufsakademie
Mannheim Germany. I've written a script, that audit objects in Windows NT
4.0 file system and registry and I'd like to contribute this script to the
CPAN archieve.

Name: Michael Witthaut
Email address: michael.witthaut@azubi.siemens.de
preferred user-ID: WITTHAUT
Description:

INTEGRITY, a change detection and integrity checking for Windows NT

The program takes a snapshot of objects in the filesystem or registry of
Windows NT 4.0 that a specified in a configuration file. It audits the
valuenames and values in the registry and size, content, date of the last
modification and other properties of the specified files.
The next time you run a check the current system is compared to the existing
database in order to detect any changes. If there are any changes they are
reported in a file and to the Windows Nt EventLog. This allows you to
integrate this Skript into a network management system. For example
TransView or Tivoli audit the EvntLog of many machines and can alarm the
administrator if integrity has detected any changes to the specified
objects.
Other integrity checking software like tripwire or intact which are very
expensive, abou $500 per licence, are very conplex and do not provide any
information about how the registry has changed. My program can do that and
it is easily controlled with a command line interface and a configuration
file.

Please tell me if it is necessary to dicuss it publicly. It's only dicussed
with some NT administrytors in the company I'm working for in the moment.

Is it possible to contribute it to the CPAN archieve or do you think there
is no need for such a tool in the CPAN?

If you like to test the program I will send the source and a documentation
to you.

Pleas answer me question.

I like to thank you for your interest.

Yours faithfully

Michael Witthaut
