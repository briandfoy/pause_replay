The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Lyskom
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: library for talking to Lyskom servers.
  userid:      CDYBED (Calle Dybedahl)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    The "perlkom" conference in Lysator's Lyskom server
    (kom.lysator.liu.se)

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Lyskom conference system lies somewhere in between IRC and
    USENET. It's been around since 1990, and is a moral descendant of
    similar systems dating back to QZ-KOM at the Royal Institute of
    Technology in Stockholm around 1978. It's client/server based, using
    a wire protocol called "protocol A", which is far too generic a term
    for me to chose it as the name of the module. The main client runs
    in GNU Emacs, but there are standalone clients available for at
    least Unix- and MS Windows-based systems. This module is primarily
    meant to be used when writing robots importing information to a
    Lyskom server. Existing applications include screenscapers importing
    news from newspaper websites, and a more general importer for RSS
    feeds.

    To be honest, I'm not sure that this module should be included in
    the module list. The target audience is only a few thousand people
    in Sweden. It's been requested that I upload it to CPAN, to make it
    easier to find and install for people outside Lysator Academic
    Computer Society, but that works even without including it in the
    list, so...

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Lyskom          RdpOa library for talking to Lyskom servers.       CDYBED
