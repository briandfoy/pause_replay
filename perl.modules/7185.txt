How about an auto-responder or a ticketing system with auto-responder
capability?  The author of RT (http://fsck.com/projects/RT/) hangs
around on #perl on infobot.org and has offered to help set up a ticket
system if we wanted one.

At least then we could set it up to send each person an email like "Hi,
we got your message, we're very busy, but here's some general info for
you in the meantime, and you can track this ticket at <URL> if you
want".  RT has an email interface so it's easy to close tickets by just
replying to the email and adding a pseudo-header like "Status: closed"
or something (IIRC).
