Hi Tom,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

You have ownership of the package name =E2=80=9CUnderScore=E2=80=9D, =
which relates to:
    T/TO/TOMC/scripts/CS-Talk/source/dstructs/ties/UnderScore.pm.gz
This is listed in the CPAN Index, but doesn=E2=80=99t appear against =
your id on MetaCPAN or search.cpan.org, so is essentially unreachable.

Your ownership of UnderScore conflicts with =E2=80=9Cunderscore=E2=80=9D, =
which is owned by DANKOGAI:
    D/DA/DANKOGAI/underscore-0.01.tar.gz

I can think of several ways to resolve the conflict:

 1. drop your ownership of UnderScore, but leave the file on CPAN
 2. drop ownership and delete the file from CPAN as well
 3. rename the module, release a new dist, then drop the permission and =
delete the existing file

If you want to go with either 1 or 2, I=E2=80=99m happy to do these for =
you, since I=E2=80=99m working through situations like this.

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let these kind of conflicts arise now, so I=E2=80=99=
m working through the existing cases (this is your only occurrence in my =
hit list).

Thanks,
Neil=
