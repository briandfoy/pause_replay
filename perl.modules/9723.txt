I recently wrote a module (which I am currently calling Shared.pm).  Shared 
allows data to be shared across processes on a single/multiple machine(s) 
through the use of a forked tcp server and Storable.pm.  I've spent quite 
some time fine tuning/debugging the module, and I feel its finally stable 
enough to release.  Although I plan to add several more features to the 
module (including defining custom serialization, XML support, built-in 
encryption, etc), I feel that releasing it publicly can only have a 
positive benefit.

The module contains 3 packages: Shared::Local, Shared::Remote, and 
Shared::Retriever.  Shared is just a temporary name I picked because I 
needed to name it something;  I'm open to anything.  At any rate, I'd like 
to register the module under some name space and make it publicly available :)

The code for Shared.pm is at:
