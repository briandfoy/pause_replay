Hi Jeff, in addition to this patch, I'm about to release an updated
version of HTML::Element, which I maintain, that will break
XML::TreeBuilder unless it is patched. I will be making a patch for
XML::TreeBuilder and XML::Element later today.

FYI I put the code up at http://github.com/jfearn/XML-TreeBuilder
since I couldn't find a public repo.

I'm CCing modules@perl.org since I just  noticed the instructions on
the pause site to do so.

Cheers, Jeff.
