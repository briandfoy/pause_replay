Subject: cpan tool doesn't like NetAddr:IP
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: ric@ms.Telcom.Arizona.EDU (Ric Anderson - SIRT)

Hi:
Graham Barr at cpan.org suggested I report this problem here.

As of Oct 14, 2005, at 09:59 AM the list of modules that the "cpan"
tool fetches (02packages.details.txt.gz) is out of step with the
version of NetAddr:IP.  www.cpan.org says NetAddr:IP version 3.028 is
available and that is on sites like carroll.cac.psu.edu.  The problem
is that the index file says NetAddr:IP is version 3.025, so a
  cpan -i NetAddr:IP
tries
  ftp://carroll.cac.psu.edu/pub/CPAN/authors/id/L/LU/LUISMUNOZ/NetAddr-IP-3.25.tar.gz
which does not exist.

FYI,
Ric
