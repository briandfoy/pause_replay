I'm not sure who to send this to. I am using the perlcc that comes with perl
version 5.6.0. I have noticed that if a .pm file has a __END__ statement in
the middle of the file perlcc stops loading the .pm file at that point. Any
subs defined after the __END__ statement are not loaded. First, how do I
report this problem (if it is) to the developers? Second, what is the
purpose of the __END__ statement in the middle of a .pm file?
