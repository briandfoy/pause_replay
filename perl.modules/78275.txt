The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::Boxer
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Create PDFs from simple box-type markup
  userid:      LECSTOR (Jason Galea)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    https://github.com/lecstor/PDF--Boxer,
    http://prepan.org/module/3Yz7PYrBH6

  similar:
    PDF::Template

  rationale:

    "Boxer" is derived from the css "box model". PDF::Boxer doesn't try
    to replicate that but uses a similar model. PDF::Template does
    similar things but I don't think it automates quite as much (eg row
    heights) and it uses PDFLib which requires a commercial license.
    There is apparently a version which uses PDF::Writer which can use
    PDF::API2 but I can't figure out how to install that via cpanm..
    (https://metacpan.org/release/PDF-Template-PDFAPI2)

  enteredby:   LECSTOR (Jason Galea)

The resulting entry would be:

PDF::
::Boxer           adpOp Create PDFs from simple box-type markup      LECSTOR
