Yup.

> I was able to upload my module. 

Good.

> My module is registered, since it shows up on CPAN.

No. If you have a CPAN id, you can upload modules. Registration is
only necessary to get them in the registered modules database.

> However, I can't edit any information regarding my module.

Since it is not yet in the database.

> Is this supposed to happen?

It is done now.
