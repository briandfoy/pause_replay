Folks,

I had sent this mail a couple of weeks ago.. The perl site mentioned that
it would take a week or so to get the ID.

I guess you guys have been busier than usual.. Is there a way for me to
find out what the status of this is?

Thanks
rv

Description: Whitespace module  to detect and cleanup bogus whitespaces
             in files. Accompanied by a whitespace program that uses it,
             as an example.

Whitespace     MdpO  Detect and cleanup bogus whitespace in files ???

The whitespace program itself is a tool to help developers cleanup
spaces that are useless or bogus (like leading space, trailing space,
end-of-line space, etc..)

An emacs-lisp version of this ships as a library with GNU Emacs (whitespace.el)

I have never contributed modules to perl itself, (just a bug fix to Pod/Html.pm
a week or so ago) so I'm not sure what to say about myself.

I maintain GNU Cons (http://www.gnu.org/software/cons/) and do some hacking
for GNU.
