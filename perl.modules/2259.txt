    modules@perl.org is a council of wise elders who give advice on
module naming, when they feel that their wisdom is applicable.  A more
accurate version of the above quote might be:

    `Generally, a lack of response can be taken as an indication
    that there is nothing blatantly stupid about your proposal.'

    Some of us appreciate some imagined level of privacy.  What benefit
will you achieve from knowing each member's name and email address?

    Their responsibility is to listen when they have time, and to consider
the future of CPAN before they speak.

    There is very little law on PAUSE.  To quote 04pause.html, `Please, talk
to modules@perl.org before you decide upon the namespace'.  Note the use of
`please' and the absence of `must'.  Certain top-level namespaces (e.g.,
Sun::, DBI::) are controlled by force of law, and are documented as such.
Otherwise, you are simply requested to play nicely with others.

    I certainly want to support your efforts and the efforts of others to
contribute to CPAN, but I don't see how you've been kept from contributing.
I find CPAN (specifically PAUSE) to be unbelievably open, and fairly well
documented.  Your legitimate complaints seem to be based in not finding,
reading, understanding, and/or trusting the documentation.  Do you think
there's a documentation problem, an access problem, or another sort of
problem?

    <IMHO>I am happy to be outspoken and say that I don't want to make
things _too_ easy.  There's a certain level of commitment that's required
to participate effectively in CPAN, and I think that's a good thing, because
what we need most is committed and well-informed participants.</IMHO>

    That being said, modules@perl.org isn't a discussion forum; it is
requested that the substantial discussion take place elsewhere first.

    I hope that I haven't been discouraging in my tone, unless you're
easily discouraged, in which case I hope that I was extremely
discouraging.  :^)
