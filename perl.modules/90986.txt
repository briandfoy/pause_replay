The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::MultiChannel
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Multi-Channel, Multi-target logging
  userid:      PLAPOINTE (Paul LaPointe)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::Channel

  rationale:

    This is a full-featured logging module that includes capabilities
    desirable for complicated software projects that involve multiple
    components and systems.

    Log::Channel is somewhat similar. This adds the ability to -
    Forward log messages on sockets, etc, - Provide a fully custom print
    handler as a call back. - Map a channel to more than one log. -
    Enable or disable log messages based on the perl module they came
    from.

    Features: - Multi-channel logging, with the ability to enable or
    disable channels dynamically. - Channels can be mapped to multiple
    Log files for duplication of messages. - Channels can be optional
    color coded. Each log file can enable or disable the color feature.
    - Channels can be selectively enabled for messages from specific
    modules.

    Advanced features: - Channels can be mapped to your own handles
    (Eg. socket) for writing to things beside log files. - Each Log file
    can use its own print function, or default to the one provided.

    Features for limiting and cycling logs: - Log files can optionally
    be limited to a specific line count. - Old copies of log files can
    optional be preserved or overwritten. - Old log files can be
    optionally moved to a different directory.
