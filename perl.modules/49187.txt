I see :) You also have to login to rt or else the download is an html  
page telling you to login.

I've logged in, downloaded it locally and uploaded the file from my  
disk.

Once it hits the mirrors feel free to do do a diff on it and your  
repository and apply the diff yo your repository and commit that.

that way your repository will be in sync with whats on CPAN an d you  
can do it whenever you have a spare moment

Thanks!
