     why:

    Have been writing Perl code for 15+ years and would like to
    contribute back to the Perl community.

    There is a module named Radio::Thermostat for interfacing with a
    wifi thermostat available on the Radio Thermostat wiki
    (http://central.isaroach.com/wiki/index.php/Perl) The previous
    author had never had a chance to complete the module and/or upload
    it to CPAN. With his permission, I will be taking over maintenance
    of this module and would like to make it available to everyone via
    CPAN.
