The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Anansi::Database
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A manager for database interaction.
  userid:      ANANSI (Kevin Treleaven)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Continuing in the Anansi system of simplicity of use, this module
    is designed to provide seamless interaction with any installed
    Anansi database component defined within the "Anansi::Database::"
    namespace. Tying each database connection into it's own object means
    that keeping track of handles is no longer necessary and disconnect
    and finish can be correctly automated on object destruction. As a
    single method now handles all SQL statements and allows for the
    preparation and binding of field data and as each SQL statement can
    now have it's own identifier, database interaction has become more
    dynamic.

  enteredby:   ANANSI (Kevin Treleaven)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun  6 01:48:02 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Anansi::
::Database        adpOp A manager for database interaction.          ANANSI
