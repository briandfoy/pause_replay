Hi Steffen,

     Thanks for the suggestions/thoughts.  I ran it
by the pdl-porters community and have decided
that

(1) PDL::Graphics::POGL is the best namespace
      to use as it maintains parallelism with
      PDL::Graphics::TriD which it intends to
      replace/refactor.

(2) Given #1 above, it makes more sense to have
      the chapterid the same as PDL:
     
          06-Data Type Utilities

Regards,
Chris Marshall
PDL Developer
