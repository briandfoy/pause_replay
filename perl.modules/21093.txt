The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::BenchmarkResults
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Averages and compares benchmark runs
  userid:      JTITUS (Jason Titus)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It processes data, and it deals with benchmark results. It could
    also be more generally described as dealing with sets of 1d or 2d
    arrays, but the model is more specifically useful for benchmark
    result processing.

    This module should be listed in the CPAN module list because many
    people do benchmarking and must do a great deal of manual data
    manipulation before being able to publish the results. This module
    enables a great deal of automation of benchmarking and result
    analysis. I am currently using it in this way with iozone.

  enteredon:   Wed May 14 06:12:57 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::BenchmarkResults adpOp Averages and compares benchmark runs         JTITUS
