The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Web::DataService
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: framework for building web data services
  userid:      MMCCLENN (Michael McClennen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Dancer

  rationale:

    This module is built on top of Dancer, and provides a unique
    framework for building a particular type of web application. It
    implements much of the processing involved in responding to an HTTP
    data request.

    Using the methods provided by this module, one starts by defining a
    set of output formats, output blocks, vocabularies, and parameter
    rules, followed by a set of data service operations. Each of these
    objects is configured by a set of attributes, optionally including
    documentation strings.

    One continues by writing one or more classes whose methods will
    handle the "meat" of each operation: constructing one or more
    queries on the backend data system and fetching the resulting data.
    This module then handles the rest of the work necessary for handling
    each data service request, including serializing the result in the
    appropriate output format.
