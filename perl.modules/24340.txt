The Local Demographic Analysis Workshop (LDAW)™ will teach you to extract,
query, download, analyze and present 2002-1990 demographic data for
Honolulu and other Hawaiian Islands.  The Census Bureau recently released
2002 Census (ACS) data for Honolulu and other large communities. These data
can provide analysts, grant writers, activists and community planners with
a current snap shot of community demographics.  Data include variables such
as income, race/ethnicity, age, language, transportation and many others.
Specifically, in this is unique, hands on workshop participants will use
disaggregated data from the 2002 American Community Survey (ACS) and 2000
Census of Population and Housing data, for various geographies from
neighborhood level to nationally. Participants receive a LDAW workbook that
includes the workshop presentation, exercises, reference materials and a
valuable Demographic Data Resource CD™ that includes useful GIS tools such
as ArcExplorer and several shapefiles. Participants will also receive
Information Activist™, a quarterly e-letter highlighting new data rich
websites and interesting social research. (For a detailed agenda,
description of materials and to see workshop reviews, visit
www.smartgirltechnologies.com). 

Participants will:

• Learn the most efficient process to extract, query, download and analyze
data from the American Factfinder website;
• Construct a Local Community Change Profile™ which is comprised of 30 key
demographic variables and customized for Honolulu and a Census tract within
Honolulu (participants may also substitute their own community);
• Learn analytical, demographic and spatial analysis techniques including
commonly used mathematical formulas to transform raw data into compelling
information;
• Learn the strengths and weaknesses of the Census and ACS including
accuracy issues; 
• Learn about Census geography including:
  -What to do when your target area boundaries don't fit Census boundaries;
  -Figuring out if your tract boundaries have changed between 1990 and 2000
and if so, what to do about it;
  -Demonstration of ArcExplorer, a free map browser produced by ESRI;
• Learn techniques to present data in clear, compelling ways in terms of
tabular and graphical data.
This workshop is customized for Hawaii, however all techniques and
methodologies are directly transferable to any other geography.  Workshops
are also offered in most metropolitan cities including NYC, DC, Chicago and
Boston.
