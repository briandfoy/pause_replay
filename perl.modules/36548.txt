The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       L4Env::Dice
  DSLIP:       cmhOp
  description: Perl extension to the L4Env API
  userid:      EROB (Etienne Robillard)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/perl-L4

  similar:
    CORBA::XS CORBA::Perl

  rationale:

    L4Env::Dice - perl extension to the L4Env API

    This module consist of developing a group of related modules
    designed to ease the process of developing L4 interfaces.

    The current rationale is yet highly volatile, thus we expect the
    implementation to change (very often) in the future.

    Meanwhile, L4Env::Dice has no code yet. Our ubiquitous philosophy
    consist of developing a toolkit -- inspired in part by Wardley's
    excellent Template::Toolkit -- in a way that we can develop more
    easily applications on top of L4.

    So pratically, we're to develop a set of tools, backends and their
    related documentation pages, explaining how to develop stuff for the
    L4Env programming environment.

The resulting entry would be:

L4Env::
::Dice            cmhOp Perl extension to the L4Env API              EROB
