That's the thing, you see. At first I just wanted to USE a Dict
module. I saw that ABIGAIL registered it in the module list, so I
contacted her in order to obtain some information regarding whether
such module exists, being worked on or what. I got no response. So I
went on and wrote the module. Now people go to the module list, see
the entry and (wrongly) assume that Net::Dict does not exist.

Yes. There will be additional modules under the Crypt hierarchy, but I
don't know yet their exact names. BTW, are the Crypt modeuls related
in any way to the Cryptix LTD? On
http://www.cryptix.org/dist/Cryptix-1.16.tar.gz they have a
distribution of a set of modules that has some (but not all) modules
common with the CPAN's list. Who do I have to talk to in order to add
the missing ones to CPAN?
