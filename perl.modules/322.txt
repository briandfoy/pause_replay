To help future visitors with the same problem, I just added this text
on the top:

        The select box shows all the modules that have been registered
        for user JPRIT officially via modules@perl.org, i.e. that have
        been included into the module list. If you are missing certain
        pieces, please let modules@perl.org know. Tell them which
        modules you would like to have registered, if possible in
        module list format, that is: with DSLI status and a 44
        character description. Please decide upon the chapter of the
        module list where each module should presumably live in.
        Please include everything else that might be relevant for the
        submission. If you have already talked to them but your module
        doesn't show up here, it might help to find the relevant posts
        in the archives. For more information about the registration
        process, please visit modules/04pause.html on CPAN. Thank you
        for your help!
