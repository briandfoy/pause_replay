The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GOYAX
  DSLIP:       Mdphg
  description: GOYAX - MVC Web Application Framework
  userid:      GOYAX (GOYAX development team)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Catalyst

  rationale:

    The "CMS" behind GOYAX.de is a huge set of modules consisting of
    several thousand of lines of code. Our core development team is
    constantly extending and refactoring this more likely called "MVC
    Web Application Framework", which is delivering several millions of
    page impression each month. Our approach in contrast with e.g.
    Catalyst is, that you can install and use it like for instance
    Wordpress, TYPOlight, Joomla or any other PHP-CMS, which goal is to
    be used and not to be developed. On the other hand GOYAX provides as
    many possibilities to develop your own web application as most of
    the other MVC Web Application Frameworks.

  enteredby:   GOYAX (GOYAX development team)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb  4 10:33:04 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GOYAX             Mdphg GOYAX - MVC Web Application Framework        GOYAX
