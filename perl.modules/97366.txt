Was this situation resolved to everyone's satisfaction?   When I left this
issue, the team at MS had restored the mail alias, and the engineer working
on it told me they are committed to supporting it and working to resolve
some of the open issues.  I have been out of the loop since then.

Did you manage to at least start communicating with the module owners, I
hope?

If there's anything else I can do to help out, jut let me know and I'll try=
.
