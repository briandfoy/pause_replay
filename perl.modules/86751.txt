The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Melody
  DSLIP:       MmhOg
  description: A secure, proven and high-powered CMS
  userid:      JAYALLEN (Jay Allen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openmelody,
    https://github.com/openmelody/melody, #openmelody and
    #openmelody-talk on Freenode

  similar:
    Bundle::Melody::Test and Bundle::Melody::extlib both install modules
    required by Melody for either normal use or developer testing

  rationale:

    We are not firmly wedded to a top-level Melody namespace, if there
    is something else deemed more appropriate. However, the application
    will consist of over 200 internal modules using that namespace (once
    they are converted from "MT::" which was used by its ancestor
    Movable Type) out in the wild so it would be preferable to reserve
    it in order to prevent collisions with random 3rd-party modules that
    might try to use it in the future.

    A top-level namespace seems to make the most sense from a developer
    standpoint (certainly that of a Melody developer who has to type it
    in constantly :) and other similar examples of this app-as-namespace
    usage already exist such as Mason, Padre, Pinto, Galileo, Kwiki,
    Bryar, Solstice, etc

The resulting entry would be:
