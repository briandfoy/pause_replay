Are Matrix and/or MatrixReal still being maintained ?

I am looking for something to do matrix/vector operations for 
colour space conversions for a Tk app I am looking at.

I was looking for something much simpler that Math::MatrixReal, but 
with overloading, e.g. to convert xyz and rgb space : 

my $xform  = new Matrix [[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]];

my $xyz    = $xform * [$r, $g , $b];

my $ixform = $xform->invert;

my $rgb = $ixform * $xyz;

My main issue with MatrixReal is not with the matrices but the vectors 
- it would be good to be able to use raw perl arrays as vectors as above.
- it would be even better if returned 'vector' took account  of context:

my ($r,$g,$b ) = $ixform * $xyz;

Is Math::Matrix up for additions or should I go for new class (say) 

   Math::MatrixXform;
