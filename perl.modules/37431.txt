Request to register new user

fullname: David J. Shultz
  userid: DSCHULTZ
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I am actually already a member of PAUSE (DSHULTZ) but I don't
    recall my password and have not received the email(s) when
    attempting to get PAUSE to email me my password. I don't recall
    which email address I was using at the previously but it must have
    been my old work address which I nolonger have access to. Please
    change my email address to mr.frost@verizon.net or let me know how
    to recover my account. I'd very much like to renew my development on
    existing CPAN modules.

    Thank you for your time, David Shultz
