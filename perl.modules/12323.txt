[I've tried to ask around, but had almost no feedback, this is my last 
station before i submit the module to CPAN]

Those of you who are involved with mod_perl probably know that I've been
working on developing a documentation framework for perl.apache.org,
which I've called DocSet, since it uses the concept of stacked docsets,
each consisting of other docsets, chapters and external links. Currently
it supports HTML and POD as the source formats (a mix of source formats
can be used) and can (and should) be extended to support XML, Text, etc.
It generates PS, PDF and HTML output and can be extended to generate 
other formats as well. Currently it uses Template Toolkit for rendering, 
but again, flexible enough to be used with any other templating system.

You can see what you can get using it at:
http://perl.apache.org/release/index.html
(btw, this is the new perl.apache.org that will be released as soon as
we finish polishing the cross-browser/platform rendering issues)

If you want to look at the sources of the site and see how it's done,
please read:
http://perl.apache.org/release/download/docs.html

This package is currently only available from:
http://www.apache.org/~stas/DocSet-0.13.tar.gz

Now back to the topic of this post. What is the namespace it should go
to on CPAN? I cannot find any existing suitable namespace to put it in.
I'd be glad to just keep it as DocSet:: but is there a concern that this
hijacks the whole namespace, similar to what Template Toolkit happened
to do to the Template:: namespace.

Rememeber that this is an extensible framework and not a package with
general purpose modules, so it won't fit into any POD::, HTML::, etc
namespaces. Should we create a new hierarchy for apps? App::, Bin::?

Thanks for your ideas! If you don't have any I'm quite happy with 
keeping the DocSet name.

I'm planning on releasing this package on CPAN as soon as the new
modperl site is released. This is because I'm going to use the modperl
site as the demo/test suite for this package.
