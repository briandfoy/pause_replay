Hi--

I've written a Net::SSH module that's an all-Perl interface to an ssh
daemon. Currently 3 encryption ciphers are working (IDEA, DES, and 3DES),
and one authentication method (password auth). (I also have rhosts-RSA
authentication working, but it requires running on a privileged port and
read access to the host key file--which basically means that it requires
running as root, so far as I can tell).

In my view the advantage of using an all-Perl solution is to save on the
cost of forking a new process to run the ssh client.

I'd very much like to release this on CPAN; my question is this: there's
currently a Net::SSH module on CPAN that's a wrapper around the ssh client
(system calls to it). Does this mean that I should enter my module in under
a different name, and if so, what would you suggest as a name?

Thanks,
Benjamin Trott
