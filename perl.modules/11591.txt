Most Todaly Bodacious Dudes And Dudets:
	As I have set on my quest to become that high guru of all things
computer related, Having filled out and burned my aplication to become 
MicroSquirt certified, Further having setup and run a Bulitin board system,
and still further programed a Z-80 by poking instructioncodes int memory
using the monitor, and suffered under many hours of programing various 
assorted Programing languages some of which I pray will never be used again;
I have stumbled upon a useful piece or two of code, which I would have 
sincerly apreaciated if it had been given to me. It is my sincere desire to
share with those who would be interested the profits of my learning, for is
not the best way to learn to teach? Therefore I here by do formaly request
an account on PAUSE.
	My planed contributions are a perl front end to the ASPseek client
library sutible for use with mod_perl or CGI, A script showing how to
accept an XML formated request, translate it into SQL, do a lookup, and 
format the return in either XML or HTML, and the ocasional puff of hot air
on a mailing list.
	When I am not being called 'bonehead,' I am normaly addressed as
Ben Hildred, but you can call me nutso or anything you think would be 
approate by mangling my name, except Hildreth (Bev Hildreth was a nice gal,
but she had no intrest in calclus and just didn't fit into girls vollyball.)
If you would be so kind as to send my pass string to bhildred@peakpeak.net 
I would sincerly apreaciate it. If you would like to se what hapens when I
pretend to be normal point your browser at hildred.linux-dude.net.
						Sincerest Thanks,
						Ben
