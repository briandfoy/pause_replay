Hello mod_perlers,

Following talk about module categorization this summer, I have now finally 
added these recommendations to the website.

The new naming conventions for modules in the Apache:: namespace are 
summarized here: http://perl.apache.org/products/apache-modules.html

In my work to define new namespaces, I also undertook a categorization of 
the current mod_perl modules into new namespaces. This can be useful for 
module authors to know what name to pick for their new modules, as well as 
for users that are looking for a module but have trouble finding it because 
of poor organization of the Apache:: namespace.

You can find this categorization here: 
http://perl.apache.org/products/old-modules-categorized.html . I remind you 
that it is only of illsutrative interest, and *is not a proposal to change 
the names of established modules*.

However, I suggest that we all work together to help new modules (1.0 as 
well as 2.0) choose a correct namespace in the Apache:: main namespace.

I hope that this suits everyone. Of course, it is flexible: nothing is 
settled and as everything, I am sure it is going to evolve. But it's a step 
forward, which everyone seemed to agree was important.
