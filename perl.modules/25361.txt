The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::DmozRDF
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Parse the DMOZ content file into chunks
  userid:      PAUL (Paul Wilson)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://wilsonprograms.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    DMOZ provide a huge content file of their database in RDF format,
    which currently stands at around 1.5GB in size.

    I have been contacted by quite a number of people wishing to import
    sub-sections of the data into their own custom databases, however
    they find such a huge file difficult to manage not only because of
    its sheer size, but also because they are not aware of how to cut it
    up into more manageable chunks.

    Therefore I propose that my new module would provide such users
    with the flexibility to manage the DMOZ file. It will allow users to
    cut up the DMOZ file into top or sub-level categories, drastically
    reducing the difficulty of managing and using the data for their
    personal websites.

    I feel that the module should fall under the root category Parse as
    the main purpose of the module is to parse the DMOZ content file,
    and DmozRDF accurately and concisely describes what the module will
    parse.

    Thankyou for considering my module.
