          $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!</font></b></div>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Arial">Does this headline look familiar? Of course it 
            does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured 
            on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the 
            world. His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came 
            across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
            some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons 
            closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when 
            she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-Dollar Bills, 
            Twenties, Fifties and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled 
            piles.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", 
            says the 41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 Dollars in that 
            bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year".</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The woman immediately called her husband at the 
            car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. 
            He came home right away, and they drove together to the boys school, 
            and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came 
            from, was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.</font> 
          </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, 
            via E-mail, a type of "Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained 
            off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he 
            had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what 
            the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started 
            sending it out", says the clever 15-year-old.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
            instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, 
            then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down 
            , and finally to add your name to the top of the list.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
            Several Thousand Dollars in Five-Dollar Bills within 2 weeks if you 
            sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. 
            "I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going 
            to work", the boy continues.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
            the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game 
            magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines, but envelopes 
            containing $5 Bills.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the 
            post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed 
            in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the 
            [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". 
            He goes on, "I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of 
            more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack 
            because I could not carry it all". Over the next few weeks, the boy 
            continued sending out the E-mail."The money just kept coming in and 
            I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time 
            for my homework".He had also been riding his bike to several of the 
            banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
            and hundreds.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so 
            I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time 
            in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter 
            that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside 
            waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
            told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would 
            have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the 
            street (laughs)." Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to 
            be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called 
            "chain-letter" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a 
            chain-letter at all.In fact, it was completely legal according to 
            US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 
            18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, 
            Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
            must be exchanged for money received.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Every five-dollar bill that he received contained 
            a little note that read, "Please send me report number XYX".This simple 
            note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A 
            Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">[This is the end of the media release. If you 
            would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 
            plus - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15

            This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. 
            Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly 
            news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation 
            of this program described below, to see if it really can make people 
            money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.</font>

          <p><font face="Arial">Their findings proved once and for all that there 
            are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program 
            and if people can "follow the simple instruction" they are bound to 
            make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.</font> </p>

          <p><font face="Arial">Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive 
            and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot 
            of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We 
            strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you 
            go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them 
            the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service 
            on all orders.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">This will guarantee that the e-mail they send 
            out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they 
            can not advertise until they receive the report.</font> </p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The reason for the "cash" is not because this 
            is illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about time. Time for checks 
            or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply 
            so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before
