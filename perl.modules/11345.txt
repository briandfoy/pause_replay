Subject: Module submission X500::RDN
To: modules@perl.org, rjoop@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@p11.speed-link.de ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       X500::RDN
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: handle X.500 Relative Distinguished Names
  userid:      RJOOP (Robert Joop)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    X500::DN

  rationale:

    [i just applied for X500::DN a few minutes ago.]

    X500::RDN is used by X500::DN and comes with the same tarball. i
    don't know whether it makes sense to register it, it depends on
    whether registering is more for avoiding conflicts or more for
    listing modules to use. the latter case doesn't really apply, i
    doubt anyone will use X500::RDN without X500::DN.

  enteredby:   RJOOP (Robert Joop)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 22 16:37:43 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

X500::
::RDN             adpOp handle X.500 Relative Distinguished Names    RJOOP
