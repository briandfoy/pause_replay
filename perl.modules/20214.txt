The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::Exporter
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Export class methods as regular subroutines
  userid:      SPLICE (David James)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Exporter::Lite

  rationale:

    This package allows you to export object methods as regular
    subroutines. It supports C<import()>, C<@EXPORT> and C<@EXPORT_OK>
    and not a whole lot else. Each package into which your object
    methods are imported gets its own instance of the object. This
    ensures that there are no interaction effects between multiple
    packages that use your object.

    This module makes it much easier to set up a hybrid interface ala
    CGI.pm. You can take any old module that has an object-oriented
    interface and convert it to have a hybrid interface by simply adding
    "use base 'Object::Exporter'" to your code.

    Here's the SYNOPSIS: package MagicNumber; use base
    'Object::Exporter';

    # Export object-oriented methods! @EXPORT_OK = qw(magic_number);

    sub new { my $class = shift; bless { magic_number=>3, @_ }, $class
    } sub magic_number { my $self = shift; @_ and $self->{magic_number}
    = shift; $self->{magic_number} }

    # Meanwhile, in another piece of code! package Bar; use
    MagicNumber; # exports magic_number print magic_number; # prints 3
    magic_number(7); print magic_number; # prints 7 # Each package gets
    its own instance of the object. This ensures that # two packages
    both using your module via import semantics don't mess # with each
    other. package Baz; use MagicNumber; # exports magic_number print
    magic_number; # prints 3!

    Most of the code and documentation was borrowed from
    Exporter::Lite. Exporter::Lite was written by Michael G Schwern
    <schwern@pobox.com>

The resulting entry would be:
