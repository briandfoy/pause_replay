Hello,

I would like to contribute a module to CPAN, so I am following the directions as outlined on the web for the contribution procedures.

Name - Stuart Lory
email - stuart@onyx.ch
preferred ID - lory or lorys

I am planning on contributing a module I wrote which does in perl the same thing that the 'banner' command does under unix. The perl module I have written does not simply make a system call into unix as this would not work in a dos environment. The module has the character structure embedded into code so that the characters can be rendered. The module goes much further than the 'banner' program ever allowed, ie:
- banner length of any size (not maximum of 10 as in Solaris)
- banner characters can be created with any displayable character the user chooses.
- banner can be displayed vertically or horizontally
- banner can be scaled in size from 100-500%.

The module size is less than 5k so it is compact. It has been tested with perl5 under Solaris 2.7 i386, Solaris 2.6 Sparc, Linux i386 and PC versions of perl. All worked fine.

The DSLI entry I would say as RdpO

Description could be 'Perl module for creating text based banners' (does it have to be exactly 44 characters?)

 From looking around the layout of CPAN I would assume this module would best belong under Text::, ie, Text::Banner.

I hope this is enough information for submission acceptance.

Regards,

Stuart Lory
