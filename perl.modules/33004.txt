The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::PaginateEasy
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Complete Pagination - calculation to display
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    beginners@perl.org

  similar:
    Data::Pager and Data::Pageset, they are not used (use() wise or code
    wise) I didn't like their error handling paradigm and they only did
    the calulations you still had to make a good chunk of code to use
    those values to get anythign to display

  rationale:

    This doesn't make you croak if they pass a bad argument, it goes to
    a default so it won't kill your entire program for one insignificant
    oversight.

    the pardigm I used makes its easy and safe to generate the same
    values necessary for pagination and also a function for generating
    the actual navigation that you would be needing the values of
    similar modules for anyway. Which is fully customizable with
    different args. Or they can just use the raw values to do it them
    selves.

    Either way its the easiest way to Paginate Data in one complete
    module.

    Thanks Dan
