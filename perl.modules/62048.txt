     why:

    Hello, I have been working with perl for a copule of years and I am
    ready to share some modules. The first one will be a small module to
    send SMS via my cellphone operator (they have an ugly flash form
    :-P). I had worked with POE and Device::Serial to make a interface
    betwen tcp/ip and a special rf protocol to manage a public lighting
    system for my university, so maybe a couple of modules will come up
    of that soon.

    Thanks a lot!
