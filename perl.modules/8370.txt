The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Server::POP
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Net::Server based (extenble) POP3 Server
  userid:      RHANDOM (Paul T. Seamons)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Company, in email conversations with various other CPAN authors.

  similar:
    Mail::POPServer

  rationale:

    I wrote a suite of mail tools for my company. There were no viable
    perl alternatives available that I could find. I also liked the way
    in which Net::FTPServer and Net::Server were written and wanted to
    be able to have simillar functionality and load bearing in mail
    servers. This is intended to be a suite of tools which include
    Mail::Spool, Net::Server::SMTP, Net::Server::POP, and
    Net::Server::IMAP.

    There are some modules that have limited functionality already in
    existance. Net::SMTP::Server exists but is only a minimal relay.
    Net::Server::SMTP would handle remote and local delivery as well as
    spooling, retrying, etc. as well as being able to take more
    connections via Net::Server. Mail::POPServer exists but is function
    oriented and not easily extended. Net::Server::POP is intended to be
    extensible and able to bear large loads.

    Internally in our company, we are have been using versions of these
    modules for a couple of months and have around 3000 mailboxes using
    the modules.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Server::
::POP             adpOp Net::Server based (extenble) POP3 Server     RHANDOM
