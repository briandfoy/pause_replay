Tim,

I'm happy to see that you uploaded NetPacket 0.03 yesterday.  Even
though I haven't seen any public flames (yet), it seems I have made a
major mistake wrt CPAN etiquette.  For trampling on your namespace, I
apologize.

While I did try to find you and speak with you before submitting the
update, I have since discovered that I just didn't look in the right
places.

  o I sent an e-mail to tpot@acsys.anu.edu.au.  Do you remember me
    e-mailing you almost a year ago about this same bug *with* a patch?

  o I tracked down your home page and found there were no updates since
    the beginning of 2000.

  o The last post I could find from you in the Deja usenet archive was
    from November of 1999.

  o I asked in #perl on EFNet and no one knew how to contact you.

I hope you don't harbor any ill feelings towards me.  My goal was to get a
bugfix that significantly affected the usefulness of the TCP package out
there to people.  I did not try to take credit for the modules and even
praised your hard work and creativity in the Changes file.

I am taking it as a lesson learned.  I should have checked and posted
to the modules@perl.org archive before uploading.

I was a bit disappointed that you removed every reference of me from
version 0.03.  Thought you would at least keep my name and e-mail address
in the AUTHOR section of NetPacket.pm or TCP.pm.  It's not a big deal but
would have been a nice touch.

Best Regards,
