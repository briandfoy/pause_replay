From: gbjk@thermeoneurope.com ("Gareth Kirwan")

In FCGI::ProcManager there's a bug currently which causes it to exit
prematurely, affecting many implementations.
The bug can be either triggered by deliberately waiting for the =
processes to
come up and then exiting,
or if a race condition stems from a fork && exit.

The primary maintainer, James E Jurach Jr, is unresponsive by email and =
has
been for many months.
The email listed on his pause account doesn't bounce, muaddib@erf.net.
I went through the site listed, and referenced sites on that site, =
looking
for contact information but the sites are buggy and don't look to be
maintained.
One throws a mysql connection error for the contact page, the other =
throws a
"new design coming soon" stamped 2005.

I'd like permissions to fix it, please.
I'm willing to take on maintainership, if necessary, since I'm very =
familiar
with the bug and the module itself.

Thanks
