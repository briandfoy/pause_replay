Yeah, maybe.  And it is more likely that someone will stumble on the
Devel::Breakpoint module, than learning about the implementation details
of the Perl debugger.  I guess it is in the same area as the constant.pm
module.

So I don't know, should I upload it?

I already got patches for it, even though I only posted it to a mailing
list so far:

    http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/pdk/1644033

(It is called BreakToDebugger.pm on the list, but I would use
Devel::Breakpoint for a CPAN name).

Cheers,
-Jan
