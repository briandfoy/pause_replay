     why:

    We are presently in the process of developing a complete ecommerce
    platform for several different storefront venues and opportunities
    at my company (from selling hand soaps to custom tailored suits to
    IT services).

    As such we plan on contributing lots of the perl code back as open
    source (from Ebay API's, to payment gateways, templating engines,
    etc.)
