The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hypatia
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A Data Visualization API
  userid:      JACKMANEY (Jack Maney)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Hypatia is a new data visualization API that sits between DBI and
    one of many backends (upon release, Chart::Clicker will be
    supported, along with plans to support GraphViz2, GD::Graph, and R
    (via Statistics::R)). It grabs data from a user-specified database
    and query and creates a basic, "no frills" chart (the exact nature
    of the chart--line chart, histogram, pie graph, etc--depends on the
    backend, the name of which is specified by the user and loaded at
    runtime).

    Since this can be viewed as an extension of DBI *and* an extension
    of one or more data visualization modules, it doesn't make sense to
    put it in an existing namespace.

    The namespace is named after one of the first notable women in
    mathematics and a librarian at the Great Library of Alexandria (cf
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypatia).

The resulting entry would be:

Hypatia           adpOp A Data Visualization API                     JACKMANEY
