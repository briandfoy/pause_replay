It is used by other modules, see http://cpants.perl.org/dist/File-NCopy.
Can deprecated modules have releases? IMHO it does not contradicts to 
deprecated status.
I'd propose to release last(?) version with warnings and mark it as 
deprecated.

P.S. It would be good to have possibility to define this status in META.yml.
P.P.S. I can also maintain Text::Format of the same author. It is used 
by 2 other dists.
