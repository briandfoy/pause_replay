I recently searched the module list 
	http://cpan.perl.org/modules/00modlist.long.html
for "Table::" and did not find it.

However, today I also searched here
	http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/
and found
 1. 2002-12/msg00399 Module submission Table::ParentChild
 - I don't completely understand the "rationale" here.

 2. 2002-02/msg00310 Module submission DBIx::Pivot
 - In this case Table::Pivot was used for development but changed
   because Table:: did not exist.
   [ However Data::Pivot also seems to exist ]

 3. 1998-06/msg00161: Re: Statistics::Table:: proposal
 - In this case the Table has to do with Statistics.

Anyhow.  I had looked at
 Data::CTable
 Data::Table
and neither of these do what I intend (although I wish
I had found Data::Table about 3 years ago :-).

My intent was to register the following:
  Table		- v 0.1 todo
  Table::File	- v 0.3 written.
To go under chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities).

The idea is that the primary abstraction is a "Table".  It
is similar to but more general than a Table in an RDBMS.  The
data in this table might come from a database (via DBI::*) or
a file (via Table::File) but to the programmer it exists
purely as a Table.  The module Table::File fulfills a contract
which the sub Table::import() requires.  It provides a function
next_record(), which allows the Table to import both its data
and meta-data.

Obviously, one idea is to have be able to change the data source
for the same data with things such as Table::DBI, Table::Oracle, 
Table::Stream, Table::XML without changing the rest of the code.

I don't care what the top-level namespace is (but I thought I
could grab Table :-).  I think that Table::ParentChild may be
entirely compatible with what I intend but I don't know how
permissions work on CPAN yet.  It also seems that either
DBIx::Pivot or Data::Pivot might be appropriate as Table::Pivot.

I could always use Xyz::Table::* ... and I'd appreciate it if 
someone has a suitable suggestion for Xyz. (DBI is NOT right,
Data is taken, but Db would work ... although I believe that 
the Db:: namespace already exists and I don't know what it is
for).  Perhaps DBIx:: is good for this...

--GH.
