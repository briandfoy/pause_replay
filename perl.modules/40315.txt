**Friend, this will really open your eyes!*****


Friend,

I get hundreds of emails every day asking what makes me so different from the rest of the "real estate gurus" out there. Be honest - you were probably wondering the very same thing! That's okay! Please read this email and you'll soon see why, without me having to say another thing: 


---------------------------------------------


Friend - Who's smarter . . . a landlord or a tenant??

Well, let's take a look at each of their responsibilities:

Landlord vs. Tenant 

Landlord:
  *Puts down 20 percent to buy the property. 
  *Pays taxes. 
  *Pays insurance.
  *Does repairs.
  *Responsible for all lawsuits. 
  *Has to ask the tenant for permission to inspect the property. (The landlord's own house!)
  *Receives repair calls anytime, day or night. 


Tenant:
  *Pays no taxes. 
  *Pays no insurance. 
  *Does no repairs. 
  *Tenant-Landlord law is on their side. 
  *Put down a small security deposit. 
  *Has more control over the property than the landlord.  



Well, you're probably thinking now that the landlord is the one getting a positive cash flow from the tenant of between fifty to one hundred dollars per month. That may be, but one small repair expense and the positive cash flow quickly goes down the drain. 

Bottom line...

The tenant is controlling the property, with less than 1/2 of the cost put down and no repairs or maintenance hassles and expenses, while the landlord is praying that his twenty percent down will be made up over the next six years and hoping that nothing goes wrong with the house and that the tenant will pay on time for the next few years.

What about the Landlord Equity??? You almost had me!

Friend, have you ever looked at the amortization table on a 30-year investor mortgage? It's practically robbery! In six years, the investor will have paid into the thousands in interest and only hundreds on the principle.

OK - so what's my point??

Every real estate guru is pitching to you how to make a fortune in real estate rentals, specifically in single-family homes.

NOT ME!

I'm sorry - if you want to learn that garbage, you aren't going to learn it from me. If your idea of success is listening to your tenants complaints on your answering machine on a holiday morning and fixing water heaters in the middle of the night, then you don't need to read any further!

However, if you are really looking to make some serious good income in real estate without wasting the next thirty years...

    *without dealing with rental properties and problem tenants 

    *without throwing your life savings into a down payment 

    *without dealing with your smug banker 

...Then my system is custom-made for you.

That is what makes me so different from virtually everyone else.

Give it a shot Friend - what can you possibly lose?

The worst thing that can happen is that you will have had access to one of the most hard-hitting, grab-them-by-the-throat real estate courses on the market!

The best thing that can happen to you is that you will walk away with a skill that gives you the ability to write your own paycheck and never have to want...for the rest of your life.

Hope to see you at the top!
