So can I.  However, in point of actual fact, it stands for workflow 
toolkit, has done so for four years, and will continue to do so, and I 
know of no other project in all of open source which is using the same 
acronym.  There is no top-level namespace that it would fit under, 
unless you count Workflow, which I just granted to Chris Winters for his 
module of the same name.

 From a semantic standpoint, I would much rather be able to say "use 
wftk" than "use Workflow::wftk", especially since "wftk" already denotes 
a generic term, and since my wftk has nothing to do with Chris's 
Workflow module.  It would be great if CPAN could reflect those 
convenient semantics.
