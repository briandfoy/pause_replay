I have written a module which, given a date in the Gregorian calendar, will
calculate its liturgical church season, saint's day if relevant, and
appropriate vestment colour. (I have had a couple of requests for such a
module.) I intend to upload this to CPAN under the name
DateTime::Calendar::Christian::Liturgical, since
DateTime::Calendar::Christian already exists but is not church-related. Are
there any problems with that?
