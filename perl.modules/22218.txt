I am working on a network emulation package. It is on SourceForge as
project Raddle:

	http://raddle.sourceforge.net/

The bulk of the package is written in Perl, though it also depends on
several external packages (net-snmp, arpd, honeyd etc). There are two
modules so far, which I have named Net::Raddle::SNMPAgent and
Net::Raddle::TimeTicks. The first provides emulation of SNMP agents,
and the second supplies a handy support class.

Is this a suitable choice of name in Perl space? I considered putting
it under SNMP:: or Net::SNMP:: but that does not seem right because it
is not just about SNMP (the bulk of the code written so far
relates to SNMP, but there are other things to implement yet). Another
alternative would be Net::Emulator. Note that this is an emulator, not
a simulator.

It is likely that the finished package will consist of several
packages/classes to be included in one distribution. Is it reasonable
to make a distribution called Net-Raddle-0.01.tar.gz which contains
classes Net::Raddle::SNMPAgent and Net::Raddle::TimeTicks etc?

Thanks

Andrew
