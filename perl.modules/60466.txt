The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::DWIW
  DSLIP:       cdpOa
  description: A logger that does what I want
  userid:      DOWENS (Don Owens)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::Logger

  rationale:

    The logging modules available on CPAN almost never do what I want,
    or they are very heavy and require lots of configuration. This
    module is something I use myself and will probably also be useful to
    others.

    I intend to have at least the following features:

    * single or multi process mode (multi is default) * synchronous vs
    asynchronous write mode * serialize data structures to JSON in all
    but first arg * hi-res timestamp * terse log level name (inf, wrn,
    dbg, err, ftl, etc.) * support tee -- e.g., print to log and stderr,
    print to multiple logs with different levels * support external
    logger * support methods like open, close

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::DWIW            cdpOa A logger that does what I want               DOWENS
