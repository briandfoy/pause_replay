Subject: Module submission WebService::Cmis

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Cmis
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to CMIS-compliant document systems
  userid:      NUDDLEGG (Michael Daum)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    https://github.com/MichaelDaum/cmis-perl

  similar:
    WebService::GData, WebService::XING, SharePoint::SOAPHandler,
    Livelink::DAV

  rationale:

    This library provides a CMIS client library for Perl that can be
    used to work with CMIS-compliant repositories such as Alfresco, IBM
    FileNet, Nuxeo and others. CMIS is an OASIS approved specification
    with backing by major ECM players including those mentioned as well
    as Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP.

    Up to now, CMIS client bindings have been available for Java, PHP,
    Python, .NET etc but not perl. So this package sort of fills a
    missing gap.

    The module name WebService::Cmis seems to be the natural choice as
    the library implements a network protocol to access a REST-like
    interface on top of Atom XML data.

    Other than the VendorXYZ::Protocol packages, WebService::Cmis is
    using a vendor neutral protocol, so that a vendor specific access
    method won't be required in most cases, hopefully.

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::
