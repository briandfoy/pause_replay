What do you think about Log::Serialize instead?  One of the features 
that I have not seen in other logging modules is that it will serialize 
data structures passed to it to JSON, making it easier to recover data, 
run reports, etc.

I have considered Log::Log4perl (and I have written an appender for it 
at work), but it seems to be very heavy.  Perhaps I should do both.
