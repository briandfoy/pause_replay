BTW, renaming is not easy as the right name for this module is really
Net::STOMP (like Net::FTP or Net::SMTP). Anyway, with your experience
in module naming, which alternate name would you recommend?
 - Net::ST0MP:  as this would be as close as possible to Net::STOMP
 - Net::STOMP1: as this would replace Net::Stomp 0.x
 - Net::STOMP2: as a second version of Net::Stomp
 - Net::xSTOMP: as an extended version of Net::Stomp

Thanks in advance for your advice.

Cheers,

Lionel
