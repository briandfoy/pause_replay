I find this file just fine on www.cpan.org. Can you fetch it by hand
without CPAN.pm or LWP?

I was able to download the right file with LWP. I checked inside the
package to ensure it was the right version:

use LWP::Simple;
use v5.10;

my $code = getstore( 
   'http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/W/WY/WYANT/PPIx-Regexp-0.030.tar.gz',
   '/Users/brian/Desktop/PPIx-Regexp-0.030.tar.gz'
   );
say "code is $code";

> LWP failed with code[404] message[Not Found]

This worked for me. I don't think this is a PAUSE or CPAN issue, but
there might be a problem with your CPAN.pm. If you still have problems,
you might want to report it to CPAN.pm.
