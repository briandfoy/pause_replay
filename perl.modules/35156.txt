Hi,

I have a module I would like to submit to CPAN and I'd like some help
finding the proper namespace for it.

It's currently called Blog::SpamAssassin and is located at
http://www.cynistar.net/~apthorpe/code/babycart/Blog-SpamAssassin-1.3.tar.gz.
I don't think the name is appropriate but I needed to call it something
for development and testing.

The module accepts an arbitrary blob of text and optional metadata, as
would be provided in a post to a wiki, blog, or other message board-like
system, converts it to an RFC-822 mail message, passes it to
Mail::SpamAssassin for analysis, and returns a verdict on whether or not
the text+metadata appears to be spam.

While the code's intent is clear, I don't believe the namespace I
initially picked is appropriate. The code is not blog-specific; maybe
Text::SpamAssassin is appropriate.

I'd appreciate any advice you may have for naming this module and
getting along with CPAN and PAUSE.

Thanks for your time,
