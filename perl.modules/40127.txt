The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::X509
  DSLIP:       bmpOg
  description: Pure Perl X.509 Parser
  userid:      JACKSONM (Mike Jackson)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    Has been discussed on the OpenCA mailing list, and the Perl-LDAP
    mailing list

  similar:
    OpenCA::X509

  rationale:

    I believe that this is the first 00 pure-Perl X.509 parser written.
    It was based on some early ASN parsing code by Norbert Klasen, found
    in the Convert::ASN1 /contrib (x509decode.pl). It has many methods
    for accessing individual items from X.509 certs, and strives to be
    feature complete.

    All other perl modules available depend on OpenSSL for the
    certificate decoding, and as such are not platform independent.

    This module is not fast, but it is completely platform independent.

  enteredby:   JACKSONM (Mike Jackson)
  enteredon:   Wed May  4 16:48:00 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::X509            bmpOg Pure Perl X.509 Parser                       JACKSONM
