Have you spoken to the author of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB about 
generalising that to incorporate your functionality?

I would have thought that his mechanism would become a specific instance 
of yours. Query->new('select * from table') to pseudo-code it.

If you guys don't think they can be merged successfully, or he doesn't 
wish to include your code, will approve.
