On a purely namespace level, you aren't strictly doing object-relational 
mapping, you are doing Object to Database Mapping, which would seem to 
me to be a subset of the full possibilities of a more general 
object/relational mapper...

But that's probably a bit harsh...

At a feature level (and not related to any namespace approval issues) 
that list of features looks pretty much like the same feature set as 
Class::DBI, Tangram, T2, Rosetta or $my_proprietary_one.

Of course, the fact that there's existing similar modules is no reason 
to not upload it. This is CPAN after all, it's practically expected :)

As you can see, being generally quite large and frameworky, these sorts 
of systems tend towards being done as "branded" modules, as they aren't 
really usable as a smaller component in a much larger system. They tend 
to want to dominate the entire application.

But in summary, while I don't personally think ORM is ideal and you 
might want to consider a branded namespace, it's nowhere near as bad as 
the outright namespace abuse of many other modules out there and I can't 
think of any other obvious potential system that could stake a better 
claim to ORM than yours.

So I'm sure someone (me included) would hit the big Go button if you 
wanted to register it.
