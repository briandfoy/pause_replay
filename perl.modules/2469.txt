Welcome Seattle Perl Users' Group,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

    SPUG

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      Seattle Perl Users' Group
  email:     brian@ingerson.com
  homepage:  http://www.halcyon.com/spug/
  enteredby: Kurt D. Starsinic

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
if you want to protect yourself from SPAM. If you want to do this,
please visit
  https://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred
or
  http://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred

If you need any further information, please visit
  $CPAN/modules/04pause.html.
If this doesn't answer your questions, contact modules@perl.org.

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Kurt D. Starsinic:
You can set up mailing list forwarding to your tastes via the
adminitrative interface.  As long as brian@ingerson.com is the
associated email address, password request information will go to
that address.
Good luck!
