The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::CJKCharsetDetector
  DSLIP:       Mdpfg
  description: detect charset of CJK string
  userid:      FOOLFISH (錢宇/Qian Yu)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Encode::Detect

  rationale:

    This module is used to detect charset(encoding) for any binary
    string,optimized for web text and EastAsia( Chinese ,Japan,Korea)
    language. The accuracy is up to 99.94% much better than
    Encode::Detect in EasyAsia language.

    It has been published as CharsetDetector
    (http://search.cpan.org/~foolfish/CharsetDetector-1.0.0/) for two
    years,works perfectly well.

    As it was not good well named and document is poor,I want to
    rewrite the document and re-publish it as new name
    "Encode::CJKCharsetDetector"

    Thanks very much

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::
::CJKCharsetDetector Mdpfg detect charset of CJK string                 FOOLFISH
