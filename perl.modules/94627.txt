     why:

    I am reading the Alpaca book (Intermediate Perl) and their
    suggestion at the outset was that I apply for this account. I am
    reading this book because I have a passion for Perl. I have prepared
    for Perl by first learning C/C++ and shell scripting (kernel, regex,
    sed, awk, grep, etc.) over the past 12 years. Thank you for
    considering my request for this account. -- Jim
