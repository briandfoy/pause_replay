Thanks for the quick reply, Steffen.

I see now that the process takes several weeks, and with good reason.   
I know that some volunteer coding that I do often gets delayed for  
weeks or months.   I think that's a good policy.   This change that we  
have is not critical, only useful.

Incidentally, we were following a different set of instructions (http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_adopt_module 
), which is more vague about the amount of time that it takes.

If Enrico sees this email this week and makes myself (JINGRAM) or Karl  
(KERISMAN) a co-maintainer or asks for the patch, then we can go that  
way.  Otherwise, we have a fallback plan to simply subclass  
Apache::Session::Memcached and Apache::Session::Memcached::Store.   We  
didn't do that originally because the ...::Store class is very small  
and our subclass would have had to override almost half of it.   But  
it is a solution to our problem.

Thanks again,
John
