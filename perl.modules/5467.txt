    I think that this just became an FAQ.  You have accurately described
the "official" best way.  modules@, should we craft a response and put it
on the web?

    Could someone with more expertise (Andreas) field this question?

    One does not achieve trust of Open Source software based on finding
the source code in a particular directory.

    CPAN.pm is the high-level interface to CPAN.  One should not browse
the FTP directories directly and expect to be enlightened.
