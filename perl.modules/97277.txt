Apologies for the delay on getting back to everyone....   I was out of the
country on vacation, and ignoring anything and everything remotely related
to work.

I heard back from the engineering team that owns the MQSeries module, and
they have brought someone pretty senior into the team, and they have a plan
to address the backlog of issues (both internal and external) in the coming
months.   The mqseries@cpan.org address should work again, as they
re-enabled the internal mail group it was directed to.

Can you try to reach out to them again, and reboot the conversation?
