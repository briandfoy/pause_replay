mailto:unsubsribe@xenonreed.com

Is Your website available on the worlds major search engines?
AOL, MSN, Google, Overture, iWON, HotBot, About.com, Anzwers, chello, cnet, Eoexchange, Espotting.com, , LookSmart, MobilCom, NBCi etc enjoy an amazing 80 million queries per day.
XENON REED Tech Group® guarantee that within 72 hours you will be indexed and available on the world's leading search engines
Some amazing web facts:
"85% of internet users use search engines to find the sites they want" 
Georgia Institute of Technology

"Search engine listings are the number one way to generate traffic on websites" 
WebCMO

"169,400,000 people in the US access the internet. 92% of these people query search engines" 
Nielsen-Netratings

"The internet is an incredible marketing tool, but if your website is not submitted on a regular basis you are missing the whole point of the world wide web" 
Andersen Steinberg Group
Many companies ask: "Why is it that when we search for our website on many of the search engines our page simply does not come up"
Quite simply your website designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your website seen! A site that is only sporadically submitted will often be relegated from any particular index.
No, it isn't your site. No matter how exciting your message or how perfectly constructed your website is, if people don't know you're there, they won't come. It is VITAL that a site be professionally and proactively submitted several times a week to the worlds leading engines, if they are to be available and indexed.
Yes some web designers may submit your website to a couple of directories, but it is not their remit to proactively submit your company's website to the hundreds of distinct search engines. This is a separate task all together and requires significant technical expertise to get a company professionally indexed. You have to be put there! 

XENON REED Tech Group® a leading global web site submission specialist, guarantees you will be seen locally and globally. 
Search Engines are the most effective way of reaching your target audience both at local and global level. At Xenon Reed Tech Group® we understand you want your website listed quickly with all the major engines and directories. Our global exposure solution provides the fast results you are looking for on both a local and global scale. We Guarantee It! 
For only $99 (approx €99)
We will submit your website to up to a minimum of 300 of the world’s leading search engines and keep on doing this during the following 12 months, to give your site and business maximum exposure both locally and globally.

What we will do to get your website both the local and global exposure it requires: 
We submit your website using two complex techniques to give maximum exposure. We first submit you to the world's most powerful search index powering AOL, MSN, Overture (formerly GoTo), iWON, HotBot, About.com, Anzwers, chello, cnet, Eoexchange, Espotting.com, Google, LookSmart, MobilCom, NBCi etc which enjoy 80 million queries per day. Then, we will proceed to submit your site to the other top engines and then re-submit your site every 30 days thereafter to these. 

Our Guarantee, for complete peace of mind.
If you are not listed on all the world leading engines (mentioned above) within 7 days, we will give you your money back.

World’s Leading Search Engines: We guarantee that your site will be listed and indexed in the web's top search engines (including AOL, MSN, Overture (formerly GoTo), iWON, HotBot, About.com, Anzwers, chello, cnet, Eoexchange, Espotting.com, Goo, LookSmart, MobilCom, NBCi etc and many others), serving over 82 million search requests a day, in 72 hours from when your order is processed.
Mass Exposure locally and globally: We guarantee that on a monthly basis your website will be submitted to a minimum of 300 of the other leading Search engines. This will commence within 24 hours or receiving you details.
Frequent Updates: Your web pages will be refreshed every 48 hours. This means that any change you make to your web page will be reflected in the search index within two days. You can thus modify your page to fine tune the relevancy and improve your search engine ranking. All without the need to re-submit your URL all the time. 
No Dropouts: Due to the 48 hour re-indexing, your website URL will remain in the leading search engine indexes for the whole 12 month subscription period. This means that there is no need to worry about having your URL dropped from the search engines, which can happen regularly with other search engine placement services. 
Cost Savings: Search engine placement is the most cost effective way to attract new visitors to your web site. Companies spend thousands of dollars in online advertising to attract new customers to their web sites. A well-placed search engine listing can be much more cost effective in comparison to traditional banner advertising. 
To begin submitting your website all we need are your URL and e-mail address. 
We will do the rest!
