I getting ready to release a new module to the CPAN that has a recommended dependency on Win32::IPC and Win32::Semaphore. Both of these modules do -NOT- reside independantly on the CPAN, but rather are part of the large bundled  libwin32-0.191  Bundle. The problem is, my new module will have a dependency on Cygwin in the Windows environment, due to the need for a working IO::Pty module installation. The full suite of libwin32 DOES NOT COMPILE using gcc under Cygwin - but Win32::IPC and Win32::Semaphore -do- and work as expected.

QUESTION - is it possible, in addition to the libwin32 bundle, to have separate copies of IPC and Semaphore in the CPAN?? I'm attempting to put a CPAN installation together now, but there appears to be no easy way have a dependency on these modules without compiling and installing the entire Bundle.

Any help on this would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian Kelly
