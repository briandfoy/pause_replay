     why:

    I have a micro assembly language compiler written in Perl on github
    that I want to submit (https://github.com/jpducassou/malyp). I also
    want to contribute with a couple of modules already on CPAN that a
    friend of mine maintains. I've been coding in Perl for more than 10
    years now and I think is high time I join the community in a more
    active way. Thanks.
