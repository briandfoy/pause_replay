The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Google::Language
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to the Google AJAX Language API
  userid:      HMA (Henning Manske)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've been playing with the Google AJAX Language API for internal
    usage at the university library I work for. Extensive search through
    CPAN showed me a lot of Perl packages for various Google APIs, but
    no one for the AJAX Language API. Since I'm a big fan of the mighty
    CPAN I thought the time has come to finally contribute something to
    the community.

    I've got my module ready covering all features of Google's API in a
    clean object-oriented style. Makefile.PL and the testing scripts are
    almost finished. Just the POD documentation is lacking for now. Of
    course I'll complete the docs before releasing the module.

    About the namespace choice: As for Google APIs, there are multiple
    ways: WWW::Google::*, Google::*, REST::Google::Search,
    WWW::Search::Google and more. After browsing through other modules
    in the WebService:: namespace, I found myself most comfortable with
    placing my module in the WebService::Google::* namespace.

    I hope you'll agree with my choice.
