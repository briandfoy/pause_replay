Hi,

I'd like to be granted maintenance of the module  =
HTTP::Headers::UserAgent please.

There are currently two registered authors:

	John Neystadt (JNEYSTADT) who released version 1.00 in 1998.

	Ivan Kohler (IVAN) who released a couple of versions,
		most recently 3.01 in 2002

In writing a review of such modules, I discovered that there's a CPAN =
confusion with this module,
which results in the 1.00 version being returned as the most recent =
sometimes and sometimes 3.01.

I had email with ANDK, who said that it looks like it wasn't properly =
recorded if/when the module
was handed over. I suggested that the quickest way (ha, more fool me) to =
resolve this would be
if I get permission to take over the module, and upload 3.02.

The 3.01 release is now just a front-end to one of the other User-Agent =
modules, and the documentation
makes it clear that you should probably use a different module. I plan =
to update the documentation
to point to my review, and give a list of the best modern modules. I've =
also added a number of tests,
just in case there are people out there using the module.

I've now had email with both authors, who've said they're happy for me =
to take over the module.
It took quite a while to track down / get a response from John.

John wrote:

Ivan said:

similar modules

Which is exactly what I do.
I explained what I want to do, to which he replied:
> Sure, happy to do so if it makes things easier.

If you do add me, can I suggest that you remove at least John, and =
possibly Ivan,
as I believe that if you don't they will continue to receive copies of =
any RT issues etc?

cheers,
Neil
