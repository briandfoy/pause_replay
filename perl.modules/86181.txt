In February, apeiron released local-lib-1.008009, but forgot to update the
remote git repository (oops!)   He received an email acknowledgement from
PAUSE indicating that indexing was successful.

On May 22, I released 1.008009 on top of the last release seen in git.
The upload returned HTTP 200, and I also received an indexing
acknowledgement in git.

I've since fixed the issue (updated the code with the original 1.008009
release, rebased, released 1.008010 etc), BUT:

- PAUSE should not have indexed the second upload, as there was a version
  conflict
- and BOTH 1.008009 releases are visible on metacpan via the left sidebar
  pulldown menu (see at https://metacpan.org/release/ETHER/local-lib-1.008010/)
  -- possibly an artifact of the first problem.

This would suggest there is a problem in the PAUSE indexer somewhere.
Please advise?
