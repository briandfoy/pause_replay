The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Evented::IRC
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: an evented and objective IRCv3 library
  userid:      COOPER (Mitchell Cooper)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    https://github.com/cooper/libirc

  similar:
    Net::IRC POE::Component::IRC AnyEvent::IRC Net::Async::IRC

  rationale:

    Evented::IRC is an event-driven IRCv3 client library written
    entirely in Perl.

    It is highly objective and extensible, and it is built upon
    Evented::Object. Because all of its objects are direct subclasses of
    Evented::Object, this IRC library belongs in the Evented::
    namespace.

    The library is unique when compared to similar IRC libraries
    because of its seamless compatibility with other Evented:: software.

    The repository is located at https://github.com/cooper/libirc.

The resulting entry would be:

Evented::
::IRC             RdpOb an evented and objective IRCv3 library       COOPER
