Subject: Module submission Math::Business::WMA
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::WMA
  DSLIP:       RdpOl
  description: Weighted Moving Average
  userid:      JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    email, http://groups.google.com/group/stockmonkey/

  similar:
    Math::Business::EMA, ::SMA

  rationale:

    The WMA is used less than simple moving averages or exponential
    ones. The linear falloff seems less useful at first glance, but it's
    a pretty standard calculation and deserves a home in the M::B
    namespace as much as SMA or EMA does.

  enteredby:   JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul  6 12:17:51 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Business::
::WMA             RdpOl Weighted Moving Average                      JETTERO
