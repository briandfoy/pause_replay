     why:

    I'm doing already libraries in other languages and started to work
    much with perl in the last time. At the given point i got one small
    Module, so that i can start with something probably useful and then
    go on with stuff that is useful for more people :-). I dont think I
    will make anything big new but i will probably make some modules
    that combine others very well.
