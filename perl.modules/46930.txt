A good general guideline for top-level name-spacing is that is your 
module is so-tied to an EXISTING branded product it can't be used 
anywhere else, and there is no obvious second level name for it...

(for example, Asterisk would be fine, but if CPAN had a strong existing 
VOIP:: namespace, then VOIP::Asterisk would be much better).

Sometimes it can be preferable to use VOIP::Asterisk anyway when you 
know that there's going to be a bunch of other modules coming along 
later, because an area is growing fast for example (Bio:: Geo:: Eng:: etc)

The second reason is to Brand an new product that completely dominates 
any program that will ever use it.

My example would be of a module that provide a framework outside-in 
approach to a problem domain. A solution that is never ever going to act 
as a smaller piece of a larger system, because the system IS your think.

And especially if there are a dozen different similar modules anyway in 
that area. The best example is the current situation with web MVC 
frameworks, such as Maypole and Catalyst.
