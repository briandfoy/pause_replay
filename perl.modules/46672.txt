Subject: Module submission File::ExtAttr

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::ExtAttr
  DSLIP:       cmcfp
  description: Access extended attributes of files
  userid:      RICHDAWE (Richard Dawe)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    file-extattr-users@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    The functions in File::ExtAttr relate to individual files, hence
    the reason why it's under File::* rather than, say, Filesys::*.

    As far as I know there are no other modules that aim at
    cross-platform support for extended attributes (extended attributes
    are a form of file meta-data and are used for things such as
    access-contro lists).

    This module will (one day) support Mac OS X and *BSD as well as
    Linux. This is something I and the co-author have discussed.

    There is a Perl module for OS/2 that supports something similar.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
