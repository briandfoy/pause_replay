Done!
http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-MultiStatementDo/

I had just to strip some chars to try to silence the complaints from
some lazy colleagues of mine  :-)

I did not consider that the splitting behaviour didn't need Moose, so
it could really be confined in a module of its own without that dep,
you were perfectly right...

... But I'll take advantage of this (for now).

Rather, should you find any SQL code which is not split correctly,
please let me know that I'll extend the parsing logic.
