     why:

    I have two little frameworks and want to share these to CPAN world:
    1. first is aimed to help with development of an architecture of
    complex applications forcing developer to build modular systems and
    easily use strategy pattern to avoid possible unmaintainability of
    code caused by kind of unexpected requirements; 2. second is aimed
    to help to avoid code doubling and increase re-usability of code
    snippets by providing some kind of macros definition and processing
    engine.

    Both are built with Moose, and the second heavily uses metaclasses.
