Subject: CPAN-PAUSE Upload Question

From: toms_email@gmx.de (Thomas Wegner)

Dear maintainers at modules@perl.org,

I'm registered as user TWEGNER . Yesterday, I've  uploaded my Mac OS 
port of the Date::Calc 4.3 module (Date-Calc-4.3-bin-MacOS.tar.gz) 
via HTTP. For reasons I don't know, my browser cuts out the dashes, 
so that the module now shows up as "DateCalc4.3binMacOS.tar.gz" in my 
CPAN dir. This is really not what I wanted and thus I've scheduled 
the files for deletion.

To avoid these problems in the future, I'd like to upload my file(s) 
via FTP. According to the PAUSE upload form one should be able to 
upload to an incomming directory on pause.kbx.de. But I can't figure 
out the FTP URL for the upload. I've tried various directories on the 
pause.kbx.de host to no avail. I've always got a "Login/Password 
incorrect" error message. Seems as if the upload procedure isn't as 
trivial as the modules/04pause.html document says it would be (at 
least, it isn't trivial for me :).

My question now is: What's the correct URL for FTP uploads?


Thanks for your help.

Best regards,

--Thomas
