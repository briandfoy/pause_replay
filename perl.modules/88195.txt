Hi Shane

Being co-maint means you can unilaterally upload distros. And yes that 
means not needing to ask for RICECAKE's permission - because he's 
already given it to you by making you co-maint.

The search will show up under your name if you're the most recent 
uploader. At least, that's what happens when I adopt modules.

You can search MetaCPAN via your PAUSE id or name, and you'll see your 
contribution recognized, but of course most people won't search in that way.

There is a web page - http://neilb.org/adoption/hall-of-fame.html - 
kindly maintained by Neil Bowers, but this is of people who adopt 
modules which they were not originally part of.

As for sharing the work, I advise you to use git to help co-ordinate 
work. Learning git may seem like an effort if you're just starting out, 
and have heaps of other things to do, but I /strongly/ recommend it.

Download a distro like Tree::Simple and examine its Makefile.PL for how 
to specify the git repo in Makefile.PL. This is optional but helps everyone.

Then, using git you can share your patches with each other before 
uploading a new distro to MetaCPAN.
