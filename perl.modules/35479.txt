I just found http://groups.google.de/groups?selm=F1C32CD48B89D411AD2B00D0B78EC38909CD2A49%40MAPPINMAIL01&output=gplain
He asked for HTTP::UAProf, we have mailed with each other, and will
try to join our work.
So, i don't mind, which module-name to use, i am shure, you know
better, where to place the module, i would prefer HTTP::UAProf.

Thanks for advice, 
Rainer
