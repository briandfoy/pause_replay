Hi Phil,

Thanks for your reply and honest appraisal of the situation.

> This is very sad, and as the original author of the code, I would like =
to apologize on behalf of those who have inherited in from me.   Except =
that I have *NO* idea who that is.   I wrote and owned this code from =
1998 to 2002.   Hildo also left the project and Morgan Stanley a few =
years later, and the engineering team that manages the MQSeries =
infrastructure Hildo and I designed and deployed are the ones =
responsible for the CPAN distro now.   That team *was* pretty good, but =
they entire team quit or changed projects in 2012, which explains the =
final release date.
>=20
> Now, I am going to be characteristically blunt here: all the good =
engineers are gone from that team, and I don't think they are giving ANY =
priority to maintaining the CPAN distribution, because none of them have =
any clue how.    If you have the skills and the interest in taking this =
over, I would be more than happy to help broker getting the ownership =
transferred.

If you can help us get approval from =E2=80=9Cthe right place in Morgan =
Stanley=E2=80=9D, that would be great.

>  If push comes to shove, I am pretty sure that if Hildo and I endorsed =
it, the CPAN maintainers would make the change.

I should have made clear in my first response =E2=80=94 I am one of the =
PAUSE admins.

> [=E2=80=A6] Now, I honestly think that the team in question is so deep =
underwater with everything we created (that infrastructure and the =
management application we built are perhaps the most successful work of =
my career, and they still use it), that they will most likely be =
thrilled to give this up.
>=20
> Anyway, if it is not obvious, please keep this discussion entirely =
confidential for now.

Just so you=E2=80=99re aware, the PAUSE admins mailing list =
(modules@perl.org <mailto:modules@perl.org>) has been copied on these =
emails. There is a public archive of these emails, but it=E2=80=99s not =
likely that people will stumble on those archives. If you want to =
continue this discussion off that list, just let us know.

> I am putting the priorities of the open source community before those =
of my employers here, and so taking a bit of political risk by doing so. =
   I am, for lack of clearly better judgment, working at MS again right =
now, so I would appreciate you NOT sharing this discussion publicly =
until it is appropriate to do so.   This is also why I am in the perfect =
spot to broker the ownership change.

I appreciate you doing this.

> reach out to Golden, and inquire about the process here, as I don't =
think you will ever see another release if we don't, so I will bring him =
into this discussion as well.   Please give me about a week to get the =
internal feedback on this.

Since the code is copyright Morgan Stanley, and was last released from a =
Morgan Stanley account, we=E2=80=99ll need some approval from MS to hand =
over maintenance. If you can get approval and forward it to us, I can =
then give co-maint to Thorsten on all of the MQSeries modules. This =
doesn=E2=80=99t need a formal signature, but once you=E2=80=99ve spoken =
to the right person in MS, you could send an email to us and cc that =
person, with a simple email along the lines of:

Dear PAUSE Admins,

I=E2=80=99ve spoken to XX at Morgan Stanley, who is happy for co-maint =
permissions to be granted to Thorsten Hirsch on the MQSeries =
distribution. I=E2=80=99ve copied XX on this email.

Phil

Given Thorsten=E2=80=99s recent email, it will hopefully be relatively =
easy to make a good case for this, as it=E2=80=99s going to result in =
active maintenance and bug fixing (I notice there=E2=80=99s at least one =
patch from Thorsten in the RT bug queue for the dist). They=E2=80=99re =
clearly dependent on this module in production, and have a good CPAN =
pedigree.

Let me know if there=E2=80=99s anything else I can do to help.

Cheers,
Neil
