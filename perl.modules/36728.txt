The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EasyDateTime
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: A date and time object
  userid:      FOOLFISH (錢宇/Qian Yu)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/admod

  similar:
    DateTime

  rationale:

    We often need a date and time object, but the existing DateTime
    object is too difficult to install, too hard to use, too much file,
    and need a complier....and u need to know too much ahout DateTime
    how to implement the func.

    So i collect the function that most common, and develop a new date
    and time object.

    First i try my module in my company's project,after several
    project. i re-develop it ,delete some feature not use at all,and add
    some useful feature.now it's stable and powerful

    i think it's the most easy to use date and time object in exsting
    modules in cpan.

    i think it's necessary to add my module to cpan,and it's also my
    honour to share my code with others

The resulting entry would be:

EasyDateTime      RdpOg A date and time object                       FOOLFISH
