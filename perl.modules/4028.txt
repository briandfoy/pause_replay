It should not surprise you that there are other tools around which are named
Lingo, as the name is simple and catchy. I know of the existence of at least
one such commercial tool, which is used for modelling and solving linear
programs. This must not be a problem. I at least do not intend to do
anything Perl related with it.

Anyway I do suggest that you choose a slightly more specific name to avoid
later problems/misunderstandings. Since it is a language, you might think of
Language::Lingo, but who knows how many "Lingo" languages there are around?
Shockwave::Lingo seems a good compromise, however.
