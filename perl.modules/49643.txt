This is a known problem for many modules on CPAN. Most modules without 
an explicit license were actually meant to be distributed under the same 
terms as perl.

The only way to make sure that you can use the module is to contact the 
author (I am sending him a copy of this mail) and ask him to release a 
new version of the module which includes a license. An explicit license 
for a CPAN module is strongly recommended.
