Hi all,

I've just got my cpan account, and wanted to upload a perl module for
handling file changes, it's mostly an update of SGI::FAM, fixing some
bugs and adapting to gamin, a (IMHO) most updated version of FAM (which
was supposed to be API/ABI compatible, but isn't at this moment)

Said this, I was thinking in the File::Gamin namespace, putting it under
File seems correct to me, but when/if Gamin is compatible with FAM, it
wouldn't be an accurate name... Any opinions? 

	Regards
