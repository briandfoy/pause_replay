     why:

    Note. As you can see I am having a bad day, between spelling my
    name wrong and then inadvertently resubmitting this several times
    without correcting the mistake. It is true that fact is stranger
    than fiction. I cannot even blame it on a Monday morning ;-) Its
    times like these I hate archives.

    I am planning to add a facility to the Tie::RDBM possibly the
    Tie::DBI module where the data can be cached in various ways before
    inserting into the database. I have emailed Lincoln D Stein about
    this and he recommended Sub-classing his module rather than adding
    it to his own.
