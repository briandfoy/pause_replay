Dear PAUSE Admins,

Can you give me co-maint on constant::Atom please?

I'm working on a review of modules for defining constants, and while =
reviewing constant::Atom I fixed one bug, and have done some other =
tidy-ups. My version is on github:

	https://github.com/neilbowers/constant-Atom

The author is Jonathan R. Warden (JOHNWRDN), and this is his only =
module. Email to his PAUSE email address bounces, and I haven't been =
able to find another working email address for him. I asked about him on =
module-authors, and someone pointed out a web page that had his personal =
consulting company details. I tried ringing his phone number, but got a =
message saying it was no longer in service. I've emailed him a number of =
times over the last 4 weeks, but always get a bounce.

I first tried emailing Jonathan on 22nd December.

thanks,
Neil
