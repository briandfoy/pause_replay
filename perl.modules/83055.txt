Hi,

I have written a module that I would like to upload to the CPAN. I already
have a PAUSE account (nmarley), but I haven't uploaded any modules yet.

I am writing to this list because of the advice I read at these urls about
choosing a namespace for my module:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#namespace
http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_namingmodules


The module is a parser which reads SSH2 public keys in different formats
(OpenSSH and SECSH formats) and turns them into 'key' (or 'PublicKey')
objects.

The objects can then output either openssh or secsh format public keys,
which are used by different implementations of SSH.


The purpose of the module is to assist sysadmins in converting to/from
OpenSSH and various commercial implementations of SSH, for whatever reason.

The ssh-keygen tool that comes with openssh does this also, but can only
process one key at a time, and doesn't preserve certain attributes (it
re-writes the comment field instead of preserving it each times it does a
conversion).

This module will also parse multiple keys in multiple formats in one file
(e.g. both SECSH and OpenSSH in an "authorized_keys" file that may have
been accidentally setup that way by well-intentioned sysadmins). For this
reason, and the fact that it's Perl vs shell, this module makes it a bit
easier than using the ssh-keygen command to convert between key formats.

So, it's really just doing some text manipulation with regexes.

So my question to the PAUSE admins is: what should I name the module?

I have considered SSH2::PublicKey, and Convert::SSH2::PublicKey, but I
don't know if SSH2 is a good top-level namespace for my module, and using
Convert::SSH2 might be invading Mark Allen's namespace (he has
Convert::SSH2, which does something similar, but not the same).


Thanks,
Nathan
