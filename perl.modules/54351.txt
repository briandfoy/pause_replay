Hi,

I would like to register the namespace 'Bio::Ecell' for
the module I have created, which is  a Perl API for
E-Cell simulation environment (http://www.e-cell.org/).

Since this is a scientific software for cell biology
researches, I believe a top level of 'Bio' would be suitable,
and since this API is specific for E-Cell and the goal of
this software is quite different from bioperl (mathematical
simulation rather than sequence analysis) I think Ecell
can be placed at the second level.

Thanks for your feedback.

gaou
