     why:

    I have been working on some Windows GUI automation modules for the
    purposes of testing Windows applications. I have examined the
    modules Win32::GUI, Win32::GUIRobot, Win32::GUITaskAutomate, and
    Win32::GUITest. While these modules have some similarity, their
    scope fall short of my needs, and their ease-of-use leaves somewhat
    to be desired.

    Actually, I am writing a family of modules, and I propose the
    namespace Win32::GUIAutomation. So far, I have written
    Win32::GUIAutomation, Win32::GuiAutomation::Mouse,
    Win32::GuiAutomation::Window,
    Win32::GUIAutomation::Window::Listview, and
    Win32::GUIAutomation::Window::Treeview.

    As you can see, the goal is to write a family of modules under
    Win32::GUIAutomation::Window, one for each control type, as well as
    other modules such as Win32::GUIAutomation::Keyboard.

    The whole system is object-oriented and provides very powerful, yet
    simple-to-use, commands.

    These modules are not intended to be "quick" solutions to my
    problems, but rather, robust, long-term solutions. I have spent
    considerable hours writing what I have so far, and will spend
    considerable more writing the additional modules.

    I am writing to you now in order to get your initial reaction and
    guidance before I start setting everything in stone.

    I also want to submit to CPAN because I have benefited so much from
    CPAN and I want to return the favor.

    Thanks for your consideration!
