As you know, the preferred method is for Kees (KJH) to grant you =
co-maint or ownership. If you don=E2=80=99t get any response from Kees =
after a month, and you can show that you=E2=80=99ve taken appropriate =
steps to try and contact him, then you can return to the =
modules@perl.org <mailto:modules@perl.org> list to request a handover.

Kees, if you don=E2=80=99t want to hand over your module, that=E2=80=99s =
fine, just let us know please. If you are happy for Shlomi to take your =
module on, I=E2=80=99m happy to make the permissions change for you: =
just let me know which option you want:
You retain ownership, Shlomi gets co-maint
Shlomi gets ownership, you get co-maint
Shlomi gets ownership, and you release all permissions

If you retain co-maint, then you=E2=80=99ll continue to receive any bug =
reports submitted to RT, which won=E2=80=99t happen if you choose option =
3.

Cheers,
Neil
