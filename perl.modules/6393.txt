IMHO applications don't require assigned namespaces -- what's the
point? If all applications use a top-level namespace (main:: is well
qualified) then I don't see any conflicts with modules.

If an application is built around a primary module of functionality
then we're not talking about the "application" as the module.

In this case I don't think App::Tracker is useful -- it's not
descriptive and not unique enough to reduce the chance of conflict.
I'd say use "Tracker" for the application namespace and put the
core modules somewhere else. I have no suggestions since I don't
know what the core modules do...
