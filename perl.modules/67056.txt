Subject: Module submission Authen::UserVerify
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, terencemo@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::UserVerify
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Auto-login for email verify, reset password
  userid:      TERENCEMO (Terence Denzil Monteiro)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    #email on irc.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Lots of people need user password reset / email address
    verification / first time user info entry feature in their
    applications, for which they want to mail a URL with a unique code
    to the user. When the link is clicked, the user gets logged in
    automatically.

    Since this involves helping to authenticate the user based on the
    given code, I think Authen::UserVerify is an appropriate namespace.

  enteredby:   TERENCEMO (Terence Denzil Monteiro)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 10 06:59:05 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::
::UserVerify      RdpOp Auto-login for email verify, reset password  TERENCEMO
