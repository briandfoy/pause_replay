In the usual case you have the author's explicit consent, but even
with Stacy's cited posting we do not have explicit consent here. So
I'd say caution is called for. There's an long standing tradition of
(unjustified) offended authors:-(

Anyway, Stacy's posting convinced me that I should not wait until
Saturday and I changed authorship now.

As I've never heard about official rules for that case, we have to
invent our own. I'd suggest Matt's proposal looks perfect except for
that it's hiding the story. If you added a HISTORY section in which
you offered a single sentence, something like you "forged" the project
(or whatever is the appropriate term) because the original author
could not be reached, that would be ideal (IMHO!). The art here is to
make enough words and not too many words at the same time.

Very true! Thanks Anthony!
