I'm not sure the module name is entirely clear, at least to someone like 
me that's done some basic GPS stuff but isn't a geomatics person as 
such. Google doesn't provide anything obvious for "NGS Fortran Forward"

If "Forward" is obvious to people then this should be fine, but would 
something like Geo::NGS::Forward be appropriate. I'm assuming there 
might be more National Grid Service-inspired module here...

Alternatively, Geo::NGSForward, Geo::Vincenty::Forward, or 
Geo::Algorithm::Forward?

The few references I can find use the casing of "FORWARD" rather than as 
a regular english word. I think it's possible that there might be some 
level of confusion with "Forward"...

Your thoughts?
