The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::FIGlet
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Perl implementation of figlet,akin to banner
  userid:      JPIERCE (Jerrad Pierce)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    NA

  rationale:

    figet is like banner in that it creates asci-art of text in a
    larger size. However figlet supports multiple fonts. Being ascii-art
    pure text I believe it belongs in Text. figlet also fits the whole
    international slant as there are several language fonts.

    Text::FIGlet is pure perl, and a much safer alternative to several
    of the existing CGI interfaces for figlet. It's also cross-platform.
    etc. etc. ;-)

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
