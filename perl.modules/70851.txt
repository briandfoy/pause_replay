The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Mock::LWP::Dispatch
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: mocks LWP::UserAgent and controls responses
  userid:      TADAM (Yury Zavarin)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://github.com/tadam/Test-Mock-LWP-Dispatch

  similar:
    Test::Mock::LWP

  rationale:

    This module intended for mocking LWP::UserAgent, that makes many
    different requests and you need to control this. Probably you can
    make this with Test::Mock::LWP, but it is not very suitable module
    for this.

  enteredby:   TADAM (Yury Zavarin)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 18 07:31:50 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Mock::LWP::
::Dispatch        adpOp mocks LWP::UserAgent and controls responses  TADAM
