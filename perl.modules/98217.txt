If the documentation is related to Perl in some way, then I think it=E2=80=
=99s fine. And there are advantages to putting it on CPAN:
People can find & read it online via MetaCPAN
People can install it and use perldoc on it

If it=E2=80=99s not related to Perl in any way, for example a Blueberry =
muffin recipe, then it doesn=E2=80=99t really belong on CPAN (but feel =
free to send me a copy ;-)

Cheers,
Neil
