I understand your thinking, but that would not work well because this 
would be the only module within such a "Ranking" sub-category.

Note that "VoteFair ranking" is the name of the method.  (For this CPAN 
module I've capitalized "ranking" to avoid punctuation, and because 
italics is not available.)

Other voting methods typically have the words "method" or "voting" in 
their names -- such as "Instant Runoff Voting", the "Condorcet-Shulze 
method", the "Ranked Pairs method" (which does not do ranking), etc.  No 
other method (that I know of) includes the word "ranking" in its name.

For perspective, other voting methods only calculate the winner, or in 
some cases multiple winners.  They are not designed to rank the 
"losers".  In contrast, VoteFair popularity ranking -- which is the core 
part (but not the only part) of VoteFair ranking -- "only" calculates a 
full ranking, and then the top-ranked choice is identified as the winner.

As you realize, the "Voting" category will grow.  However, it would be 
difficult to create meaningful sub-categories.  Furthermore, VoteFair 
ranking does not fit within the traditional categories (for example 
because it has both "single-winner" and "proportional" components, and 
because the VoteFair party ranking component does not fit within any 
existing category).  Also, some software (that exists elsewhere) 
calculates multiple methods to allow comparing different methods.

Soapbox: It turns out that the mathematics behind voting is complex.  
That's why so few people have "done the math" to realize why money can 
so easily be used to manipulate election results.  Now, with software, 
the math can be done at the click of a mouse!

Brian, thanks for your valuable contributions to the Perl community!
