Subject: Module submission Devel::Autostub

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Autostub
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Stub module/class during development.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Yada::Yada::Yada, Devel::TraceSubs

  rationale:

    The main use of this is in stubbing modules at project startup or
    when adding new modules without fully-specified interfaces.

    Y::Y::Y simply prints a "not implemented" warning to stderr each
    time something is called. Problem there is that the sub's need to be
    written and give no history of what actually gets used. O::S logs
    $AUTOLOAD to stdout with a Dumper of the arguments and tracks the
    lifespan of objects via its DESTROY block.

    Tracing alone is available via Devel::TraceSubs, but that won't
    stub anything and is a lot more complicated to use (i.e., create
    tracing object vs. just use [base] the module).

    Note: This seems to belong in Devel, feel free to suggest another
    name if you can think of a better one (I've wasted way too many
    napkins on it at this point).

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Autostub        bdphp Stub module/class during development.        LEMBARK
