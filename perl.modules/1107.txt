I would like to contribute to CPAN some modules that I have written.
I'd also like to use the Persistent::* namespace for them.  Here's a
brief summary of the modules from their web site:

Persistent is a framework of classes that makes it easier to store and
retrieve Perl objects to and from various types of data stores. Using
a common interface that all of these classes inherit, you can store
objects to various types of data stores such as text and DBM files,
relational databases, LDAP directories and so on, all with the same
programming interface. You can also query and retrieve these objects
from the various types of data stores by using the query/search
language of the native data store. The data stores currently supported
are the following:

      Text files 
      DBM files 
      Memory (RAM) hashes 
      MySQL databases 
      Oracle databases 
      Sybase databases 
      mSQL databases 
      LDAP directories

There is quite a bit of information about the classes along with
complete downloads on their web site and so I encourage you to visit
it if you are interested.  The URL is:

http://www.bigsnow.org/persistent/

I posted a RFC on comp.lang.perl.modules and received a couple of
encouraging replies including one from Randal Schwartz suggesting that I
submit these modules to CPAN.  These modules have also been in use by a
group of 10 or so developers for about 2.5 years and so are in a fairly
mature state.

Here's the requested info:
