OK, thanks - I'll fix both and see if that works.

SOmething probably already on your todo list would be to have pause give a
confirmation screen after uploading, telling what it has/hasn't been
able to extract from the module.  Then you could see if PAUSE has been
able to read everything correctly, and if not you would have a chance
to fix the module before publishing it.
