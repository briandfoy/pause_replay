The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attribute::Method::Typeable
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Specify method typing and argument checking
  userid:      JJORDAN (Jeremiah Jordan)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    cvs.faeriemud.org

  similar:
    Arguments Params::Validate

  rationale:

    Well, since the module is based on Damian Conway's
    Attribute::Handlers, I figure it should be in that heirarchy. The
    module is primarily for specifying method typing, so that's why I
    named it Attribute::Method::Typeable. I've looked around, and
    although there are many modules for argument checking, and a few for
    method declarations, I find using Attribute::Handlers makes the
    method declaration simple, clean and self explanatory:

    sub foo :Public (ClassA, ClassB, literal, string) { # stuff }

    sub bar :Private (integer o list) {}

    sub bas :Constructor (HASH) {}

    And it throws exceptions if the method/fuctions are called
    incorrectly. Anyway, it seems like a very good module for people new
    to programming or who come to perl from more strongly typed
    languages.

The resulting entry would be:

Attribute::Method::
