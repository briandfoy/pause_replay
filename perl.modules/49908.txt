The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Float
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: details of the floating point data type
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    When doing serious numerical work with floating point data, it
    helps to know exactly how the floating point type behaves. This
    module characterises the native floating point type, providing a
    group of constants along the lines of C99's <float.h>. It also
    provides some functions to perform low-level manipulation of
    floating point data.

    I considered the names "Data::Float" and "Math::Float". The latter
    would match "Math::BigFloat", but this module is characterising an
    existing fundamental data type, not implementing a new one as
    Math::Big* do. It's also not really doing maths: what mathematics
    there is is supporting the use of floating point, rather than the
    other way round. So I think this module is best classed as a "data
    type utility" and placed under Data::.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Float           adpfp details of the floating point data type      ZEFRAM
