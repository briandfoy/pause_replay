Greetings,

I am having trouble updating CPAN modules for the CGI::Test
distribution, and am seeking assistance to resolve the issue.

CGI::Test was originally created by Raphale Manfredi <RAM> and
was transfered to Steve Fink <SFINK>. Steve Fink recently
transferred ownership to me. There are a number of modules included
in the distrubution (listed below) that are not owned by SFINK
nor myself. They are still owned by Raphael Manfredi.

I have uploaded a new distribution of CGI::Test, and although
search.cpan.org seems to see the updated modules, the PAUSE indexer is
rejecting all but one (the top level CGI::Test module) of the modules in
the distribution.

I contacted Raphael Manfredi to ask him to transfer ownerhip, but he
hasn't been involved in the perl community for more than two years,
and doesn't remember his PAUSE password. He suggested I contact the
PAUSE maintainers to manually change the permissions. I am including his
message below as well. 

The 'view permissions' page in the PAUSE interface suggests I contact
modules@perl.org to address permissions problems.

I greatly appreciate any assistance on this matter.

Subject: Re: Some CGI::Test modules still owned by RAM on PAUSE

Hi Steven,

No need to "Mr Manfredi" me.  Just call me "Raphael".

Quoting Steven Hilton:
: According to the permissions searches in the PAUSE interface, you are
: still the owner and maintainer of many modules related to the 
: CGI::Test distribution, and Steve Fink does not have permission to
: transfer them. He may have never noticed because he never uploaded a
: new version of the files.

I don't know.  I forgot my PAUSE password.  And this looks like a PAUSE
problem, not something I could do myself.  I don't recall claiming ALL
the modules under the CGI::Test namespace!

Did you try to contact the PAUSE folks for solving this problem?  I
would think they will be able to help you pretty efficiently.

If not, let me know and I'll restore some files from DAT/CD-R where I
have my PAUSE password in clear.

Raphael
