Hi!

Plz. note: I resend this mail because the previous one might not have been
read due to the subject line.

I have an issue uploading a new version of Tk::FcyEntry. According to the
PAUSE indexer, I do not have permission on the distribution name.
However, *YEWENBIN <https://metacpan.org/author/YEWENBIN>* provided me
co-maint some time ago.

Maybe it is because I do not have co-maint on Tk-ACH? Could you please add
me as co-maintainer for Tk-ACH?
YEWENBIN was not able to do it himself, because PAUSE did not offer the
name in his module list.

Extract from the mail from 2014-06-29:

      "I have made you the owner of Tk::FileEntry and Tk::FcyEntry. They
belong to Tk::ACH modules, but I cannot find the Tk::ACH module in my
module list. Can you update the Tk::FileEntry module now?"


I didn't really checked if I could update Tk-ACH as well, until I tried to
fix an RT issue recently.


So, could I get co-maint for Tk-ACH please?


Best regards,

Alex

The following report has been written by the PAUSE namespace indexer.
Please contact modules@perl.org if there are any open questions.

  User: ASB (Alexander Becker)
  Distribution file: Tk-ACH-0.07.tar.gz
  Number of files: 14
  *.pm files: 2
  README: Tk-ACH-0.07/README
  META-File: Tk-ACH-0.07/META.json
  META-Parser: Parse::CPAN::Meta 1.4414
  META-driven index: no
  Timestamp of file: Thu Sep 29 19:05:46 2016 UTC
  Time of this run: Thu Sep 29 19:07:28 2016 UTC

This distribution name will only be indexed when uploaded by users with
permission for the package Tk::ACH. Either someone else has ownership
over that package name, or this is a brand new distribution and that
package name was neither listed in the 'provides' field in the META file
nor found inside the distribution's modules. Therefore, no modules will
be indexed.


Further details on the indexing attempt follow.

The following packages (grouped by status) have been found in the distro:

Status: No permissions for distribution name
============================================

     module : Tk::ACH
     version: undef
     in file: Tk-ACH-0.07/ACH.pm
     status : Not indexed; ASB not authorized for this distribution name

Status: Database error
======================

     module : Tk::FcyEntry
     version: undef
     in file: Tk-ACH-0.07/FcyEntry.pm
     status : The PAUSE indexer could not store the indexing result in
             the DB due the following error: C< Deadlock found when
             trying to get lock; try restarting transaction >. Please
             report the case to the PAUSE admins at modules@perl.org.
