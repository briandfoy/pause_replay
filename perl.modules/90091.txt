If that means the existing user of the namespace is responding to you,
then this isn't a matter for modules@perl.org to address.

We can deal with adoption issues when maintainers are actively absent,
but if they're simply in disagreement with you then we don't interfere.

After all, if we policed people's social skills and opinions then you
probably wouldn't have a PAUSE account and neither would I.
