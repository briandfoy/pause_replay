Hello.

I have now tried several times over a number of months to contact the
author of the Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser about the bugginess of
his module and my attempts have gone unanswered.

It is clear that he has abandoned this module and that perhaps due to it
being unmaintained and buggy, it is time to remove it from CPAN.

CPAN should really not be in the business of providing buggy modules as
it ends up wasting other developer's time as they try, in good faith, to
use the module only to discover that it doesn't actually work.

Instead, if the buggy module were not available, he/she could have
chosen another suitable module for their needs and not wasted his/her
time with a buggy one.

Thanks for your consideration.

b.
