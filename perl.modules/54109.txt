     why:

    Hi~ I'm a graduate student on NLP (natrual language processing),
    with 2 years more Perl programming experience.

    I'm planning to contribute some NLP tools to CPAN.

    I'd like to start with Lingua::EN::Tokenizer which is a tokenizer
    for English language work as:

    INPUT: I've been in C.S. department. OUTPUT:
    I/'ve/been/in/C.S./department/.

    If simply split the text by spaces and punctuations, we may get the
    wrong results. That's why a tokenizer is necessary.

    The tokenizer does the different thing comparing to
    Lingua::EN::Splitter, which just pick out words, ignoring other
    tokens.

    And, after the tokenizer, I'll proceed on a POS-tagger using a Max
    Entropy model or CRF model. I see there's a POS-tagger in CPAN
    Lingua::EN::Tagger, but it's based on dictionary lookup and HMM
    model, which may fall behind in precision to Max Entropy and CRF due
    to recent research.

    Thanks

    Laye
