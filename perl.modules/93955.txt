EARTHTONE definitely has co-maint of everything so my guess is that the
co-maint for Reddit::Client itself wasn't set up until after the upload - I've
scheduled the dist for reindexing in the hopes that'll fix the upload.

Hopefully ANDK can convert your modulelist entry into a normal first-come,
at which point you can give the thing away entirely.
