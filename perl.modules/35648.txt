Subject: Module submission Net::OrkutSpider
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::OrkutSpider
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Access some Orkut data via WWW::Mechanize
  userid:      MANNO (Mario Manno)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Orkut

  rationale:

    I am not sure if the Net::Orkut Module is still existing or if it
    was ever uploaded to cpan. I named my module OrkutSpider
    nevertheless. I did not want to stick to LWP, so extending the
    Net::Orkut module was no choice.

    I think Orkut should allow users a more direct access to their
    data. While this module is no solution to the current development in
    social networking sites, i hope it shows the demand for more
    sophisticated interfaces than a browser if we ever want to make more
    out of this networks. This module may help to make users understand
    which data they leak on Orkut.

    Last but not least i hope the module will make a good example for
    the use of WWW::Mechanize.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::OrkutSpider     bdpOg Access some Orkut data via WWW::Mechanize    MANNO
