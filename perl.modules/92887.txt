     why:

    I would like to upload a series of modules I've created which
    allows parsing and conversion of WebVTT caption files. I'm following
    instructions I received at last year's YAPCNA as well as PerlMaven's
    "Minimal requirement to build a sane CPAN package" instructions. I'm
    hoping others can find this code useful, and maybe help me add
    features more quickly than I can alone. Please let me know if
    there's anything else you need from me.
