Subject: Module submission WWW::Pastebin::Many::Retrieve

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Pastebin::Many::Retrieve
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: retrieve pastes from various pastebins
  userid:      ZOFFIX (Zoffix Znet)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module is aimed to abstract all (current)
    WWW::Pastebin::*::Retrieve modules into one module, thus with one
    call you could one method on different URIs and be able to retrieve
    the paste irrelevant of what the pastebin is.

    I was thinking of WWW::Pastebin::Any::Retrieve as there is at least
    an Archive::Any which would ring a bell about indifference in the
    pastebin, but then there are tons of pastebins for which the module
    will not function for, thus I went with Many

  enteredby:   ZOFFIX (Zoffix Znet)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 26 21:58:09 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Pastebin::Many::
::Retrieve        idpOp retrieve pastes from various pastebins       ZOFFIX
