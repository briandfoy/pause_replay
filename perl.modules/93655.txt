I suspect he's working through brian d foy's book which walks you through
this process in order to learn how to use PAUSE.

I'm more interested in people being able to learn how to upload things so

One person's garbage is another person's favourite utility module; much though
the quality of CPAN is highly variable, attempting to forcibly curate it would
I think cause more problems than it would solve.
