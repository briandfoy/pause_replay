Hi all,
About the possible security risk in the Makefile.PL in my distributions, I
proposed a change into the makefiles and post it in Perl Monks. (
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=350119 )

After receiving some positive reply, (
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=350129 ) I changed and uploaded
everything this morning, and I deleted all the old distribution. I did it
even before you sent me your message, and before you take the action on
PAUSE indexing, so I have been faster than you :-).

For this reason, PAUSE already contains the new files, so, please could
you just restore the index without having to re-upload the same files with
another name?

I am very sorry to have underestimate the possible security risk in my own
code, anyway I fixed it quickly.

Thank you

Domizio Demichelis
