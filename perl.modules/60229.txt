Greetings,

I initially read this FAQ regarding gravatars:

--------------------------------------------------------------
Where do the author's pictures come from and how do I set mine? ^

They come from the Gravatar associated with that author's cpan.org email 
address. To set yours, simply sign up at http://site.gravatar.com/signup 
using your cpan.org address. We cache the gravatars so give it a day or 
so to catch up.
---------------------------

I interpreted "that author's cpan.org email address" as "the address of 
the author listed on his/her cpan.org page".  Stupid, I know - I 
couldn't figure out why my gravatar wasn't showing up even though it was 
linked to my cpan.org page email address (fred@redhotpenguin.com).

Schwern kindly informed me that the gravatar was associated with 
'phred@cpan.org' - I looked at the faq again and realized my blunder.

Would suggest a concrete example for those who read the faq and 
misinterpret it like I did.  I think there is a fair amount of users who 
don't have their 'user@cpan.org' address mapped in order to avoid spam...

Thanks!

- Fred
