I've written a wrapper around Apache::Session which adds :
1) Short term session tracking by cookie or URL
2) Long term user tracking by cookie or URL
3) Login / logout / create new user / remove cookies from computer

The module needs to be subclassed because it comes with some dummy
methods. These need to be overridden to provide the SQL for the user's
particular database setup 

At the moment, there is a module called Apache::SessionManager, which
provides pure session tracking, without the user stuff on top of it. 

thanks

Clint
