Hello,

This day I couldn't login to https://pause.perl.org/
My ID is pangj, this is the error page:


Error

User 'PANGJ' set to nologin. Many users with an insecure password have
got their password reset recently because of an incident on
perlmonks.org. Please talk to modules@perl.org to find out how to
proceed



I will delete an unused module, and upload a new module.

please help, thanks.

Regards,
Jeff Pang
