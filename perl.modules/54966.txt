     why:

    I've built several modules over the last few years, but one recent
    addition I want to contribute parses MRTG configuration files for
    use in add-on scripts. It's several orders of magnitude faster than
    the code that comes with MRTG, and will eventually include features
    like persistience and validation of directives and values. I have
    not found anything comparable on CPAN.
