I had trouble understanding this paragraph. I think what you are
describing is something that you can also do with LWP, but it sounds
like you skipped the programming part because wget has a command-line
option for the same thing.

I've done something similar with HTTP::Size, where I can check the size
of a particular resource, or the size of a resource and the things it
references. 

It's not that these features are really missing in LWP. LWP has
everything you need, as far as I know, and extra cool stuff like this
won't be there until someone lends a hand. I only say this because so
many people want to make disparate solutions instead of strengthening
and reinforcing already popular and good Perl solutions.
