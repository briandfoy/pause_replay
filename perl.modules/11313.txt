Subject: Perl module namespace discussion as it relates to a new Openview module (advise is sought)

Hi all,

I would like to call your attention for the following thread on 
comp.lang.perl.modules:  "New module which provides access to HP Openview opcmsg 
API".

This is a discussion I started concerning top level API name space issues 
surrounding the addition of a new or sub namespace for an Openview extension 
module.  The problem is that this is nowhere near large enough (currently at 
least) to justify a new toplevel namespace, but there appears to be no clear 
namespace into which it should be placed.   I am interested in discussion... 
before I a "set my new module name in concrete", as I want general acceptance of 
whatever name I finally settle on.

At first I rejected Net:: because it appeared to be vendor independant, then 
someone pointed out AIM and several other modules there.  So maybe, 
Net::Openview:: makes the most sense.

Still listening... wanting to finalize...

Lincoln
