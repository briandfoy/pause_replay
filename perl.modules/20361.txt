The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Presenter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Present data stored in hashes of arrays
  userid:      JKEENAN (James E Keenan)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perl Seminar New York

  similar:

  rationale:

    Data::Presenter offers a variety of methods useful in representing
    data that can be stored in hashes of arrays. It has proved
    particularly useful in preparing data stored in legacy database
    systems for further manipulation by word processing programs. It has
    also proved useful for the construction of small databases where,
    for some reason, a commercial or open source database program is not
    utilized.

  enteredby:   JKEENAN (James E Keenan)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 12 15:13:36 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Presenter       bdpOp Present data stored in hashes of arrays      JKEENAN
