     why:

    I want to provide an open source CMS perl framework I have written.

    It is a complete OO framework which is very flexible. It uses
    Class::DBI and DBX as well as Template Toolkit and other components.

    The flexibility is also that the Perl output is XML and can then be
    converted to html by XSL.
