Hi Dan,

Good. I received a copy and forwarded it to modules@perl.org for 
reference. It's important that these inquiries are public so if the 
original author - for any reason - comes back after we transferred 
maintenance, we need to be able to prove that people tried to contact 
him or her.

The only idea I have is posting in public places such as perlmonks, 
use.perl, etc.

It is. That sentence of mine was just a motivation for the process. It's 
great that you volunteer to help maintain possibly abandoned modules. 
I've done that a lot, too.

As for placeholders: I know how different parts of life can interfere 
with one another. I think everyone on modules@perl.org does. That's part 
of the reason why placeholders are frowned upon. It just happens too 
easily that something interferes and it doesn't get uploaded.

When or if you implement one of the registrations you've deleted, your 
registrations can always be reissued in no time.

I wish the very best for your health and family and that the future 
doesn't bring the same hardships you described.

Best regards,
Steffen
