I wouldn't worry too much about creating top level namespaces. It 
happens every couple of months. And functional programming doesn't 
really seem to have a current home that I can tell. I'd worry more if 
you wanted to create the module Functional.pm :)

Lacking a better or existing home for functional programming, we could 
do worse than Functional::
