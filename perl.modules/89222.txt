     why:

    Best Practical Solutions (we make Request Tracker (RT) and write a
    lot of perl modules) have found that we're running into problems
    maintaining CPAN rights for the RT extensions and other perl modules
    we write. We'd like to try consolidating our maint bits into one
    place so that if a developer is off (or has left) and has forgotten
    to hand out comaint. This is to avoid situations like our recent
    troubles with Email::Address::List.

    I don't think we'll ever ship a module under the BPS account, but I
    may be wrong, we'll see. If there was a better way to manage our
    rights, I'm open to hearing about it.
