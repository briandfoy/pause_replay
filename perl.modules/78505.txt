The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Amazon::EMR
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: Use the Amazon Elastic MapReduce service
  userid:      PFIG (Pedro Figueiredo)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm currently the maintainer for Net::Amazon::S3, and while Amazon
    provides a Perl client library for EMR, it's not available on the
    CPAN, it has not tests, no proper packaging, etc.

    I make heavy use of both S3 and EMR at work, so there's also a
    selfish motive for this :)

    Since it's licensed under APL 2.0, I want to bundle it nicely for
    the CPAN, so it's easily installable. It also hasn't had any
    development done on it since April 2010, and the EMR API has
    undergone some changes since.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Amazon::
::EMR             adpOo Use the Amazon Elastic MapReduce service     PFIG
