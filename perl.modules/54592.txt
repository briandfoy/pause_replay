It requires external library - SpiderMonkey. It is described in README.

CPAN modules are automatically tested. Exception - modules that require
external libraries that are not installed by default. Generally, this
information should be in README.

See "Annotate this POD" (for every module), or "Rate this distribution"
(http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/JavaScript).

Try again after installing SpiderMonkey and if you still have problems,
report them to
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=JavaScript . You can
also send patches.
This mailing list is for other purposes - it is for maintaining module list.
