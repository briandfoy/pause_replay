it might satisfy if a second level name were created that would clarify
nature of this test, e.g., "Statistics::Diachronics" being tests
sensitive to sequences, structure, and Pot could go under that, and
perhaps some could put others there. 

On the other hand, second levels don't seem popular among Statistics
people - there is only "Table" and "Test" which are not much use in
organising anything beyond general. So a secondary name could be
redundant. And then most stats modules have non-descriptive names, e.g.
"Burst," and "Calinski ...". People seem happy to find out more from abstract.

If no other feelings on this, then, I will send across Statistics::Pot shortly
