The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::JulianDateTime
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Astronomical Julian Date / Time conversions
  userid:      AQUACADE (Lawrence Hixson)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perl Mongers, Perlmonks, maillists

  similar:
    Time::JulianDay

  rationale:

    Module differs from other CPAN contributions because it:

    1) Assumes our current 7-day week as a continuous series of days
    from ancient past to distant future, completely incorporating full
    leap years rules across the range of all years (currently accurate
    between 9999 BC and 9999 AD)

    2) Uses the fractional part of JD to encode time-of-day to the
    second using the strict astronomical interpretation where whole
    number Julian Day start at 12:00:00 UTC (Noon) (or configurable to
    use local time 12:00:00) and fractional value of .5 is midnight.
    (Astronomers do it all night long! <g>)

    4) Calculates JD 0.0 (zero) as 01/01/4713 BC 12:00:00 UTC; JD
    2451545.0 as 01/01/2000 AD 12:00:00; JD 2452576.54007 as 10/29/2002
    AD 00:57:42 UTC

    5) For consistency (see #1 above), forces non-existent year zero to
    1 BC and handles the Gregorian shift seemlessly by forcing all the
    days between 5-OCT-1582 and 14-OCT-1582 inclusive to be JD 2299161
    to maintain unbroken 7-day weeks consistent with our modern calendar
    (rule #1 again)

    6) Includes a day-of-the-week function due to accommodate 12:00:00
    UTC bias of .5 JDs correctly

    7) Includes a day-of-the-year function (since January 1st of
    current year) as 2002001 to 2002365 for example with or without
    leading year

    Thanks!
