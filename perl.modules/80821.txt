What sort of uses do you imagine for this timer? That helps choose the
right name. We also have some general guidelines:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_namingmodules

You might also see if any of the other myriad timer modules on CPAN
already does what you need to do, or if one is close and you might
collaborate on it.

Good luck. :)
