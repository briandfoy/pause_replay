The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Ptrace
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Perl interface to the ptrace(2) command
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's very annoying to use the ptrace directly with syscall() so I
    want to provide an easy interface. There are also very many
    constants that go along with it. I plan to EXPORT_OK all of the most
    popular and useful ones, (i.e., PT_* and PTRACE_* found in
    <sys/ptrace.h>). This is basically just "h2xs sys/ptrace" with the
    ptrace command exported.

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::Ptrace          cdpfp Perl interface to the ptrace(2) command      BBB
