I'd push the nationality further down the name and push the
task up the name. Although you may only want to use your
module within one national domain, I think a lot of people
will want to use it across borders. For instance, I'd like
to validate post codes for every nation, but I don't want
to load a module for each one. Something like Business::PostCode
could unify *::BR, *::PT, and so on.
