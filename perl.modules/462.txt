"development a little bit streamlined" eh?

That needs to distinguish better between full individual module names
and category names.

Also it needs to explain clearly that:
a) We don't exert any namespace control over an authors own upload area.
   People are free to upload any modules they like.
b) The control we do have is over the indexing.
c) We try to use that control to the benefit of the greater community.
d) In a few rare cases we will restrict indexing of certain categories.
   For example:
	DBI::* under the control of Tim Bunce
	Sun::* under the control of Sun Microsystems

Tim.
