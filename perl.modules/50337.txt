Yes, its keeping track of the number of bytes in and out of the socket.


But IO::Socket::KeepTrackOfBytesInAndOutOfTheSocket seems like a bit  
much :)

LogBytes would seem to indicate its actually logging them to a fiel  
or database of some type
RecordBytes would seem to indicate its recording the actual bytes of  
data being sent  (IE the bytes making up your password are logged,  
like keystroke recording)

::TrackBytes maybe?
::TrafficInBytes ?

Any input would be great so I can register what you all feel would be  
best. I chose ::Bytes since its short but I suppose could be confused  
with using byte semantics like the bytes pragma...

So the thing this adds is

  $sock->{'io_socket_whatevertheheckthismodwillbecalled_in'}
  $sock->{'io_socket_whatevertheheckthismodwillbecalled_out'}

Which is the total amount of traffic in bytes across the socket in  
and out respectively

Any ideas of the shortest most proper name should be?

Any input is greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Dan Muey
