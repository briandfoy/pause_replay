"Rejected" is a foreign word on CPAN. Nothing gets rejected[*].

Namespaces get approved or get not approved. But that's quite a
different category than what the word "rejected" would suggest.

Sorry, no. Brian would you mind explaining?

We have very loose rules, so the following is just a start. You are
supposed to be a CPAN user too, not only an author, so that you know
how a CPAN package looks like from the perspective of a user.

- .tar.gz or .zip

- Makefile.PL or Build.PL, installable with on of the CPAN mantras

    perl Makefile.PL     perl Build.PL
    make                 ./Build
    make test            ./Build test
    make install         ./Build install

- Parseable version number

- License

- etc.

Look around how other modules on CPAN look like. Be prepared to upload
the next version with a different filename. There are certainly plenty
unwritten conventions that I cannot explain in this email, but I hope
to get you started.

[*] well, I hope you know what I mean.
