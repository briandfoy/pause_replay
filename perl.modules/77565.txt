Indeed - that's what prompted my question :-)

The most up-to-date version of that file that I can find says:

  XML::SAX::Base        1.02  K/KH/KHAMPTON/XML-SAX-Base-1.02.tar.gz

Given that I uploaded version 1.05 yesterday and given that according to
PAUSE I have co-maint permission on the distribution, why was it not
indexed?

Grant
