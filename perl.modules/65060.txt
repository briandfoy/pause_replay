Hi Modules,

I didn't realise signing up to PAUSE would trigger a message to
modules@perl.org till after it was sent.

So my thoughts on a module would be to do something similar to
SVN::Notify but for backups.
I was thinking of Notify::Backups or Backups::Notify.

SYNOPSIS

# Loadup objects to backup how to recognise them and how often they
should be backed up.
my $notify =3D Backup::Notify->new({
  to =3D> $email_to, subject =3D> $email_subjects, smtp_user =3D> $smtp_use=
r,
   # ... (other smtp args)
});

# get an array of hashes for each item (db's) thats we want to know about.
$notify->setup_config( config =3D> $config_file );

# foreach item in config get some stats on them (size,number,frequency)
$notify->prepare()

# send an email. highlight items that don't have a recent backup.
$notify->execute()

Version 0.01 was going to be a specific use case (DB Backups on
Amazons:S3) for my current employment and workout how the CPAN works
(as this is my first contribution). Then get feedback on how useful
this would be and adapt to include any suggested other Modules.

I was planning on using Moose for its simple object interface.

So Modules,
Thoughts on the namespace usage?
(my preference would be for Notify::Backup but I'm not sure it fits in
well with existing Notify::*).
Have I missed something on the CPAN that is similar?

Cheers,
/al
