The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Jabber::Lite
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Small perl-only Jabber Library
  userid:      BEECEE (Bruce Campbell)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    developer

  similar:
    Jabber::NodeFactory Jabber::Connection

  rationale:

    The development of Jabber::Lite as a pure-perl, non-UTF-8 library
    for connecting to Jabber servers, authenticating and handling XML
    packets was driven by the need to have something which worked on
    non-upgradable systems where speed wasn't an issue. As no existing
    Jabber or XML related libraries were found at the time which did not
    have a non-installable dependency, a mini XML parser was written,
    along with a connection and stanza-handling framework.

    The library started off as being a plug-in replacement for the
    Jabber::Connection and Jabber::NodeFactory libraries with better
    error handling, however it has suffered the inevitable result of
    feeping creaturism and now does more.

The resulting entry would be:

Jabber::
::Lite            adpOp Small perl-only Jabber Library               BEECEE
