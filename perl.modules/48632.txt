     why:

    I am planning to contribute Algorithm::SpiralSearch. A spiral
    search is a method used to optimize a two-parameter, relatively,
    well-behaved function. A reference to a function, the maximum number
    of iterations and optional boundary conditions are passed to the
    spiral_search function. spiral_search() returns the optimal point in
    the function passed to it. It's an elegant optimization algorithm
    but is not well-suited for most applications. SETI uses the spiral
    search in hunting for strong radio signals. Spiral search is most
    effective in situations where function evaluations are expensive and
    where there's a small amount of random noise within the search
    space.
