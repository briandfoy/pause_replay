    I'll admit to knowing next to nothing about the issues you speak of.
My concern was that it was going to be deleted and or blocked from being
used, which doesn't sound like something that should be happening.

    So unless something drastic changes, I'm reasonably kosher with things
as they are, providing no one goes out of their way to create problems.

    It certainly is not my intent to try to create problems, -- I've
been trying
to reduce them.
