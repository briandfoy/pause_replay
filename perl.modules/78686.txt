Subject: Module submission File::Flock::Tiny
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, zwon@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Flock::Tiny
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: yet another flock wrapper
  userid:      ZWON (Pavel Shaydo)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    http://github.com/trinitum/perl-File-Flock-Tiny

  similar:
    File::Flock and many others

  rationale:

    Despite there's a lot of modules for locking, I found myself
    writing the same package again and again. It is simple to use, it
    provides minimum functionality, but it provides all what I need from
    flock. So finally I decided to upload it on CPAN, maybe somebody
    else will like it.

  enteredby:   ZWON (Pavel Shaydo)
  enteredon:   Fri Dec  2 15:49:05 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Flock::
::Tiny            adpOp yet another flock wrapper                    ZWON
