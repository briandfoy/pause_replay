The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Arary::Heap
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: functions treating perl arrays as heaps
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Heap::* Array::Heap List::Priority

  rationale:

    Further below is the rationale as originally submitted on 2003-09-18.

    The reason I resubmit is because Array::Heap is reserved by John
    Macdonald, who said he'd have a much better version ("speed isn't
    really that important") and would upload it.

    This hasn't happened. Meanwhile, a useful module is rotting away, and,
    unfortunately, other modules depend on it and are being hindered by
    this, too (I was actually reminded of this by some CPAN user inquiring
    about Array::Heap and Array::Heap2).

    No matter how much better Johns module might be, it doesn't exist
    yet and hasn't for years, although the namespace is uselessly
    reserved since 1998.

    Instead of confusing users and delaying work, I suggest either
    registering Array::Heap2, so that there is at least an existing
    module with a bad name that users can find, or rename the module to
    Array::Heap or Array::Heap::XS, whatever you think useful.

    I do not think, however, that it's productive or useful to let people
    register namespace for 6 years without delivering any code while other
    modules exist that could be used to fill that space but can't because
    somebody else once had plans to deliver some better code; or just
    because this mythical module is mentioned in a book.

    Here is the original rationale for choosing Array::Heap*

    There are already a lot of heap and priority-queue modules on CPAN.

    All of them build more or less elaborate data structures (which is
    fine for many uses).

    Array::Heap is different in that it is a simple module exporting
    functions that work on normal perl arrays.

    That is, similar to perl's builtin functions C<push>, C<sort>, etc.
    there are push_heap, pop_heap and make_heap functions, used like
    this:

    @h = (1,2,3,74,6,4); make_heap @h; push_heap @h, 5,3,2; my $x =
    pop_heap @h;

    (there are also functions taking a comparison fucntion similar to
    sort).

    This is the reason why I chose to name it Array::Heap, since it
    treats an array as a heap, but does not implement a data structure
    itself.

    And here is the rationale for choosing Array::Heap2:

    Well, there is no good rationale, but while registering, I found
    that Array::Heap has been registered in what seems 1998 already,
    however, a module hasn't been uploaded in the last 5 years. (I
    didn'T see this at first because my searches were for existing
    modules only :)

    I've contacted the author, but haven't received a reply yet (but
    it's not been a long time).

    Anyways, I thougth I could already ask for advice on the namespace
    issue :)
