The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::ChipsChallenge
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Access Chip's Challenge Data from Perl
  userid:      KIRSLE (Casey Kirsle)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Data::ChipsChallenge is a Perl module that provides an interface to
    read from, manipulate, and write to the "CHIPS.DAT" file that comes
    with the computer game "Chip's Challenge", which was popular in the
    Windows 95 days and still has a place in the modding community for
    the ability to hack on CHIPS.DAT and create custom levels.

    I created the module to port the 149 levels of Chip's Challenge
    into an easier to work with format for a JavaScript clone of the
    game.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::ChipsChallenge  bdpOg Access Chip's Challenge Data from Perl       KIRSLE
