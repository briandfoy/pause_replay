sure it does: just do the same magic you did before when you get
one argument.

but, I don't really feel that strongly about it.  i was just 
throwing my two cents in like everyone else.

in that case, I'd like the import list to be as close to the 
original module name, and I'd like to just stick the alias
stuff in front.

   use 'Namespace::Preferred::Customer' qw( foo bar baz );

becomes

   use alias 'Customer', 'Namespace::Preferred::Customer'
      qw( foo bar baz );

by just inserting the "alias Customer".  The second argument
is the orginal namespace, and everything past that is the 
import list.
