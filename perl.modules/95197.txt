Hi Slaven, & TKML (the Perl/Tk mailing list),

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where people =
are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

Context for modules@perl.org: TKML is a pause id associated with the =
Perl/Tk mailing list. I=E2=80=99ve joined the list to try and track down =
who controls the pause ID, since I want to resolve some permissions =
issues that involve TKML.

Very handy that you replied Slaven, since one of the cases involves you =
and TKML :-)

	TKML has ownership of the =E2=80=9CPlot=E2=80=9D namespace.
	You and NI-S have co-maint on this namespace.
	There is no =E2=80=9CPlot=E2=80=9D module on CPAN, and from =
checking BackPAN, there never has been.
	Your =E2=80=9CPlot=E2=80=9D permissions conflict with =
=E2=80=9Cplot=E2=80=9D, which is owned by CJONES.
	CJONES has an indexed release on CPAN for =E2=80=9Cplot=E2=80=9D: =
C/CJ/CJONES/Microarray-0.45c.zip

I=E2=80=99d like to drop all the permissions on =E2=80=9CPlot=E2=80=9D, =
to remove this conflict. Are you happy with that?

The other case is the =E2=80=9CBundle::Tk=E2=80=9D namespace, which TKML =
owns. Again, there isn=E2=80=99t a Bundle::Tk module on CPAN at this =
time.
SHARIFULN (also copied on this email) owns the Bundle::TK namespace, and =
also doesn=E2=80=99t have a Bundle::TK module on CPAN.
To resolve this I=E2=80=99d like to drop one or both of Bundle::Tk and =
Bundle::TK =E2=80=94 everyone ok with that?

Cheers,
Neil
