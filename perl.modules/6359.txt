Contibution:  Mail::MassMail.. a module that does more then Mail::Bulkmail
Bulkmail envelopes messages but in turn dumps them on your SMTP server 
which to my experience will then take the message and break it out, thus 
saving you the headache of multiple emails per domain but still dropping 
that pain on you SMTP server and generate tons of extra net traffic. 
 MassMail groups users together from a mail list with like domains and 
attempts to locate the mailhost for that domain and will then send an 
eveloped mail to that domains mailhost if possilbe.  If not it drops it 
will either drop it to a local SMTP server or will report back an error, 
which ever is desired.  Mass::Mail can also be givin the right to run as 
more then one process in which case it will attempt to fork 'x' 
(specified by user) process to connect to remote hosts.  Headers are 
more configurable along with debugging being easier to access and 
timeouts at the remote SMTP end and locally are more modifiable.
