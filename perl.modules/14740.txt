Hi Brian,

First let me neutralize the following.

1) I do appreciate volunteers and their significant efforts! (If you 
care to know, sometimes I am ashamed of myself for doing too little)
2) By "...(I guess he is a busy man)" I actually meant that you might be 
a very busy man and that therefor the occasional mail may slip from your 
attention. IMO that's a positive sign.
3) I'm not a native English speaker. I guess many PAUSE contributers 
aren't. Most contributor's intentions are good. Please forgive/forget 
clumsy formulations.
4) Sometimes, business-like messages seem unfriendly. Most of the times 
they aren't as it takes a lot of effort and energy to consciously be 
unfriendly. This effort and energy is better used for meaningful work 
(like programming).
5) I was being business-like. That is, I tried to be as direct and as 
clear as possible.
6) General smile :)
7) I like number seven.

And now back to the actual topic. I trust we will conclude this time.

 >how is this not a web service? i'm still not clear on that.  your comment
 >in 2) says it is HTTP.
CDDBP (CDDB protocol) is the principal protocol for the CDDB information 
system.
It is implemented directly on  top of TCP (I'll refer to direct CDDBP 
further in this mail).
Later on a CGI interface was implemented to access CDDB. (I'll refer to 
CDDBP over HTTP further in this mail) Fact is that a subset of the CDDBP 
functionality is implemented in CDDBP over HTTP. Specifically, the " 
write" function is not supported. "CDDB write" is vital to upload CD 
information to CDDB.

The two supported protocols make this not a true web service package.

Direct CDDBP is used when full CDDB functionality is needed. And when a 
proxy/firewall is not prohibitive.
CDDBP over HTTP is mainly used when you're behind a proxy/firewall. E.g. 
at your office.

My packages support both direct CDDBP and CDDBP over HTTP. Of course 
proxy/firewall authentication is supported with CDDBP over HTTP.

Getting back to your question:
 >i don't think InfoSys is appropriate.
Please suggest a suitable name. It seams that the obvious ones are all 
already taken.

Sincerely,
Vincent Zocca
