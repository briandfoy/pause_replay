OK, I want some module naming advice :)

Dave Cantrell wrote a script called "perl-dep" that takes as its
arguments a list of perl source code files, then looks through them and
gives you lists of what subroutines are in which file, which subroutines
call which other subroutines, and so on.  Useful tool for getting an
overview of what the code does, or for refactoring, or whatever.

I'm going to be taking this script and (with Dave's permission) turn it 
into a CPAN module.  And I'm wondering what to call it.

Devel::Subsomething seems obvious.  I'm thinking maybe Devel::SubInfo or
something.  Suggestions welcome.
