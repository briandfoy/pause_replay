I'm afraid not.  The situation is as follows.
The FCGI module was developed together with the C fcgi library
in a cvs repo.  Development stagnated and a couple of years ago,
I decided to move the cvs repo to git.  Then, later,
the maintainer of the C library picked up development again, but he
continued working on the cvs repo, while I no longer have access
to this cvs repo.  He seems to have agreed to move to git, but
it just hasn't happened yet.
