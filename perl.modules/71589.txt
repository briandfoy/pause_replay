Subject: Module submission Gallery::Remote::API

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gallery::Remote::API
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Implements the Gallery Remote Protocol
  userid:      MYSTERYTE (Jonathan Wright)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://github.com/mysteryte/gallery-remote-api

  similar:
    Gallery::Remote

  rationale:

    The existing Gallery::Remote was never completed and does not
    support never versions of the Gallery software. Gallery::Remote::API
    was chosen then so as not to conflict with the existing namespace,
    while appearing "near" it so users will find them close together in
    a search. (Otherwise, WWW::Gallery::Remote may have been a better
    choice). Also while I share the sentiment that "API" is normally a
    redundant / useless term in a namespace, in this case I think of it
    meaning that the module lets you interact with an API, not that the
    module is an API.

The resulting entry would be:

Gallery::Remote::
::API             RdpOp Implements the Gallery Remote Protocol       MYSTERYTE
