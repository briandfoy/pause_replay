Agreed. Unfortunately, I had no idea it would be a problem when I picked 
it. How much of a hassle would it be to have the account replaced with 
RCSEEGE? My initial idea had been to request the second account, go into 
pause, and change ownership of the modules to the new account, then 
request that the original account be deleted. I'm open to other ideas...
