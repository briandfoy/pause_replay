Subject: Module submission Apache2::AuthColloquy
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, nicolaw@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::AuthColloquy
  DSLIP:       Rdpfo
  description: mod_perl authentication against the Colloquy
  userid:      NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Colloquy talkers

  similar:
    Other Apache2::Auth* and Apache::Auth* modules (that authenticate
    against different backends)

  rationale:

    Apache2:: because the module will work only with Apache2 +
    mod_perl2, other modules only compatible with Apache2 are already
    using this root namespace. ::AuthColloquy instead of
    ::Auth::Colloquy because it appears to be an existing standard
    naming convention for Apache authentication modules. I would have
    used Auth::Colloquy but I thought it made more sense to match what
    was already in CPAN for consistancy.

  enteredby:   NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  enteredon:   Mon May 22 20:56:35 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Apache2::
::AuthColloquy    Rdpfo mod_perl authentication against the Colloquy NICOLAW
