Hello,

I've been hacking Perl on and off for a few years - nothing major, but it
gets the job done.

One routine has come up often enough that I've tried to put it in a proper
module and would like to submit it to CPAN, if it's worthy.

The module provides a single call interface to Graham Barr's Net::SMTP to
allow simple emailing of a file.  I use it a lot in Perl "batch" scripts to
send the results to a list of maintainers.

A typical call looks like:

	emailFile({
		Server => 'something.wallace.com',
		File => "$0.txt", 
		From => "\"Automail - $0\"", 
		Subject => 'Crystal Info Activity Report', 
		ReplyTo => 'mblackwell@wallace.com', 
		To => \@addressList
	});

Perhaps something already exists to do this - I didn't notice one when this
was first put together.

I'm open to suggestions for namespace (currently Net::, as it works with
Graham's stuff - but it seems that may not be polite), calling interface,
and anything else you would like to offer regarding the best way to proceed.

Thanks in advance,

Mike Blackwell
