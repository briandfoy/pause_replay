Hello,

How to find the module dependencies? I have used many modules in  my tool
development, and i given all the modules used with my tool package. But when
the tool is installed on Windows at the customer places they are getting
problems as some of the module use some depenedent modules. Is there any way
to find out what are all the modules that are dependent.

Thanks and Regards
Sharan Hiremath
