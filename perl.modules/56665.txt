# To see the problem, try running "cpan DBIx::SchemaView". It's not going

# link under "Registered Modules" on your search.cpan.org author page.
# 
# Now, this isn't a huge deal. We're not going to pry the registration
# from your hands. If you want to make DBIx::SchemaView indexable, you can
# include a bare-bone .pm file which has mostly only documentation about
# the distribution or so. That's optional and up to you, of course.

Ok, I prepare barbone DBIx::SchemaView .pm file into and (if I have time)
separate it to three different packages (I sometimes need to install on my
installations only some of included packages like CompactDump etc.).

Thank you for instructions
