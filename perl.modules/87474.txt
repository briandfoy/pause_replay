Ok. Thanks. I'll give it a go.

Honestly, "gender" in a geek context to me has to do with serial cables and
adapters and the like and I was trying to figure out if I was unaware of a
language that had gendered variables and just got a lot of confused.
Clearly I don't spend enough time with the perl community anymore.

best regards
jane
