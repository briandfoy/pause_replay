The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Glite
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Web service wrapper for G-language System.
  userid:      GAOU (Kazuharu Arakawa)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    glang-users@lists.sourceforge.jp

  similar:

  rationale:

    I would like to register the namespace 'Bio::Glite' for the module
    I have created, which is an interface to G-language Genome Analysis
    Environment through its REST web service
    (http://www.g-language.org).

    Since this is a scientific software for genome biology researches,
    I believe a top level of 'Bio' would be suitable, and since this API
    is specific for, but a lightweight version of, G-language software,
    and the goal of this software is quite different from bioperl I
    think Glite can be placed at the second level.

  enteredby:   GAOU (Kazuharu Arakawa)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 18 01:54:36 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
::Glite           bmpOp Web service wrapper for G-language System.   GAOU
