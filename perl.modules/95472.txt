This distribution name will only be indexed when uploaded by users with
permission for the package Math::TrulyRandom. Either someone else has
ownership over that package name, or this is a brand new distribution
and that package name was neither listed in the 'provides' field in the
META file nor found inside the distribution's modules. Therefore, no
modules will be indexed.


Further details on the indexing attempt follow.

The following packages (grouped by status) have been found in the distro:

Status: Permission missing
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

     in file: Math-TrulyRandom-1.0/TrulyRandom.pm
     status : Not indexed because permission missing. Current registered
             primary maintainer is TELS. Hint: you can always find the
             legitimate maintainer(s) on PAUSE under "View Permissions".
