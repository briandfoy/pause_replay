From: rubykat@katspace.com (Kathryn Andersen)

I have been looking at the module list.  And at the FAQ.  And at the
lists of modules on CPAN.
In February I submitted a module registration request for my module
HTML::GenToc.  Now, the FAQ says that "The module list maintainers
themselves are mostly lurkers. You need not wait for a response.
Generally a lack of response can be taken as acceptance of the module
name being proposed."  Since I got a "lack of response" to my module
request, I didn't worry.

I am worrying now, because I have since discovered that the module which
my module is similar to, HTML::Toc (but I have a different user
interface and features) has been around since *September* last year,
and *it* isn't in the Module List either!

So what gives?
