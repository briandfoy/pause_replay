The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BerkeleyDB::BDB::Wrapper
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Make it easy to use BerkeleyDB.pm
  userid:      HIKARINE (Hajime Kurita)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is the module to make use of BerkeleyDB.pm easily and use it
    correctly for protecting BDB file from the concurrent access. I use
    this module for http://www.accessup.org/ and it is working well.
    This is my first try to upload perl module to CPAN, so please tell
    me if anything is wrong.

  enteredby:   HIKARINE (Hajime Kurita)
  enteredon:   Thu May 15 23:53:20 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

BerkeleyDB::BDB::
::Wrapper         MdpOp Make it easy to use BerkeleyDB.pm            HIKARINE
