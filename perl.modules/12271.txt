I would like to register, here is my info

your name : Joseph Annino
your email address : jannino@jannino.com
your homepage : http://www.jannino.com
your preferred user-ID on CPAN. : JANNINO
a short description of what you're planning to contribute :

I have several Perl/Tk widgets - RadiobuttonGroup, CheckboxGroup,
PropertySheet, and maybe a few others.
A module File::Rsync::Safe for doing safe (atomic) updates via rsync with
several options for dealing with versioning, timing, and locking.
Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSender - Allows Mail::Sender to be used with
Log::Dispatch

I look forward to my registration and any next steps.  I am working now on
packaging these in the usual CPAN way.
