There have been similar cases for other modules of Graciliano's and 
people not being able to reach him. Therefore, I'll add co-maintenance 
permissions for Brian.

Graciliano, if you object to this, please reply. There is nothing 
involved that cannot be undone. I am confident, however, that Brian will 
take good care of the module.

Best regards,
