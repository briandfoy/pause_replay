This is me slapping my forehead because I know that and keep forgetting it

I am not wed to the package name but was simply trying to follow what
others have done.

I am thinking specifically of XML::SAXDriver::(Excel|CVS) Granted neither
one of those have defined XML applications (I don't think they do,
anyway.)

I'm not even all that wild about vcard-xml since it doesn't handle
X-CUSTOM fields by default but decided that it wasn't worth muddying the
waters and re-inventing the wheel.

I am open to suggestions. Perhaps vCard::XML::SAXDriver?

My only other comment would be that it kind of breaks the whole
XML::SAXDriver::* namespace if it can't/shouldn't contain anything whose
XML output has been formalized now or in the future.
