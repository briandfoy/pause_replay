Christian Based Inc. 500 Company Needs You.  Our Company will introduce to the market this year a wind energy system that will start generating electricity with a 3 MPH wind.  This device mounted on your roof-top, with no blades or propellers, silently capturing the power of the wind to provide electricity for your home.  This is expected to be as big as Computer, Microwave Ovens and VCR'S.  This could be your opportunity of a Lifetime.  We need people we can train to Manager across the World.  You can start making money your first week and I can show you how to earn $8,000 your first month, if you follow our proven plan.  Our Company also has profit sharing, bonus car, paid travel programs and early retirement.

We have become the world's largest producer of indoor air quality equipment and besides indoor air pollution, we address the problem of water quality.  With the need for clean Air and Water our company has been rated the number one Home Based Business in America for two years in a row.  Our government uses the Company products around the world, and in fact, they're using our air purifiers in the pentagon right now.

In these two area alone we have people earning close to a million dollars a year, and we are only touching 2% of the market.  

THIS CAN BE YOUR OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME!   We invite you to evaluate this extraordinary opportunity.   Are you a leader?  Can you build and manage for the greatest opportunity this century on planet earth.
