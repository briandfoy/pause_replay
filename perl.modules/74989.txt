Hi, Jacob.

Generally speaking, namespace registration is getting rarer as people
seem to find modules via search at search.cpan.org or other places
rather than the namespace tables.

That said, the convention of a good namespace prefix still holds
whether or not you formally register and helps people find modules
they otherwise might miss.  I did a quick search for "column report"
and saw things like "Text::Report", "Data::Report", "Data::CTable" and
"Data::Presenter".  From that sample, "Data::" is probably a good
prefix, but I think "Text::" is also a good option since your modules
focuses on the output more than the input.

I would encourage you to consider a more descriptive name than
"UNLreport" -- since I don't know what "UNL" means.  The
module-authors@perl.org list is a good place to ask for feedback on
names, as is perlmonks.org.

If you do add a prefix, you'd move your module file to (for example)
"lib/Data/UNLReport.pm" and change the package line to "package
Data::UNLReport".  Then it would be loaded via:

    use Data::UNLReport;

While you may "fear" that extra length, it's very typical for CPAN
modules to have a prefix.  While there is no rule against a
"top-level" namespace, people are usually encouraged to avoid it
unless their work represents an entire project or family of modules.
C.f "Moose".

Regards,
David Golden
