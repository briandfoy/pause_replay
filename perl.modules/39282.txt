    Summer break is right around the corner! Statistics have shown that a large percentage of our Educational Employees and their Preferred Partners will be inquiring about our Educator Mortgage services within the next few weeks.
    
    We are urging you to get started early and fill out your loan application at no cost to you.   We will send you a "Commitment to Lend" certificate that is good for 120 days.

    You can apply online at www.educatorsmortgage.net.  There are complete and short applications available for your convenience.  If possible, we would prefer that you fill out the full application, in order to expedite the approval process.  If you choose the short application, one of our Educational Specialists will contact you as soon as possible.  Please indicate the best time and number that you can be reached.

    If you prefer to call and speak to one of our specialists, the application can be taken over the phone.  Please allow about 15 minutes for the process.  The number to call is, toll free, 1-877-733-3278.

    We look forward to assisting you with your financial needs.

    Thank you, and have a great summer!!
