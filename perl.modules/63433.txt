The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::KernelEstimation
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Kernel Density Estimates and Histograms
  userid:      JANERT (Philipp K. Janert)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org PerlMonks comp.lang.perl comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Statistics::Descriptive

  rationale:

    [An RFC for this module, including details and rationale, was
    posted to modules@ on 23Nov2008.]

    What? ===== This modules calculates Kernel Density Estimates and
    related quantities for a collection of random points.

    Why? ==== A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) is similar to a
    histogram, but improves on two known problems of histograms: it is
    smooth (whereas a histogram is ragged) and does not suffer from
    ambiguity in regards to the placement of bins.

    This module is intended as a complement to Statistics::Descriptive,
    which provides all sorts of summary statistics for a data set. This
    new module allows users to visualize the point distribution itself.
    It handles all the required bookkeeping and includes non-trivial
    convenience features, such as support for kernel bandwidth
    optimization.

    Where? ====== The "Statistics" namespace seems the natural place
    for this module.

    The full RFC, including responses to reader questions can be found
    on PerlMonks: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=725475

The resulting entry would be:
