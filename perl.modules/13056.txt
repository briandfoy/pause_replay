The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Listman
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Easily managing web subscription lists
  userid:      HPYHACKER (Wolfgang Sourdeau)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I chose the CGI namespace since this module will probably be of
    best use to CGI applications although one could argue it could be
    used in any form-based user interface. Listman comes from "list
    manager" in short. It provides a frameworks to manage lists of
    persons by storing them in any type of database supported by DBI
    (well, it's one of the goals), by exporting the records for
    retrieval by a site administrator in the form of a CSV file.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::Listman         adpOp Easily managing web subscription lists       HPYHACKER
