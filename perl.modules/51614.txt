The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       oedtk
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: oedtk is a project for printing processing
  userid:      DAUNAY (David Aunay)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/oedtk/

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is no specialized namespace for enhancement of data tracking
    and knowledge for industrial printing processing.

    This module is an interface for products as DSC Compuset and LaTex
    in the future (planed). The beta of this namespace is actually used
    by 20 applications in production.

    There would be differents modules in this namespace : - building
    application modules. - production modules dedicated by target
    product.

    This module is a toolkit for developping parsing application
    dedicated to Compuset (and Latex in the future). First you can
    create application by loading stream documentation (such as Cobol
    CopyBooks). Developpers will customize their application. Then the
    core (basics functions) of this module is used by the applications
    to product documents such as mailings, invoices, banking statement,
    etc. In the future, I would like to add a user interface.

The resulting entry would be:
