> I'd like to adopt Term::EditLine.

Hi me again.  I posted about this a few weeks ago but did not receive a
response.  I am interested in adopting Term::EditLine, which just needs a
little love to make it useful again.  I have forked the module in my
GitHub here:

https://github.com/plicease/Term-EditLine

My PAUSE id is plicease.

I've made changes to resolve the existing tickets on rt and made some
small changes to get it to work more reliably on some additional
environments.  The original author intended to make me owner of the
module, but was apparently unable to because he had forgotten his PAUSE
password.  You can see by his index on metacpan.org that he is no longer
active on CPAN:

https://metacpan.org/author/PHINYX

I am including his message inline this time, as last time it seems the
attachment was stripped.

Can someone with authority to change the ownership please help me, or
point me in the appropriate direction to someone who can.

Thanks,
Graham

Hello Graham,

I'm glad to hear that you wish to adopt the module. I haven't used the
code for ten years and I'm not interested in the module anymore.
I will give you ownership of the module as soon as I have recovered
my PAUSE password.

Best regards
Ulrich
