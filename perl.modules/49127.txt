Regarding http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18792

PLEASE, may I have access to upload the new version I have attached  
at that bug report above (my cpan id is DMUEY) or can one of you that  
has access just upload it to the author's account so that the fixed  
version will be whats installed via CPAN?

The author is unresponsive and this is a very very serious bug with  
an easy fix all packaged up and ready to go :)

Thanks!
