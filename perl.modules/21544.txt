Installing Pod::DocBook from CPAN installs P-DB-0.05 instead of the more up
to date 0.06 by Jan Iven. I have an even more up-to-date 0.07 version on
my hard disk, but uploading it will not get it installed by default
either.

Can I become the owner of the Pod::DocBook namespace instead of Alligator
Descartes who no longer maintains this package, and who was unresponsive
last time I tried to contact him?

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
