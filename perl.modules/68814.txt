     why:

    1) Because all the cool kids in my street all have one 2) I've
    always wanted to say "patches welcome" on IRC when someone moaned at
    me 3) You can never have enough things inside the Acme namespace.

    (seriously? I'd like to put some stuff on CPAN that works with
    propriety 3rd party API's, of course)
