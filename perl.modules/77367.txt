Hello

When I was a child in Perl world, I released a couple of modules with 
names that, during the time, changed (some others were completely removed).

Although they might still exist on backpan, they are not available on 
CPAN for years, and I imagine nobody is really using any of them.

Is t possible to unregister these module names? So that they do not 
appear in cpantesters or rt lists?

Cheers
ambs
