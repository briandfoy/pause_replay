Subject: Module submission IO::BufferedSelect
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::BufferedSelect
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Line-buffered select interface
  userid:      AFN (Antal Novak)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module provides a way to safely combine line-buffered I/O with
    select() (currently only reading is supported; writing may be added
    in the future). It provides an interface that blocks until a full
    line is readable on one of a set of filehandles.

    Don't know of any similar modules, but IO seems to be the right
    place to put it.

  enteredby:   AFN (Antal Novak)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 13 08:27:21 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::BufferedSelect  RdpOp Line-buffered select interface               AFN
