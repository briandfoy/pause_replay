Hi,

  I'm the author of the Net::Jabber modules.  There was recently a new
Jabber top level namespace created to hold Jabber specific modules. 
Would it be possible to get the Net::Jabber module to show up in that
list as well as in the Net list?  I'm fairly sure that I've seen some
modules show up in multiple lists, but I could be wrong.
