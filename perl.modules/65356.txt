One requirement is that the $VERSION assignment must work on a single
line if you want the indexer to find it. This implies that if you want
to use version.pm you must 'use' it on the same line. Since a well
respected author has recommended this style in a book about various
practices several years ago it is supported to say something like:

    use version; our $VERSION = qv("1.2.3");

BTW, this is covered in the version.pm manpage.

I'd rather not recommend any practice wrt version numbering. Pich your
favorite and keep it as long as it works.
