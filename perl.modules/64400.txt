Subject: Module submission Apache2::WebApp::Simple

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::WebApp::Simple
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: A simplified Web Application framework
  userid:      MBROOKS (Marc S. Brooks)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Catalyst

  rationale:

    This is a simple web application framework which runs under the
    mod_perl environment.

    Several features of this framework include URI to class method
    dispatching, persistent database connections, and template caching.

    ** Uniqueness vs the Catalyst approach **

    This package only requires a handful of modules to be installed.

    mod_perl Apache2::Cookie Apache2::Request Apache2::Session
    Apache::DBI

    Any modules beyond that is up to the developer.

    ** Other features **

    This package will also include

    A pluggable admin dashboard which is built in XHTML/CSS and
    Javascript.

    Command-line tools in order to easily set-up and test your
    application.
