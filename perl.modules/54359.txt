Hi,

Is there any documentation on how CPAN indexes an uploaded distribution? =


Specifically, I am trying to find out:
- how it assigns types to files in the distribution =
(module/documentation/other file)
- how it decides to make a file searchable at search.cpan.org

These are in relation to two distributions I uploaded recently, =
HTML::GMap and GD::Icons.

In the case of HTML::GMap for example,=20
<http://search.cpan.org/~pcanaran/HTML-GMap-0.01/>
There are two example scripts (no extensions) in the examples directory. =
Only one of these files is indexed. And the README file in the examples =
directory is also indexed.

In the case of GD::Icons,
<http://search.cpan.org/~pcanaran/GD-Icons-0.01/>
There are two module, of which one of them is assigned as documentation.

I have used Module::Starter to package these. I checked =
ExtUtils::Makemaker for options that might hint the indexer but didn't =
see any.

Thank you.

Payan
