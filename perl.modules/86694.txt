Hi, Chris.

Are you actually CKIMBER rather than "CLIMBER" (as you said in your email)?

I can update the email address and you can do a password reset, but
first I need you to find a way to validate your email address with
your identity.

You can point me to a public profile on the web (Google+, Facebook,
LinkedIn) that has your email address, that would work (or you can
send me a LinkedIn invite). Or have someone who I already know vouch
for you.

Regards,
David Golden
