: 
:     I don't think that Religion:: is the right top-level namespace.
: The module doesn't process theological concepts, it processes text.
: I would suggest that you either put your modules under Text::GBF::,
: or under SWORD:: (if you're planning on submitting a lot of SWORD-
: related modules).

Yes, lots under Sword, and there are several processors, not just GBF,
should they all go under Text::, or would a Text::[something here]::
be more appropriate.  Also, some of these formats are actually binary
in nature.
