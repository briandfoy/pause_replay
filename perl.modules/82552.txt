The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URI::Based
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Define a base URI and then generate variatio
  userid:      NICWOLFF (Nic Wolff)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    <https://github.com/nicwolff/URI-Based/issues

  similar:
    URI URI::WithBase

  rationale:

    Gisle's URI is a terrific module, but it doesn't facilitate setting
    a base URI and then generating URIs that add more path segments and
    query strings to it. URI's setters change the stored path, and they
    don't return the URI object, so they can't be chained or printed;
    even URI::WithBase doesn't help much.

    This module lets you program in a more readable style, setting up
    $u = URI::Based->new( 'http://example.com/path' ) and then easily
    printing URIs under that directory with print $u->with(
    '/more/path/segments', and => params ).

    It's handy!

The resulting entry would be:

URI::
