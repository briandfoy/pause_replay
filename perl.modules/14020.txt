The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Client::Ping
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: concurrent ICMP ping without fork or threads
  userid:      RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    poe@perl.org; comp.lang.perl.misc; irc #perl and #poe; it has been
    on CPAN for over two years

  similar:
    Net::Ping (only pings one host at a time; doesn't report round-trip
    times)

  rationale:

    This is a POE component for ICMP ping. As such, it belongs in
    POE::Component::Client and follows with ::Ping. The module addresses
    a need to query large networks, perhaps entire enterprise WANs,
    quickly and without the resource penalties of using multiple
    processes or Perl interpreters.

    The POE::Component namespace has been carved out by its author (who
    happens to be me) for add-on modules to the POE networking and
    multitasking framework.

  enteredby:   RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  enteredon:   Sat Sep 28 05:28:49 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Client::
::Ping            Rdphp concurrent ICMP ping without fork or threads RCAPUTO
