The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BB
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Perl based Big Brother framework
  userid:      GREPBOY (Eirik W. Toft)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    BigBrother::Object

  rationale:

    I have searched around CPAN for various BigBrother modules. I have
    found no particular namespace for them to be located in, except for
    the BigBrother namespace - which I will happily occupy, but cannot
    reach the author. I am tasked with writing several extensions to Big
    Brother and intend to locate them all here for general use.

  enteredby:   GREPBOY (Eirik W. Toft)
  enteredon:   Wed Jul 28 17:26:29 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

BB                bdpOg Perl based Big Brother framework             GREPBOY
