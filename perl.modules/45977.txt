LS,

I have created a small addition to the LSF module set and wanted to notify
the author to consider including it in his module-set... But the e-mails I
sent to him bounced back with 'unknown recipient'. (I sent to both his
cpan address and the one listed in the module, they go to different
addresses). What would now be the next logical step for me to do? To
upload the module myself?

Thanks for your advice!

Aukjan van Belkum
