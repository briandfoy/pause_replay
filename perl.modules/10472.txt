I have been maintaining Archive::Zip. The last I heard about Amavis was that 
they wanted to detect certain kinds of zip archive damage caused by specific 
viruses. I added this in a test version that I sent to them. However, I told 
them that I wouldn't make a permanent change until we could decide on a 
proper way to report/control this automatic fixing mode.

So I've been waiting. My last communication with Lars Hecking of Amavis was 
on Nov. 9 of last year, and I asked him at the time how he wanted the fixing 
handled. I haven't heard back from him.

I haven't received any patches from him; which ones are you referring to? We 
did communicate about his desire for extra functionality.

If this is "unmaintained", you have a different definition of the term than I 
do. 

Still, I intend to come up with a new version as soon as I get time to.
