If that's the case then I'll have to come up with an alternative.
Getopt::GUI isn't sufficient because I intended to make a Getopt::Std
replacement as well.  Getopt::GUI::Long is probably the right choice
for the current package.  Geptopt::Long::GUI is really just a wrapper
around Getopt::Long and thus placing it directly underneath seemed
like the best choice.  But it's your name space, so I'll bow to your
wishes...
