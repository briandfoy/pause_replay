The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NetMgmt
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Manage network devices and configurations
  userid:      RSTAATS (Robert Staats)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I didn't want to use a Net:: namespace because as explained in the
    PAUSE module naming doc Net was originally designed as a home for
    the code that knows how to talk various defined network protocols.

    The module(s) I am submitting are from the Perl part of a network
    management system we have that connects to many vendor devices over
    the network (Cisco, Juniper, F5, VMware, more) to monitor and
    configure them.

    The base module name chosen was NetMgmt because it does network
    management. Our sub modules are as such:

    NetMgmt::Device.pm (Base class) NetMgmt::Device::Cisco.pm (Sub
    class) NetMgtm::Device::Cisco::IOS.pm (Sub class)
    NetMgmt::Device::Juniper.pm (Sub class)
    NetMgmt::Device::Juniper::JUNOS.pm (Sub class) ... and so on

  enteredby:   RSTAATS (Robert Staats)
  enteredon:   Fri Jan 18 00:37:04 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

NetMgmt           bdpOg Manage network devices and configurations    RSTAATS
