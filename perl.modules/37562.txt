The first message had a couple of typo's in the second
'eval'.  They were typos in the mail, not what I've done.

Sorry...

Hi All

I'm trying to implement a test using Test::More where I want
a subroutine to die and I want to catch the error to make
sure it's right.

I've checked the docs on Test::Simple, Test::More, and
Test::Tutorial and I can't seem to get this to work.

This must be something people do, but I can't seem to get it
to work.

I tried:
eval {
	call_sub()
};
if ($@...

and eval {
	local $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {print STDERR "Got die..."};
	call_sub();
};
if ($@...

and these don't work.

I found the __DIE__ signal handeler in Test::Builder and
modified it to print the call stack to STDERR and find the
call to my subroutine in the stack and the call to
Test::Builder::__ANON__, but not the eval block.

I must be doing something foolish/ignorant/stupid here but
don't see what.

Suggestions please...

Thanks
Steve S.
