I was poking around in PAUSE this evening trying to fix
something, and I noticed I have the "Post Message" option
(power, whipping stick, whatever) so I make make a message
appear above a user's PAUSE menu.

This thing seems like a good idea, and I could have used
it a couple of times this month. 

How have admins used this in the past, or have they used it
at all?  What is the received wisdom on this tool? Is it 
something I should use {liberally|sparingly|not at all}?
