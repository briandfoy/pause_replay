The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Float
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Compare if two numbers are equal within a sp
  userid:      DAGOLDEN (David Golden)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    Most programmers at one time or another are confronted with the
    issue of comparing floating-point numbers for equality. The
    canonical idiom is to test if the absolute value of the difference
    of the numbers is within a desired precision. This module provides
    such a function for use with Test::Harness. Usage is similar to
    other test functions described in Test::More. Semantically, the
    cmp_float function replaces this kind of construct:

    ok ( abs($p - $q) <= $precision, '$p is equal to $q' ) or diag "$p
    is not equal to $q to within $precision";

    While there's nothing wrong with that construct, it's a pain to
    type it repeatedly in a test script. This module does the same thing
    with a single function call and supports user specified precisions.

The resulting entry would be:
