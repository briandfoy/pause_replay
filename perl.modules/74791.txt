There are other, non-death reasons for this as well.

Andy,

I have removed you as contact for SPOON, per your request.  Thank you
for being the point of contact for several years.

Historical practice seems to be that unless a person such as yourself
(or brian d foy for Randy Kobes) steps up to be point of contact,
email is directed instead to modules@perl.org, so I have done that
with SPOON.
