The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Quake::DEM
  DSLIP:       cdpfg
  description: Quake Demo Source from LMPC
  userid:      OKTAL (Mat Sutcliffe)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    IRC Chat Channel: #quakeforge on irc.openprojects.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    I suggest a new space be created under Games for all modules to do
    with the Quake series. I will be creating more such modules after
    this one, and doubtless the QuakeForge project will create some (QF
    is a group hacking the Classic Quake source code which was released
    recently). There were other possibilities for the name of the Demo
    Source module: Demo (too vague between different sequels of Quake
    whose demo formats are very different (DM2, DM3)), and LS (this is
    the filename extension that LMPC assigns to demo source, however I
    believe that in the future the module can be broadened to cope with
    compiled binary demos, so that would be a misleading name). LMPC is
    the Little Movie Processing Centre which can decompile a Quake (and
    other games) demo into an ASCII format similar to a C nested struct
    typedef, and recompile such a file back into binary format that can
    be read by Quake. At the moment the only tools for editing demo
    source are general text editors.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Quake::
::DEM             cdpfg Quake Demo Source from LMPC                  OKTAL
