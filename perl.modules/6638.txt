I have a nagging interest in HTML::FromText.  I've tried to contact
the author ( who hasn't updated the module in years ) to send him
patches and his mail bounced.

I have an immediate need for these updates and, since it seems to have
been abandoned for some time, I'd like to take it over by uploading a
new version to the CPAN under the same namespace.

Is this ok?

PS.  I'll be uploading it under the CWEST PAUSE id, I'm finally ready
to get my CPAN life together under my new name.

Andreas, you mentioned scaping some things under the table like
'override'?  Perhaps we can do all this very soon?
