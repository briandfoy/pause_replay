Take a look here:

http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/gsl-ref_toc.html

I implemented a base class and several sub-classes to
do 3 algorithms of "One dimensional Root-Finding" (of
general non-linear functions).  You'll also find in
this GSL documention a separate section for
"Polynomials" and routines for finding the roots (i.e.
Polynomial::Solve).

From this GSL documention, the related sections are:

* One dimensional Root-Finding (Math::Solve1)
* One dimensional Minimization (Math::Brent is one
algorithm)
* Multidimensional Root-Finding
* Multidimensional Minimization (Math::Amoeba is one
algorithm)

* Polynomials (Math::Polynomials)
  - the root-finding could be considered a subset of
    one dimensional root-finding
* Linear Algebra (various perl packages)
  - solving a system of linear equations is a subset
of
    multidimensional root-finding (non-linear)
* Simulated Annealing
  - method of multidimensional minimization attempting
    to find the global minimum 

Like I said earlier, you could also envision something
doing it all - multidimension minimization with
constraints.  This would solve a system of nonlinear
equations (and/or inequalities) while minimizing one
(or more?) nonlinear functions.  This would be the
granddaddy of nonlinear programming.

Hopefully this helps put this into context.
