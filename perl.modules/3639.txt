Hello,

    Here is the information requested form
http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html :

Name: Matt Sanford
email : mzsanford@aol.com
home page: none
preferred User ID: MZSanford
planning to contribute:
 -- Modules :
        Dev::x25.pm  - cdpO - x25 communications in pure perl.
 -- scripts, ports, documentation
        script: binary_mod_maker.pl - given a hash of field names and
binary types (used by pack), will generate a module with general OO
methods. Saves on leg work.
        documentation - Paper on binary data processing in perl.
        documentation - Paper on data summary using the hash or a hash
technique.

Areas of Discussion : With other perl developers within the company
(AOL). Worked with Les Peters (awarded BEST OF SHOW, TPJ 5th Annual
Obfuscated Perl Contest) among others. Work on mostly internal
programming, which cannot be released, but hoping to start releasing the
more generic code i have written.


Thank You;
