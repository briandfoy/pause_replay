Request to register new user

fullname: Pete Houston
  userid: HOUSTON
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.perlconsultancy.com/
     why:

    I have written a perl module which subclasses and extends an
    existing CPAN module (Net::EPP::Simple) and would like to publish it
    on CPAN for the benefit of the wider community. It is intended that
    other such modules will follow in due course.

    I've been programming in Perl since 1994, but am coming very late
    to the publishing party - better late than never!
