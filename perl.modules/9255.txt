The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::ObjectTracker
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: Track object life to aid memory leak detecti
  userid:      JOHNC (John Clutterbuck)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Aspect

  rationale:

    I have not found any similar module on the CPAN apart from Aspect
    which seems to be more for use as a permanent part of an
    application. This module is purely for development support (hence
    the name) to help check for memory leaks within a perl application,
    not perl itself. It uses the perl -d DB::Sub hook to look for new
    objects, etc. in all sub arguments and return values and notes the
    datetime, call stack, etc. The current list of known objects can be
    output on demand. Output is recorded in spreadsheet compatable files
    which can be analysed to see when and where objects are created and
    destroyed, and more importantly whats left behind at key stages in
    an application.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
