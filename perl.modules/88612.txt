OK, the email to KSCHOTTIE@cpan.org bounced:

  KSCHOTTIE@cpan.org
    SMTP error from remote mail server after RCPT TO:<KSCHOTTIE@cpan.org>:
    host cpan.mx.develooper.com [207.171.7.115]: 554 5.7.1 <KSCHOTTIE@cpan.org>:
    Recipient address rejected: Access denied

I also wrote to the Dancer user mailing list and send a contact request on Linkedin.
I'm not aware of various Dancer forums, but I don't use forums at all.

BTW: Where I can find registered CPAN modules (which are not uploaded yet).

         Racke
