The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::LinearRaid
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Multiple physical files as one seamless file
  userid:      ROSULEK (Mike Rosulek)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Allows you to access a linear series of files (with random access)
    through a single aggregate filehandle. It's useful if your
    filesystem has a low size limit, but you need to pass a filehandle
    for a large amount of data into some module -- the data can be
    stored in many smaller physical files, but accessed through one
    filehandle in Perl.

    I'm not entirely attached to the module's name -- should it be
    under IO:: instead?

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::LinearRaid      bdprp Multiple physical files as one seamless file ROSULEK
