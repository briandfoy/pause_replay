As you may be aware, there was a CPAN/CPANTS/modules/etc BOF yesterday
at YAPC.  Ziggy's going to be posting full minutes soon (to cpan-workers
and use.perl.org if I recall correctly) but one of the action items that
I volunteered for was to review current module naming conventions on
CPAN (if any), look at any discrepancies, and start thinking about
resolving them in time for the inevitable "Great Perl 6 Module
Rewriting".

My plan of attack at the moment is to look through the modules lists on
CPAN, talk to people about what they see as mixed up (for instance I
know that Date::* and Time::* aren't clearly organised), and write this
up somehow.

I hope to deliver a document describing current "best practice" for
module naming, and a set of recommendations for Perl 6.

I'm emailing you just to let you know what I'm up to and to solicit your
assistance if you're interested.  Let me know if you have any thoughts.

Yours,

K.
