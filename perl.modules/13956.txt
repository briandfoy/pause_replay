The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Jeopardy
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Data model and playing logic of Jeopardy
  userid:      BIGJ (Janek Schleicher)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Games::GuessWord Games::QuizTaker

  rationale:

    Programming some versions of Jeopardy games makes it neccessary to
    seperate the different views (e.g. HTML/Tk/...) from the data model
    and playing logic. As I could imagine that it is perhaps interesting
    for someone else, I'll also want to provide in CPAN.

    The most advantages are the generalization possibilities for the
    rules (number of players, size of boards, scoring, time penalties,
    who's allowed to answer or select categories, ...) and the
    possibility to create Mementos to store the current play standing
    without breaking the hiding principle (it also provides the
    possibility to take back an action).

    The only real problem I see with this name is that Jeopardy could
    be a trademark. As I don't have any commercial aspects, I'm brave
    enough to reserve the namespace :-))

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Jeopardy        cdpOp Data model and playing logic of Jeopardy     BIGJ
