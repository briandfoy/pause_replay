This variant here is unmaintained for a few years.
The biggest problem is that the PROXYSUBS feature should be warned against to be used in CPAN modules, as it generates code which is only usable >5.14

The fixed version and development continued at https://github.com/rurban/ExtUtils-Constant/
Latest RURBAN/ExtUtils-Constant-0.23_04.tar.gz
There ProxySubs generates code which is only broken < 5.8

Can I get co-maint to get the >15 fixes into CPAN proper?
This is quite an important module.
