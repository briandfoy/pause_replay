The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::Tpyo
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Adds typos to a string
  userid:      SIMCOP (Ryan Voots)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    the module is not a serious one so i have put it in Acme::* to
    reflect that. it may have some uses to some people (such as me, to
    make a chatterbot seem more realistic), the name Tpyo is in fact a
    Typo of Typo, it was chosen on purpose to be funny.

  enteredby:   SIMCOP (Ryan Voots)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 27 20:11:59 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Acme::
::Tpyo            bdpfp Adds typos to a string                       SIMCOP
