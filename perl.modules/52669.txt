The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Logo::Language
  DSLIP:       cncOp
  description: A module for executing Logo commands
  userid:      JCNORTON (John C. Norton)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Boston Perlmongers

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module was presented at the Boston Perlmongers group on
    January 16th, at which time there was a consensus from those people
    most familiar with CPAN that the Language::Logo namespace would
    likely be the best location.

  enteredby:   JCNORTON (John C. Norton)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 18 21:02:04 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Logo::
::Language        cncOp A module for executing Logo commands         JCNORTON
