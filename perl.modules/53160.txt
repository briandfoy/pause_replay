    NAME AutoReloader - Lazy loading and reloading of (anonymous)
    subroutines

    DESCRIPTION

    A drop-in replacement for AutoLoader which provides reloading of
    subroutines or methods e.g. upon disk change.

    AutoReloader provides lazy loading like AutoLoader, but also for
    function files which return an anonymous subroutine upon require (as
    its last evaluated statement).

    Before requiring that file, it is checked via some subroutine
    returning a value (default is mtime). The returned value is
    remembered. At each call to that sub the check subroutine is run
    again if this subroutine's check flag is set; and if the returned
    value changed, the source file is reloaded.

    Importing the AUTOLOAD method provides for lazy loading of anonsubs
    as named subs. The wrapped anonsub will be assigned to a symbol
    table entry named after the filename root of the function source
    file.

    See http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=600805 for more information.
