'UI::StateMachine', perhaps?  That's really all it is.  Isn't strictly an F=
SM,=20
since there isn't an alphabet input for it to use.  It's only real job is t=
o=20
make sure that each state can only transition to another that was explicitl=

I'm not sure where else to put it, but perhaps I lack imagination.  The=20
current 'Data::' namespace is a possibility, though it may be a little too=
=20
generic. Reorginizing it under the 'Control Flow Utilites' category may be=
=20
wise, though there doesn't appear to be a well-defined hierarchy to that=20
section.
