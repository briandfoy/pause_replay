The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::SPG
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Simple Password Generator
  userid:      GERA (Devendra Gera)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.theoldmonk.net/blog/archives/2008/07/22/spg_-_simple_password_generator/

  similar:
    Crypt::RandPasswd Data::SimplePassword String::MkPasswd
    Crypt::PassGen

  rationale:

    I have been using unique passwords for (almost) all the websites I
    have accounts on, and have a handy script to do the task for me. The
    idea is simple and came from a comment on a blog post(
    http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/how_to_harvest.html#c220047
    ). You just need to remember one secret passphrase. Every time you
    need a unique password, append that secret to a unique string
    identifying the use (the website URL, or the domain name), hash the
    result and use the first n characters of it as the password. Unique,
    and there's only one thing to remember.

    There are other password generators, but thet focus on generating
    unique/random passwords, leaving it upon the user to remember/manage
    them.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::SPG             bdpfp Simple Password Generator                    GERA
