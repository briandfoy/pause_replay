     why:

    We, Apple, would like to make our PerlObjCBridge module open source
    by posting it on CPAN. The PerlObjCBridge module supports creating
    and messaging Objective-C objects from Perl programs, allowing Cocoa
    objects in Apple Computer's Mac OS X to be directly manipulated from
    Perl. In addition, Perl objects can be messaged from Objective-C,
    making it possible for Perl objects to function as Cocoa delegates
    and as targets of notifications and other Cocoa call-back messages.
    Perl programs can take advantage of Cocoa's Distributed Objects
    mechanism to support messaging between Perl objects and Objective-C
    objects (or other Perl objects) in different address spaces,
    possibly on different machines.
