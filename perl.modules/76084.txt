Subject: Module submission Finance::QFX
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, budney@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::QFX
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Read and create files in Quicken QFX format
  userid:      BUDNEY (Leonard R Budney)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::OFX, Finance:QIF

  rationale:

    There are already modules under the Finance namespace for parsing
    Quicken's older formats, QIF and OFX. So far there are no Perl
    modules that I can find for parsing QFX.

    Directly under Finance seems like the place to put it given that
    the other modules with similar purpose live there already.

  enteredby:   BUDNEY (Leonard R Budney)
  enteredon:   Sun May 15 19:43:01 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::
::QFX             adpOp Read and create files in Quicken QFX format  BUDNEY
