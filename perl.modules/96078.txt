Subject: PAUSE permissions clash between MCrypt and Mcrypt

Hi Frey & Theo,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m emailing you because =
I=E2=80=99m working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now =
considering package names case insensitively. This has left us with some =
situations where two or more people are owners of namespaces previously =
considered distinct, and now considered the same.

Frey has ownership of MCrypt (last released in 2000), and Theo has =
ownership of Mcrypt (last released in 2007). These are now considered =
the same from a permissions perspective, resulting in a conflict, which =
wouldn=E2=80=99t let anyone release a new version.

There are at least ways we can resolve this:

 1. One of you could rename this to Crypt::MCrypt or similar
 2. I noticed that MCrypt won=E2=80=99t install under any recent =
versions of Perl:
       http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=3DMCrypt
    So maybe the quickest solution would be to delete MCrypt from CPAN,
    if Frey is ok with that? I can do that for you.

How would you like to proceed?

PAUSE no longer lets situations like this occur, so I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
