Howdy,

Recently I uploaded a module called LinePrinter
(LinePrinter-0.10.tar.gz) under the name CFUHRMAN.  Unfortunately, I was
not aware of the naming conventions at the time and realized that having
one's module in a top-level area is probably not a Good Idea<tm>.

The purpose of this module is to provide a method for perl programmers to
talk to remote print servers without having to create a pipe to lp or
lpr.  I'm willing to rename the module (at least to give it more exposure
*G*) and I believe that having it under the Net:: hierarchy would be the
most logical choice (e.g. Net::LinePrinter or Net::RemotePrinter).  

Other suggestions and comments would be appreciated!
