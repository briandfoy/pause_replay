Any chance we could switch the first-come permission on Sub::Name over to
FLORA so rafl can give out co-maint to people? I don't want to 'steal' your
module but it'd be nice to have somebody able to mint extra co-maints for
bugfix releases etc.

(sent to modules@ because if we can't raise XMATH I intend to JFDI on the
forgiveness/permission principle, and ETHER because damned if I'll remember
to JFDI unless she reminds me)
