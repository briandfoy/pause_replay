Subject: Module submission Authen::Krb5Password

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::Krb5Password
  DSLIP:       Sdcfp
  description: Kerberos 5 Password Verification module
  userid:      SHUQUE (Shumon Huque)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Authen::Krb5::Simple

  rationale:

    I'd like to submit a module that performs Kerberos 5 password
    verification. It has been in use at our site for a number of years
    and I've recently given it out to a few colleagues so I thought I
    might place it on CPAN also. There is one module on CPAN
    (Authen::Krb5::Simple) that attempts to perform this function but
    does so incompletely because it doesn't verify the authenticity of
    the KDC's response (leaving it vulnerable to a well known attack.)

    The module I intend to submit does the following: in addition to
    acquiring initial credentials (ie. a Kerberos TGT), it obtains a
    service ticket for a local application service and attempts to
    decrypt the ticket via possession of it's master key - thus
    verifying the authenticity of the Kerberos server's response.

    It's a C extension module, requiring the MIT Kerberos 5 software
    distribution to compile successfully.

    The logical place for this module would be in the Authen::
    hierarchy. And I'd like the name to be Authen::Krb5Password to make
    it clear that this is a Kerberos password verification routine and
    not native Kerberos authentication. I don't think it belongs in
    Authen::Krb5:: either because it is not dependent on the
    Authen::Krb5 module routines.

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::
::Krb5Password    Sdcfp Kerberos 5 Password Verification module      SHUQUE
