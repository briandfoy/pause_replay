Hello,

As win32-guitest developers don't mind me being a new self-appointed CPAN
maintainer of Win32::GuiTest module (see mail attached), I'd like to ask if
that be possible to make me (CPAN id KARASIK) a co-maint for the module, and if
yes, to re-run the indexer for the module, because I've already uploaded it.


-- 
Sincerely,
	Dmitry Karasik

Absolutely,
I am trying to contact Dennis Paulsen in order to obtain proper privileges for you.
