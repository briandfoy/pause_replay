Chief =28Dr=2E=29 david ehi=28SAN=29
David=2C Ayo & Co=2E Chambers=2C


Compliments of the day to you=2C

Firstly=2C let me introduce myself=2C I am Chief =28Dr=2E=29david ehi
the principal partner of David=2C Ayo & Co=2E Chambers=2E I have 
been in the legal system for the past 30years=2E Right now I am a
gubernatorial candidate in my state=2E And I hope to become the
governor of my state come 2003 election=2E

I am one of the founding members of the ruling party=2C People 
Democratic Party =28PDP=29=2E The party leaders have unanimously
decided that I should be rewarded for my long-term support 
and steadfastness for the course of the party=2E As a reward the
party leaders have given me the ticket as the governor of my 
state=2C Delta State=2C which is the oil nerve center of my country 
Nigeria=2E In addition=2C it was also decided by the leaders that the
party would be responsible for sourcing the finance for my election=2E
The party leaders mandated the presidency to find a way of raising 
funds to meet with my political ambition=2E

The Presidency has given me a gigantic project with the 
Liquidifed Natural Gas Company =28LNGC=29=2E I was told to get a 
foreigner who will be my expatriate partner and as a front for the 
project=2E This favour is given secretively by the Presidency therefore 
the foreigner=2C who has no connection with Nigeria=2C will front as the 
owner of the project=2E The project is to the tune of US$88million 
=28Eighty-Eight Million United States Dollars=29 and a mobilization of 
50% which is US$44million =28Forty-Four Million United States Dollars=29 
will be given for the project to commence=2E I have overestimated 
everything to reach the true value of the project and it's US$22Million
=28Twenty-Two Million United States Dollars=29 with a lot of excess=2E 
All I have been asked by the Presidency to do is to provide a foreign 
company =28that does not necessary have to be a company in the oil 
and gas field=2C it could be any company=29 that will be awarded the 
project and front for me=2E Once the project is awarded=2C the mobilization
 will be given to you=2E

If you are truly capable to handling the project=2C then you will execute 
and complete it=2C here in Nigeria=2E This will create a golden 
opportunities
 for an opening to establish your company in the oil and gas industry 
in 
Nigeria where money is flowing like a river=2E Alternatively=2C after 
collecting
 the mobilization we =28me and you=29 can sell the project to any oil and 
gas 
company for only the true value=2C which is overestimated at 
us$22million=2E
 The remaining us$22million from the mobilization will be shared by us 
with a ratio of 75% to me and 25% to you=2E When the job has been fully
 paid for =28normally half way through the completion of the project=29 we 
will give us$22million to the people at the presidency and us$22million
 for the leaders of my party=2E But if you choose to execute and complete
 the project the mobilization and any left over from the project is all 
ours
 and will be shared 60% for me and 40% for you=2E

I am unable to devoid information of the project for security and 
confidential 
reasons=2C but once I am convinced that you are capable and conscious of 
confidentiality I will then intimate you on all there is to know about 
this project=2E

The earlier I give them the name of the foreign partners the better=2C 
please
 do understand that time is of the essence here=2E You are to reach me 
immediately through my email=3A senatordavid=40lycos=2Ecom or senatordavid=40lycos=2Eco=2Euk
Hoping to hear from you soonest=2E

Best regards=2C
