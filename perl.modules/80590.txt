Brian,

Thank you for getting back to me.  I just want to make sure I
understand. Are you suggesting a new toplevel namespace of
"SiteCatalyst"?

I really feel SiteCatalyst belongs under Business, joining the ranks
of Business::CyberSource, Business::FedEx::RateRequest,
Business::PayPal::API, Business::UPS.
"SiteCatalyst" is a specific product, by Adobe (formerly Omniture).

Thank you
