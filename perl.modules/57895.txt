Hello Brian,


	I need a self contained date module with the following requirements for
financial software I am writing.


	- front end parser
	- time independence to make it fast
	- broad date range (not limited by epoch seconds)
	- date component operations (year, dayofweek, etc.)
	- date operations
	- back end formatter


	I hope this helps.  Thanks for your review.


	David McAllister
