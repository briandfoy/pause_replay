Brian (and other PAUSE admins),

Thanks for your feedback. At the time I wrote these modules (and a few
more, yet to be uploaded) my rationale was that these were a
collection of general /miscellaneous utility modules (for the lack of
a better description), that were shared by many of my projects but
didn't quite belong to specific ones. Subsequently they were named as
such in my local environment.

I had hesitated about requesting the "Util" namespace for the reason
made obvious by your comments. But I overcame my hesitation after
seeing a few other registered modules in similar vein. i.e. with
"fuzzy" sounding namespaces. And I hope to have this 'Util' namespace
created because I see it as a potential "community garden" for
petty/odd modules that don't quite deserve their own namespaces. I
imagine that it might help many other folks to avoid the headache of
coming up with bona fide sounding project names for their one-off
modules, too.

I hope my request does not impose not too big of a problem. Of course,
I'd completely understand if folks feel strongly negative about it and
"vote it down" so to speak. I'd appreciate any suggestions/advice for
the alternative namespace(s).

Sincerely,

Kan
