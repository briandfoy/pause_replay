Sorry for not getting back to you either, I didn't realize this was  
posted on the list.

I have included a short comparison in the module docs itself.

Well, tree structures are complex in nature, so I can only make it so  
simple. But my module does not attempt to balance your tree, or provide  
complex search paths or do anything of that nature. It simply provides  
the means to create straight-forward tree structures. This is not to  
say that these more complex tasks cannot be done with my module, you  
would just have to do is write a custom Visitor object to do it or  
process the tree manually.

I suppose it is simple because it only aims to provide the structure of  
a tree and nothing more.
