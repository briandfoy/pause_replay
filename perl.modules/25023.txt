     why:

    Hi,

    after round about eight years of perl experiences and utilising the
    service of CPAN and its contributors, I'll try to give back some
    stuff to the community. I'm planning to contribute an application
    building framework (consisting of several modules).

    It delivers the following services to its users on a mostly opaque
    way: - A plugin based configuration file service + Comand line
    option handler + built-in Java-like property file parser + built-in
    Windows-like ini file parser + Loader for String, URL and File
    access - A plugin based bridge to logging facilities (e.g. Log4Perl)
    - Daemonizing - Usage and help - ...

    Lazy Application::Framework users only have to derive from
    Application::Frame and to implement a run method. More committed
    users can use one or more of the above-mentioned services or they
    are invited to implement their own PlugIns ...

    TODOs - Documentation ;-) - MakeMaker tuning / Bundling - Testing

    My schedule is to complete version 0.1 after Christmas.

    hfu,

    Sebastian
