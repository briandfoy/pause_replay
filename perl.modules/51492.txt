The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ingres::Utility::IIMonitor
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: API to iimonitor Ingres RDBMS utility
  userid:      WORM (Joner Cyrre Worm)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ingres-utility

  similar:

  rationale:

    The purpose of this name space is to host one of a series of
    modules that will suply an object oriented interface to Ingres RDBMS
    utilities that perform local sysadmin tasks.

    The whole bunch of modules will offer a framework to help
    development of powerfull and user friendly FOSS tools to promote the
    adoption of comunitary (FOSS) version of that RDBMS.

    The only graphical tool to help admins runs on MS Windows and is
    included in the commercial version only.

    The name space proposed might be organized with the following
    structure in consideration:

    . Ingres - RDBMS name space (1)

    .. Ingres::Utility - Interface framework to local sysadmin
    utilities ... Ingres::Utility::IINamu (REGISTERED) - API to iinamu
    Ingres RDBMS utility

    .. Ingres::IMA - Interface framework to remote sysadmin services
    (Ingres Manegement Architechure).

    .. Ingres::Admin - Sysadmin abstraction layer to employ both
    interfaces

    With this namespace in mind, Ingres::Utility::IIMonitor is the
    second Ingres::Utility interface to be implemented, being
    Ingres::Utility::IINamu the previous one.

    (1) There is MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, etc. database namespaces
    already, and since Ingres has been open sourced and growing stronger
    on FOSS community, CPAN should take a leading step into providing
    tools and infra-structure.

The resulting entry would be:

Ingres::Utility::
::IIMonitor       adpOp API to iimonitor Ingres RDBMS utility        WORM
