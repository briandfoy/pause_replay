GDBUI: The GDB-like User Interface

Or, fully expanded: The Gnu's Not Unix Debugger-like User Interface.  :)

Come to think of it, I probably should have called it Term::ShellUI.
I wrote Term::GDBUI to create GDB-like user interface, but has become
decidedly more shell-like over the past year.

So, should I change the name to Term::ShellUI and reupload?
