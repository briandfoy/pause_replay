Done for all *existing* namespaces under Bio::

Future namespaces will as always be assigned to the one who does the
first upload. Please note that uploading isn't restricted in any way,
just indexing, so this will probably work for a while.

By the way, Chris, do you know anything about a second Chris Dagdigian
or is that one also you. And if so, should "he" be deleted?
