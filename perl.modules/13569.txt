The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::GeneratePassword
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: gener. secure random pronounceable passwords
  userid:      JWALT (Jörg Walter)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Crypt::RandPasswd

  rationale:

    Just like Crypt::RandPasswd, it is related to Encryption and/or
    Authentication, and it's sole purpose is to generate good passwords,
    so Crypt::GeneratePAssword seems a natural choice..

    It doesn't use a flashing new approach, but to my knowledge, an
    approach never actually implemented. Distinct from Crypt::RandPasswd
    by the important fact that Crypt::RandPasswd's method has been
    proven to be insecure. Since making it secure would break compliance
    to the FIPS-181 NIST standard, Crypt::RandPasswd cannot be fixed.
    This module explicitly does not adhere to that standard but tries to
    do the Right Thing(tm).

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::GeneratePassword Rdpfp gener. secure random pronounceable passwords JWALT
