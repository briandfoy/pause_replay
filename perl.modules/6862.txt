I sympathize, but if they can't get and install modules, then they can't
install your module in the first place, so the question of installing its
dependencies doesn't come up.

(I do sympathize with the fact that module installation can sometimes be a
great bother; but significant effort is now being put into fixing this
situation.)

The vast majority of people using Perl "on PCs" (by which you mean "under
MSWin", I assume) are using ActiveState's Perl which has, for years now,
come with HTML::Parser and HTML::Entities.  (And if it didn't, they could
use ppm.)

Yes, please delete them and redist your module anew.
