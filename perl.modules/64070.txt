The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RMI
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: remote method invocation & transparent proxy
  userid:      SAKOHT (Scott Smith)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    RPC::.*

  rationale:

    RMI is a generic term for OO-RPC. RPC is a top-level namespace, so
    I thought it more intuitive to have RMI next-to it.

    There seemed to be some call to put it under IPC:: or Net::. One of
    the server/client pair types uses pipes instead of sockets, so it is
    not necessarily networking. It is probably always IPC in some way,
    since it leans on handles, but it seemed unnecessarily redundant
    with the "R" in RMI, to call the modules IPC::RMI. RMI has a
    well-known general meaning which doesn't require pre-categorization
    to be meaningful, like IPC::Run or IPC::SysV do.

    There was apparently an attempt at a Net::RMI module made in 1999.
    It does not exist on regular CPAN, and when I pulled it from
    backpan.perl.org, it failed tests. The author's email bounces, as
    did an alternate email I found.

    The RMI modules I'm uploading also have a different API and do not
    require that custom servers be written per-class which is proxied.
    There is no code from Net::RMI in these modules, and they are not a
    1:1 replacement w/o some consideration by the developer.

The resulting entry would be:

RMI               bdpOp remote method invocation & transparent proxy SAKOHT
