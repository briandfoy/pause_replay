If your idea was to do it in an extremely small amount of code with no 
non-core dependencies to provide only a limited subset of common 
functionality, I'd be happy to welcome you to the ::Tiny suffix-space, 
along with Config::Tiny and CSS::Tiny.

One of the rules I imposed on both of those is that they will NEVER 
necesarily support the full set of features, are intentionally reduced 
for simplicity and overhead reduction, and anyone that asks for new 
features is pretty much told to go use something bigger.
