Hi Folks,

I recently (2001-09-06) uploaded a package named IO-Tty-0.05 containing 
IO::Tty and IO::Pty.  But now I (and others) can only find it under 
R/RG/RGIERSIG/ but not under by-module/IO/, and the CPAN.pm module also 
cannot find it (probably because it's not in 02packages.details.txt).
  
It is (was) also missing in the recent uploads list (RECENT.html).  Note 
that http://search.cpan.org lists and finds it OK, but not the traditional 
CPAN.

I just noticed that on PAUSE I am registered for a module called IO::Ptty,
but not for IO::Tty.  Could it be that this mismatch has anything to do with 
it?  I just browsed the docs again but could not find anything about 
a requirement between package and module name.

Could somebody knowledgeable write up the detailed process how an uploaded 
package in PAUSE finds its way into CPAN?

Are there any preconditions so that more than one module may reside within 
a package?  


Thanks!

Roland
