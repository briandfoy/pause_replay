Graham Barr is nominated as the Exception pumpking. I forward your
message to him.

I also forward to modules@perl.org.

SEX is not only a cutesy name we at modules@perl.org mostly frown
upon, it is also already taken, at least on a case insensitive basis,
by MSCHWERN.

I recently made the proposal to name all the candidates in the racing
for the best Exception library Exception::Something (pick your
favorite instead of "Something", that is;).

So anyway, if you're inclined to rename or not, feel free to upload it
to CPAN as it makes future discussions about alternatives easier if
the candidates are not spread over multiple places. For uploading
instructions see $CPAN/modules/04pause.html.
