Hi,

We have a toolkit for the Z39.50 protocol, and there seems to be need to
access it from Perl. So we are building a perl module for it. My question is
about distributing the thing. Which is more proper:

1) Distribute the perl module without the Yaz toolkit, and add instructions
on where to get it.

2) Include a current version of the toolkit into the tarball of the perl
module.

Let me stress that I am talking of a already-made toolkit, which we
distribute from our web site, and which has been used for a while by various
projects. Therefore we do not with to change the primary distribution of
that toolkit.


Hoping to do the right thing
