     why:

    I've found a security hole (possibly trojan) in Font::TTFMetrics.
    First I tried to contact the author, but his mail address doesn't
    work.

    I want to upload a fix, and some improvement to the module.

    The problem description follows. The font init code (line 271)
    starts with this: my $self = shift; my $fh =
    $self->get_file_handle(); my $buf = ""; eval { read( $fh, $buf, 12 )
    };

    This seems... a little bit problematic. Currently I'm on the module
    and sometime start to upload a fix. Commenting out the eval doesn't
    mess up anything.

    bye,

    Akos
