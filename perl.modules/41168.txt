Subject: Locking off PPI::

From: cpan@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

I'm coming up to a 1.000 release of PPI and I'm going to need to do a 
DBI:: to it and lock out the namespace. There's just way too many 
classes in PPI:: and more that will be coming later. I'll be booting out 
  PPI::Metric::Basic, which is the only other one there now.

I'd be limiting PPI:: releases to only those from the Parse::Perl 
sourceforge project, although not necessarily released by me personally.

Is there an actual _mechanism_ to lock off the namespace? Or are we just 
doing it by convention. I just say "don't release PPI:: modules" in the 
docs and then rip the guts out of anyone that does and tell them to 
remove it.
