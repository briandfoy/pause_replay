Ah, I think I see what you are getting at now.

Do you think something like Class::StringWrapper would be clearer? Or 
something more along the lines of Class::Interface::Messages?

is that really the purpose though?  it looks like the idea is to
provide an interface to messages.  the "text" portion is only
incidental.

if you want to use template strings, you might as well use
Text::Template or some such.  the only thing that is left is to
organize the templates---that part has nothing to do with text
though.
