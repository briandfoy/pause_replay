  Dear Sirs,

  I would like to register to the PAUSE archive to upload some SCRIPTS
  so they are available for general use.

  Contribution:             I am planning to contribute several
                            SCRIPTS for data adquisition of
                            meteorological instrumentation. One of them
                            for the TSI SMPS (Scanning Mobility
                            Particle Sizer), for a Shadowband
                            Radiometer and software to use the
                            Meilhaus-26 and Meilhaus-63 data
                            adquisition boards.
                            
  Note about contribution:  I am presenting this work at the HispaLinux
                            II conference in Madrid on November 5 and 6,
                            it has been acepted for an oral
                            presentation.
                            I still do not have received enough
                            feed-back to know how important this
                            software will be.
                            I do believe that it is of interest to make
                            a new section in the SCRIPTS section about
                            data-adquisition with Perl. I think this is
                            a more or less forgotten field in
                            programming and it would be nice to have
                            some programs with which other people that
                            have had my same needs could start.


  Thank you very much,

  Xavier Calbet
