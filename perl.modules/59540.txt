2 weeks ago I submitted the name Data::NDS for registration and
got a reply back.

I sent the reply below 2 weeks ago, and haven't heard anything back.
I'd like to rename Data::NDS to something that acceptable to the
moderators so that I can get it registered.

At this point, my first choice is:

   Data::Struct

Let me know if this is acceptable.

Thanks

I can use Data::Nested if the consensus is that that would be better.
However, the "nested" part is the least "interesting" part of the
phrase "nested data structure" (IMO).

It works with perl data structures which _may_ be (but certainly don't
have to be) nested. Of course, even though it would work for a
simple, non-nested data structure (such as a simple hash or list),
this module would be overkill and almost certainly not justified.
Still, I'm more interested in emphasizing the Data Structure part
as opposed to the Nested part of the name.

I considered using Data::Structure, but there is already a module
Data::Structure::Utils that I wouldn't want to imply was related
to this module.

I could use Data::Struct which is almost as good, and has the
advantage that it's completely separate from Data::Structure::Utils .

Let me know... I'm perfectly willing to use whatever namespace
you think is best:

  Data::NDS         (nested data structure)
  Data::PDS         (perl data structure)
  Data::Structure
  Data::Struct
  Data::Nested
  Data::DataStructure

Let me know, and whichever one you choose, I'll go with that.
