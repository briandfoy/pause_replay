Hi,

I've been using this service for a long time to distribute a module I have.
Today I made some updates and I started receiving import errors.

About 2 months ago I transitioned from an svn repository to github. In
doing so I no longer had an automatically calculated $VERSION string. I
removed these from some of my files. I then used $VERSION within
Makefile.PL, did "make dist" and posted the result to CPAN. The file was
accepted, and has been used in production systems since.

Today I simply changed the number with Makefile.PL and then ran "make dist"
and posted the result to pause. Now the file is not accepted. What's going
on here? The errors I received are as follows:

The following packages (grouped by status) have been found in the distro:

Status: Decreasing version number
          =================================

     module: CSS::Inliner
          version: undef
          in file: CSS-Inliner-3912/lib/CSS/Inliner.pm
          status: Not indexed because CSS-Inliner-3674/lib/CSS/Inliner.pm in
             K/KA/KAMELKEV/CSS-Inliner-3674.tar.gz has a higher version
             number (3674)

     module: CSS::Inliner::Parser
          version: undef
          in file: CSS-Inliner-3912/lib/CSS/Inliner/Parser.pm
          status: Not indexed because
             CSS-Inliner-3911/lib/CSS/Inliner/Parser.pm in
             K/KA/KAMELKEV/CSS-Inliner-3911.tar.gz has a higher version
             number (1)

__END__



Thanks in advance, I started making crazy changes and committing, but it's
making a mess in my repo. Are we really saying that $VERSION must be
stamped into all these files? That seems really silly... especially when
there is no automated way of doing it (which is what I thought the
Makefile.PL took care of)
