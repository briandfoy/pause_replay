The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::xPathLike
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: A xPath like processor for perl data structs
  userid:      JVVERDE (Isidro Vila Verde)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    github

  similar:
    Data::Path Data::dPath

  rationale:

    There are already some good approaches to xPath syntax, namely the
    Data::dPath and Data::Path. Nevertheless we still missing some of
    powerful constructions as provided by xPath. Suppose, for example,
    we have an array of invoices with Total, Amount and Tax and need to
    check which one does not comply to the rule "Total = Amount *
    (1+Tax)"

    The Data::xPathLike full implements xpath expressions, so the above
    could be get with just this query

    //invoice[Total != Amount * (1 + Tax)]

  enteredby:   JVVERDE (Isidro Vila Verde)
  enteredon:   Wed Jul 31 15:47:28 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::xPathLike       bdpO2 A xPath like processor for perl data structs JVVERDE
