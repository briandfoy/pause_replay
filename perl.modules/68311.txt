The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FedoraCommons
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Implements Fedora Commons Repository APIs
  userid:      DFIELDING (David L. Fielding)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    The FedoraCommons name space is intended for Perl modules that
    interface with the Fedora (Commons) repository. I chose
    FedoraCommons instead of Fedora to avoid confusion with the Fedora
    Linux distribution.

    Two modules are currently implemented and ready to upload:
    FedoraCommons::APIA and FedoraCommons::APIM.

    I do not know of another 'root' level namespace where these modules
    fit. If there is a 'root' level where software related to
    repositories resides then this might makes sense. I would need to
    rework the modules and this might delay the upload for a while until
    I find the time to rework the two modules.

    I am not sure if the chapter I selected is the correct category.
    There does not seem to be a category for repository utilities.

    Thanks, David
