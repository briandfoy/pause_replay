Hello brian,
                                                      
                     
  This module is a tool for importing and exporting   
                     
data from a XML document into any SQL database. 

 So if I rename the module SQL::XMLtoSQL             
 you will approve it? I will be happy to name it
anything you might feel appropriate. I am sure that
the module will be of  great use to any one trying to
import or export data from xml documents.             
                    

  Thanks,                                            
Chris Berning
