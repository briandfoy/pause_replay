No, at least not exactly.  Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::Mediawiki is a
plugin for Wiki::Toolkit.  It is object oriented and tied to the
Wiki::Toolkit API.  It is also integrated with the backend database
store (Wiki::Toolkit::Store::*) so that it can colorize links based on
whether they exist and will eventually have a few other store related
features.

At a user's request, I am pulling out all the non-database related
functionality from W:T:F:Mediawiki and putting it into
Text::MediawikiFormat, in the same way that W:T:Formatter:Default uses
Text::WikiFormat for the bulk of its formatting.
