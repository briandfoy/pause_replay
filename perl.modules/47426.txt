Subject: Module submission Schema::RDBMS::AUS

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Schema::RDBMS::AUS
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Authentication, Users and Sessions in SQL
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    cgi-session-user@lists.sourceforge.net, dbi-users@perl.org,
    perl@lists.mysql.com, modperl@perl.apache.org

  similar:
    several

  rationale:

    The Schema::RDBMS::AUS distribution provides a complete
    transactional, mid-level interface to users, groups, and sessions,
    including:

    * SQL schema defining users, sessions, groups, permissions, and a
    security log

    * A rich user object and user management script

    * A CGI::Session subclass for session management

    This package only supplies an API for the management of users and
    sessions, it does not integrate them with any particular user
    interface.

    Apache2::AUS will be forthcoming shortly.

    This approach (separating the schema and mid-level objects that
    support it from the appliaction, and leveraging
    DBIx::Migration::Directories for ease of schema installs) is
    something I have not seen done on CPAN yet. Most SQL-based modules
    just tell you what sort of table you need to install in the POD, and
    most low-to-mid-level perl objects to manipulate these are bundled
    within a larger application or framework.

The resulting entry would be:

Schema::RDBMS::
::AUS             adpOp Authentication, Users and Sessions in SQL    CRAKRJACK
