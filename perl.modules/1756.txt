- Network management utilities:  First up is my OO and shamelessly
extensible SNMP Trap processor.  It has no dependencies on any other
modules but does "prefer" to run under straps, part of the scotty/tkined
package.  (I'm soliciting for permission to include that single C
program's source along with my module.)  Aside from the stub
infrastructure of three different applications, I'll have separate modules
that can be used outright or as examples of how to use the yet-to-be-named
application.  When it gets a name, it's description is simply:

<NAME>	SNMP Trap Application

- Spooling (Queue/Dequeue) scripts will be included with the initial
module set.  Augementation will be done through subclasses of my OO tree.

- This is a sanitization and reorganization of a network management
application written by myself and others over the past 6 years.  There has
been little public discussion over it but it's seen a couple years use at
an ISP and several other private organizations.  JAYJ has been a
significant contributor as well.
