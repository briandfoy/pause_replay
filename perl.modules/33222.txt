Hello, Tim!

What do you mean by too general?
What is your proposions about this name...?
I want to make a module for working with structure and data of MySQL without
any additional tools(I mean, mysqldump, for instance..)
The functions, I thought about, and maybe already done(I mean, v.001 beta
:) ) are Backup function(Backuping  structure and/or data),
Restoring(dependent on backup file or Array of sql-commands) and
Upgrading(the upgrading of the structure of DB with saving the data. The
upgrading is based on the simple structure of new DB, so it should compair
two structures and make needed corrections, using ALTER commands). Maybe
some others functions.. Maybe it's already done by somebody.. but when I
searched examples of such functions in the Internet... Had found
Backuping,.. but all examples used mysqldump tool.

With best wishes,
Dmitry Nikolayev
