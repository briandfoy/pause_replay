I'm unsure what to make of this. I know nothing of any conversation 
between Dave Rolsky (of DateTime) and the sender of that mail. I'm not 
personally inclined to push anybody to apologize for anything. That's 
something in between the two. Thus, I guess this means removal?

It certainly means that right now, the distribution is *not* distributed 
under a "free" license, so it should absolutely not be on CPAN in this 
state.

Seems I'm faced with an option.

If Dave Rolsky apologizes for attacking me, then I'll fix it.  If not, then=
 I demand my software be removed from CPAN forthwith.

Dear Brendan,

we (modules@perl.org) have received an inquiry about the licensing terms=20
of one of your modules:

[...]

Your DateTime::Cron::Simple module, which you uploaded to CPAN,=20
unfortunately lacks an explicit license. It is customary to release=20
modules to CPAN under the same terms as Perl itself, but that is not the=20
only choice an author has. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to add=20
a statement of your module's license to the distribution and=20
particularily to the module .pm file. Adding an explicit license (here:=20
same terms as perl itself) is as easy as adding the following paragraph=20
to your module's documentation:

=3Dhead1 COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself, either Perl version 5.6 or,
at your option, any later version of Perl 5 you may have available.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Steffen M=C3=BCller
