Subject: Module submission Parse::Colloquy::Bot

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Colloquy::Bot
  DSLIP:       Rmpfo
  description: Parse Colloquy bot/client terminal output
  userid:      NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    online talkers

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module parses the Colloquy talker "client" (bot) terminal type
    output and returns a categorised hash of the data parsed. Parse::
    because it's primary purpose is to parse data, Colloquy:: because it
    parses Colloquy talker output, and finally ::Bot because it's
    parsing a specific terminal type output called "client" which is
    used for bot/robot connection. I considered calling it
    Parse::Colloquy::Client instead, but I felt this was a little
    ambiguous given that Client could mean a more generic client
    connection type.

    It is possible in the future I will write modules to parse other
    Colloquy terminal output types, in which case I may make
    Parse::Colloquy a parent interface class for all the subclasses.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::Colloquy::
::Bot             Rmpfo Parse Colloquy bot/client terminal output    NICOLAW
