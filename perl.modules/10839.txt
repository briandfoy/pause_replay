plans: I have created a module to simplify performing a set of edits on text files, primarily oriented toward configuration files. Some such files can be easily processed as objects, for example those which are true XML, but sometimes files are not regular enough for that. Straightforward search and replace is of course trivial under Perl, but context-sensitive replacement can be more complicated.

In particular, I envision developing a graphic tool to assist in generating the edit sets to be used by the module, so that complicated modifications can be performed with minimal user code.
