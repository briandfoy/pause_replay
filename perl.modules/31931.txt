The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::ImageSpool
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Cache images of interest from the web
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wrote this so that my xscreensaver can have lots and lots of
    images to pick from based on keywords that I choose. This idea all
    started here:

    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=247128

    When I realized that webcollage's dictionary file was "hardly used"
    (and THAT's why I get porn when I search for vegetables...) and that
    this sort of functionality would have to behave at least
    semi-responsibly to not piss off a bunch of sysadmins, I wrote this
    module/script.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::ImageSpool      adpOp Cache images of interest from the web        CRAKRJACK
