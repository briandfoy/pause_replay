The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Semantically Disambiguate Given Word in Text
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    senserelate mailing list

  similar:
    WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords

  rationale:

    WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord allows a user to assign a sense to
    a given word in a text. This assignment is made by choosing the
    sense of a word that is most related to the surrounding context. The
    relatedness measurements are made using the existing Perl module
    WordNet::Similarity, which in turn uses the existing Perl module
    WordNet::QueryData. All of these modules are relying on the freely
    available lexical database WordNet as their main source of
    information.

    This module is distinct from WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords, which
    assigns a meaning to every word in a text. TargetWord supports a
    larger range of options for customizing the dismabiguation process
    than does AllWords. This is due to the fact that disambiguating all
    words in a text is computationally intensive, and certain options
    available in TargetWord would not be feasible for AllWords.

The resulting entry would be:

WordNet::SenseRelate::
