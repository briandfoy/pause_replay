The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pollute
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Many modules can now be bundled into one.
  userid:      DAVIDNICO (David Nicol)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    KC perl mongers

  similar:

  rationale:

    Modules export their functionality into the package where they are
    invoked, this is called "name space pollution." If you want to have
    all of your packages use the same several modules, you can use
    Pollute.pm to create an "include file" kind of module which will
    import all the imported symbols from the other modules. When Pollute
    is used, it takes a census of the symbols. Then Pollute() is called
    and new symbols are aliased into the caller's caller's package.

    Pollute::Persistent is an even tighter way of creating an "include
    file" module: its import method clobbers the caller's import method
    with a self-modifying version of &Pollute::Pollute that maintains a
    persistent list of the symbols that need to get updated when the
    "include module" is used; opposed to regular Pollute, which requires
    all of the modules' import methods to be run every time.

The resulting entry would be:

Pollute           Rdphp Many modules can now be bundled into one.    DAVIDNICO
