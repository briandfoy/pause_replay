You can upload CPAN distributions without first registering. The 
registration process is for the inclusion in the official modules list only.

I tend to agree with you in this case. "Simple" would, however, seem 
more appropriate along the lines of LWP::Simple.

That's exactly the problem. If all modules contain the words "easy" or 
"simple", the information content is zero. :)

On this modules list. The archives can be found via lists.perl.org.

Might be an alternative.

"::Helper" is often used for internal routines.
