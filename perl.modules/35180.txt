  First thing, sorry for the delay in  response.  I  do  not
  read perl.modules.  My  fault.  I'll  read  the  reply  on
  perldiscuss, but if you could Cc me ;)

  I dit not  choose  Net::Packet,  since  NetPacket  already
  exists, and I don't want to be assimilated with  it  (even
  -or mostly- if NetPacket is a bad namespace).

  I choosed Pkt because Pkt is shorter than Packet,  and  is
  less error prone at typing. Secondly, since it is  in  the
  Net namespace, Pkt is likely to  be  for  Packet  and  not
  "parakeet" (we are not in the Animals namespace ;) ).
