From: epa98@doc.ic.ac.uk (Edward Avis)

If human-readable text is available in multiple languages, which do you
pick?  Web browsers let you enter which languages you're prepared to
accept, and the best one is chosen.

I've written a small module that picks a language from those available,
based on a list of acceptable languages given by the user.  So if the
user's preferences are qw(fr it) and a document is available in
qw(en fr), then 'fr' will be chosen.  This is trivial, but there are
wrinkles involved in handling 'dialects' like en_GB versus en_US versus
en.  At the moment this is all the module contains, but it might get
routines to work out the user's preferences based on $ENV{LANG}, the
Windows Registry or whatever.

I think Lingua::Preferred is a reasonable name.
