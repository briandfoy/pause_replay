Brian,
	How are you planning to tackle the prediction piece?  Have any
particular algorithm in mind?  I started speculating after reading your
e-mail, but nothing concrete jumped out at me.  I thought that a purely
numerical date representation would work...using some type of standard
regression for prediction...with conversion from/to DateTime objects
simply for display.  Of course that now seems impractical to me since
timezones and daylight savings irregularities would screw that up in my
mind.
