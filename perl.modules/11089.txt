I don't think all caps for VERSION is necessary.  I would suggest that
in fact, the exact opposite is called for - consider it a pragma.
First you need a "version.pm" which does nothing but set $VERSION.
Then your code can go in version::RCS to extract it from the RCS
revision info.

use version 1.0;                # sets $VERSION to 1.0
use version::RCS "$Revision$"   # extracts from RCS revision

While version::CVS would be identical to version::RCS, it may still be
useful to put a stub CVS file in the distribution that simply inherits
from the RCS module.  I would suggest bundling it with version::RCS in
the same tarball though.
