I rushed to the dressing room and slipped it on. Even though it was at
least two sizes too large and more costly than I had anticipated, I talked
Mom into buying it. The shop was so small it didn't offer alterations, but
my excitement assured me I would be able to get it resized in my hometown.
It is not necessary for you to write in it everyday, but it helps to record
various insights you gain as you go about living your life. Instead of using
a big notebook, you might use a small note pad that you can keep in your
purse or pocket for easy access to record your thoughts as they occur to
you. (I've found that if I don't immediately write down ideas and insights
as they come, it's hard to remember them later, at least with the same
degree of clarity.) Whichever method you choose, what's most important is
that you write your thoughts down. It will help you know what's in your
heart.
