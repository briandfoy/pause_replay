Hi Alberto, hi Judith, hi Alexandr,

Alexandr has been trying to contact you about the Linux::Distribution
module on CPAN and failed. This is a final attempt from the PAUSE
administration. There have been many outstanding issues for a long time
and he would like to apply the necessary maintenance.

Alberto, Judith, please note that this is a reversible action. If you
disagree with it or want to start maintaining the module yourself again,
there is no harm done.

Thanks, Alexandr, for the info about how you tried to contact the
original author. I'll assign co-maintenance permissions in a few minutes.

Again, this is a reversible action and its aim is to ensure the high
quality of the code on CPAN.

Best regards,
Steffen, for the PAUSE admins
