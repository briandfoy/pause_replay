Thank you for the reply.

Actually, MyLibrary, as a system has been around since 1988 or so. Do  
a Google search for MyLibrary and you will get a gazillion hits. So  
much so that word "mylibrary" has become a part of the library  
vernacular. With the advent version 3.x, MyLibrary is less like a  
turn-key application and now a full-blown set of object-oriented  
modules. Creating a root namespace will make it less confusing for  
the existing folks who know about the MyLibrary concept.
