Hi Michael,

as brian pointed out, you can get a PAUSE/CPAN ID at pause.perl.org. 
Then, John can transfer the maintainership to you via the PAUSE 
interface as well. He can log into PAUSE, select "Change Permissions" 
from the menu and then either pass primary maintainership to you or give 
you co-maintainer status.

Furthermore, I'd like to thank you for planning to improve on a 
mathematics related module on CPAN. I'd love to hear what you plan to 
do. (If you plan to change the API, make sure to offer backwards 
compatibility, but I probably didn't need to tell you that.)

All the best,
Steffen
