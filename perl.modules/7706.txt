Before you submit this to CPAN, I think you should subscribe to
datetime@perl.org and talk to the folks over there. I know of *at least*
three modules that aim to do what you've described, and we're trying to
amalgamate some of them rather than proliferate more.  The Date::
namespace is already confusing enough without umpteen nearly-identical
modules in there.  So perhaps you could contribute your coding efforts
to an existing module.
