Subject: Module submission Test::MockClass

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::MockClass
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A module to provide mock classes and objects
  userid:      JJORDAN (Jeremiah Jordan)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://cvs.faeriemud.org

  similar:
    Test::MockObject

  rationale:

    Unlike Test::MockObject, Test::MockClass creates an entire Mock
    Class and installs it into the symbol table. This gives you more
    control, allowing you to test methods that create objects, instead
    of just methods that you pass objects into.

    I would also accept Test::MockMaker or something like that,
    although my preference would be Test::MockClass

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::MockClass       adpOp A module to provide mock classes and objects JJORDAN
