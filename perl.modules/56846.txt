I'll fix the current version by moving around co-maintainer
permissions, but someone should step up to be the new primary
maintainer. I can transfer all of the modules to the new maintainer.

Andreas, can you add these IDs to the TKML mailing list?

   BDFOY
   NI-S
   GSLONDON

Here's what I did as the temporary fix:

--------
Added NI-S to co-maintainers of Tk::Reindex.
Added NI-S to co-maintainers of Tk::ReindexedROText.
Added NI-S to co-maintainers of Tk::ReindexedText.
Added NI-S to co-maintainers of Tk::TextList.

According to a request entered by brian d foy the
following files have been scheduled for reindexing.

$CPAN/authors/id/N/NI/NI-S/Tk-800.024.tar.gz
$CPAN/authors/id/N/NI/NI-S/Tk-804.026.tar.gz
$CPAN/authors/id/N/NI/NI-S/Tk-804.027.tar.gz
