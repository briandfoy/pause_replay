The general question for all date and time-related modules without a 
community listed is "have you spoken to the DateTime guys about this"?

Because DateTime is more or less the central hub of datetime activity, 
we generally like to hear that you have consulted with them.

This isn't a "no" to registration and not a condition that they agree or 
not with your module, just a "please consider consulting with them first".

A number of modules have changed based on such consultations, generally 
for the better.

Let us know how it goes, and we'll go ahead on that basis.
