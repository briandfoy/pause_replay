Hi brian, hi Nikos,

> How about adding this feature to Archive::RAR?

I think that's easier said than done. Archive::RAR is a mess. I know 
that because I sort-of maintain it and it's a huge mess. I tried to 
rewrite it and ran out of time.

I would suggest a different namespace, though. How about something in 
the Archive::RAR hierarchy? Or Archive::Unrar if need be?

Cheers,
Steffen
