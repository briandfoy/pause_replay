Yes, this is the only practicable solution for the times when we are
overloaded, and we do not want to take that back.

In that case it would be pretentious to insist on changing. I could
not know that.

There are many policies that can coexist and some of them are
described in the module list, some of them are in the archives of
modules@perl.org and some of them can be drawn from the current state
of the module list. We know its a mess and we hope to prevent that it
becomes a complete mess. An extensive paper on that is said to be in
the works.

Any root namespace that is not yet taken is unique:-)

We do not consider namespaces being reserved but as soon as somebody
has occupied a portion of it, I understand it would not be good to
join the club with something that is completely unrelated.

Good. I've registered it now. Thanks for makeing your arguemnts so clear.

Thanks. Please choose one of those and let us know which. We really
believe it helps making CPAN cleaner if people use the existing names.

Much can be done with aliasing like so:

*TableMap::insert = \&DBIx::insert;

You need to do something like this only for published functionality,
and you can issue a warning when TableMap.pm is being required. If you
encounter severe problems in doing something, just let us know.
