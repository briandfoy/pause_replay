The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Untaint::hostname
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Untaint DNS hostnames
  userid:      DHUDES (Dana Hudes)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    CGI::Untaint::DNS::hostname was just too long; it may be that
    someone else in future will have need to untaint other data for dns
    but I think 'hostname' is pretty unambiguous (though it is also
    supporting FQDN hostname).

    Listing this in the module list will make it more noticeable and
    likely to be found by someone who needs it.

  enteredby:   DHUDES (Dana Hudes)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul 11 23:41:59 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Untaint::
::hostname        bdpOp Untaint DNS hostnames                        DHUDES
