The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Muck
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: manage the muck of an EC2/S3 cloud
  userid:      MIKE (Mike Schroeder)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    Amazon EC2 Developer Forums

  similar:
    Net::Amazon::EC2

  rationale:

    The goal of the project is to create a framework for managing
    elastic clouds on Amazon EC2 (or potentially other virtualized
    server providers in the future).

    While the Net::Amazon::EC2 module works well for interacting with
    the Amazon APIs, and Muck will use Net::Amazon::EC2, Muck goes
    beyond that. Muck will watch server loads, adding/dropping servers
    autonomously throughout the day, managing the steps to add/drop
    MySQL servers to circular clusters using EC2, SQS, etc.

    The first release includes Muck::FS, a Fuse based filesystem that
    allows multiple instances to share a common S3-backed filesystem
    with inode info maintained in MySQL/memcached. Subsequent components
    will include Muck::Server (a POE-based monitoring system) for
    autonomous peer-to-peer supervision of the cloud, Muck::Client - for
    possible interfaces like wxmuck (a wx widgets administrator's
    interface to the cloud), as well as other Muck modules for managing
    dynamic DNS, dynamically provisioning circular MySQL clusters, etc.

    While most of what Muck does could be partitioned into numerous
    other places (Fuse, Net::Amazon, DBIx, POE), I believe having the
    vast scope of interoperation consolidated into a single name space
    will make installation and maintenance easier in the long run.

    Thanks for your consideration.
