     why:

    I'm working on a couple of Perl based projects in my free time, and
    I'll be implementing a couple of modules that I think might be,
    while a little niche, useful to more than just me -- an
    implementation of the logic for MOT and car tax rules in the UK, for
    instance.

    Nothing is concrete yet, but getting an account removes one barrier
    to contributing :-)

    If I need to re-apply when I have more specific code to point at,
    I'm happy to do so!
