planned contribution:
SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Intergation Language) generation module
(Smil.pm, nicknamed "PerlySMIL") which fits within the new SYMM
(Synchronized Multimedia) namespace .  SMIL is a W3C standardardized
language used to create multimedia applications developed under supervision
of the SYMM working group.  SMIL is XML based and looks very similar to
HTML, although SMIL adds the concept of a timeline enabling scheduling of
content, which is in contrast to the 2D, layout-only features of HTML.
There are several SMIL "players," RealNetworks' RealPlayer G2/7.0+, Oratrix
GRiNS, Helio's Barbizon, and the Labyrinten LpPlayer, among others.  This
module allows users to create SMIL documents with syntax similar to the
CGI.pm module using an object oriented syntax.  The functionality of SMIL.pm
can be combined with CGI.pm to serve as a backend SMIL generation tool
integrated with a web server, or with any of the database modules to create
dynamic, database-driven, multimedia application creation tools.  I choose
SYMM as the namespace under which SMIL fits because there are other XML
based languages which complement SMIL and w ould sit under the SYMM
namespace as well: RealText, RealPix and RealText, to name those from
RealNetworks. Also, when the SYMM working group finalizes several other
drafts of XML-based multimedia langauges (vector based graphics, etc.), they
can be added to the SYMM namespace.

"OO interface to SMIL generation"

public discussion:
When I speak at SMIL authoring conferences the question always arises:
"Since SMIL is textual XML, can I generate SMIL from an application server
like a web server?"  Perl is the most popular web programming language on
the Internet and internally at RealNetworks I have gotten a lot of interest
in a Perl/SMIL solution, so I imagine that it would be something that could
benefit the perl community at large.  There are currently many GUI-based
tools available for SMIL generation available, but there was no unified
framework for generation of SMIL from a command-line environment until now.
Since this module is closely related to the CGI.pm module and most of the
usage will come from web server environments, it seemed like a natural
choice to wrap the functionality into a perl module.
