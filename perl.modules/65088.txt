I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but I decided it would probably be
better to at least get the repo up and running quickly, and then deal
with history later.

My main issue with history is that my repository has about 300 modules
in it (having 300 repositories with one module each being infinitely
harder to manage) so importing history would have been non-trivial.
