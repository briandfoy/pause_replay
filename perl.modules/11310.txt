A man should be able to: change a diaper, plan an invasion,  butcher a
hog, conn a ship,  design a building, write a sonnet,  balance
accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,  take orders,
give orders, cooperate,  act alone, solve equations, analyze a new
problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight
efficiently, and die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
