:but C::Scan was last released in 2001, so nobody cares about h2xs or C::Scan anymore.

I'm not sure if anyone thinks they're the maintainer - I did the last
release, to incorporate some features requested by Tim Bunce, but assumed
Ilya would continue as primary owner; however I'm not sure that he does
perl stuff any more.

If anyone is willing to maintain it, I for one would have no objection.
