The current Net::SSH module on CPAN is a wrapper around the ssh command line
client.

Mine is an actual Perl implementation of the SSH protocol.

I've spoken w/ the author of the current Net::SSH (and queried the modules
list previously about the matter), and we've agreed that the best thing to
do would be to rename his current Net::SSH to something like
Net::SSH::system, then to replace Net::SSH itself with an interface to each
of our modules, to be used something like:

    use Net::SSH mode => 'perl';

This would load everything necessary for my Net::SSH::perl implementation,
and if you then did

    my $ssh = Net::SSH->new('host');

you'd open an SSH connection using Net::SSH::perl.

I've written this wrapper interface for the two modules. The author of the
current Net::SSH hasn't yet switched his module over to Net::SSH::system.

But I'd like to get my Net::SSH::perl module registered and uploaded so that
it's all ready, and so that it could be used, perhaps, by interested
parties.

If you want to read more about this, here's the first thread I wrote about
this, with several responses from other module list maintainers:

And here's the message I wrote a couple days ago about this module:
