     why:

    A small group of us are building an E-Commerce framework called
    Lemonade. We're going to want to release this into the wild via CPAN
    once we have a fully working super-alpha release.

    There is a minimum of two modules that we would want to release.
    Lemonade itself and it's corresponding group of related sub modules,
    and Dancer::Plugin::Lemonade the glue between the Dancer web
    framework and Lemonade. There is also a strong possibility of more
    related modules as this system is being designed to be pluggable
    into other web frameworks such as Mojolicious and Catalyst (these
    will come in time).

    NOTE: We do NOT have a working prototype at this point, however
    this project is being funded and will progress over the next few
    months.
