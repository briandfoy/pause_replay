Hi again,

so the first attempt to contact Hans was on
10 April by a private e-mail then on
23 April I sent an e-mail to the Dutch Perl Mongers
            https://list.xs4all.nl/pipermail/nl-pm/2009q2/msg00015.html  an=
d on
26 April I posted on use.perl:  http://use.perl.org/~gabor/journal/38873

I got no reply to either of these and I have no other way to contact him

(the link from his CPAN page http://search.cpan.org/~hanje/ returns 404

So in order to start to maintain it I'd like to get co-maintainership.
I'll start by fixing the bug as reported
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D36328
and then wait some more time before I start doing bigger changes so
if Hans shows up soon I can hand it back without lots of changes.

Adam Kennedy offered to twiddle the permissions for me.

regards
  Gabor
