From: andrew@hbslabs.com (Andrew Rodland)

I'm writing a module for (eventual) distribution that's based around 
processing menus for web applications -- reading a menu description from a 
file, dynamically modifying it in various ways (for example checking against 
user permissions), and formatting the structure to be passed to a templating 
system. It's very plugin-based, so namespacing is going to be pretty 
relevant. I'm tentatively using "WWW::MenuGrinder" but I'm very open to 
suggestions :)

On a semi-related note, I know that there are a number of PAUSE accounts 
belonging to companies, and I'm considering creating one for $WORK to be the 
owner of this module. Is this an accepted practice or a bad idea?

Many thanks,
Andrew (IRC:hobbs)
