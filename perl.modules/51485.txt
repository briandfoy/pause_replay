My logfile suggests that you clicked the button below that is left to
the text "2.2 Give up primary maintainership status (without
transfering it)". We'll eventually find out.

There should be an easy way to restore your previous permissions:
reindex the latest version of bioperl. So I just scheduled reindexing
for the thress files 

 BIRNEY/bioperl-1.4.tar.gz
 BIRNEY/bioperl-ext-1.4.tar.gz
 BIRNEY/bioperl-run-1.4.tar.gz

and in an hour you will have all permissions restored that you gave up
yesterday. Then you can retry to pass them over to bioperlml.

Please watch out for potential bugs on the way through. The page you
want to reach has all your primary-maintainer modules in a scrolling
list and a textfield for the name of the receiver. And the Submit
button is labeled

    Pass Maintainership Status

The page that I suspect you were reaching instead has all your
primary-maintainer modules listed, no text field and the Submit button
is labeled

    Give Up Maintainership Status

If you were directed to the wrong page through a misleading button,
please report.

Hope this helps,
