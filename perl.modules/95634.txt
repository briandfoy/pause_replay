Subject: Tidying up CPAN author directories

Hi Alexander,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that =
we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master. This is =
caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author =
directories. So we=E2=80=99ve identified the authors who can free up the =
most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

Quite a bit of diskspace can be freed up by deleting old releases of =
App-SFDC. Thomas Minney (TMINNEY, copied on this email) has the latest =
release of this on CPAN, so is there any reason you couldn=E2=80=99t =
just delete all the old releases of App-SFDC  in your author directory? =
While you=E2=80=99re there you could delete old releases of your other =
distributions as well.

Would you be happy to cull your old releases from your CPAN author =
directory please? All releases you=E2=80=99ve ever done will always be =
available from your BackPAN author directory:
	http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/D/DA/DANKOGAI/

There are 2 ways we can make this happen:

1. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
2. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

When marked for deletion, you=E2=80=99d have 3 days to check and revert =
anything you=E2=80=99re not happy with, before PAUSE would actually =
delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil
