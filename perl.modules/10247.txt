Hi Bill,

There's no tradition or history within CPAN or PAUSE of ever requiring a
PAUSE ID to not clash with a module.  Quite to the contrary .. please see
below.

PAUSE ID     MODULE
------------    -----------
URI                URI   ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this module
RAM              DBD::RAM    ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this module
RAM              AnyData::Storage::RAM    ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this
module
RDF               RDF::Notation3    ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this module
RDF               RDF::Service    ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this module
PING             Net::Ping    ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this module
NI-S               NIS::DBM    ** PAUSE ID isn't author of this module
......
I'm stopping after a casual perusal of the authors tree from Z to N.

Thanks~
