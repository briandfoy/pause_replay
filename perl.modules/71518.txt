Subject: Module submission COPS::Client

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       COPS::Client
  DSLIP:       adpO2
  description: COPS Protocol - Packet Cable Client
  userid:      SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglings

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    This module provides a client for a server running the Common Open
    Policy Service (COPS) protocol. As the COPS protocol is a defined
    standard and there are no other PERL modules providing it, it seemed
    sensible to put it at the top of the namespace, however open to
    discussion.

    There is currently only one module, Client.pm, for connecting to
    CMTS and sending/receiving COPS messages, however over time
    additional modules should be possible to provide server
    functionality as well.
