Hello,

Quite some time ago (early 1999) I made a relatively minor addition to
CGI_Lite, and submitted it to the listed maintainer (and author, Shishir
Gundavaram). I did not hear from him, so uploaded my own new version to
my CPAN account (without fanfare to modules@perl.org).

I've gotten the odd enquiry since then, and am now happy to assume
maintainer role - is there anything special I need to do?

Finally, one thing that has bugged me since day one is the name: I
hereby note my intention to change the module's name from CGI_Lite to
CGI::Lite.

Regards,

Ben Low

PS: What does one have to do to get a new module listed in the module
list? I've submitted a request for my Business::OCV module ages ago but
not seen any result...
