Do we want to address the failures in limits_round.t and limits_trans_err.t 
for perls built with both long double and slatec support ? See the current 
"round_pow() test failure on RHEL 5" thread on the perldl list for details.

I have fixes for limits_round.t already, and expect to have a fix for 
limits_trans_err.t as soon as I get the time to write it.

As mentioned in that perldl thread, I'm not so sure that the amendments to 
Limits.pm's round_pow() will be good enough for very small values (maybe 
around 1e-15 and below) but at least they do the right thing for the values 
tested in limits_round.t.

Cheers,
Rob
