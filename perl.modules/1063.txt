Hello

I'm thinking about creating a new widget to set a logging facility
based on a Tk::ROText and the Log::Dispatch object.

This new widget would be named Tk::LogDispatch and would inherit
the Log::Dispatch::Output class.

Each log passed to the widget would be displayed on the
text window in the form:

<error_level>:
        logged text.


The first version will be fairly basic, but following versions may
include a menu to select the log minumum level that a log must have to
be displayed on the text window.

Is the naming acceptable ?

Any comment or request regarding this class will be gladly accepted
(especially if you tell me that this widget already exists ;-) 

This widget is intented to replace the Puppet::Log and Puppet::logBody
classes whose names and implementations are not so bright.

Cheers.
