Hi Sean,

I=E2=80=99m writing this to you as a PAUSE admin, rather than as the PRC =
organiser :-)

> I am writing about the module Test::RedisServer. I am participating in =
the CPAN PR Challenge hosted by Neil Bowers and my assignment for May is =
Test::RedisServer. [=E2=80=A6]

> I had sent an email to the current maintainer, Typester =
(typester@gmail.com <mailto:typester@gmail.com>) - Daisuke Murase, at =
the beginning of May and another email a week ago, and have not received =
a reply from either email.

about 2 years old, submitted by Songmu (y.songmu@gmail.com =
<mailto:y.songmu@gmail.com>) - Masayuki Matsuki. In the comments of that =
PR, Typester asked Songmu if he would like to be co-maintainer of the =
module. Songmu accepted but it doesn't appear that Typester completed =
it. So I have also emailed Songmu asking if he had been granted =
co-maintainer, or if he knew how to contact Typester and I have not =
gotten a reply from him either.

I=E2=80=99ve tried to get in touch with Murase-san, and have also =
contacted Kenichi Ishigaki, who knows him. Ishigaki-san is going to have =
a chat. In the past Songmu was going to adopt this module, and it sounds =
like that might happen. And then he=E2=80=99d be able to take a PR from =
you.

Please bear with us, while we try to sort something out.

Cheers,
Neil
