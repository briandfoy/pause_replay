Subject: Module submission WWW::Imgur

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Imgur
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Upload and delete files on imgur.com
  userid:      BKB (Ben Bullock)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Not discussed publicly at all.

  similar:
    Image::Imgur

  rationale:

    This module is for uploading and deleting files on imgur.com. I
    suggest putting it under the WWW::sitename format since I can see a
    lot of similarly namespaced modules on cpan.

    There is another module called Image::Imgur but it is only a few
    lines of code and not very satisfactory, so I wrote this new module
    from scratch.

    PS sorry but I already uploaded the first version of the module to
    pause.perl.org without enquiring here first.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Imgur           RdpOp Upload and delete files on imgur.com         BKB
