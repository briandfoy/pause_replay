The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Tileset
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A tileset image loader
  userid:      KIRSLE (Noah Petherbridge)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Image::Tileset is a module for loading and slicing up tileset
    images.

    It works by having a tileset image (probably a PNG, maybe one with
    transparency) and an XML document that describes how the image is to
    be sliced up into tiles. Tiles can be simple and uniform, i.e. 32x32
    pixel tiles, but they can also be more complicated and require exact
    pixel coordinates for each tile in the tileset.

    The module also manages animation instructions for tiles, though it
    doesn't have the means to display them; there is a demo script
    included in the distribution that uses Perl/Tk to demonstrate how to
    display animations from a tileset.

  enteredby:   KIRSLE (Noah Petherbridge)
  enteredon:   Fri Jan 22 03:26:08 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::Tileset         bdpOp A tileset image loader                       KIRSLE
