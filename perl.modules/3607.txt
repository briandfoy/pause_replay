Hi Sander,

you are right, you didn't get an email from me, and perhaps it would
habe been better to send you one, before starting my own project. But
I will try to explain you why I started it.

My original idea was to write a program with perl/tk to can change
easily tags of mp3 files. Therefor I looked at CPAN for modules and
find your MP3::ID3v1Tag and the MP3::Info module. Later I also found
MPEG::ID3v2Tag, which I didn't found earlier because I only searched
for MP3 at CPAN.

I have no problem with the MP3::ID3v1Tag module itself. But I wanted a
module to which I can give a filename, and it returns to me which tags
are found, so taht I can decide which to use, when I want.  Supporting
only ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, it would have been no problem to do this
with two different modules, but my idea is to support as much as
possible tags (also, I know that at the moment my module supports only
ID3v1 and ID3v2). That means I wanted to have a sort of wrapper
module, which can handle different tags, which can then be supported
by different modules.

Second problem was, that I didn't find a module, which does proper
reading/changing/writing of ID3v2 tags. MP3::ID3v2Tag supports only
parsing of some frames, and can't write them to a file.

So my decision was to create, perhaps together with you and MattDiMeo,
a wrapper module for the two existing modules and changing ID3v2Tag to
support (almost) all frames and writing possibilities.

But I decided that it would much easier for myself to start this new,
because I know that it would not to difficult to implement the
ID3v1Tag module and had also some ideas how to write the ID3v2Tag
module. That means how to support parsing of the frames in a uniform
way using format strings.

And so I created MP3::Tag, which at the moment supports
reading/writing of ID3v1 tags and ID3v2.3 tags, thereby parsing 67 of
73 frames, but missing still some parsing support for adding frames.

With the newest release of tagged-0.20 I also added my first version
of the tk-tag program, which was my original goal to start this
project.
  
> Having even more modules to do this is kinda silly don't you think?
Of course, you are right that it is not the best idea to have one
more module doing the same work. But as I tried to explain, for me
it seems the best solution to get what I wanted.

I would like to hear, what you think about this, and if you have ideas
about how to go on with this.

'Groetjes'

   Thomas


PS: As you cc'ed your mail to modules@perl.org I did this also, but
    I'am not really sure, who gets the modules@perl.org mails. Perhaps
    you can explain me, what this adress is for.
