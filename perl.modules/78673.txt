The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::FromArrayref
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Generate HTML from arrayrefs
  userid:      NICWOLFF (Nic Wolff)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::LoL

  rationale:

    The existing HTML generation modules, such as HTML:LoL, don't make
    it easy to programmatically skip a tag or an attribute, so here's a
    simple module that takes a list of arrayrefs and renders them as
    HTML elements, replacing any whose tag names are false with their
    contents. This simple change makes it much more powerful and
    expressive:

    print HTML [ $is_bold && b => 'is this bold?' ];

    and please see the examples in the POD as well.

    Also, I've used simpler syntax to denote already-escaped text: if
    an element's tag name (the first item in its arrayref) is an
    arrayref, then the first item in that arrayref is inserted into the
    HTML without being escaped âÂ so you can just do

    print HTML [ p => 'the following text was ', [[
    '<b>already&nbsp;escaped</b>' ]];

    This is a module my team has been using for many years in corporate
    Perl applications, and now I'd like to add it to CPAN. Please let me
    know if you think this would be appropriate! Thank you for your
    time.
