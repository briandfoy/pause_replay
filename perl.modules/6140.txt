I would like to submit a new module for consideration but want some feedback
first.  The module name is Net::DHCPparse.  The concept is that you give it
an ISC 'dhcpd.leases' file (or a copy) and it will parse that file and return
a hash with the keys being the IP address contained in the leases and the values
being a fixed length record containing the IP address, most recent lease timestamp,
MAC address, and client name.

I have seen people asking about a DHCP parsing program and I have been using
this routine for some time with great success.  Some have balked at the fixed
length record, but I like it for web page formatting and the pod contains a
short script to parse the record into individual fields if needed (using unpack).


Any thoughts on this would be appreciated - especially on naming.

Thanks,
John
