Since July I=E2=80=99ve been trying to track down Dan Brumleve =
(BRUMLEVE), to resolve one of the permissions conflicts:

>>>> I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on =
resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

=E2=80=9CPragmatic=E2=80=9D module, owned by BINKLEY.

well.

I ended up signing up for a trial of the paid service on LinkedIn, as =
that seemed to be the only place I could track him down. His reply was =
=E2=80=9Cyes it is fine with me remove it. I doubt my packages have any =
users=E2=80=9D.

Here=E2=80=99s a screenshot showing the InMail response:

So I am now going to schedule deletion of the wildproto distribution, =
and drop his permissions.

Cheers,
Neil
