The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bot::Jabbot
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Pluggable jabber bot based on AnyEvent
  userid:      ISAGE (Ivan)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Jabber::Bot

  rationale:

    Well, when i wanted to create my own small bot for XMPP i stumbled
    upon Net::Jabber::Bot, but it's based on Net::Jabber, which is kinda
    outdated. Also, i was in need for plugin system, so i decided to
    write my own jabber bot module. It's was written with inspiration
    from Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable, so it's really easy to port plugins
    from and to it.

  enteredon:   Thu Dec 24 09:51:21 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bot::
::Jabbot          bdpOp Pluggable jabber bot based on AnyEvent       ISAGE
