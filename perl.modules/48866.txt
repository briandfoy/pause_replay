So would it be preferable to use

   ReStructuredText::Parser
   ReStructuredText::Writer::HTML
   etc.

or

   Doc::ReST::Parser
   Doc::ReST::Writer::HTML
   etc.

?

The other possibility is that, since the top-level script
is called "prest" (for Perl ReST parser), to use

   Prest::Parser
   Prest::Writer::HTML
   etc.

At the moment, there only seems to be Program for Research and Education 
with Small Telescopes and Pedigree Relationship Statistical Test
sharing this acronym.
