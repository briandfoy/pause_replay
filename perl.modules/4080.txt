From: behroozi@penguinpowered.COM (Peter Behroozi)

Greetings,
	This is my first entry to PAUSE, so I am requesting both a namespace 
(CGI::SecureState) and a PAUSE account (BEHROOZI).  The module that I 
have created is a drop-in replacement for CGI::Persistent that stores 
the CGI parameters in an encrypted file on the server.  Due to several 
shortcomings of CGI::Persistent (see below), the changes I made involved 
a complete rewrite (Persistence::Object::Simple was removed, for 
instance), so integration with CGI::Persistent was out of the question. 
  I have checked both CPAN and archives of modules@perl.org for a 
similar module, but have turned up nothing.  While I cannot provide a 
location where discussion has occurred on the topic, I have been running 
the code unchanged on the Price Laboratory School website 
(www.pls.uni.edu) under Apache::Registry for more than a month with no 
reported bugs.

Peter

Description:  CGI::SecureState (or whatever it ends up as) is a drop-in 
replacement for CGI::Persistent that corrects the three main 		flaws of 
CGI::Persistent, e.g. failure to work with Perl's taint 	mode, not 
encrypting user data, and a lack of association 		between the user's data 
file and their computer.
