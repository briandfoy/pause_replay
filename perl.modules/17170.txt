Nope, after installing 1.7, here's the retrograde still being
reported:

    cpan> r /Psh/

    Package namespace         installed    latest  in CPAN file
    Psh::Completion               undef      1.38  G/GR/GREGOR/psh-0.009.tar.gz

It wants me to upgrade Psh::Completion from "not installed" to "1.38" by
installing 0.009.tar.gz.  Do you really want me to do that?  I don't
think so. :(

One way to cure the retrograde is to *delete* *all* *old* versions
from the CPAN.  There's always the BackPAN, after all.
