Two corrections:
1. interface is OO.
2. description's new line had disappeared. The example should have been:
For example:
(user shell) feature <tab>
 <completion screen:>
I am   the 'feature's root one line description
feature run: I am 'feature run's node one line desc.
feature test: I am 'feature test's.
feature set: I am 'feature set's root desc.
(user shell) feature set v<tab>
<complete to 'feature set verbose', which the only option that starts with =
'v'>

(Hopefully this one works ..)
