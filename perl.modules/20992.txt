The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Regexp::Tr
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Lightweight run-time tr/// operations
  userid:      CHIA (Robert Fischer)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    NAMESPACE ----------- The Regexp:: prefix for a namespace is well
    established, and "Regexp" is a clear overarching classification for
    the "Tr" operator, and since this package provides the Tr operation,
    it seems obvious.

    UNIQUENESS ------------ A number of programs need to generate new
    tr/// operators at run-time, but Perl doesn't allow that capability.
    The standard way to handle this is to either eval the tr/// each
    time (a la Crypt::Vigenere) or use home-rolled tr/// based on other
    Perl operations (a la Crypt::Rot13).

    WHY TO INCLUDE ---------------- Listing this module in the module
    list will increase the awareness of it, providing a standardized way
    for people to handle this very common problem.

  enteredby:   CHIA (Robert Fischer)

The resulting entry would be:

Regexp::
::Tr              adpOg Lightweight run-time tr/// operations        CHIA
