Howdy,

I wanted to use the perl-Net-Patricia-1.014 module, but it was missing 
some functionality and had a crippling bug...

We're testing some fixes and some functionality that was originally 
slated but never made it in.

What's the etiquette for usurping (:-)) someone else's module?

Thanks,

-Philip
