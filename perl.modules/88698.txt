The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::CaffeinatedMarkup
  DSLIP:       bdhO2
  description: Caffeinated Markup Language
  userid:      JGREGORY (John Gregory)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Git repo (and wiki) on (github)necrophonic/text-caffeinatedmarkup

  similar:
    Text::Markdown, Text::Markup

  rationale:

    Caffeinated Markup is a markup language designed for formatting
    rich blog postings. It takes inspiration from other major markups
    such as Markdown and docuwiki syntax, mixing the best features of
    them and adding more whilst still remaining end-document format
    agnostic and sensible to read as plain ASCII. It aims to provide
    more control to the developer rather than (though in addition to
    when required) just a simple "parse it" interface. These modules
    provide (currently) a pull parser for the language and a HTML
    formatter and will be expanded to include a push parser and XS
    modules for parsing performance as well as different output format
    formatters. Support for non-blocking operation is also to be added.
