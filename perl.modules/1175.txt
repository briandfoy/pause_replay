I've now seen it in Tim's DB ref list on

It still doesn't show in 00modlist.long?

	DBD      DSLI
	::Unify  bdcO  Unify Driver for DBI          HMBRAND

It still doesn't show in http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI/

	                           Module Information
	View README       Download    View Summary   Version   Release Date
	DBD::Unify        Download        View        0.04     15 Feb 2000   

It       does    show in http://www.perl.com/reference/query.cgi?database

I'd like to see it refered to in locations people search for it, in
order to the module being used and tested by Unify users  (I admit,
not the most widely spread DB),  so I can complete parts that  I do
not use myself.
