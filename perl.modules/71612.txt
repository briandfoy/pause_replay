The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::CLI
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Provide a tree of commands to terminal shell
  userid:      JEZRA (Josef Ezra)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Term::Shell, Term::Shell::Enhanced

  rationale:

    Provide a CLI - tree of commands with tab completion to a terminal.
    Unlike Term::Shell, some commands would be roots and others - nodes.
    This is very similar to other Command Line Interfaces (gdb, for
    example), and elegantly enable providing many possible commands
    without overwhelming the user with too many completions. In a way,
    it's like moving from files in single directory to subdirectories
    structure. I've found the need for it when a simple Term::Shell
    script I've wrote exceeded 50 commands while the users kept asking
    for new ones.

    For example: (user shell) feature <tab> <completion screen:> I am
    the 'feature's root one line description feature run: I am 'feature
    run's node one line desc. feature test: I am 'feature test's.
    feature set: I am 'feature set's root desc. (user shell) feature set
    v<tab> <complete to 'feature set verbose', which the only option
    that starts with 'v'>

The resulting entry would be:
