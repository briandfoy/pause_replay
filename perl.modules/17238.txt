You're very right.

My main concern is that the backlog is non-deterministic. Some
requests get honoured, some trigger a discussion (often with
non-obvious outcome), some are just forgotten.

I think (I have some humble opinions myself) that we have long passed
the point that the module name (namespace) was a good indicator of
what a module is about. Newer search techniques (do/will/can/must)
compensate for that.
