The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::PPM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to the Swedish PPM pension saving
  userid:      ERWAN (Erwan Lemonnier)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    none found

  rationale:

    In Sweden, everybody who pays taxes gets a part of those taxes
    placed into a state managed pension saving system. Part of this
    saved money is in its turn placed into funds via a state
    organization called PPM (Premiepensionsmyndighet).

    PPM gives to every Swedish pension saver the possibility to choose
    in which funds to place his/her money and to change funds at no cost
    and as often as wanted. In other terms, PPM is a low cost and high
    quality fund placement bank, where you start getting your money back
    only upon retiring.

    All those transactions (account status, changing funds...) can be
    performed via PPM's webportal, www.ppm.nu.

    Finance::PPM offers an object oriented interface for performing
    fund related transactions on a pension saver's account. It is a
    wrapper around PPM's web portal and is designed to be integrated
    into later account monitoring and managing tools.
