I went to

        https://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_mod

to try to give away Algotirhm::Diff to Ned Konz.  I selected the
module, and then I got the form that asked me to edit the metadata.  I
changed the userid, but when I submitted that form, 
the URL


        https://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery

gave me the error:
