     why:

    I'm planning to contribute a module with the current working draft
    title of Linux::TCPServer (likely to change once I start showing it
    around PM and getting some feedback in the next week or two). It is
    essentially a scalable, light, fast, pluggable TCP network server
    module which is implemented as a pool of pre-forked children.

    It is extremely similar in nature, from the module users' point of
    view, to the following existing CPAN modules:

    Net::Server::PreFork POE::Component::Server::PreforkTCP
    POE::Class::Server::PreFork::TCP

    The primary differences are that:

    1) It is not part of a large framework or class heirarchy. It is
    just a simple non-OO module in which one registers a few callback
    functions.

    2) It is done almost entirely in C (using XS and perlcall
    mechanisms), and the underlying C code is highly optimized
    specifically for late-model Linux environments (kernel 2.6+, gcc 3+,
    glibc 2). It achieves very good scalability, very good optimization,
    and very low overhead by taking advantage of specific features,
    calls, behaviors, and assumptions that are only valid in this
    environment. I highly doubt it would compile correctly, much less
    run correctly, on a kernel-2.4-era linux machine, or any non-linux
    environment.

    The code is seemingly complete and functional right now, but docs
    and better testcases have yet to be written. I plan on running it by
    PerlMonks first for ideas (especially on naming) before starting the
    process of putting it in PAUSE/CPAN, I'm just trying to get the
    account creation thing out of the way ahead of time.
