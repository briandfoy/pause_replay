Hi, Rafael.

I'm sorry to hear about the conflict you're having. I can understand
how frustrated you must be to "lose control" over code you wrote.

Speaking as a PAUSE maintainer, we don't want to arbitrate
intra-project conflicts.

Matt has explained that he took action with the permission of the
primary maintainer(s).  If you believe that to be incorrect, I
strongly encourage you to appeal to the primary maintainer, who has
the power to restore permissions.

Beyond that, a fork is probably the best option (as usually happens
when project contributors have irreconcileable differences).

Regards,
David
