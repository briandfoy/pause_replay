Subject: Module submission Astro::SIMBAD::Client

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::SIMBAD::Client
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Fetch astronomical data from SIMBAD 4
  userid:      WYANT (Tom Wyant)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    None

  similar:
    Astro::SIMBAD Astro::Catalog

  rationale:

    SIMBAD is an online astronomical database hosted by the University
    of Strasbourg, and mirrored by Harvard. Existing Perl modules
    Astro::SIMBAD and Astro::Catalog (the latter accessing other
    databases as well) exist, both by Alasdair Allan, but neither
    registered.

    The interface to SIMBAD 4 is not compatible with SIMBAD 3. I have
    been in correspondence with Dr. Allan, and I understand the last
    note I have from him to say that he does not intend to upgrade
    Astro::SIMBAD to work with SIMBAD 4, preferring to focus on
    Astro::Catalog. The latter is a fairly heavyweight package, both in
    terms of number of modules contained and in terms of number of
    prerequisites. I have expressed to both Dr. Allan and the University
    of Strasbourg my belief that a lighter-weight module is justified,
    and made them aware of my work. I have not heard from either lately,
    and have taken silence to imply consent. I will let them know that I
    have applied for registration.

    I considered calling this Astro::SIMBAD4, but did not want to grab
    a name that far up the hierarchy; also I am ambivalent about
    embedding the version number in the name. I also considered
    Astro::SIMBAD::Lite, though the "Lite" is only relative.

  enteredon:   Tue Dec 12 16:17:38 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Astro::SIMBAD::
::Client          adpOp Fetch astronomical data from SIMBAD 4        WYANT
