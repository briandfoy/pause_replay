The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::EXIF::DateTime::Parser
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: parser for EXIF date/time strings
  userid:      PORRIDGE (Marcin Owsiany)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides a parser for "DateTime" strings as defined in
    Exchangeable image file format for digital still cameras: Exif
    Version 2.2 Section 4.6.4 "TIFF Revision 6.0 Attribute information"
    Subsection D. "Other Tags", DateTime

    This module is simply a string parser. It does NOT know how to
    extract a date/time string from an image file. You just give it a
    short string and it returns a time_t.

    The value of this module is that apart from parsing strings that
    conform to the specification, it tries to decipher some
    non-compliant strings which certain implementations produce.
    Examples of supported deviations can be found in the unit tests for
    this module.

    Keeping this module outside of other EXIF-related modules gives the
    programmer freedom to choose the method of reading the actual image,
    without forcing them to use ExifTool or any other EXIF library. At
    the same time it gives us a single place to maintain the date/time
    parsing code.

    I felt that placing this module under Image:: hierarchy makes it
    easier to find than if it was under Text::, as the strings it parses
    are strictly image-related, and people looking for such
    functionality will rather look under Image::.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::EXIF::DateTime::
::Parser          bdpOg parser for EXIF date/time strings            PORRIDGE
