The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Affixes
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Prefixes and suffixes analisys of text
  userid:      COG (José Alves de Castro)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Ngram Text::ExtractWords

  rationale:

    Prefixes and Suffixes are a very important part of Natural Language
    Processing. This module provides an easy way to extract them from
    text, along with their frequency.

    This module is currently being used by (at least) Lingua::Identify.

    Currently, it is probably a bit slow with bigger texts (haven't
    tried, just guessing), but that will be solved real soon, by
    changing the algorithm and using a little bit of C.

  enteredby:   COG (José Alves de Castro)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov  3 12:51:51 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Affixes         Rdpfp Prefixes and suffixes analisys of text       COG
