Subject: Module submission Acme::OutsideIn
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::OutsideIn
  DSLIP:       Rdpnp
  description: make your source outside in
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    Acme::emcA and other source filters

  rationale:

    This source filter makes the source inside out (but called outside
    in so as not to be confuesed with inside out objects)

    abc123

    becomes:

    cba321

    but stil works as normal :)

    IE makes each line with its outsides in and its insides out:

    |-__-|

    and makes it

    _-||-_

  enteredby:   DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan  9 14:23:34 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Acme::
::OutsideIn       Rdpnp make your source outside in                  DMUEY
