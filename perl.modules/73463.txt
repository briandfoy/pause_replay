The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::embedR
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO interface to R functions
  userid:      QIUHW (邱红文)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Statistics::useR Statistics::R

  rationale:

    The Statistics::R is an OO interface for the R language, but it has
    less interaction between R and Perl. While Statistics::useR is based
    on embeding R using C code, it does have more interactions between R
    and Perl. But it is function oriented instead of object oriented.
    And hence, you can't pass the R object to a class (or module,
    perhaps). As a result, you end up with many R interpreters as you
    used it in your own packages. This package is based on
    Statistics::useR, but provide an OO interface. As a side effect, it
    can use the technique of AUTOLOAD to automatically import R
    functions to Perl without the worry of namespace collision. And it's
    more extendable then Statistics::useR.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
::embedR          adpOp OO interface to R functions                  QIUHW
