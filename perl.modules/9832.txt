Net::PacketFactory ?
Net::PacketAssemblySystem?

I would prefer something like Clibnet or XSlibnet. The reason is that I do
not really like the packet building API used in that module and therefore I
would like to keep a good name open for someone else (i.e. somebody wants to
write a better NetPacket).

By keeping the name of the library, people would recognize it as such.

Maybe even Net::CLibnet_bindings or CLibnetBindings?
