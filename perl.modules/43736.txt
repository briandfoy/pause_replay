     why:

    File::Bidirectional reads a file line-by-line in either the
    forwards or backwards direction. It supports an object interface as
    well as a tied filehandle interface, and should be straight-forward
    to use. It is also memory efficient, since it is intended to be used
    on files too large to be efficiently slurped into an array and
    traversed backwards.
