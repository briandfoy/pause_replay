I haven't heard back yet and it's been 12 days since my first request so =
I'm going to resend just incase you didn't get my first request or =
perhaps my first request was not very clear... I would like to set have =
a PAUSE account setup for me  (Peter Tschipper) so that I can contribute =
my  MQ::  modules designed for setting up send/receive quueus and =
monitoring them...Thanks.=20

Hello,

I have a new module that is almost finished and would like to contibute =
to the perl community.

my name is Peter Tschipper
email is:  blueskies@entirety.ca
my preferred userid is:  spiritsky

What I would like to contribute is a "guaranteed delivery" messaging =
system.  Currently it will deliver messages read from either a socket =
(messages can come with message length headers or be terminated by some =
sort of message separator i.e. a "\n") or from files that are dropped in =
a send folder.   The data can be written to files that are kept =
monthly,daily,hourly etc.  and works well with generating HTML reports =
on the fly from data that is coming in from various sources.  This =
system is designed for quickly setting up production monitoring of all =
kinds of systems and as I mentioned all messages are guaranteed a =
delivery with no duplicates being sent regardless of any system or =
network outages.

Eventually I want to be able to use MySQL (for security purposes) so =
that messages can not be viewed during the routing process, also I would =
like to include triggers and automatic message forwarding in the event =
that a queue is offline. =20

I would like to get your feedback on some names for this system.  I had =
originally thoughy of  "PerlMQ" to differentiate it from IBM's MQ series =
but perhaps just "MQ" would be better?

Peter...
