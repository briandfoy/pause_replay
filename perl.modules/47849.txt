Apologies.  After I sent that, I realized I should have explained that 
better for the non-Americans.

"ZIP Code" is the US Postal Code -- 5 digits that identify the local 
post office for mail delivery.  The postal service also has a newer, 
9-digit code that is granular to specific streets.  The official name is 
"ZIP+4" (not Zip4).  And, technically, that "Zip" in the name should be 
"ZIP", too, I guess.

Regards,
David
