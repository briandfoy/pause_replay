Hi there

I noticed you had registered the domain cesan.org

I'm one of a group of major CPAN developers who also have an interest in 
Javascript/ECMAscript, and we are looking at replicating a version of 
CPAN for use with JavaScript.

The two names that we think are the most likely for this project is.

The short version:    JSAN - JavaScript Archive Network
The accurate version: CESAN - Comprehensive ECMA Script Archive Network

Can I presume from your position as one of the most active open source 
people in Turkey that you got the name reserved so that something like 
this could be done?

If so, would you be interested in joining our little group, letting us 
use the domain for this project, and possibly at a later date handing 
the domain over to some appropriate person/authority?

Regards

Adam Kennedy
