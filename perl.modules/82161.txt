Subject: Requesting assistance sorting out a PAUSE account for Shlomo Yona (shlomoy@cpan.org)
To: modules@perl.org
Cc: Yona Shlomo <yona@cs.technion.ac.il>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

From: daoswald@gmail.com (David Oswald)

A few weeks ago I began the search for the author of the CPAN module
SuffixTree, by Shlomo Yona (shlomoy@cpan.org).  Some of the others on
the modules@perl.org mailing list helped helped out, and we were
successful.

I've offered to assist in fixing some issues with that module as
co-maintainer.  Mr Yona has been graciously receptive to my offer, and
has said that he would like to add me as a co-maintainer on the
module.  However, he has lost his PAUSE credentials, and has accepted
my offer to further assist him in getting that sorted out as well.

So this message is requesting that someone with the ability to do so
assist Mr Yona in regaining access to his PAUSE account so that we can
get to work on SuffixTree.

I realize it's rather unconventional for a 3rd party to intercede in
re-establishing another author's credentials, but I'm trying to do
everything I can to facilitate the process for Mr Yona so that we can
apply some bug-fixes to this module.

Mr Yona's email address is yona@cs.technion.ac.il

Here is a brief summary of the email messages we've exchanged over the
past few weeks:

August 17-19: I sent email to the author's PAUSE email address, as
well as the email address listed in his module's POD. (bounced)
August 20:  Email sent to modules@perl.org and module-authors@perl.org
announcing the quest to find the author.
August 20-21: Email messages sent by me as well as others on the
module...@perl.org mailing lists to more current addresses.
August 26: Received a message from Mr Yona:  "Hello, I'd be happy to
get help with maintaining that module. Let's discuss how we can do
that."
August 27: I replied with an explanation of what I'd like to do, and
how co-maint works.
August 27: Mr Yona replied mentioning he had lost his PAUSE credentials.
August 27: I replied with an explanation of how to send a message to
modules@perl.org to plead the case for a reset.
August 27: Mr Yona replied: "Your help is much appreciated. I'd be
very happy to add you as co-author. I'll try sorting out the PAUSE
issues asap."
Sept 6: I sent a message asking if progress had been made on the PAUSE
issue, and offering to send an email in his behalf if he hadn't had
the time.
Sept 8: A reply from Mr Yona: "Hello, sorry, no progress. Yes. Of
course, you're more than welcome to do that."

All of my interactions with Mr Yona seem to have been positive for
both of us, but we're sort of stalled until we can get past the
technical hurdles to granting me the ability to apply some bug fixes
and generally provide assistance maintaining the module.

If someone with elevated PAUSE privileges could help us to move
forward I'd really appreciate it.
