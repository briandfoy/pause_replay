Subject: Module submission CLI::Framework

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CLI::Framework
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Standardized, flexible, testable CLI apps
  userid:      KERISMAN (Karl Erisman)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=829276

  similar:
    CLI::Application, App::Cmd, App::CLI

  rationale:

    Namespace choice: CLI::Framework (natural choice for a command-line
    interface application framework).

    Uniqueness: CLIF offers too many differentiating features to
    mention here (details are in the CLI::Framework POD -- see
    http://search.cpan.org/~kerisman/CLI-Framework-0.04/lib/CLI/Framework.pm#DESIGN_GOALS_AND_FEATURES).
    It establishes a clearer conceptual pattern than the other modules
    and it features comprehensive documentation and examples. It has a
    powerful way of handling subcommands and application exceptions. It
    features support for interactive CLI apps. It includes reusable
    built-in commands.

    Why it should be listed: For the reasons given above, because it
    has already proven its worth to current users, and because more
    people need to know about it.

  enteredby:   KERISMAN (Karl Erisman)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 31 22:39:49 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CLI::
::Framework       bdpOp Standardized, flexible, testable CLI apps    KERISMAN
