The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::TreePP
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Parser/writer between hash tree and XML file
  userid:      KAWASAKI (川崎　有亮)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://www.kawa.net/works/perl/treepp/treepp-e.html

  similar:
    XML::Simple XML::Mini

  rationale:

    XML::TreePP module parses XML file and expand it for a hash tree.
    And also generate XML file from a hash tree. This is a pure Perl
    implementation. You can also download XML from remote web server
    like XMLHttpRequest object at JavaScript language. I think that
    XML::TreePP is enough fast and easy to use!

    XML::Mini is also pure Perl implementation, but it is 10 times
    slower than XML::TreePP. XML::Simple is NOT pure Perl and it needs
    XML::Parser. XML::Parser::Lite::Tree and XML::Parser::EasyTree don't
    generate just a pure hash tree.

  enteredon:   Tue Feb 21 06:46:53 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::TreePP          bdpOp Parser/writer between hash tree and XML file KAWASAKI
