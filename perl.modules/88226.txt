Hi,

I took over Net::Dict from DIMRUB in 2001, after he did 3 initial =
releases in 1999. I've done releases since then (with a big gap), =
including one just now.

Some ABIGAIL has accidentally been given co-maint of Net::Dict, and in =
email to me he just said:
>  I certainly haven't asked for that, and I don't recall being asked.
> [...] Feel free to remove my co-maint.

Here are the perms:

% grep Net::Dict 06perms.txt
Net::Dict,ABIGAIL,c
Net::Dict,DIMRUB,f
Net::Dict,NEILB,c

DIMRUB hasn't released anything else to CPAN (see =
http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/D/DI/DIMRUB/), so I don't think it's =
worth bothering him about this.

Can I get the 'f' please, and then I'll drop ABIGAIL's 'c'

Cheers,
Neil
