Actually these are old modules, but I've released so many without
notifying you guys, I'd just like to update my list of registered
modules...:

Already there were:

CGI::XMLForm
Win32::ASP

Now I also have:

Apache::MimeXML - mod_perl module to return the correct MIME type,
including charset value, for XML documents.

DBIx::AnyDBD - Module to make cross db applications easier to write.

Time::Object - Implements an OO interface to localtime and gmtime (as
specified by Larry Wall on p5p - message URL in documentation).

XML::PYX - Converts XML to/from a streamed format for processing with
command line text tools like grep, wc, sort, uniq, etc.

XML::XPath - Implements the W3C XPath specification.

XML::miniXQL - Implements tiny subset of the XQL specification.

Phew... that's the lot.
