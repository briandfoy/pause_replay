Subject: Module submission Mozilla::Backup
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, rrwo@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mozilla::Backup
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Backup and restore Mozilla profiles
  userid:      RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    N/A

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    This module can locate the profiles of various Mozilla-related
    applications (including Firefox, Camino, Thunderbird, Sunbird,
    K-Meleon, etc.) and backup or restore the profiles.

    Unlike some existing utilities (such as MozBackup), it is
    open-source (in Perl) and not-platform-specific. It's also highly
    extensible, with plugins to implement various backup formats.

  enteredby:   RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 30 22:42:51 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mozilla::
::Backup          bdpOp Backup and restore Mozilla profiles          RRWO
