Dear keepers of the modules,

As per the discussion below on the dbi-dev listserv, I will be
maintaining DBD::CSV from now on and will be uploading a new version
shortly into the ...J/JZ/JZUCKER directory.

In the first case SQL::Parser has to know how to parse a statement SQL
containing a blob and in the second case it can just allow
SQL::Statement to insert the blob without having to parse it within the
context of the SQL statement.

In this case it means a string that can contain unescaped single quote
characters whereas other stings can not.

Ok, I'll think about it.

Sure, that sounds good.

Ok, done. I'll maintain it.
