# Date: 17 Sep 2007 11:00:59 +0200
# To: MILSO@cpan.org
# 
# Dear CPAN contributor,
# 
# we, the PAUSE administrators, are trying to tidy up the CPAN Modules
# List and are looking at namespaces that have been registered without
# ever being uploaded to PAUSE.
# 
# You have registered the namespace
# 
# DBIx::SchemaView
# 
# in the CPAN Modules List, but according to our databases, you have not
# uploaded any module with that name. This may be an error on our part,
# a problem with the PAUSE indexer, or you actually haven't uploaded an
# implementation.
# 
# In any case, we kindly ask you to contact us via the modules@perl.org
# mailing list so we can sort out the issue. This is particularly
# important if you think you are receiving this mail in error!
# 
# A simple message telling us briefly why you want to keep the
# registration even without an upload so far should suffice to get the
# namespace off our to-do list.
# 
# We plan to purge the registration for the aforementioned module
# from our database somewhen after December 17, 2007 if we do not receive an
# answer until then.
# 
# Thank you for contributing to CPAN and your help in advance.
# 
# Best regards,
# Steffen Mueller
# for the PAUSE administrators
