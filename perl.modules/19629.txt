Think we've got a bug here, maybe it's caused by the fact that 
Log::Log4perl is multi-owned: both by me (MSCHILLI) and Kevin Goess 
(KGOESS) and that we've been uploading new releases alternatingly.

Now, I think this particular .pm file Log::Log4perl::JavaMap::TestBuffer 
(only a small part of the distribution) might have been introduced in a 
release that KGOESS pushed and the indexer is rejecting it now whenever 
MSCHILLI pushes the distribution to CPAN. Could that be the case? Would 
be great if you could look into it. Thanks!
