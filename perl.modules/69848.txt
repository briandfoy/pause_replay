Frankly, I'm not attached to this or any other name. I certainly don't 
mind keeping this name (both as a nod to Array::Alt, and due to the fact 
that it's been released as an unregistered module for a year now). So if 
you're willing to register it as-is, I think that's probably best. 
However, if there's a different name that you'd prefer, that would be 
fine too.

Thanks
