     why:

    TinyXML perl module. Since in some environment one could want to
    avoid installing expat / XmlParser and blahblahblah needed by most
    XML-related perl modules. Performance are comparable to XML::Simple
    ones (maybe TinyXML is a little faster) but with a wider feature
    set. What I wanted to obtain was a fast xml library usable from perl
    (so with a powerful interface) but without the need to install about
    200 other modules to have it working. Once I just discovered xs I
    started porting a very little and efficent xml library I wrote in C
    some years ago. The interesting part of porting it in perl is that
    now it's really easy to improve the interface and I was almost
    always pissed off of installing more than 10 modules to have a
    simple xml implementation.
