i figure if you all cant help, you should at least know who i can talk
to about this. i am the author and pseudo-maintainer of
Apache::Htaccess, a module which provides an interface to apache
htaccess files.  i would like to find it a new maintainer. this was a
work project and is no longer being funded. since i have no interest in
htaccess files outside of work, i am not actively maintaining it.

any ideas of folks who might want this module? or are there better
places to appeal?  i know you all are busy and probably care even less
than i about this module :)

thanks for your time.
