Hi Neil,

Thank you for the initiative. I have marked all of the files you've
suggested for deletion. Thank you all for continuing to maintain and
improve CPAN and PAUSE!

Greetings,
Deyan

So we’ve identified the authors who can free up the most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.
