Class::DBI::AutoLoader bdpoP Class::DBI subclass generator RYANPARR

As the Class::DBI::Loader module series never did work, this aims to
take it's place. I'd hoped to reuse the Class::DBI::Loader namespace but
the author was unresponsive to e-mails.

Hopefully this package will be very useful to a bunch of people.
