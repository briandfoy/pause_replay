Anything I could do to help with that? We already host git and svn repos for
Catalyst, DBIx::Class, Moose and assorted other projects - most recently we've
set up an svn repo for Config::General and are shortly going to provide a git
one for the SDL_Perl project.

I'd be happy to support FCGI by providing whatever hosted stuff you need
within reason if that would make it easier to bring the module back into
maintenance.
