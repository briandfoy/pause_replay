     why:

    I'm working as a software engineer and use Perl as my primary
    language , and often when I write software, I write new modules
    which may sometimes be helpful for other people. I can give support
    per email or at the webboard http://www.perl-community.de/ or
    http://de.perl.org/.

    I just finished a Tk::Entry-Addon called Tk::EntryCheck which
    provides the functionality of Tk::Entry plus the following
    additions: -maxlength => 10 # maximal length of the content -pattern
    => qr([A-Za-z -]) # content may only contain these letters (i.e.
    simple access to -validate and -validatecmd)

    Of course, packing with h2xs, documentation and tests are included.
