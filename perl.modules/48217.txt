How about using a dualvar so that there are number and string
components? 

Hmmm... I wonder if there is a way to figure out which base it shold be

What did they find confusing about that? Just that they weren't using a
string? How did you finally explain it to them?

And, this particular example seems like a good candidate for some
obfuscated Perl if you need to generate a 0. :)
