Are you still having a problem with this?

I notice that both you and Patrick (and others) have permission on =
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch

egrep -i '^Catmandu::Store::Elasticsearch,' 06perms.txt
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch,HOCHSTEN,c
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch,NICS,f
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch,PIETSCH,c
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch,VOJ,c
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch,VPEIL,c

Notice the highlighted line, which says that you (NICS) have ownership =
(the =E2=80=98f=E2=80=99, as opposed to the =E2=80=98c=E2=80=99 for =
co-maint that all of the others have).

PAUSE considers package permissions case-insensitively, which means that =
having ownership of Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch ownership will mean =
that if you upload Catmandu::Store::Elasticsearch, then it will be =
indexed.

Please let us know if you=E2=80=99re still having problems, and I=E2=80=99=
ll try to help resolve them!

Cheers,
Neil
