Hi Buddy,

I only just noticed your email. PAUSE-related issues are better raised =
to modules@perl.org <mailto:modules@perl.org>, or you can send to both =
modules@ and module-authors.

I *think* that the problem is this line in your META.json file:

	"provides" : {},

If you include a =E2=80=9Cprovides=E2=80=9D section in your dist=E2=80=99s=
 metadate, then PAUSE will take that as the definitive list of packages =
in your dist, and won=E2=80=99t look at the code.

And PAUSE now requires that a dist includes a package where the name =
matches the dist name (ie dist Date-Easy should have a module =
Date::Easy), but there wasn=E2=80=99t such a module listed in =
=E2=80=9Cprovides=E2=80=9D, hence the warning.

I=E2=80=99ll raise a ticket on PAUSE, as I think it could be more =
helpful when the provides block is empty.

Cheers,
Neil
