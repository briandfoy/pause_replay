     why:

    Initially I want to take up Sam Tregar's kind offer of
    co-maintainership of Guile so I can get some bugfixes I done in and
    out in the wild and hopefully add more features later.

    I'm also planning to release a series of modules that provide the
    capacity to use Guile as a top-level logic language for POE
    applications, although there's plenty of work to be done before
    anything appears outside of posts to the appropriate
    lists/newsgroups
