     why:

    A suite of modules making a unified framework for easy development
    of complex Web applications.

    Includes a (FSA) state machine representation mechanism, a
    versatile templating system with its compiler to native Perl, a
    registry méchanisme to publish and access data thru the templates,
    its virtual machine and compiler, as well as a core API to register
    custom plugins.

    White paper first published in OSDC 2004 (Melbourne, Australia)
    under the title CGI::Unified : unified web developement framework.

    Being developped for the last 2 years. Used within many companies
    down here in Tahiti, French Polynesia.

    Hope you will consider thyis interesting enough.

    Cheers,

    Franck Porcher, Ph.D.
