Hi, this is Josh. I have a few questions. I recently installed Perl on my
PC. I am running Perl 5.8, Apache 2.55. my httpd config file is already
configured to read cgi and perl scripts. On your website I noticed you had
Apache::MP3. I'm not sure if it's available for windows or not. If Apache
MP3 is available, is there anyway you can provide me with a link to the
site.

Thanks, Josh
