Thanks for the link. Damn legal issues.
One comment on that thread: Mike Axiak is right about CPAN (the 
infrastructure) not caring about naming unless there is a direct 
conflict. Who totally wrong thinking that CPAN (the people) don't care. 
That's why we're here. We usually choose to advise instead of enforcing 
stuff because that, paired with a bit of common sense and experience, 
avoids having hard-and-fast rules that fail to make sense in some cases 
("cannot have Django in the name"...). This has worked very well in 
almost all cases.

Quite ridiculous reasons but so is legalese. That's not exactly the 
Django people's fault. :(

I'd be fine with the DTL part since it seems to be established practice 
elsewhere if I read that thread correctly. However, I'm a bit reluctant 
to grant a top-level namespace that's an acronym. Then again, 
DTL::Template is nesting things the wrong way around *and* redundant.

So let's see whether brian has any input on this. If not, I'd say go for 
"DTL".

About the previous registration: You can delete it yourself via PAUSE -> 
edit module metadata -> module lifecycle -> can be deleted.

Best regards,
Steffen
