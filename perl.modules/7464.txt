Contribution:
Number::Base - supplies a set of functions to allow simple conversion 
between common engineering number bases ( integer, hexadecimal, and octal ) 
for signed and unsigned.  Whenever I've done conversions in the past, I'd do 
them the manual way (i.e. sprintf or pack/unpack) but after a while that 
gets tedious, especially when you change jobs and forget to keep all of your 
old libraries.  I'd like to make this contribution to the community so that 
others and myself don't have to do these conversions tediously.
