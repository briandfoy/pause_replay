The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RDF::Redland
  DSLIP:       MdhOl
  description: Redland RDF library
  userid:      DJBECKETT (Dave Beckett)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    See http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/ for pointers to list,
    public CVS and cvsweb.

  similar:
    RDF::Suite RDF::Core RDF::Service

  rationale:

    This is a full featured perl interface to a mature C RDF library
    that has been deployed for several years. It has been mainly used
    via the perl interface which is in the OO styl and includes complete
    POD documentation.

    The namespace RDF::Redland has been chosen so as to distinguish
    from other CPAN RDF modules and to make it clear that it is an
    interface to the Redland library.

    The existing RDF modules cover similar territory but are pure Perl
    approaches.

    (The license is actually dual LGPL/MPL)

The resulting entry would be:

RDF::
::Redland         MdhOl Redland RDF library                          DJBECKETT
