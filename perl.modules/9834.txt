Since it looks like a framework of related modules I think it needs
a funky 'brand name' (like Alzabo is, for example) so you effectively
'own' the namespace below it.  Say PeterMQ::* as a (poor) example,
or BlueskiesMQ::*. Whatever.

MQ::* and PerlMQ::* aren't too good because the names implies a home
for other messaging system modules that may be unrelated to yours.

Tim.

I would like to set have a PAUSE account setup for me  (Peter Tschipper) so that I can contribute my  MQ::  modules designed for setting up send/receive quueus and monitoring them...Thanks.

Currently it will deliver messages read from either a socket (messages can come with message length headers or be terminated by some sort of message separator i.e. a "\n") or from files that are dropped in a send folder.   The data can be written to files that are kept monthly,daily,hourly etc.  and works well with generating HTML reports on the fly from data that is coming in from various sources.  This system is designed for quickly setting up production monitoring of all kinds of systems and as I mentioned all messages are guaranteed a delivery with no duplicates being sent regardless of any system or network outages.
