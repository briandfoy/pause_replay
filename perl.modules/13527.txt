Please CC on your reply, thanks.

Swish-e (http://swish-e.org) is search engine tool that's been around since
1994.  A few years back I was asked to put a few existing Perl modules for
using swish-e on the CPAN.  

I kept the names of the modules, but that meant I uploaded to CPAN SWISH.pm
as a top-level module and created a new top-level directory called SWISH.

I think uploading a top-level module and creating a new section of CPAN was
probably not the best way to go.

Anyway, I need to create some new modules for swish-e.  Outside of CPAN I'd
call them SWISH::Filter.pm and SWISH::Filters::* (for the various filters
that can be used with Swish-e).  They may not ever need to be uploaded to
CPAN, but on the other hand these additional filters are going to be
user-submitted, so it could be possible that CPAN would be a good repository.

So, the question is should I reconsider the naming scheme just in case the
modules end up on CPAN at some point in the future?  And if so, under what
name?  Since some modules relating to swish are distributed with swish-e I
don't want the name to seem too out of place.

Suggestions?

Thanks,
