Hi.

I've seen several mails in the modules-list archives about modules that
don't show up on the CPAN modulelist. The weird thing is that the modulelist
(00modlist.long.html) is a version from just a few days ago. And yet it
*still* contains only the two oldest Games:: modules, and doesn't have Cards
(no, I'm not altruistic), Chess, Rezrov.... (They are in
01modules.index.html, but I'll bet that that one is machine-generated.)

So why doesn't 00modlist have all the modules in it?

ps I read cplm and the modules archive only rarely, so please cc me.
