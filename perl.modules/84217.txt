Dear fellow PAUSE Admins,

I'm interested in taking over co-maint of Dancer::Session::Cookie.  It
was originally written as part of SUKRIA's Dancer and then spun out
into a separate CPAN distribution.  KAPPA got the 'first-come' rights,
but SUKRIA has been doing maintenance for a while (and then stopped to
focus on Dancer 2).

KAPPA has not responded to requests and SUKRIA is supportive of
offering co-maint to me given his lack of round tuits.

Since I don't use my PAUSE admin rights on my own behalf (at least
without peer review), could someone please add me as co-maint or at
least state formally that you have no objections to me making the
change on my own.

Regards,
David
