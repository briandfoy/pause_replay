That was a pretty thin answer. More specifically, CapnMidnite implements

MD5 and RC4 + RC4 modified-non-linear

MD5 is identical in function to Digest::MD5, but because of the way it
is used inside the C program, it would be a hassle to use the module
though it could be done of course. The RC4 implementation is similar to
Crypt::RC4 but this module appears to be broken and not maintained. This
implementation corrects the errors and adds features for use in several
other modules. The non-linear RC4 implementation is unique and prevents
"unwinding" the encryption with the original crypt key.

Used by Crypt::License and several modules not yet released but in use
for a couple of years.... I'll get around to it eventually :-)

Crypt::CapnMidNite has an alter ego included in the Makefile
(Crypt::C_LockTite) that is used in the developer portion of
Crypt::License that enables the reverse non-linear RC4 crypt function.
There are INSTALL notes provided that explain its use and build.
Crypt::C_LockTite will never be uploaded/released as it is only built on
demand for Crypt::License per the included docs.

Sorry about rambling on so...

Michael
