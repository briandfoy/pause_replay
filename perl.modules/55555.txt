The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::AskAnExpert
  DSLIP:       adph2
  description: Automate checking with experts when testing
  userid:      TRIZOR (Edgar A. Bering)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, irc.perl.org/#perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is meant as a relinquishment of the Test::Smart name (which I
    requested but never got) for doing the same thing. This is a more
    accurate name reflecting what the module actually does instead of
    using a loaded word like 'Smart' to convey next to nothing.

    The concept behind the module is that complex systems (meteorology
    packages, expert systems, various perturbative solution methods)
    which are very difficult to unit test the end result of because it
    is either an abstract concept "Is this meteorologically sound?" or
    something computers have a very hard time with "Is this captcha
    foobar123?" but people do quickly and easily and should the wrong
    answer be present, people can provide much better diagnostics (in
    the case of the captcha a person can say "The backround and font
    don't have enough contrast" while a computer can tell you you need
    to look at it and make the determination on your own). The face time
    with experts should be spent developing new algorithms and
    understanding true bugs, not verifying day to day tests are ok. This
    module abstracts the face time spent on test verification into a
    computerized interface for the experts and standard TAP output for
    the developers.
