The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Jabber::JAX::Component
  DSLIP:       RdhOp
  description: Jabber JECL XML libraries interface
  userid:      PIERS (Piers Harding)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    jdev@jabber.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module suite is an interface to the Jabber C++ JECL libraries
    using Inline. These libraries are used for building high performance
    components that communicate with a Jabber server. Jabber::Judo deals
    with the XML node manipulation function set ( releated to the C++
    judo namespace ), and Jabber::JAX deals with the component connector
    interface ( the C++ jax Component building namespace ). Please see
    http:://jabber.tigris.org for the JECL project, and
    http://www.jabber.org for links to all other Jabber related
    background material, as there many diverse applications for Jabber (
    see: http://discuss.andredurand.com/stories/storyReader$86 - as an
    example ). It is envisioned that there will be many other modules
    that will come from this, covering the vast spectrum of Jabber and
    its possible uses - these will include all manner of Transport
    layers ( components ) for things such as the AIM, MSN, or ICQ
    interfaces, and diverse applications such as XML-RPC, SIP/SIMPLE
    gateways, or BOTs ( note: Jabber is NOT just IM) . I have noted that
    there has been recent discussion about the adoption of the new
    highlevel namespace Jabber
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-09/msg00339.html
    - I hope that this demonstrates that there is reasonable merit for
    this.
