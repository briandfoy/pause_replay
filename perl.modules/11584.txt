I have 3 HPUX Modules that I'd like to get included in CPAN if possible. =
 They are HPUX::LVM HPUX::Ioscan (Updated version with OO portion of =
Dominiuqe Dumont's module) and HPUX::FS.  They are in my CPAN directory.

Their entries should look like:

HPUX::LVM    bdpo    Object Oriented Interface to HPUX Logical Volume =
Manager
HPUX::Ioscan    bdpo    Functions and OO Interface to HPUX Ioscan
HPUX::FS    bdpo    Object Oriented Interface to HPUX filesystem data

I've been updating them for some time now and they are quite useful for =
any HPUX admin.  Especially the LVM module.  I've included a cgi script =
that uses them all in the contrib directory and I have just finished =
another text based utility that uses them all.  I have found them =
extremely usefull.

Thanks,

-Chris
