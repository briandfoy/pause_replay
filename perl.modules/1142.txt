Plan: Right now I'm working on File::Directory. contains
      mkdirhier	    create a directory structure
      rmdirhier	    recursively remove a directory

      I have it working as a script right now, just need to
      make into a module, and add some pragmas.
DSLI: cdpf
Desc: Dir functions (creation, destruction)
Qual: Have not discussed. But the reason it came about was (I'm going to be
      using this blurb; or somehting like it; in the documentation):
      How many times have you needed to do some extensive directory
      manipulation but just didn't feel like writing the code? You
      knew it wasn't too difficult, but surely somebody's done it before...
      Why reinvent the wheel? But you looked at CPAN and nothing was there.
      So instead you made a system a call (rm -rf sound familiar?)
      Well rejoice, for now there's File::Directory, and it's portable!
