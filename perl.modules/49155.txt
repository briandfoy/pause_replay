There is a lot of misconception about -ize vs -ise spellings.  
Historically the -ise is not British, its a French influence. The  
British use both spellings.

There is an article on wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-ise_.2F_-ize

I also found this while looking
http://www.oasis-open.org/archives/ubl/200404/msg00115.html


So I would not say that -ize is little used. They are used just about  
the same, it is just some countries have a preference one way or the  
other.
