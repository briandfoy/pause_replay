The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Inline::WSC
  DSLIP:       Rupfp
  description: Use JavaScript and VBScript from within Perl
  userid:      JOHND (John Drago)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.*

  similar:
    JavaScript::SpiderMonkey

  rationale:

    Although this module does not follow the internal implementation of
    a proper Inline:: module, it does allow basically the same
    functionality.

    Unlike JavaScript::SpiderMonkey, you can pass parameters and
    retrieve results from javascript/vbscript functions.

    I have not found another Perl module that allows inlined execution
    of VBScript.

  enteredby:   JOHND (John Drago)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 25 16:21:01 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Inline::
::WSC             Rupfp Use JavaScript and VBScript from within Perl JOHND
