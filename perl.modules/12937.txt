Seems reasonable.

Tricky. We don't have a namespace for state machines and the 'control flow
utilities' section of the module list is a mish-mash of modules:
    http://search-beta.cpan.org/modlist/Control_Flow_Utilities

Searching on state machine is interesting:
    http://search-beta.cpan.org/search?mode=all&query=state+machine
but offers little practical help. It seems that state machine modules
have always been closely tied to other modules (POE::Session,
Bio::Tools::StateMachine::AbstractStateMachine, Win32::CtrlGUI::State)

Is there any chance you could reuse/extend/subclass POE::Session?

Otherwise perhaps StateMachine::Gestinanna would be a reasonable
name (showing the association with the Gestinanna framework) and
distribute it as a separate module - if it really is separate.

Seems okay to me.
