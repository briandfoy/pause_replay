[also sent to module-authors and CC'd to Marco Carnut]

I've been sitting on a patch for Compress::Bzip2 for a while; I sent it to the 
maintainer (Marco Carnut, http://search.cpan.org/~kcarnut/) but he didn't 
reply.  The patch:

- fixes a bug with compressing small strings (the allocated buffer is too 
small)
- adds error reporting and checking
- adds tests
- adds an OO streaming interface
- adds a 'version' method to get the bzip2 library version
- cleans up the documentation
- looks for libbz2, rather than hard-coding the location

I can send the patch to this list if desired (it's about 9k gzipped), or go 
ahead and upload a new version to CPAN, although I don't want to tread on 
anyone's toes.  If Marco can't be found I'd be willing to take over 
maintainership.
