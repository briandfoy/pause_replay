Hi,

I started this module in 2005 and haven't done any work on it since. I 
don't really have access to the type of test data needed to fully 
develop this any more.  The module is well documented, but needs more 
work. It is a fairly difficult class of problem to solve well, but is 
very useful.

I also have the name spaces Text::Record::Filter, and 
Text::Record::Cleanser if anyone is interested. Together they could 
perhaps form part of an ETL (Extract Transform and Load) tool kit for 
improving business data quality.

Regards,

Kim
