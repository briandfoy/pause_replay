The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VMware::LM
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to VMware Lab Manager's SOAP API
  userid:      AIVATURI (Aditya Ivaturi)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    VMware Lab Manager has a SOAP API & most of its scripting examples
    are available for Java or Powershell. I developed a Perl interface
    for it for our internal automation needs and figured, it could help
    others in their automation efforts.

    The reason I chose the namespace VMware::LM was because it clearly
    depicts what it addresses/provides. I couldn't find any VMware
    namespace listed on CPAN and I couldn't really find any other
    namespace where my module would be a good fit. I'm open to other
    suggestions though.

    And finally, I chose Commercial_Software_Interfaces because VMware
    Lab Manager is a commercial software. Again, I'm open to categorize
    it as some thing else.

  enteredby:   AIVATURI (Aditya Ivaturi)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb  4 06:39:59 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

VMware::
::LM              adpOp Interface to VMware Lab Manager's SOAP API   AIVATURI
