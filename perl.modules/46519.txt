The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Module::API
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Easy API interfacing to you code
  userid:      EVDB (Edmund von der Burg)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    Froody

  rationale:

    Module::API lets you create code that can be accessed over an API
    easily. It provides both the clint and server code need for the
    communication and lets you handle the various calls you might want
    to make by writing plugins.

    It deals with both local requests and remote ones, as well as
    creating a queue on which to look after parallel non-blocking
    requests.

    As this module is intended to be used as a base class for other
    modules I though that the Module::* namespace was appropriate. It
    could also have gone into Net::* but the API calls need not go over
    a network.

The resulting entry would be:
