The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Genealogy
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Process files containing genealogical data
  userid:      RSAVAGE (Ron Savage)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    The Gedcom.pm mailing list

  similar:
    Gedcom.pm

  rationale:

    Sorry about the double submission, if any. Not sure what happened.

    In co-operation with the author of Gedcom.pm, we've decided to use
    Genealogy::* for a new suite of similar modules.

    Gedcom.pm is actually named after a document which defines a
    specific genealogical file structure, and hence is not such a good
    name.

    In time, the new set of modules (some written, others planned) will
    probably supercede Gedcom.pm, while offering new features.

    Lastly, by using a new namespace, installation of the new modules
    will not cripple installed scripts using Gedcom.pm.

The resulting entry would be:

Genealogy         bmpOp Process files containing genealogical data   RSAVAGE
