i was looking at this yesterday too, and i remember seeing some
comment in one version of the list that nobody had a way to 
convert the data format to the HTML format that the web uses.

i considered writing something to do while i travelled today, but
haven't thought about it much beyond that.  i'm willing to help, but
i should probably wait to see what's already been done.  i can't 
imagine that someone simply typed that list :)
