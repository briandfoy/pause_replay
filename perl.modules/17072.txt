Randal --

Thanks for the clarification.

I've made a change I think will cure the problem, and released
version 1.1 (uploading to CPAN now). Please let me know if
this does not make things better.


Regards,

The problem is specifically somewhere where you say:

        package Psh;
        $VERSION = 1.0;

You do this in psh-0.009, but nowhere in psh-1.0,
so the problem is that it wants me to "upgrade" to 0.009 to "upgrade"
the version of "Psh" from undef to 1.0.

Please remove psh-0.009, or release a new psh-1.1 that has a Psh module.
