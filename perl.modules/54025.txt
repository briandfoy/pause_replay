The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::DVSM::SB
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: XHTML/XML transformation
  userid:      DVSM (Stuart Butler)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Module is mainly aimed at web development but requires XHTML. It
    embeds instructions in the XHTML/XML itself. The effect is to spin
    XML from within the XML document itself. The right root might be
    XHTML::DVSM::SB - HTML::XHTML::DVSM::SB just seems too long.

    DVSM stands for dynamic visual software modelling - referring to
    the use of a working storyboard of XHTML markup to design an
    application, and SB stands for Story Board - animating the
    storyboard using the embedded instructions.

    This really is a very simple but utterly new concept - there is
    nothing else that uses the principle of completely preserving the
    designer's XHTML. This is NOT any of the following: a document merge
    module, a replacement for asp/jsp, just a way of embedding perl
    script.

  enteredby:   DVSM (Stuart Butler)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 17 08:14:57 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::DVSM::
::SB              bdpOg XHTML/XML transformation                     DVSM
