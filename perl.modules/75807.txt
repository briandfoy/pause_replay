I don't think any of these recent additions really belong in Algorithm. 

I didn't really notice it at first, but you're flooding the namespace
because you think you're doing the same basic thing of computing
something. However, we want to provide a better hierarchy.

For instance, you have many modules that deal with national ID numbers,
but from looking at the name, there is nothing that groups them. Find
a top-level namespace that's specifically about national ID numbers,
like NationalID::*.
