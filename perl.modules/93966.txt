Dear PAUSE admin,

I'm interested in adopting Alien.pm so that it can be updated to reflect
the current state of the art of Alien on CPAN.  I intend to keep it a
documentation only distribution and just add some links to commonly used
Alien based solutions and examples (including Alien::Base).  My fork can
be found on GitHub, and details of my plans can be found here:

https://github.com/plicease/Alien/issues/1

My PAUSE id is PLICEASE.  I am the release manager for Alien::Base and I
have also successfully adopted a number of CPAN modules, including
Test::Fixme, File::Which, and others.

As per the adoption guidelines I attempted contacting the current owner
(Artur Bergman ABERGMAN) via his cpan.org email address, github and
twitter.  He responded on Twitter as can be seen here:

https://twitter.com/crucially/status/641649738735943680

As you can see he is requesting that I take over the module.  I asked if
he could assign me the appropriate permissions on PAUSE, but given that
his last release to CPAN was in 2009 it seems likely that he has forgotten
the password, or otherwise does not have the time to make the adjustment
in the PAUSE web interface.  If you could please make the change in the
PAUSE database for me I would greatly appreciate it.

If possible, please also make ETJ, JBERGER and ZMUGHAL co-maint of this
module.  They also have a vested interest in the Alien ecosystem, and I
would like them to be able to take over in the event that I am
unavailable.

Thank you for your timely consideration of this request,
Graham
