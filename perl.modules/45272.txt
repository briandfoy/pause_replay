Over the years I get the impression, this needs to be put into some
FAQ. Something like this (and the whole text is subject to radical
changes if needed and if alternative means via META.yml evolve):

To satisfy the CPAN indexer, it's necessary to distribute one or more
*.pm files. If your distro contains no *.pm file, because for example,
your Foo.pm is written by a script during the execution of 'perl
Makefile.PL', then you need to take precautions if you want to be
acknowledged by the indexer. The META.yml by MakeMaker doesn't help.
There are several possible solutions:

1. Write a different file on the fly, say Foo/Local.pm and have that
   be required by Foo.pm and let Foo.pm be just

   package Foo;
   $VERSION =3D "2.26";
   require Foo::Local;

2. Write only a few configuration variables into some Foo/Config.pm
   and the common logic into Foo.pm. This is really the same thing as
   above.

3. I have not yet enough experience with Module::Build instead of
   MakeMaker. M:B writes a bigger META.yml file that would be parsed
   by the indexer. That would be an interesting approach but would
   probably need some more support on the PAUSE side.

4. The least intrusive to you as an author would probably be to let
   Makefile.PL care for the distribution of a bare minimum of Foo.pm
   and overwrite it during installation. This approach is the
   trickiest and thus probably least maintainable one. But it is
   conceptually possible and is therefore mentioned as an alternative.
   An actual implementation is left as an exercixe to the reader:-)
