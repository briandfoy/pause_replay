Welcome HENRIK,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      HENRIK

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
