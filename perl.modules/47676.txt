The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Read
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Unique API for reading one or more files
  userid:      SAPER (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    IO::All

  rationale:

    Hello,

    Although the name of this module could let think it's too trivial
    to be a module (reading a file is quite easy after all), I actually
    need it for refactoring some Perl scripts used for gathering systems
    information. Of course there's IO::All, but I unfortunately can't
    use it as it requires Perl 5.6 and I need a module compatible with
    Perl 5.4.

    Hence this new module, which proposes a few high-level filters
    (skip blank lines and skip comments) and support reading files as
    root (in a crud way, but the aim of this module is to hide and
    factor the crud in one place, so that when a better way is found,
    only one place needs to be changed).

    Regards,

    SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni
