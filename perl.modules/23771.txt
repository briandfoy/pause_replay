The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Metabolic
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Biochemical reaction networks
  userid:      OXE (Oliver Ebenhöh)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-metabolic/

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module defines objects for biochemical compounds, enzymatic
    reactions and complete reaction networks.

    It shall help to analyse and model metabolic networks. This is
    clearly a biological application, therefore I intend to place this
    module under root level namespace Bio.

    There are many modules comprised in the bioperl distiribution.
    However, most of these models are purely bioinformatics tools, i.e.
    they deal with sequence (genomic as well as protein) analysis.

    My module deals with a completely different aspect of system's
    biology, the metabolism.

    Therefore I chose the second level to differ from other modules and
    propose the name Bio::Metabolic.

  enteredby:   OXE (Oliver Ebenhöh)
  enteredon:   Mon Sep 29 15:04:10 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
::Metabolic       cdpOg Biochemical reaction networks                OXE
