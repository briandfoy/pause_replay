Yeah, trouble is the CPAN shell's "hey hey update me" thing suggests
Bundle::CPAN which has a tendency to blow the fuck up.

It's ... er ... it's a bastard of a problem. I don't have any great solutions
off the top of my head. But old toolchains are, sadly, a reality, and while
it's not exactly our fault I'm still in favour of whatever we can do to
fix it.
