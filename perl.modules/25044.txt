I'd prefer to see it under HTTP:: as perhaps HTTP::<Foo>Daemon where
<foo> is something that either hints at what makes your module
different, or is a 'brand name'.

If you really think it deserves a new namespace for itself then
the namespace needs to be a more distinctive 'brand name' than RSH
(which many people will assume is related to the 'remote shell'
protocol).

Tim.
