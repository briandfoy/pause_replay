     why:

    I work as a Perl developer for a living and recently started a
    project using Dancer. During this project, I ran across a need for a
    DBIx based session engine and all that I could find on cpan was a
    DBI based one so a writing of Dancer::Plugin::DBIC motivated me to
    sign up for this account.
