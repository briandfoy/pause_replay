Subject: Games::Cards missing from modulelist

Games::Cards was created in August, but has failed to appear on the module
list (00modlist.long.html) at CPAN. I happened to go to PAUSE today and saw
the "module list catchup" mail from october. I'm guessing this is what
happened to Games::Cards, too. Here's the one- (two) line description.

Games::
::Cards           adpO Tools to write card games in Perl            AKARGER

Incidentally, the vitally important Games category has Chess,
Chess::Referee, Dissociate, RezRov, WordGuess, and Worms, none of which are
mentioned in 00modlist.
