Subject: Module submission MooseyPoopoe

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseyPoopoe
  DSLIP:       cdpOb
  description: modern POEish framework.
  userid:      ECARROLL (Evan Carroll)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    poe mailing list, and irc.

  similar:
    POE

  rationale:

    POE without POE-components, blessed arrays, closures in new(),
    inconsistent APIs, junk in the core, and other nonsense. Rewritten
    with Moose (blessed arrays).

    This project is going to bring POE up to date by straight out not
    supporting anything older than perl than 5.08, and maybe in some
    respects 5.10. It will also not have things like HTTPD Filters in
    the core. It will use Moose.pm heavily.

    The current established POE community has shown very little
    interest, and so I will personally attempt it alone. I'm asking for
    the whole namespace of MooseyPoopoe so i can release my components
    of the framework as they are developed to the community.

    You can find the repository on github at
    ttp://github.com/EvanCarroll/MooseyPoopoe/tree/master

    I've already completed the whole POE::Filter component, and audited
    all of the code in all of the filters (glanced over httpd a bit).

The resulting entry would be:

MooseyPoopoe      cdpOb modern POEish framework.                     ECARROLL
