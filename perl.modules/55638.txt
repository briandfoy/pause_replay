Subject: Module submission HTML::Dashboard

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Dashboard
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Spreadsheet-like formatting for HTML tables
  userid:      JANERT (Philipp K. Janert)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org nntp.perl.org www.perlmonks.org

  similar:
    HTML::Tabulate HTML::Table HTML::EasyTable HTML::ElementTable

  rationale:

    This module tries to achieve spreadsheet-like formatting for HTML
    tables.

    Rather than having to build up an HTML table from data, row by row
    and cell by cell, applying formatting rules at every step, this
    module allows the user to specify a set of simple rules with the
    desired formatting options. The module will evaluate the rules and
    apply the formatting options as necessary.

    The following features are supported:

    - User-defined formatting of first, last, even, and odd rows or
    columns. - Conditional formatting, based on the contents of each
    cell. - Sorting (on any column or combination of columns, with user
    defined sort-order). - Pagination of the data set. - Definition of
    ``views'', i.e. restriction of the set of columns shown. -
    User-defined column captions. - On-the-fly formatting and collating
    of the data.

    You can view a set of examples at:
    http://www.beyondcode.org/projects/dashboard/gallery.html

    and the POD at:
    http://www.beyondcode.org/projects/dashboard/index.html

    Other modules:

    The module HTML::Tabulate seems close in intent to the present
    module and may be an alternative. (The API is much larger than the
    one for the present module and I am not entirely sure how it works.)

    Several modules provide very thin wrappers around the actual HTML
    of a table, they include HTML::Table, HTML::EasyTable,
    HTML::ElementTable.

    However, all either seem to be much more complicated to use than
    the current module, or do not offer the data-dependent formatting
    which is the core functionality this module offers.
