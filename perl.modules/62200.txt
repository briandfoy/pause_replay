The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AI::Genetic::Pro
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: Genetic algorithms for professional purpose.
  userid:      STRZELEC (Strzelecki Łukasz)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://warszawa.pm.org

  similar:
    AI::Genetic

  rationale:

    This module provides efficient implementation of a genetic
    algorithm for professional purpose. It was designed to operate as
    fast as possible even on very large populations (> 10000) and big
    individuals (>> 32-bit). It uses C and XS code for speed reasons and
    to reduce amount of used memory.

    Available on CPAN AI::Genetic has several seriously limitations
    (small populations and small individuals).

    AI::Genetic::Pro was implemented in Military University of
    Technology for scientific purpose.

  enteredby:   STRZELEC (Strzelecki Łukasz)
  enteredon:   Fri Sep 12 22:30:45 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

AI::Genetic::
::Pro             adhOp Genetic algorithms for professional purpose. STRZELEC
