Subject: Module submission Class::ArrayObjects
To: modules@perl.org, rberjon@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@p11.speed-link.de ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::ArrayObjects
  DSLI:        bdph
  description: utility class for array based objects
  userid:      RBERJON (Robin Berjon)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm not sure that category 6 is the best category, but that's where
    most of the Class:: modules seem to be.

    The rationale behind this module is to provide easier ways of
    creating OO hierarchies of classes that use array based objects.
    There was a TPJ article on this (which I unfortunately couldn't
    reread before releasing this module given that TPJ isn't around),
    and I saw the subject come up on a regular basis on various mailing
    lists. I searched CPAN, and ask here and there but there didn't seem
    to be anything that did what I needed so I came up with my own. I've
    been using it for a while, and it seems to perform fine.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::ArrayObjects    bdph utility class for array based objects        RBERJON
