You don't seem to have replied to my mail introducing you to the actual
protocol buffers project; the only reason you seemed to be wanting to
write something else was that their code wouldn't go onto CPAN, and I sent
an email introducing you to Yuval Kogman who's part of that project and
-is- planning to put the code onto CPAN.

I'd ask you to please consider working with the existing project that
already has a working protocol buffers implementation for app engine to get
their code onto CPAN, rather than inventing your own potentially incompatible
one.
