    Module 1 - Router_Collection

    Currently only one incarnation

    Router_Collection::Cisco

    although this will be increasing over the next several months.

    I have never submitted work into the community before so will need
    some help packaging it up properly.

    Cisco Router Statistics/Inventory Collection Code covering the
    following routers

    UBR7200 - CMTS - Inventory and traffic statistics along with cable
    plant characteristics. Detailing per card characteristics and
    interface performance parameters.

    7600 - Switch/Router GSR - 12xxx series routers 7500 - Business
    circuit aggregation device

    UBR Manipulation Code for Cable Providers, offering the following
    functionality

    Per MAC data collection statistics ( so per Cable Modem/Set top box
    ) - Octets up/down, Packets Up/Down, Profile ( DOCSIS profile ), IP
    addresses associated with devices, + variety of other data points

    Disconnection of device based on MAC

    Change of service profile for connected devices ( Cable Modem/Set
    top box ) without the need to reboot the remote device ( no DOCSIS
    restart required ) per MAC. Could be used to offer additional cable
    services without the need for significant high order management
    systems.

    CPE Data Statistics Collection Code

    DOCSIS Profile DOCSIS Filename used for provisioning Downstream
    DOCSIS frequency Upstream DOCSIS frequency Cable Modem/Set top box
    manufacturer Firmware of device + variety of other DOCSIS service
    parameters ie. concatentation ( used to determine service speed
    availability )

    General network link map generator so generating each connection
    point from a list of IP addresses and SNMP read keys.

    Dependencies are Net::SNMP

    Module 2 - Windows Media Control Module

    Package : WindowsMediaServices

    WindowsOS only

    Dependencies are as yet unknown

    As yet unfinished, but working and has the following functions

    Publishing point ADD Publishing point Remove Publishing point
    parameter changes supporting the following

    i) All limits defined by windows media, so bitrate, max connections
    etc ii) Change of source type ie. push/pull iii) Logging options iv)
    Extraction of current publishing point characteristics ie. max
    limits/number of connections/current bitrate/current playlist item
    and clientdata v) authentication/authorization changes vi) building
    of WSX playlists to be used.
