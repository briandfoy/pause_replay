cpan.perl.com isn't working correctly, so do not use it. Inquiries are
going on.

I'm in charge with this but have fallen out of the loop for three
months, so discussions about namespaces were not performed as much as
should have been.

I just registered Parallel::ForkManager as it has a straightforward
namespace. I fear we should discuss the namespaces of the other two on
modules@perl.org. Whenever you wnt to open a new root namespace you
ought to have a reasonable explanation why the root namespace would be
justified.

I'm doing this and include pointers to your requests:

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-07/msg00091.html
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-09/msg00087.html

I'm currently working on productivity tools that make registering and
gathering of informations easier and hope that we can then provide a
better job. I did the registration of Parallel::ForkManager with the
new tool, still have to iron out a few weaknesses, but in a few days,
we are there.
