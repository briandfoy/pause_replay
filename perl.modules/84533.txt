     why:

    I use PERL extensively for work and non-work related tasks, and am
    a firm believer is code re-use. It would be a pleasure to contribute
    back to what I have learn through others efforts and would hopefully
    help other learn from my efforts. Planning on contributing scripts,
    modules, how-to's. etc.
