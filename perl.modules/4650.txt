Hi,

I'd like to register for PAUSE with a view to contributing a module.

Here are my details:

A module that converts UK easting and northing to latitude and longitude.

Working title is Geo::Coord, however would rather use a more narrow name.
I'm having difficulty coming up with something that fits in the 11 character
recommendation. The sentiment is Geo::ukEastingNorthing2LatitudeLongitude.
Would appreciate advice here.

Latest version of the module is here:
http://dev0.freelancers.net/Geo-Coord-0.12.tar.gz

> where you have discussed some or all parts of your contribution
Invited comments on comp.lang.perl.modules, received two responses off-list.
Happy to take further direction on this.

Cheers
Dan
