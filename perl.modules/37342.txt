I don't think that "Precision" captures what the test is about.  The 
module doesn't test "precision" in any way and doesn't test "for 
precision".  At best, it tests "with precision", but that doesn't convey 
what it tests.  "Test::EqualityWithPrecision" is a clear name, but too 
long, in my opinion.

Generally, I see three approaches to names in the "Test::" hierarchy:

1. Something that helps with testing, named after what it is or does. 
E.g., Test::Builder, Test::Harness, Test::Inline, Test::Unit, 
Test::Mock*, etc.

2. A condition that is being tested for.  E.g., Test::Exception (and 
outside the official hierarchy, Test::NoWarnings)

3. The object that is being tested or tested for.  E.g., Test::Env,
Test::File, Test::URI, Test::Data, etc. (outside the hierarchy, 
Test::LongString)

The name Test::Float is patterned directly after the third approach. 
Because its utility is specific to floating-point numbers (and nothing 
else), I feel strongly that having "Float" in the title is important.

Could it be "Test::CompareFloat" or "Test::Equality::Float"?  Maybe, but 
those seem unwieldy for such simple functionality.  (Though the first is 
far better than the second, in my opinion.)

"Test::Float" is simple and clear in its meaning and follows an 
established pattern of naming.

David Golden
