The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Adblock
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A simple implementation of Adblock Plus
  userid:      EDECA (David Cannings)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Nowhere, but it seemed like a good idea on a Saturday morning

  similar:
    None that I could find

  rationale:

    Loads Adblock Plus rules and supports filtering based on URI. Does
    not (at the moment) support element filtering, but this could be
    added if enough people bug about it.

    I use this to graph HTTP requests and ignore those which relate to
    advertising, but it could be used to implement other code too.

    Also add WWW::Adblock::RegexFilter at the same time if possible,
    which is part of the implementation.

    Current code here: http://github.com/edeca/WWW-Adblock (a 0.01
    release is tagged)

  enteredby:   EDECA (David Cannings)
  enteredon:   Sat Jul  3 18:13:41 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Adblock         bdpOp A simple implementation of Adblock Plus      EDECA
