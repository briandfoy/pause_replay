If you wish to get further approval for it, feel free.

As I am locked out of communicating with that group by it's
protector/leader Ricardo, such a requirement for me is equivalent
to banning contributions.ures on that
list all being met by resistance, but in nearly all cases (assuming
I wasn't given a clue stick -- which happened on occasion), I was
told it wouldn't be done unless I wanted to submit a patch for it.

In the case of this module, I was told to try it out on CPAN first.

The name was designed to be simple  and easy to use and remember.

Complicating it would defeat the purposes.

Other people have asked for the source and the ability to examine
what it does -- as I have used it in programs and examples.

Even the module P.pm uses 'mem' -- which I had to code around due
to it not yet being present.

Personally, I would take the position of permission being granted
by exemption -- as I'm exempted from communication with the p5p list
for personal reasons only fully understood by Ricardo, but if you wish
to lobby in my stead, I wouldn't be against such, but if you make
it clear that it is my idea, it will be unlikely to be given objective
or rational consideration.
