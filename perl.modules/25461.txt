The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GoogleHack
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: GoogleHack tool kit
  userid:      PRATH (Pratheepan Raveendranathan)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  rationale:

    Google-Hack is a Perl package that does a number of interesting
    things using the Google API. The package interacts with Google,
    retrives query results, and has the ability to do basic Natural
    Language Processing. To The idea behind this package is basically to
    be able to use the web as a source for doing natural language
    processing. Currently the package uses google as the source to the
    web, and can predict the semantic orientation of paragraphs, and the
    relatedness between two words etc. This in turn allows others
    interested in using the web as a source for NLP to have access to
    functions that do the simple act of retrieving measures, doing
    queries etc.

    The namespace Google-hack was chosen, since we are using the Google
    API, and we are performing two tasks. One, we are allowing the user
    to use the basic API functions in an easy to use format. Two, we are
    allowing a little bit more interesting applications of the Google
    API.

    The package is at its early stages, but is in a form ready to be
    released, but is still under active development and testing. For
    more information on the package, and to download its current
    version:

    http://google-hack.sourceforge.net

    Since the package is written in PERL we beleive that it is
    important to release it via CPAN.
