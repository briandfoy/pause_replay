Well it is an odd place, but if the docs are in POD form, and if they
are installable using "perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make
install" and then viewable using "perldoc US_DID::Whatever" then I
don't see any harm in it.

I haven't seen the content of these modules so I don't know if that's
how they work or not, but they should work that way if they don't.
