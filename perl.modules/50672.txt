Hi Ankur

You might want to have a look at Module::Starter.

You can give it the basic information (name etc) of your module, and it 
will lay out the correct structure of a skeleton distribution for you, 
set up for your module name etc.

Then just move the functionality from the code you already have into 
this skeleton, and it should be ready to be packaged up.
