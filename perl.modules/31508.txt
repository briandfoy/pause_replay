Sorry, I posted this to the newsgroup instead of modules@perl.org, which 
seems to be the more official destination.

As I mentioned in the original post, this module is a file I/O plugin,
driver, or whatever. I think it makes a lot of sense to group all such
drivers together, so I suggested Chemistry::File. A viable synonym
would be Chemistry::IO. One could say that it is more sensible from
the taxonomic point of view to label it Chemistry::Mol::File::SMILES
or something like that, since this module is designed to work with
Chemistry::Mol. It's just that the idea of having to type four-level
module names seems oddly uncomfortable.

If what worries you is that I seem to be polluting (or taking over?)
the Chemistry:: namespace by growing the taxonomy sideways instead of
in a more nested way, perhaps I can suggest the following
alternative...

How about placing all my Chemistry-related modules in the top-level
PerlMol:: namespace? I didn't do that in the first place because the
guidelines strongly discouraged suggesting top-level namespaces, but
since now I'm developing the modules under what I called the "PerlMol
project", ( http://www.perlmol.org ),  maybe an independent namespace
is warranted? I wouldn't like Chemistry::PerlMol again because it
would be too much typing.

[Added note: now I'm not so sure about the previous paragraph. Some 
material has already been published using the Chemistry:: namespace and 
it would be really a pain for everyone to change it all.]
