Hello, CPAN librarians.

I and several others who depend on Text::ScriptTemplate have tried to 
contact the author over many years to no avail, as you can see below from 
the bounce and other messages without a response.

There are a couple of patches that fix problems with it. I'm ready to do a 
release if I can be allowed to in PAUSE. My username is JONJ.

Can someone please authorize that for me?

Thanks,
Jon

Taisuke,

I've been trying to get in touch with you for quite a while -- see below! 
I'm still interested in taking over maintenance of Text::ScriptTemplate 
and realized I hadn't yet tried emailing your taiy@cpan.org address.

We are still using it and would love to keep it current.

Thank you again for creating it, and thanks in advance for any reply!

Jon

Taisuke,

I'm still interested in taking over maintenance of Text::ScriptTemplate 
and found this email address for you in your Audio::SoundFile module on 
CPAN.

We are still using it and would love to keep it current.

Thank you again for creating it, and thanks in advance for any reply!

Taisuke,

I wrote to you over 7 years ago as copied below! And I'm still interested 
in the Text::ScriptTemplate module. I wanted to see if you would mind if I 
take over maintenance of the module on CPAN. We use it on some systems and 
would like to keep it current.

Thank you in advance for any reply.

Jon

Subject: Text::ScriptTemplate patches

Taisuke,

Thank you very much for releasing your excellent CPAN module 
Text::ScriptTemplate! It does exactly what we needed and no more, and is 
well-written and documented. It works much better for us than heavier 
solutions like Embperl, Mason, or Template Toolkit.

I have added a couple of features to our copy:

(1) Add support for <% ... -%> and <%= ... -%> like Ruby on Rails' ERuby. 
It strips the trailing newline if any.

(2) Added caching of the prepared code on disk, for faster speed. The Perl 
code can be slurped in, compiled, and run, without having to parse the 
template every time.

(3) A couple of minor tweaks to initializer and documentation.

Are you interested in taking a look at the patch and considering it for 
the CPAN module? If so, please let me know and I'll send it.

Thanks again!

Jon
