I like this. It's a pity that producers of CDs need to contact
everybody again and again. I still have your previous proposal that
was more elaborated:

     By uploading material to the PAUSE, the material will
     instantaneously become a part of the CPAN, a vast collection of
     software and other information. It will be distributed to
     hundreds of ftp servers all over the world and it will be
     included in other distribution channels like books and CD-ROMs as
     well. Once uploaded, it will not be possible to stop the material
     from being distributed.

     Therefore, by uploading, you declare that you have the right to
     distribute the material freely and unlimited, and that everyone
     may redistribute the material likewise, in combination with the
     whole of CPAN, or any subset thereof. You may restrict the use of
     the material by copyrights or licenses, but the distribution of
     the material in the unmodified format it was uploaded to PAUSE
     may not be resticted in any way. In the case you do want to apply
     restrictions to the use of the material, we urge you to use a
     certified Open Source licenses, see <URL>.

Does anybody have additions, correction, preferences? Jon, could you
once again get a US lawyer's opinion on this? I mean, it's still a
delicate idea that needs careful consideration: I think of the guy who
erroneously uploads material that is not under his full control and
when he realizes that this is the case he suddenly is in a precarious
position...
