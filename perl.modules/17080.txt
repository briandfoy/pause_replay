The script is CPAN.pm, used by anyone installing stuff from the CPAN.

The version number of 1.02 is found at line 40 of
XML/Filter/Dispatcher/Parser.pm.

I see that it's a generated file, and that "package
Parse::Yapp::Driver" apepars before the VERSION string.  I don't know
what you have to do to do it differently, but it needs to get fixed.

The usual "version retrograde" problem.  CPAN.pm says to upgrade,
so I upgrade.  Then it says to upgrade to the older distro, so I upgrade.
Then it says to upgrade to the newer distro... so I upgrade... again.

Endless loop.
