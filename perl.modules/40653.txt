A Grid:: root namespace does seem appropriate, and is probably the right 
thing to do.

However, as a new module space, I'd like to see major component 
available as it's own distro. Branded collections of functionality tend 
to be not supported as well a encapsulated components of functionality.

The problem can be that people may want to use only some parts to built 
things in directions you don't initially expect, and this can be hard if 
they have to buy into your specific direction of thinking.

This has caused problems with modules like Workflow.pm, which is great 
but requires you use Workflow's logging and data persistence mechanisms.

Would it be possibly to break out and isolate some of the major pieces, 
and then provide something like a Bundle::Grid or Bundle::GridPerls for 
people that want the entire collection?

Looking at the GGF website, you may well end up with either modules 
named after particular services, or perhaps things like Grid::GFD48 to 
implement particular concepts?

It looks like there's a hell of a lot of things that could be 
implemented, so breaking them out should help you avoid dependency bloat 
(having one big module that spans a lot of functionality and requires 
the installation of half of CPAN :)
