Dear Patrice, dear Paolo,

Patrice, please have a look at the following mail from Paolo. He'd like 
to contribute to your Net::Frame::Layer::ICMPv6 module on CPAN. Would 
you be interested in a cooperation? Would you like Paolo to do a release 
(including indexing by PAUSE) for you? Please get back to us with at 
least a short message.

Paolo, given that Patrice's most recent release to CPAN is just two 
months back, he might be generally available but simply busy.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
