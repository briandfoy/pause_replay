The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Thread::IID
  DSLIP:       adcfp
  description: unique Interpreter IDs
  userid:      WROG (Roger Crew)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    An IID (Interpreter ID) identifies/distinguishes PerlInterpreter
    objects.

    This will be of interest to people working in multithreaded
    environments who think they need Thread IDs but are dealing with,
    say, mod_perl2 under MPM-Worker where thread IDs are essentially
    useless (since perl interpreters are cloned, stuffed into a pool,
    and repeatedly assigned/re-assigned to different threads as needed)
    and what they really need are Interpreter IDs

  enteredby:   WROG (Roger Crew)
  enteredon:   Fri Dec  2 20:33:21 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Thread::
::IID             adcfp unique Interpreter IDs                       WROG
