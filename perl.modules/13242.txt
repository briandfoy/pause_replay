The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LaBrea::Tarpit
  DSLIP:       Mdpfg
  description: Interface modules for LaBrea scanner buster
  userid:      MIKER (Michael Robinton)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    has received some "print" press coverage http://www.hackbusters.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    The name space is much like that for Jabber. It is single purpose
    with no likelihood of fitting into or duplicating the name. I have
    no strong feelings about it. It has been in the public domain for
    some time and it is a convenience issue. It would be very
    inconvenient for current users with scripts in place if the
    namespace needed to change because of CPAN requirements. I've
    uploaded the most recent release to my author space (MIKER) where I
    guess it will sit pending resolution of this question.
