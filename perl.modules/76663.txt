That's fine. AS much as I would love to keep up on this, I have to admit
that my time is scarce these days. Thanks for taking this on.

There is a sourceforge project for this at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-openssl/; it would be nice to continue
using that for continuity. If you let me know your sourceforge id, I'll add
you to the project.

Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA isn&#39;t working with perl&gt; 5.13.9. There is a 4<br>
