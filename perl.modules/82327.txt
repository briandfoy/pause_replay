Many of those tickets are for feature requests of varying merit.

I plan to retain control of this module for the time being, since it
is a deep dependency for much of my other work.

I'm happy to give you commit on the SVN repository for the time being
to facilitate bug fixes.

That aside, please note it is customary to contact authors a couple of
times over a period of time (a week is generally a reasonable
timeframe) so that they have a chance to respond with due
consideration or to allow their return from short journeys without
easy internet access.
