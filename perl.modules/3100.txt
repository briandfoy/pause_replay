I submitted a new module-list add request for adding Sendmail::Milter to
the module list on July 13th, now over 3 Months ago.

Is there a hold up with registering new modules in the module list? A few
of the maintainers I've talked to said they're very busy. Is there a way
to offload the approval process for new modules to other Perl community
maintainers?

Best,

Charles Ying

Sendmail::Milter provides users with the ability to write mail filters in
Perl that tightly integrate with sendmail's mail filter API.

Sendmail::Milter   bdch   Write mail filters for sendmail in Perl      CYING


This module has been discussed briefly on comp.mail.sendmail, and in the
user mailing lists. The home page for this project is:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/sendmail-milter/

Full POD documentation and distribution are all available from that
location.

Sendmail::Milter is also readily available from PAUSE, the latest is:

	C/CY/CYING/Sendmail-Milter-0.16.tar.gz

Extended description:
---------------------
Sendmail::Milter provides users with the ability to write mail filters in
Perl that tightly integrate with sendmail. These mail filters are able to
perform operations based on every step of the SMTP negotiation process,
and can perform operations on message headers and message bodies, such as
scanning and filtering mail attachments, checking for and replacing
headers, adding / removing envelope recipients, and so on.

Mail filters written with this module define and register perl callbacks
with the main engine. Sendmail::Milter calls these perl callbacks using a
threaded persistent interpreter pool. (Similar to mod_perl 2.0) Milter
contexts are presented using an object-oriented style interface for
performing operations on a Milter context.
