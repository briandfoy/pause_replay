The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Ex
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Extended CGI validation, fill, and utilities
  userid:      RHANDOM (Paul T. Seamons)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Extensive in company use and discussion

  similar:
    HTML::FillInForm, CGI::Validate, borrows (replace in some cases but
    usually borrows) functionality from many

  rationale:

    CGI::Ex is intended as an extended suite of extensions for normal
    CGI execution. Included are validators and form fillers and conf
    reader wrappers (doesn't actually have a reader of its own) and
    extentions to CGI style objects.

    Most of the functionality included in this module has been used for
    several years in house at a fairly large perl shop.

    As for uniqueness - there may be little. CGI/Ex.pm provides useful
    extensions to CGI.pm (or similiar modules). CGI/Ex/Validate.pm
    provides more powerful validation of cgi parameters than in other
    similar modules (nested tests, conditional validation, and grouping)
    as well as nearly duplicate javascript validation that works on all
    current major browsers. CGI/Ex/Fill.pm is fairly similar to
    HTML::FillInForm with a few additions, the most significant being a
    tremendous speed improvement (CGI::Ex can be set to use
    HTML::FillInForm instead of CGI::Ex::Fill). CGI/Ex/Conf.pm is a
    wrapper around the various methods of reading settings files
    (storable, perl, yaml, inihash, xml) with a common interface and the
    option of preloading files at server start time in a mod_perl
    environment.

    All of this is put through a common interface in CGI::Ex which
    allows for and easier gateway to common used functions.

The resulting entry would be:
