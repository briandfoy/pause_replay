I can't even remember who's on the list. As for roles, we don't have any.
It's a forum to discuss naming issues, which are often subtle and difficult.

I agree that it should be made more transparent. 04pause.html and other
docs could usefully be expanded.

The modules@perl.org group is, like the rest of the community, a
volunteer effort. Sometimes messages 'fall through the cracks'.
We tend to rely on authors badgering us into action (or submission :-).

Sometimes on difficult naming discussions people just run out of energy.
If that happens it's sometimes best to start over with a fresh proposal
that tries to address whatever issues have been raised so far.

Err, I hope that's helped.

Tim.
