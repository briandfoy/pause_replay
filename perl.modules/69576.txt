Hello Adriano,

I know you are very busy, so I'd like to offer to be co-maintainer.

I'd be happy to run things past you and co-ordinate with p5p as needed  
before uploading. That'd save you the time of having to investigate or  
code for the various RTs. My PAUSE id is DMUEY.

I also wanted to remind you of these five RTs that I submitted 6  
months ago that improve Locale::Maketext's efficiency and usability.

Each RT includes a complete (i.e. Changelog, code, POD, tests, etc)  
patch for easy review and a tarball that is pause-upload ready. All  
tests pass and existing uses are unaffected (except that they'll get a  
speed/memory efficiency increase).

The version is bumped each time starting at the current development  
release (1.13_82) and go from 1.13_83 -> 1.13_87
