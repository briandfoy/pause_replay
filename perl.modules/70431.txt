Todd's been going round adopting lots of older modules with the help of the
perl core team (i.e. perl5-porters@perl.org).

He has the active support of the community in doing so, and plenty of people
able to help ensure he gets it right.

Todd, how about if you upload a fixed up Stty as a dev release (which therefore
needs no permissions) and then Austin can look at the tarball and the cpan
testers reports to confirm you're as good as we say before he hands you
the relevant pause permissions?

Austin, does that sound like a reasonable compromise?
