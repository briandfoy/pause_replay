The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::AlignmentSet
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: handle a word-aligned bilingual corpus
  userid:      PLAMBERT (Patrik Lambert)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a module for natural language processing, so I thought the
    best place would be in the Lingua namespace. The name AlignmentSet
    is a description of what it is. I havent't seen anything comparable
    in the module list. Although it is a library on a very specialized
    subject, I think it's worth having it on the module list it groups
    some of the methods standard in the field. It can help people new to
    the field. Furthermore, being in the module list, it can get
    contributions from other people. I think the only reason to reject
    it would be because the field is too specialized.

  enteredby:   PLAMBERT (Patrik Lambert)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun  7 14:09:46 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
::AlignmentSet    RdpOg handle a word-aligned bilingual corpus       PLAMBERT
