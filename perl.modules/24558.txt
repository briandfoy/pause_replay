Good day,

I am planing on releasing Palm::Ztxt_XS on CPAN. Palm::Ztxt_XS is an XS
interface to the ztxt library used with the weasel book reader
(http://gutenpalm.sourceforge.net/).  There is a similar module
Palm::ZText (not on CPAN) linked to from the gutenpalm website; however, 
1. It does not follow the C api, 2. is not as complete as the C api, and  
3. I am planing on using this to generate ztexts on the fly from mod_perl, 
so I'd like a slightly leaner implementation.


Rudy
