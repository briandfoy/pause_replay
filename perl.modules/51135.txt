Hi all,

   I've written a small proof-of-concept module about global variables. It
usage would be much in the spirit of 'use vars', but the generated
symbols would be global variables aliasing some fixed variables instead
of items different for each package. A little SYNOPSIS is probably
better than my words so far:

    # In the place/package where we want to create globals
    use vars::global create => qw( $foo @bar %baz );

    # Add some more global symbols
    vars::global->create(qw( $hello @world %now ));

    # Somewhere else, where we need to access those globals
    use vars::global qw( $foo @bar %baz );

    # Don't try to use globals that do not exist
    use vars::global qw( $Foo ); # typo, croaks
    use vars::global qw( @inexistent ); # we don't create by default
                                        # use 'create' as above

    # You can also import and create new globals
    use vars::global qw( $foo %baz ), create => qw( $hey @joe );

    # If you're lazy, you can import all the globals defined so far
    use vars::global ':all';

As you can see, I'm inclined to call this module 'vars::global'. A couple
of questions:

* I'm not sure I'm going to apply for a registration of this namespace. Is
it a problem if I upload the module anyway? (I've understood that there
should be no problem)

* what do you think about the name?

Thank you in advance and best regards,

   Flavio.
