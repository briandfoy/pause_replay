The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::IP2Location
  DSLIP:       Rdprp
  description: Lookup of geographical info by IP address
  userid:      LOCATION (K.L. LIEW)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module, Geo::IP2Location, provides fast lookup of country,
    region, city, latitude, longitude, ISP and domain name from IP
    address by using IP2Location database.

    This module bundled with one sample IP-COUNTRY binary database.
    Meanwhile, other databases are available to download from website
    http://www.ip2location.com/perl.htm.

    This module was written in Perl and optimized for fast query and
    memory utilization. The development has been completed and we would
    like to publish it for general public usage.

    - K.L. Liew

  enteredby:   LOCATION (K.L. LIEW)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun 22 06:03:46 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::IP2Location     Rdprp Lookup of geographical info by IP address    LOCATION
