Hi,

Three of my modules have disappeared from CPAN.

Sort::ArrayofArrays
Data::Fallback
Log::Delimited

The other module I wrote,

File::CacheDir

Shows up on my author page

http://search.cpan.org/author/EARL/

but no longer shows up in searches.  I have seen each
of the above show up in searches.

All my uploaded tar balls are still there 

http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/E/EA/EARL/

But they don't show up anywhere else that I can see. 
I have at least a few people that use my stuff and
would like it to stay up.

A reply would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Earl
