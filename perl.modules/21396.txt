Hello Tim, and thanks for your reply.  It was very helpful.  (And also
thanks for replying both to me and the module list, which in the past some
people didn't do.)

Those are good suggestions, and look better than most of mine.

Nice to hear.

This sounds good and I'm inclined to agree.  But its weighty enough
that a third opinion *might* be helpful.  So if anyone else can chime in
and agree then I'm sold.  (Then the next task will be figuring out what
parts of my unified documentation to move over to the separate distro.)

You're probably right.  These modules would certainly be a lot *simpler*
than the previously mentioned ones, which people seem to like.  But the
question remains whether this separate distro contains all the user
strings (a pre-defined set of common database error messages) or simply
contain the method to fetch and interpolate variables into Perl anonymous
hash files.  I suspect the former because the latter might be so simple
there isn't worth being a module for it.

So maybe I'll try there soon.

Just FYI:  On a side note, I did send a different but related question to
the poop-group@lists.sourceforge.net list, which I also subscribed to,
since this seems to be made up mostly of database module developers.

Thanks again. -- Darren Duncan
