     why:

    At TripAdvisor, we have written several tools and libraries in Perl
    that we would like to share as FOSS on the CPAN.

    Most of this code is centered around Hadoop and Hive, and our first
    release will be a web interface to Hive that we actually developed
    as a prototype/proof-of-concept for functionality and ease-of-use
    that we couldn't find elsewhere, even commercially!
