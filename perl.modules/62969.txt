I was just going to give Greg co-maintenance permissions for 
Net::SSH::Perl::AuthMgr as he has received permissions for all the other 
Net::SSH::Perl components from the previous maintainers already.

However, there is currently nobody who is primary maintainer of that 
module. I guess it's up to Andreas to fix this? Anything I could do?

Best regards,
Steffen
