Hi, Scott.  Since WDDX.pm needs some updates, and since you "no longer 
do computer work" per scripted.com, I'd like to take it over.  I've 
been using it the past few years for some ColdFusion interface stuff, 
but it doesn't behave well under the latest Perls.  I've made the 
updates for a 1.02 release already, and just need your goahead.

Is that OK with you?

Thanks,
Andy
