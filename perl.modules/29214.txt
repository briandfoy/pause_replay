The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Speech::Flite
  DSLIP:       cdcfg
  description: Simple text-to-speech using Flite.
  userid:      DKING (Duane King)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    .Most likely the blind computer user discussion newsgroups.

  similar:
    Speech::Festival::Synthesiser

  rationale:

    The flite implantation has much in common with the festival speech
    synthesizer due to the fact that flite is a derivative of festival
    that has been recoded for smaller size and speed; Due to festivals
    large size and speed needs some systems (like the 200mhz p1 I am
    using as my only computer) can not handle it and thus flite fills
    the gap; As such its only fair that it has its own module under
    ‘Speech’ as its not only faster, smaller, and easier to
    use, but provides a greater user base to perl itself since it is
    something that is currently not supported.

    It is only logical, at least to me, that it have its own module and
    that is why I would like to make sure there is a namespace for it
    when I upload my first alpha version of the module, Currently I am
    going over the flite documentation in the hopes of adding more
    functionality to it and to weed out possible bugs, as well as going
    over perl documentation so things are compliant.

The resulting entry would be:

Speech::
::Flite           cdcfg Simple text-to-speech using Flite.           DKING
