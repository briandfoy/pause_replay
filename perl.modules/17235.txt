    Opposed.  To put it bluntly, and only in my humble opinion, we have a
worsening problem of too much mislabelled crap on CPAN, not on too long
a backlog on module registations.  I think that the purpose of CPAN is
to make it easier for module users to find what they're looking for, not
to make module authors feel warm and fuzzy about having their modules
listed on a prominent web page.
