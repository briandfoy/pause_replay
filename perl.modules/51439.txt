Hi CPANers


Bioperl (www.bioperl.org) is a collaborative project which currently
has me as the person uploading to CPAN. this is inappropriate and
not scaleable, and in dicussions we've realised that we'd like an
APML-style "joint" account, rather than working through me.


My understanding of this is that:

    - we request to set up an APML style mailing list accoutn
for Bioperl, presumably called Bioperl. The Bioperl packages would
be owned by that account


    - Sendu Bala, cc'd here, will soon be getting a PAUSE account
and should be made maintainence role for the account.


Let me know if you need any more information from me.
