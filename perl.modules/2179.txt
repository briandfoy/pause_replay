I have written two modules that I would like to post on CPAN.  Here is my
info:

Name:	Thomas J. Mather
Email:	tjmather@alumni.princeton.edu
Homepage:	http://www.thoughtstore.com/~tjmather/
Preferred CPAN userID:	TJMATHER
Description:
	DBIx::FullTextSearch - Indexing documents with MySQL as
storage.  Indexes databases, files, and URLs.  Includes support for
phrases, required words, and stop words.  This was originally named
MyConText by Jan Pazdziora.
	HTML::FillInForm - Populates HTML Forms with CGI data.  Populates HTML
Forms with CGI (or other) data.  One useful application is after a user
submits an HTML form without filling out required field.  HTML::FillInForm
can be used to redisplay the HTML form with all the form elements
containing the submitted info.

DSLI:
Name			DSLI	Description				Info
----------------------  ----	--------------------------------------  -------
DBIx::FullTextSearch	bdpO	Indexing documents with MySQL		TJMATHER
HTML::FillInForm	adpO	Populates HTML Forms with CGI data	TJMATHER

Discussions:
	I have publicly posted the distributions on my web page:
http://www.thoughtstore.com/~tjmather/perl/

	I have announced HTML::FillInForm on htmltmpl@lists.vm.com, a list
for discussing HTML::Template.  There was a discussion on this list
regarding a need for this type of module.  I have contacted the Sam
Tregar, the author of HTML::Template, to ask him if this should be
integrated into HTML::Template, but he thought that it should be a
stand-alone module, since filling in HTML Form values is beyond the scope
of HTML::Template.
