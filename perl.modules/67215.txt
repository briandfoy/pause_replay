Well, I've seen a mail from Jeremiah on the debian-perl list *today*. 
That means he's hardly unreachable. PAUSE admins come in only if an 
author is malicious or unreachable. Please try to figure this out 
between yourselves: If Jeremiah is the primary maintainer, he can use 
pause.perl.org to give all of you co-maintenance for the namespaces in 
question. If you have any trouble, don't hesitate to let us know.

The rationale for not getting involved unless absolutely necessary is 
spelled out here: http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
