Request to register new user

fullname: Lawrence Murray
  userid: LAWMURRAY
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.libbi.org
     why:

    I would like to contribute a software package called LibBi to CPAN.
    This will, I hope, allow users to install it more easily from a
    variety of platforms. More information on the package is available
    at www.libbi.org.

    LibBi is statistical/scientific software for fitting models to data
    using Monte Carlo methods. It is free and open source. The main
    program is written in Perl (as a number of modules). It parses a
    domain-specific language, then generates, compiles and runs C++ code
    to do the bulk of the work.
