     why:

    I've completed work on a module to clean HTML of any
    vulnerabilites; the module is quite flexible and tested with a lot
    of XSS attack vectors. This is what I'm planning to contribute
    immediately.

    In future, I hope I will be able to contribute something else that
    can scratch some other itch(and ofcourse, as time permits).
