Hi Eric & Mons,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving =
conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

Eric (ASG) has ownership of the namespace =E2=80=9CLvalue=E2=80=9D, with =
the Lvalue module being on CPAN in the Lvalue distribution. And Mons has =
ownership of =E2=80=9Clvalue=E2=80=9D, which is on CPAN in the lvalue =
distribution.

These two packages are now considered the same by PAUSE when looking at =
permissions, which means there=E2=80=99s a conflict with your dual =
ownership, which means that any releases you do now won=E2=80=99t be =
indexed.

There are at least two ways we can resolve this:

  1. One of you could rename your module and distribution.
     Eg Mons, you could switch to Sub::lvalue, or Attribute::lvalue

  2. You could delete one of your distributions from CPAN. I can do this =
for you.
     Eg Eric, I notice that your distribution doesn=E2=80=99t install on =
any Perl since 5.17.1
         http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=3DLvalue

How would you like to progress?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more; I=E2=80=99m=
 working on resolving the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
