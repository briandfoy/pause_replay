The main syntax of C++ and C is the same, although C++ has a few more
keywords.  But programming C++ is quite different from programming C.
How you use a language is (IMHO) more important that the exact syntax.
The use of OODoc differs a lot from the use of POD.

The reason to have some commonality with POD are simple: you can run
these scripts, because Perl skips these lines.  It is also easier for
people to convert their documentation.

That's one good point for POD::OO.  That's probably the reason that C++
is named that way: to hide the huge step they where actually making away
from C.  It may work better from a sales point of view, in the beginning,
but outsiders always ask: "you are a C programmer, can you debug my C++
program?".

The choice is: do I want to lure people into my module as well?  I don't
think that commercially.  I am not strongly against POD::OO, but its not
my prefered choice.
