The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::TagTemplate
  DSLIP:       Mdphl
  description: Replace tags in template generated content
  userid:      MATISSE (Matisse Enzer)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Was discussed in mailing list back in 2000 when originally released

  similar:
    Text::SimpleTemplate Text::BasicTemplate Apache::TagRegistry

  rationale:

    Somehow the registration for this namespace was lost or never
    approved - it was originally made in 2000 and has been used in many
    places since then, so this is a re-application to register the
    namespace. The module has been on CPAN since 2000 I think.

    The module is another template processing module with a somewhat
    unique feature that makes it very easy to associate tag names with
    arbitrary Perl subroutines.

    The module looks for HTML-like tags whose names begin with "#":

    <#TAGNAME attribute1 attribute2="value" attribute3="blah blah">

    Tags may be be nested:

    <#TAG1 value="<#TAG2 attribute="foo">">

    Tag names can be tied to a string or to a CODE reference.

    When the parser encounters a registered tag name that is tied to a
    CODE reference it excutes the subroutine passing the name/value
    pairs of the tag attributes to the subroutine and replaces the tag
    in the output with whatever the subroutine returns.

    Because the parser passes the attributes to the subroutine it is
    fairly easy for the template writer to pass data to the subroutine
    that generates the content.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
