Initially, the module author adds a list of keywords to the pod doc. In
addition a KWIC approach would generate more---it is hard to 'over' cross

reviews as well.

Certainly search.cpan.org is of value, no argument there. I just hesitate to
remove something unless it is of no value or is actively doing harm...
