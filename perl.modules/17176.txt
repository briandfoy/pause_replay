Randal --

OK.

I didn't realize the problem was spread so far throughout the code. I've
scheduled all versions of the Perl Shell prior to 1.0 to be deleted
from CPAN (PAUSE says its scheduled to happen on Tuesday).

I'll remove any remaining cases where VERSION is based on the
CVS info sometime soon and make another release (which I expect
to result in the need to remove all other versions from CPAN, too.


Regards,

-- Gregor

Nope, after installing 1.7, here's the retrograde still being
reported:

    cpan> r /Psh/

    Package namespace         installed    latest  in CPAN file
    Psh::Completion               undef      1.38 
G/GR/GREGOR/psh-0.009.tar.gz

It wants me to upgrade Psh::Completion from "not installed" to "1.38" by
installing 0.009.tar.gz.  Do you really want me to do that?  I don't
think so. :(

One way to cure the retrograde is to *delete* *all* *old* versions
from the CPAN.  There's always the BackPAN, after all.
