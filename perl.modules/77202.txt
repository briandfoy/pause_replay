The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Versioned
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Versioned access to configuration data
  userid:      MRSCOTTY (Scott T. Hardin)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)

    ABOUT THE MODULE:

    Config::Versioned allows an application to access configuration
    parameters not only by parameter name, but also by version number.
    This allows for the configuration subsystem to store previous
    versions of the configuration parameters. When requesting the value
    for a specific attribute, the programmer specifies whether to fetch
    the most recent value or a previous value.

    This is useful for long-running tasks such as in a workflow-based
    application where task-specific values (e.g.: profiles) are static
    over the life of a workflow, while global values (e.g.: name of an
    LDAP server to be queried) should always be the most recent.

    Config::Versioned handles the versions by storing the configuration
    data in an internal Git repository. Each import of configuration
    files into the repository is documented with a commit. When a value
    is fetched, it is this commit that is referenced directly when
    specifying the version.

    The access to the individual attributes is via a named-parameter
    scheme, where the key is a dot-separated string.

    Currently, C<Config::Std> is used for the import of the data files
    into the internal Git repository. Support for other configuration
    modules (e.g.: C<Config::Any>) is planned.

    ABOUT THE NAMING CHOICE:

    I chose "Config::Versioned" because, obviously, it is a module for
    accessing configuration parameters and fits well with the other
    "Config::*" modules. The "Versioned" highlights the primary focus of
    this module: to allow multiple versions of a configuration data set
    to be accessed from within the application. I also wanted to avoid
    "Version" without the "-ed" suffix because that could be confused
    with $VERSION, which is used to store the version number of a module
    itself.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
