Hi,

I have written an OO API to the commercial product called Electric 
Commander. They have their own module called ElectricCommander and the 
objects in my API has it as a member.

I named my module Ec with ElectricCommander as one of the required 
prerequisites.

I have also requested a user ID on PAUSE.

Please share your opinion as to naming the module, I think Ec will be 
too short and not descriptive enough.
