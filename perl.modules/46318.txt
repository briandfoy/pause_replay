Rejecting for a root namespace.

"TagLib" has quite specific meanings in areas other than audio. For 
example, HTML/XML "TagLib" is a known technology, and I certainly was 
expecting an XML taglib module based only on the name in the subject.

There's a high potential for confusion with this name.

If you can handle all audio tags, you might want to look at something 
like Audio::Tag, which is currently free and seems much more appropriate.
