I wouldn't object either namespace, I'm just trying to come up with
alternatives that might fall into place.

An alternative for Joystick could be Device::Joystick. An alternative
for Robotics is more difficult to find, but from your description
above one might get the impression, it is device oriented as well, so
maybe one could argue it should be named Device::Netmedia::Something
or Netmedia::Something. After all, we must expect lots of robotics
tools and if perl is playing a role in that marketplace, we should
avoid to use the Robotics namespace for a single manufacturer's
boards.

Just my 2 paragraphs;)
