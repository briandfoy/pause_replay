How about this?

1) Create a dummy user account and give all existing module authors 
co-author rights (for added points, script it to be automatic);

2) Create a single module name unlikely to be ever used for a legitimate 
module and assign it to that dummy account with an undef version (so 
that anything can replace it);

3) Run a purge script that deletes any newer version of that module just 
prior to generating the index files for transmission to the mirrors;

4) <slashdot>Profit!</slashdot>

#1 and #2 would allow anyone to upload that one module, with whatever 
contents they wanted, and generate the PAUSE index e-mail.  #3 would 
ensure that this information would never go anywhere else.

Too tricksy?
