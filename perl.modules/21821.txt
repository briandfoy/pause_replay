The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nagios::WebTransact
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Class to simplify Nagios web service checks
  userid:      HOPCROFTS (Stanley Hopcroft)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lan.perl.modules, email with Sean M Burke and Tim Bunce.

  similar:
    Not in intent, practically however WWW::Automate and WWW::Mechanise
    probably do.

  rationale:

    Ladies and Gentlemen,

    Quite frankly, this module is weak.

    However, it helps me get my job done in accelerating the generation
    of Nagios service checks of Web front ends to search engines, data
    bases and the like (web interfaces that consist of a sequence of
    fill out forms, where success is recognised by a pattern match at
    the final response).

    If WWW::Mechanize and ::Automate had been written when this was
    done, it would probably not exist.

    However, it does have or did some unique features in storing
    pattern matches and making it possible to incorporate the match
    result - by callback - in the next forms query string.

    Trash the module if you will, but please register the namespace
    since others want to use it.

    As for the name space, this module is intended to be one of a
    series that add value to the Nagios service monitor. Nagios is a
    popular service monitor that schedules service checks and responds
    to their results. It features a Perl interpeter built in for
    accelerating Perl checks and because it is written in C, there are
    many ooportunities for Perl developers to add value.

    Patrick LeBoutier for example has written a module to read and make
    available the Nagios configuration for other applications.

    Thank you,

    Yours sincerely.
