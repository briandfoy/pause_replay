The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       define
  DSLIP:       Rdppp
  description: Use this pragma to define global constants
  userid:      GGUREVICH (Gary Gurevich)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    constant.pm: declares constants, but they are not global

  rationale:

    define.pm can be thought of as doing exactly the same thing as
    constant.pm, but with global scope. Alternatively, you can think of
    it as a Perlish version of C's #define directive.

    The original motivation for the define pragma was to get
    compile-time constant optimizations on a global basis for debugging
    statements. Since one usually desires to enable or disable
    compilation of debugging statements for the entire program, the need
    for a globally accessible constant was indicated.

    define.pm can also ensure consistency of values. Unlike
    constant.pm, you canât have two different values for PI in the
    same program with define.pm.

    define.pm also makes it easy to create global objects. For
    instance, things like POEâs kernel could be defined as a global
    constant âKERNELâ, and not need to be passed explicitly as a
    parameter to every handler.

    While the obvious and well-known problems with clashing names
    present themselves, the documentation makes it clear that modules,
    as a rule, should not set their own constants, rather they should
    import constants that are defined in the main body of a program.

The resulting entry would be:
