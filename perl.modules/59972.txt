Subject: Module submission Muldis::Rosetta

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Muldis::Rosetta
  DSLIP:       cmpOl
  description: Full-featured truly relational DBMS in Perl
  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    N/A

  similar:
    N/A

  rationale:

    I am renaming Muldis DB ( http://search.cpan.org/dist/Muldis-DB/ )
    to Muldis Rosetta partly because the shorter name looks too much
    like a separate project, Muldis D. So Muldis D is the name of a
    language that can have multiple implementations, and Muldis Rosetta
    is the reference implementation of said language. Add colons to get
    Perl package names for either's pod/code.

    As for why 'Rosetta' rather than some other word, well its good
    enough on its own, and also I can leverage past mind share since I
    had effectively the same project under that name (where that was the
    whole name rather than half of it) since late 2002/early 2003, and
    then those people don't have to ask "what happened to" questions.

  enteredby:   DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 10 23:43:57 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Muldis::
::Rosetta         cmpOl Full-featured truly relational DBMS in Perl  DUNCAND
