Something seems to still be wrong: I tried the reset at
https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=mailpw
but never got an email; gmail doesn't seem to have marked
it as spam.   I retried the reset in wild desperation
and it told me that a token had been sent in the
last 6 hrs and was still valid.

Perhaps the email address is still wrong,
(should be the one up there ^), or
the old one is cached somewhere?

thanks
bruce
