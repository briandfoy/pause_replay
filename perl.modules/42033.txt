Hello,

I am looking for a namespace suggestion. I am creating a module which 
will interface with a UPB powerline interface module. This is similar to 
X10 and is used to control lights/appliances in a home by using 
powerline communication. There are some existing namespaces which relate 
to X10 (ControlX10::*) where each specific device is given a package in 
the ControlX10 namespace. I was planning on calling this module 
ControlUPB::PIM since it mimics the namespace used for the X10 
technology. PIM is the name of the device which provides a computer 
interface to the powerline (powerline interface module).

Other alternate suggestions?

Thanks,

-jr
