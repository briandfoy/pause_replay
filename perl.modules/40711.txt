Friend,

I just got some earth-shattering news from my webmaster. 

It looks like the urgent, time-sensitive message I sent you last week probably wasn't even delivered to you.

With all these spam filters and what not, who the heck knows what happened. So after talking with my staff about this, we decided the only right thing to do was to give you another chance to join us. Even though it's going to set me back at
least 4 grand...it's the only right thing to do.  So here's the message again below - hope it get through this time!

Lou
________________________________________________________________

It's 11:00 am as I write this to you...I've been sitting here for 20 minutes or so, thinking about a lot of things.

In fact, I've been doing a lot of thinking in the last 4 days about the subject of pre-construction investing...lately it's been the hottest topic in real estate and everyone's dying to find out more because of the insane profits people are making all over the country doing essentially no work...just signing a few pieces of paper!

Heck, just the first 5 weeks of this year I picked up two luxury units in sunny Miami, Florida and I plan on making a bundle real quick.

But you see, there is a trick to this that everyone keeps missing...and that's this...

A lot of developers are offering single family homes as "pre-construction" deals.  Which in fact, they are not deals...they are overpriced. Get this; people are flocking to these small developments hoping to pick up a nice deal and flip it for some quick cash...which in all honesty probably ain't gonna happen because the market isn't primed for that type of selling.

It works good in huge booming cities, where millions of buyers are only few miles away; but in the suburbs, that's a different story. You can do it...but I wouldn't put my money on it unless I could buy it at a discount and have a contact buyer lined up right after I close who's going to pay me full price in a year or so.

That way I make money when I buy, I make a positive cash flow each month, and I get all the tax advantages of owning the house.  NOW we're talkin'!

Now, the only problem with that is...how can you line all that up?

Well, before just recently you probably couldn't unless you were best friends with builders, lenders, realtors, buyers and
title companies and all lawyers involved.

That's a thing of the past, because I teamed up with a company that will do just that for my clients on a limited basis!

And the good news for you, Friend, is I DO have a few spots left! To get the full story and to see how you can benefit from this partnership BIG time, check out

Hope to work with you soon, Friend!

Lou


P.S. You better hurry, because the last time I offered this we were booked out in 2 days!  Check it out NOW!
