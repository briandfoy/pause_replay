Initial contribution
--------------------
webupload
This is a perl script that is specifically designed for the task of
uploading websites. I don't feel i'm reinventing the wheel here, because my
script was designed out of my sheer frustration of having a slow dialup
connection and wanting a quick way to update my website without:
a) having to upload the whole site
b) having to use an interactive ftp program
I added facilities ensure binary files were uploaded as binary, and text as
text(for Win32). Furthermore i wanted to cover other simple tasks like
creating directories and removing files.
There is one script on CPAN which covers a similar area, wcftp.pl, but i
feel that does not provide some of the features that mine does. I hope
someone else will find my script useful.

Best Regards

Sagar
