I can confirm, nobody else has ownership on it:

  grep -i ^dot, /home/ftp/pub/PAUSE/modules/06perms.txt  ==> empty

I can confirm, the file was not listed in the provides field (there was
no provides field).

But the file exists within RSLOVERS/Dot-v1.0.0.tar.gz, path being
Dot-v1.0.0/Dot.pm. And it contains the package and version statements:

  package Dot;
  our $VERSION = v1.0.0;

I retried to run the indexer and got the same result.

May I ask for more eyeballs to suggest a solution?

The only thing that appears really problematic is the use of a v-string
as the version number. This is not recommended practice. I recommend
reading up on that in
http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/

  > Is there any way to solve this problem?

Since I could not fix the issue in the indexer's code, I manually gave
you permissions on the 'Dot' namespace. Please make another upload
attempt with a better $VERSION line and let us know whether it works
now for you.

Regards && Sorry for the inconvenience,
