Hi, I would like to register as a developer on CPAN.

Here is the information you asked for in the 04pause.html on cpan.org

Name: Joe Lauer
Email: joelauer@rootlevel.com
Homepage:
www.simplewire.com will be the homepage for full support of this module and
any other modules that will be created.
CPAN user-ID: ROOTLEVEL
Module List Format:
Name: Net::SimpleWire or Net::Paging or Net::Pager
DSLI: amph
Dscr: Send Numeric/Alpha Pages to any pager/phone

SimpleWire is a global numeric and alphanumeric paging interface via the
Internet. We're bringing you the first and only way to interface any brand
or type of pager through one consistent protocol without using the telephone
network. Our purpose is to define a paging standard and make numerous tools
available for developer's use so paging technology can be better utilized.

The module interacts with SimleWire's Remote Procedure Calls. This new
standard, and subsequently this Perl module, has a great deal of development
energy behind it and will have full development support through an online
support forum. SimpleWire has built-in redundancy to create a fail-safe
system.
