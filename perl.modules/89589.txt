yeah, i decided finally after seeing my public profiles all blank that i
should start giving something back if possible.  DDG was my first shot
there.

i appreciate all suggestions ... i will try and put this up before tomorrow
EOD.  once it is up, then i'd like to re-factor the DDG code to use _it_ in
stead.  that should clean them both up a bit.
