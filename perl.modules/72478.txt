     why:

    I have written a module that makes it easy to align Bio::Seq
    sequences of arbitrary types to each other, as well as to determine
    which residues correspond to which locations in each sequence.

    The code was written for the ePlant project at
    http://bar.utoronto.ca/eplant/, but I think it might be useful to
    others.
