The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sparky
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: support functions for Sparky data collector
  userid:      JLHOLT (Jeffrey Holt)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    I'm aware of none.

  rationale:

    The word Sparky was derived from the company logo which has flames
    over the two 'o's in its name. Over the next few years we plan to
    produce a variety of perl-based programs that address Oracle system
    performance problems. Our initial offering is a breath of fresh air
    for our industry. We hope to reach many customers worldwide with our
    products and believe CPAN is the easiest, most stable platform for
    distributing our code.

    We could, of course, devise a way to tell activestate ppm, and CPAN
    shell to get our code directly from our server but our installation
    instructions (not to mention our server's infrastructure) would
    require more work.

    Most importantly, for us to use CPAN shell (which I believe is an
    excellent way to install modules) and store our modules only on our
    server, I'd have to allow anonomous ftp access to our server. I'm
    not at all comfortable with that option.
