The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Boost::Graph
  DSLIP:       RdhOp
  description: Interface to the Boost Graph C++ Library
  userid:      DBURDICK (David Burdick)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Graph

  rationale:

    The first part, "Boost" is the name of a library with many data
    structures and algorithms. I implemented an interface to a subset of
    these, namely the Graph libraries. Thus, Boost::Graph. Chaining off
    of the "Graph" name space in CPAN seems somewhat confusing as there
    is already a base level "Graph" module.

  enteredby:   DBURDICK (David Burdick)
  enteredon:   Thu May 11 23:54:11 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Boost::
::Graph           RdhOp Interface to the Boost Graph C++ Library     DBURDICK
