     why:

    For now I am planning to only contribute patches/fixes. I am quite
    active as a "spare time" contributor to SlimServer, which uses a lot
    of CPAN modules and often things need to be fixed or improved. A
    registered account might make the communication between me and the
    module developers easier.
