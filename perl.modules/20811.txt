The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EPS
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Creation of Encapsulated Postscript images
  userid:      WIHAA (Wilhelm Haager)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    similar to GD, but produces images as vector graphics

  rationale:

    The package EPS, which allows the easy generation of Encapsulated
    Postscript images, is intended to be a base package for other
    packages like XYplot (which is currently under development) which
    generates various kinds of plots consisting of lines, various
    symbols, bars etc. For that reason the proposal for a root-level
    namespace. (As EPS always produces ENCAPSULATED Postscript Files, it
    would not suite very well into the Postscript-namespace).

    EPS (which is object oriented) has not only a similar functionality
    like GD or Image::Magick (drawing of lines, shapes, text, color
    gradients); beyond that, it can be used as a very general interface
    to the Postscript language: all Postscript commands can be performed
    as an object-method (via AUTOLOAD).

    Contrary to GD and Image::Magick, EPS produces vector graphics,
    which can easily be translated into PDF-Files (using epstopdf).

The resulting entry would be:
