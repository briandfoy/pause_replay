From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

I've give RJBS maint on Time::Piece and modulelist ownership on Time::Seconds.

That way he can make/unmake other co-maints himself.

If you wish I hadn't done that, please say and I'll go back and shift the
ownerships back to you and leave RJBS with just co-maint.
