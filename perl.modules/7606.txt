The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::WorldCanvas
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Canvas with a world coordinate system, zoom
  userid:      SKROVAN (Joseph Skrovan)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Will upload to CPAN soon. I don't know how to advertise it.

  similar:
    Tk::Canvas

  rationale:

    Tk::WorldCanvas is derived from, and inherits the power of
    Tk::Canvas, so 'Canvas' needs to be part of the name. 'World' speaks
    to the flexible (non pixel based) coordinate system that it uses.

    WorldCanvas improves on Canvas by adapting to the user's coordinate
    system instead of requiring the user to adjust to Canvas's pixel
    based widget coordinate system. Several display methods supply
    standard functionality: zoom, viewAll, viewArea, viewFit, center.

    I believe that most people who are using Tk::Canvas now will prefer
    to use Tk::WorldCanvas instead. (IMHO)

    Thanks for your consideration!

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
