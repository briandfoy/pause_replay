The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Quick
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Generate XML from hashes (and other data)
  userid:      ROBN (Robert Norris)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Its a quick-and-dirty XML generation tool, so the name XML::Quick
    seems appropriate.

    As for uniqueness of approach, every other XML generation module
    works hard to make sure the XML it generates is sane and valid, but
    needs more user effort to achieve it. Quick does very little more
    than wrapping the data you pass in with XMLish tags. You might get
    garbage if you pass junk in, but the interface is dead simple.

  enteredby:   ROBN (Robert Norris)
  enteredon:   Sun May 28 02:54:46 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Quick           Rdpfp Generate XML from hashes (and other data)    ROBN
