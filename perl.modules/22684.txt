From: sburke@cpan.org ("Sean M. Burke")

So, at some point a few months ago, I was invited to join the 
modules@perl.org list, and I'm still trying to figure out its ways and 
customs.  So when I ask questions, like here, I'm not asking out of 
Socratic irony, but of authentic puzzlement.

One thing I'm puzzling over is the fairly large amount of traffic from 
PAUSE (as upload@whatever) to modules@perl.org.  The past few days of it 
such messages has involved about four types:
     Subject: User update for *
     Subject: Welcome new user *
     Subject: PAUSE ID request *
     Subject: Module submission *

Are "User update for" messages ever of any interest?
And the others, what are their purposes?
