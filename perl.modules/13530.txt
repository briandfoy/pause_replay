Hi,

I registered the Win32::MSAgent namespace last week. Since the approval 
of my PAUSE Id went so fast, I thought this registration would be 
processed just as fast. But until now I haven't heard anything about it yet.

I presume that since the namespace is not registered yet, this is the 
reason the module can't be found on search.cpan.org yet.

Did I do something wrong with the registration or does this just take 
more time?

Regards,

Jouke Visser
