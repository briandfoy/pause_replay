The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unix::Admin
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Generic interface to Unix admin tasks.
  userid:      BDA (Bryan Allen)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    mailing lists, IRC, CVS

  similar:
    Unix::*File

  rationale:

    After several days of looking, I haven't been able to find a
    module, or group of modules, which offer a standard API for generic
    administrative tasks on UNIX machines.

    e.g., adding a user: Unix::Admin::User->add(\%info); and the
    subclasses determine OS type, how to manage the password
    file/databases, etc.

    After user management, Postfix (virtual, access, transport files)
    and djbdns interfaces are planned.

    Even though modules exist for some of these tasks, it would still
    be useful for me (and other people I'm working with) to have a
    high-level API to them.

  enteredby:   BDA (Bryan Allen)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 30 17:35:38 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Unix::
::Admin           cdpOp Generic interface to Unix admin tasks.       BDA
