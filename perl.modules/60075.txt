Subject: Module submission Rstat::Client
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, isaacson@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rstat::Client
  DSLIP:       MdpOg
  description: Perl library for client access to rstatd
  userid:      ISAACSON (Ron Isaacson)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The namespace registration accompanies a change in ownership and a
    new version of Rstat::Client. The module itself has been on CPAN
    with this name since 2002, but was apparently never registered.

  enteredby:   ISAACSON (Ron Isaacson)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 16 18:21:51 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Rstat::
::Client          MdpOg Perl library for client access to rstatd     ISAACSON
