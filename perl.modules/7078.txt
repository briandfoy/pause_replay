The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::ParseControl
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Control parsing of server-side scripts
  userid:      DAPATRICK (D. Anthony Patrick)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.org, dav-dev@lyra.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I believe that this module will be beneficial to a large number of
    developers, webmasters, and sysadmins as it allows WebDAV to be
    viable for publishing for use on sites where server-side scripting
    languages are used. This module was originally called
    Apache::NoParse, because all it did, and currently does, is return
    all files within the <Directory>, <Location>, or <Files> statement
    containing it as is, without parsing at. I changed it to
    Apache::ParseControl because a near future release will allow the
    implementer to specify file types to control, and the depth of
    control, that is recursion into directories, etc. This could
    partially be done with native Apache directives. I endeavor to make
    it easier using this module.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
