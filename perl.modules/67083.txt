The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::ElementExtractor
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Extracts Images, URLs and such from HTML.
  userid:      TMHARISH (Harish T Madabushi)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=786757
    http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.modules/browse_thread/thread/07a56a49ad1e3b1e

  similar:
    HTML::TreeBuilder HTML::HeadParser URI::Title::HTML URI::WithBase
    WWW::Mechanize

  rationale:

    The following is the proposed functionality of this module:

    1. Given the HTML of a page 1. Find all anchor elements - broken
    into "this domain links" and "other domain links". 2. Find images on
    a page - broken as above. 3. Find the Title, description and other
    such meta data. 4. Find meta keywords and description of the page.
    5. Extract lists (ul and ol) from the HTML of a page 6. Find RSS
    Feeds of a page, if any. 7. anything else I can think of ... 2.
    Split up an anchor tag into : The URL, the alt text and the anchor
    text. 3. Given possible anchor/alt text find the related link.
    [Given Home - <a href=""> home page </a> will be extracted. 4. Given
    a potentially relative URL and the current URL, returns the absolute
    URL. 5. Given a potential redirecting URL, returns the final
    destination URL. 6. Breaks up a URL into Protocol, domain and URI

    One feels that there is a need to have the above mentioned
    functionality in a single module - not only will that make parsing
    and extracting information from HTML easier but it would also make
    such code more readable.

    There are several other elements of a HTML page that can be
    extracted (although this tends to be non trivial) and one intends to
    extend this module to include as many of these elements as possible.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::ElementExtractor adphp Extracts Images, URLs and such from HTML.    TMHARISH
