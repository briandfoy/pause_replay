If this only works for DHL in Germany, the name should mentione that
somehow.

Well, I'm Amercian and I know what DHL is. It's the world's largest
express shipping company. We have it here in the States too, and it's
been in just about every country I've visited. :)

There are a lot of poorly named modules on CPAN. Looking at WWW::DHL, a
user cannot know what it does. It does something with DHL, but that's a
big subject. Since it's not going to do everything that DHL might offer
and people would expect, some more clues are useful.
