H e l l o !

Wonderfully you want to have a rest this summer? Come to Russia! Spend your weekend in Moscow. You not only will see all most interesting places of this city, but also can plunge into its night life. Fiery dancing parties wait for you in the most fashionable night clubs of Moscow. If you were bothered with city vanity, you can go to country of untouched nature, majestic mountains and cleanest air - to Mountain Altai. You can choose rest on any taste: treking, rafting, travel on the horse or simply ecological rest in small hotel in mountains. 

Want to look more in detail?

Thank you. Have a nice day!!!
