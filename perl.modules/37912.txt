The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::UTC
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: manipulation of UTC in terms of TAI
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    DateTime::LeapSecond Date::Leapsecond

  rationale:

    This module, essentially, describes the UTC time scale, for the
    purposes of Perl programs that need to deal with the details. Within
    this remit it intends to be complete. It handles the pre-1972 form
    of UTC, in addition to the current form with leap seconds. It
    automatically downloads new UTC data (published by the IERS) to stay
    up to date.

    The name "Time::UTC" refers to this view of the module as
    describing UTC.

    I've found two other modules that encapsulate information about
    leap seconds: Date::Leapsecond and DateTime::LeapSecond. The latter
    is derived from the former. They are minimalistic, tailored to the
    use DateTime makes of them. They cover only leap seconds, not the
    earlier form of UTC, and they do not correctly handle future leap
    seconds. Conversely, they are faster at those things they do
    support. They thus have a rather different intent from Time::UTC. It
    would be possible, and reasonable, to implement DateTime::LeapSecond
    in terms of Time::UTC, using Time::UTC as the underlying source of
    knowledge about UTC.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Tue Jan 25 00:33:03 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::UTC             Rdphp manipulation of UTC in terms of TAI          ZEFRAM
