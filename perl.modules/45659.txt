     why:

    "The Goo" helps you stick "Things" together in your working
    environment.

    Things include Perl modules, Perl scripts, log files, javascripts,
    configuration files, database tables, templates etc.

    The Goo records a "Trail" as you jump quickly from Thing to Thing
    in a simple, text-based console. It remembers how you associate
    Things in your environment.

    Accelerate your work by quickly traversing the Trail of
    associations between Things.
