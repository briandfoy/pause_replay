I didn't get the distro, but you can send it to me in private email if
this doesn't fix it. You can also ask for more help on
module-authors@perl.org or Stackoverflow.com.

The note says that the distribution doesn't unpack into a single
directory, which means all of your distribution files end up in the
currently directory. Usually this means you created the tarball from
within the distribution directory instead of above it.

However, if you use the build system targets, you shouldn't ever run
into this problem:

    % make dist

or

    % ./Build dist

Good luck, :)
