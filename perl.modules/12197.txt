The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hash::Case
  DSLIP:       Rdprp
  description: Case insensitive hash keys
  userid:      MARKOV (Mark Overmeer)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tie::CPHash

  rationale:

    Case sensitivity of keys is usually great. However, for some
    applications it is complicating life. For instance, some DB modules
    simulate the database in a hash... and those DBs are case
    insensitive themselves.

    Hash::Case implements three very simple tied hashes, one which
    stores all keys in lower case, one for upper case, and the third is
    case preserving. Access is case-insensitive in all three cases.

  enteredby:   MARKOV (Mark Overmeer)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun 15 14:59:46 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Hash::
::Case            Rdprp Case insensitive hash keys                   MARKOV
