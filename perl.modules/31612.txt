The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RFID::Matrics
  DSLIP:       bdpOr
  description: Interface with Matrics RFID Reader
  userid:      GIFF (Scott Gifford)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    To the best of my knowledge, no other Perl interface to an RFID
    reader exists.

    RFID readers impelement a variety of protocols over a variety of
    transports. They can be connected by a serial port or over the
    network. As a result, neither the Net:: nor the Device:: heirarchies
    seem appropriate. In that way, it seems similar to a Remote Access
    Server device, which as its own RAS:: heirarchy.

    I expect other driver modules to use the RFID:: namespace, as well
    as middleware protocols like Savant, general abstractions used by
    several driver modules, and various frontends for dealing with the
    data.

  enteredby:   GIFF (Scott Gifford)
  enteredon:   Fri May  7 16:46:06 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RFID::
::Matrics         bdpOr Interface with Matrics RFID Reader           GIFF
