Hello,
As mentioned in my PAUSE registration, I have written a perl module that 
  is able to parse an XPDL document and return requested data in a Perl 
format (a scalar, hash, or array depending on the type of data 
requested). When I had originally written it for in-house use, I was 
using a namespace of Xfmc::XPDL, since effectively that is what it 
accesses. However, I know that the use of new root namespaces is frowned 
upon, so I was looking for guidance about whether it would be prudent to 
register Xfmc::XPDL, or if there are other suggestions as to what the 
namespace should be. Please let me know if there is anything else I can 
provide or anything I need to do.

Thanks so much,
Steve Rhoton
