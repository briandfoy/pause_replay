What our customers are saying about the Javvins Map:

“I am an IT engineer. I have the Javvins Map of Communication Protocols hanging on my office wall. It helps me get an instant answer to many network and communication questions.”

"It was last holiday season... I purchased a few copies of Javvin's Map of Communication Protocols. I framed them and gave to my customers as holiday gifts. They were very delighted. The pictures have been handing on their walls since then and remind them everyday our wonderful relationship."
 
“I am in charge of marketing for a network software company. I use the Javvins Map of Communication Protocols as a promotional gift in seminars, trade shows and training events - customers love it! I also use it as a lead generation gift on web. I generated 4000 high quality leads in one month! Javvin people customized the poster for us and it looks like a genuine gift from my company. Very good return of investment!”

“I am a certified Cisco trainer. I order the Javvins Map of Communication Protocol for all my students. The Map is very illusive for students to get an overall picture of network and communications quickly. It consistently makes my students very happy (better than T-Shirts for sure!) and refer more people to my class.”
