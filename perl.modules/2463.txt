Riad,

(I knew this would come to this point) OK, I am not angry or insulted, and
let me apologize for the tone of my last letter. It was written in haste -
it seemed like I missed the first round of corespondance so the timer
started.  Additionally I was speaking only of what I have done when I
said that it wasn't something I just slapped together.  

I'm sure there are different things in each module that would be
advantageous under certain circumstances.  I would definitly like to hear
about any problems roadblocks you've come across and how to fix them.  I
can share my findings with you aswell.

I think I'll go do some work now on pickle.

Cheers,
aryeh
