I have no problem with renaming Error and using some standard base classes.
But if it is to be renamed I feel it should stay at the top level. ie If it's
classes are Exception::* then the try/catch etc. should be in Exception.pm,
or atleast avaliable via 

  use Exception qw(try catch);

PS: For those who were there and remember, last year's p5p meeting at the conf.
I was (assigned ?) the task of getting error/exception objects into the perl
core. Part of this was to define a base class structure etc..
