The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LW4::Reader
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: A perl interface for Lightwright files
  userid:      TAMBASCOT (Tony Tambasco)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Lightwright, developed by John McKernon Software, has become a
    standard application for lighting professionals within the
    entertainment industry. It is presently in its fourth version, with
    a 5th version forthcoming, and since there are differences between
    the file type for Lightwright 3 and Lightwright 4, it is reasonable
    to assume that Lightwright 5 will have a different file format when
    it is released.

    I am not opposed to adding the module to an already existing
    namespace, but to my knowledge, there is nothing presently on CPAN
    that is appropriate to this particular type of software.

  enteredby:   TAMBASCOT (Tony Tambasco)
  enteredon:   Fri May 15 17:27:31 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

LW4::
::Reader          bdpfp A perl interface for Lightwright files       TAMBASCOT
