The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chronos
  DSLIP:       Rdpng
  description: Web calendar/scheduler
  userid:      SIMONP (Simon Perreault)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    1) Chronos is a multi-module piece of software. I goes 3 levels
    deep and development versions go deeper. 2) Chronos is a mod_perl
    application, much like Slash is. It would fit under "Misc. Apache
    modules", along other mod_perl applications that have their own
    top-level namespace. 3) Chronos is not a library, does not implement
    any standard and has no interface (well, yes, it does, as does any
    module, but it's not meant to be used by a third-party).

  enteredby:   SIMONP (Simon Perreault)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul 21 14:39:41 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Chronos           Rdpng Web calendar/scheduler                       SIMONP
