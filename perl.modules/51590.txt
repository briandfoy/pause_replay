Hi modules@,

I'm in the process of making sure that all modules I maintain have a 
very clear license both in human and computer readable form (and all of 
them should be distributable under Artistic+GPL). Before you ask, yes, 
this was triggered by CPANTS, but I think this is the single most 
important "metric" that was introduced to CPANTS.

Anyhow, I found out that Language::Mumps, which I took over from the 
late Ariel Brosh, has only the following license statement in the README:

This package is free for use but not modification. This includes
production commercial use.

I did not notice this when I agreed to maintain the module. There 
haven't been any big bug reports, but this *does* bother me: 
Technically, if I am to obey the license, I can't even fix bugs if they 
were reported. I'm not in favour of such a license and don't feel 
comfortable maintaining the module in that state.

What should I do? I don't want to abandon the module. Not that I had a 
lot of work with it. (One single release in three years.) I don't want 
to violate the original author's intent and thus license either. What I 
*do* want is to be able to do modifications to the code if I am to 
maintain it...

If the original author passed away, what's with the license of the 
software anyway?

Steffen
