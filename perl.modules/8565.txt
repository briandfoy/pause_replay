short Description:

DeepCopy.pm

The module is for copying recursively complex data structures involving 
large number internal nested references. Since, in equating two hashes or 
arrays we are equating the internal references directly and hence a change 
in one make change in the other as well.

When rules are broken, they are ammended to be rebroken.
