Dear Colleague,

Happy New Year!

As we know, codon preference among different species could be dramatically =
different.  To enhance the expression level of a foreign protein in a parti=
cular expression system (E.coli, Yeast, Insect, or Mammalian cell), it is v=
ery important to adjust the codon frequency of the foreign protein to match=
 that of the host expression system.  One classic example is GFP (green flu=
orescent protein) which was optimized to achieve high-level of expression i=
n mammalian cells.=20

GenScript has developed a proprietary algorithm for codon optimization.  Th=
is algorithm can optimize sequences for protein expression using either you=
r own codon usage table or those from publicly available codon usage databa=
se.  It can converts your amino acid sequence into a DNA sequence with over=
all codon usage similar to a specified organism, and also optimizes the RNA=
 secondary structure, GC content, repetitive codons etc. Using Genscript op=
timized synthetic genes, many of our customers have reported dramatic incre=
ase on protein expression.=20

The optimized gene can be synthesized by GenScript gene synthesis technolog=
y with 100% fidelity.  The cost is as low as $2.35 per base pair.  Our serv=
ice is very flexible, we can clone the optimized gene into our standard vec=
tors (without extra charge), or any expression vector that you provide (for=
 $400 extra charge).

Gene synthesis is a powerful technology and it has many other applications.=
  Another application example is to replace PCR Cloning.  Please visit our =
web (http://www.genscript.com/gene_synthesis.html) to learn more about this=
 technology.=20=20

Besides Gene Synthesis, we also provide custom vector-based siRNA, siRNA ca=
ssette, peptide, oligo, cloning and protein expression, biochemical reagent=
s, and labwares.  Please visit our web site (http://www.genscript.com) to l=
earn more about our services.
