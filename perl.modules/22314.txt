The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Parse
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Easy date/time parsing for fixed input fmts
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, RPI lily

  similar:
    Date::Parse, Time::ParseDate, Date::Manip

  rationale:

    The existing date/time parsing modules are very big hammers which
    are probably overkill for many parsing needs. They're great if you
    have no clue what the input format will be (for example, something
    typed by a user); they attempt to parse a huge range of possible
    input formats.

    However, for most automated processing of known file formats, you
    don't want a module to *guess* at the date format; you want to TELL
    it that the month will be here, the day there, etc.

    I propose a module which allows a programmer to specify a time/date
    format template, using the same format codes as my Time::Format
    module, and which parses a string using exactly that template.
    Possibly the user would also be able to specify the template using
    stftime's formatting codes.

    I suspect this would be faster and more robust than the Do-It-All
    parsing modules. I plan to start development; in the meantime, I
    would like to reserve the currently-unused Time::Parse namespace.
    Thanks.

The resulting entry would be:
