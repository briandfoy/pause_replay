oops! it should be the same license as perl.

Maybe it is a bug in the pause web, I select "the same
as perl" in the pull down menu and submit the form,
but then I get a warning saying that "Proc:: namespace
is for chapter 4" and I was requested to confirm it
was ok anyway. It seems that the value for the menu
select get lost between.
