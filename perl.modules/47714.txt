Yes and no.

Yes in that both modules let you process several requests at once in parall=
el.

No in that LWP::P::UA gets a list of requests, processes them all and
then returns all the responses. My module lets you continually add
requests and retrieve the responses as they become available.
LWP::P::UA also makes an effort to be more similar to LWP::UA than my
module does, and is more feature complete (handles file:// and
ftp://).

Another difference is that if LWP::P::UA is given a request it cannot
process it returns it straight away, whereas my module would return it
along with the successful results - meaning that the adding request
code and the handling response code can be separated completely.


There is overlap between the two modules but the differences make it
worth having both on CPAN, IMHO.

Having looked at the distinguishing features between the two I believe
that the name 'HTTP::Queue' is still apt, as the module does implement
a queue of sorts, where you push on requests and pop off responses,
albeit not in order.

Cheers,
  Edmund.
