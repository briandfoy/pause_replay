Subject: Module submission Voting::Condorcet::RankedPairs

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Voting::Condorcet::RankedPairs
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Condorcet Ranked Pairs voting resolution
  userid:      PJF (Paul Jamieson Fenwick)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org . When released will almost certainly reach my
    blog, and a Melb.PM demonstration.

  similar:
    None. Where are all the voting modules?

  rationale:

    We seem to be missing a voting namespace on CPAN altogether, and
    yet there are a huge number of possible voting systems that can be
    used.

    This has been recently discussed on the modules list at
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2007/03/msg53611.html

    During that discussion brian implied that opening the Voting::
    namespace was reasonable. Adam didn't say it was outright evil. ;)

    ::Condorcet::RankedPairs is an easy name for the rest of the
    module. There are lots of Condorcet voting systems, and this is one
    of them.

  enteredby:   PJF (Paul Jamieson Fenwick)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 21 09:32:21 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Voting::Condorcet::
::RankedPairs     bdpOp Condorcet Ranked Pairs voting resolution     PJF
