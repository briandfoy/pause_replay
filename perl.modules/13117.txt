I am not a great specialist of Acme::* modules, but I /think/ it boils down 
to whether you intend to whether you think your module ought to be used 
seriously or not ;) If you do, I then think no one will use it if it's in 
Acme.

If that's the case, then maybe you'd be happier in the ex::* namespace, 
indicating an experimental pragma. Then again that may give the impression 
that it's blessed as being under review by p5p which unless you push it 
further there (and it may be a good idea as "no LWP 6.0.0" complaining that 
it only has version 5.65 is a bit counter-intuitive -- or at least a 
syntactical hole) is not the case iirc.

Or perhaps under Perl::* given that it modifies Perl semantics for a keyword, 
eg Perl::NotVersion or something similar.

I'm not recommending any of these specifically, just trying to suggest 
alternatives to Acme::* if your module is "serious" (which to me it seems to 
be).
