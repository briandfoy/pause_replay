Hi,

After some discussion on the perl-xml mailing list, I have put together
a version 0.1 of a Bundle::XML, designed to simplify the installation of
XML-related Perl modules. I'd now like to upload this bundle to CPAN.
The Bundle is at:

http://www.durbanet.co.za/colin/xml/

Direct link:
http://www.durbanet.co.za/colin/xml/Bundle-XML-0.1.tar.gz

How do I register as an author to do upload it? My name is Colin Muller,
and MULL would suit me fine as an ID. I anticipate several updates to
the bundle over the coming months as planned improvements to the various
XML modules happen.

Cheers,
Colin Muller
