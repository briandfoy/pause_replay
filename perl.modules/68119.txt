We've talked about a top-level namespace for library sciences before,
but never really settled on anything. Biblio:: came up, but I've never
liked that because it's only a small part of the science. Library::* is
ambiguous when it comes to programming languages. I haven't thought up
anything better. I tend to disfavor initializations as top level
namespaces unless they are extremely general and common.

Have you talked about it on the perl4lib mailing list? Maybe we can
start giving these some context in the names.
