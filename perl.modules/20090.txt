That's the amount I always work with so I start from there. 
Extending the number of sources is in my future plan (as in
the POD).

If you use external config parser, then you follow the rules
of the parser. The internal parser takes a plain teks file.
It's meant for default parser on simple and common format,
such as one pair of param=value per line (there's a section
in the POD that explains the rules more detail).

This merges configuration from different files,
Config::Merge merges configuration from different sources,
one of them can be file. I think I can use above when
I add capability to accept more than one file for "file"
type (also in future plan).

I have to add here that Config::Merge (currently) defines
three types of configuration source: "default", "file", and
"custom". "default" is some kind of predefined set of
configuration, "file" is expected to contain configuration
from parsed file, while "custom" can be arbitrary source.
I usually use "cutom" to temporarily override the value in
"file".
