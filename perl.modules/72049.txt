The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Pockito
  DSLIP:       bdphb
  description: A mocking framework, similar to Mockito
  userid:      EXUSSUM (spencer portee)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://bitbucket.org/exussum/pockito/

  similar:
    Test::MockObject, Test::Builder::Mock::Class

  rationale:

    Test::MO and T:B:M:C both, great libraries for mock objects. The
    goal is to support a Mockito/EasyMock/JMock style mock object, where
    the 'script' is written in a more DSL style:

    when something happens, then return something

    It must support Moose, or not and reporting back state is very
    important. Pockito is named similar to Mockito due to the
    inspiration of names and a lighter style to mocking objects.

    P.s. if this is submitted twice, I apologize. Pause never sent an
    ack-email, nor is it in the archive.

  enteredby:   EXUSSUM (spencer portee)

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Pockito         bdphb A mocking framework, similar to Mockito      EXUSSUM
