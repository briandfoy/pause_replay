Hi Pierre,

there is a bug report in the RT queue for Test::Strict. I've fixed the 
bug and attached patches to the RT ticket 
(http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21196).

Is it possible that you would incorporate this into the module and make 
a release? That would fix Test::Strict on Windows. If not, would you 
like me to make a release for you? (You keep your copyright, of course!) 
In that case, you would have to make me co-maintainer for all namespaces 
Test::Strict uses on the PAUSE (http://pause.perl.org/).

Thank you for your attention,
Steffen
