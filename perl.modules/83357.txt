The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::PDL
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Test Perl Data Language arrays for equality
  userid:      EBAUDREZ (Edward Baudrez)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    PDL porters mailing list

  similar:
    Test::More Test::Deep

  rationale:

    The proposed module bundles a few functions that are useful for
    testing Perl Data Language (a.k.a. PDL) data arrays (a.k.a.
    piddles).

    In a sense, it is related to Test::More and Test::Deep, as the
    functions are meant for testing (possibly nested) data structures.
    However, the proposed module provides more detailed test failure
    messages than can be obtained with the other two, in case the data
    structures are piddles. The proposed functionality doesn't seem to
    be implemented in any other CPAN package.

The resulting entry would be:
