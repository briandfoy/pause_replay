This message is an advisory to the CPAN admin team.

With regards to the Catalyst Namespace Dispute between CPAN author SRI
and the seven CPAN authors MSTROUT et al, and under the terms of the
mediated settlement, after a 1 year period (or greater)
Catalyst-related namespaces nominated by MSTROUT et al with primary
ownership assigned to SRI are to have their primary ownership
transferred by me to an author nominated by MSTROUT et al.

In the case of subjective, non-obvious or disputed namespace
transfers, both parties agreed to my judgement on the matter.

I confirm I have been provided a list of namespaces by MSTROUT. The
list contains a series of Catalyst:: namespaces, the Task::Catalyst
namespace, and a set of 5 HTTP:: namespaces.

With regards to the non-Catalyst:: namespaces, I am satisfied that
Task::Catalyst falls within the scope of the Catalyst:: namespaces. I
am satisfied that the HTTP:: modules listed were written originally by
CPAN author CHANSEN and donated to the Catalyst core (in this case
referring to MSTROUT et al collectively), and thus are within the
scope of the intent of the agreement.

In executing the transfer, I confirm the permissions changes listed
below were made, acting as the CPAN author SRI.

This transfer does NOT resolve the set of all potential namespaces
that may need to be transferred.

Further namespaces within the scope of the agreement remain, and may
be provided at a later time.
