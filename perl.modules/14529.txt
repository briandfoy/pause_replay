* a short description of what you're planning to contribute
New modules. For now the Geo::IPfree. This module can be used off-line and
has a free, small (200Kb) and fast database to make the country lookpup of
the IPs. It has an open architecture for the database file too.

CPAN has a similar module (Geo::IP), but it's not FREE, because it doesn't
come with the database and you need to buy it! It's very slow (if you use
the PurePerl version) or you need to use a DLL (not open source)!!!!! The
database file is very big 1MB and has a crazy architecture to the user don't
see the content!!!! :-/

.... Well, my module was done and I want to publish it ;-)

I'm planning a totally free module & script for world weather too, using the
free NWS network...
