During the course of our work, we've developed a couple of perl modules 
that we'd like to contribute to the group.  One is a module that creates a 
Windows style tree for use on a web page.  It writes your html and the 
javascript that the browser will need to make the tree nodes open and 
close.  It's been tested and works on IE 5+ and NN 6x.

The second module is a different style for XML::Parser.  I found that 
having to pop off array values from the Tree style was not what I wanted to 
do, so I wrote a Node style which gives you back a differently organized 
tree-like hashref.

Here's my info:
