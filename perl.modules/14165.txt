Hello,

   Please register the following ID into PAUSE:

      MMCLAGAN
      Michael McLagan <mmclagan@invlogic.com>
      http://www.invlogic.com

   The initial contribution is currently called Mail::DSN (could be MIME::DSN 
but I'm waffling).  In either case it's my attempt to parse and manipulate 
emails containing message/delivery-status parts as represented by RFCs 1893 and 
1894.  It is in use by Linux Online to process bounce messages from the user 
registration system.  I suspect that mailing list handling software would make 
use of this to better handle returned messages.

   I tried emailing the MIME-tools maintainer but got no response (over a 
month) so I'm guessing he has no interest in including it.  I also did some 
relatively exhaustive Google searches and came up empty on this particular 
issue.  If I missed something, a pointer would be most appreciated.

   Michael
