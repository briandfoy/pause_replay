Sorry I missed the past email(s). I'll admit, I've allowed this module to
atrophy. I'll apply the patch, and take a look at the other bugs this week.

There are also several other modules that provide much more thorough captcha
support (there's one that is based in ImageMagic that is especially nice).
I'll also add links to those. I've been meaning to provide a compatability
layer as well, as the way this module works internally (using one static
font set) isn't the current best practice.

Thank you for the notification,
