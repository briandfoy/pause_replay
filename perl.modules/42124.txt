I've tried this a few times now, and I can't see why it would fail to find 
the version number.  The module starts (after some comments, like my others 
that are indexed just fine) with:-

package Math::Calculus::Expression;
use strict;
our $VERSION = '0.2.2';

Any ideas why the indexer is missing the version number?  The module builds 
fine, passes its tests, installs and works on Windows and Linux.

Thanks,

Jonathan
