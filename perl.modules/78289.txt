The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Properties
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Cached access to file properties
  userid:      WOHL (Brendt Wohlberg)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    Unknown

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    This module provides a class representing properties of a disk
    file, with particular emphasis on media (image, video, and audio)
    files. The mime type and a SHA-2 digest can be computed for any
    regular file, and these properties are also available for the
    content of bzip2 and gzip compressed files. Additional mime type and
    EXIF properties are available for media files, and a SHA-2 digest of
    the actual pixel data is available for image files. Since some of
    these properties can be expensive to compute, data is cached in an
    SQLite database so that properties only need to be computed from
    file data on the initial access (for example, this can make an
    enormous difference in efficiency when requesting a SHA-2 digest for
    the content of a large compressed file).

    File::Properties is the obvious choice of namespace given that the
    module supports a number of properties of generic regular files.
    Despite considerable searching of CPAN, I am not aware of any other
    module providing similar functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
