The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::ProcessMap
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generate UML Activity Diagrams
  userid:      BADKINS (Brad Adkins)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Flowchart

  rationale:

    The module draws a hybrid Activity Diagram, in plain text and/or
    html format. The approach taken is to provide a simple interfact for
    what can easily be a complicated task. As opposed to the module
    Text::Flowchart, no coordinates or location data is required to
    generate a diagram. The mechanics of placing the diagram's output
    objects are all handled automatically. The module is named
    ProcessMap because it has been designed to be good at describing
    computer processes, I thought the name "Activity Diagramer", or the
    like, was a bit too broad for this application.

  enteredby:   BADKINS (Brad Adkins)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb  4 04:15:45 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::ProcessMap      adpOp Generate UML Activity Diagrams               BADKINS
