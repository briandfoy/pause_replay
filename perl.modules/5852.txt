The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::DayOfWeek
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Calculate day of week for Gregorian dates
  userid:      RBOW (Rich Bowen)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Date::Manip, Date::Christmas, Date::Easter

  rationale:

    A very lightweight module for calculating the day of the week for
    any date after the change to the Gregorian calendar. This uses the
    'doomsday' approach, invented by John Conway. It is mathematically
    interesting, and offers the functionality in a few dozen lines,
    rather than the weight of using Date::Manip or similar.

  enteredby:   RBOW (Rich Bowen)
  enteredon:   Sun May 27 19:50:47 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::DayOfWeek       Rdpfp Calculate day of week for Gregorian dates    RBOW
