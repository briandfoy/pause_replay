The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBR
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Database Repository - A highly focused ORM
  userid:      IMPIOUS (Daniel Norman)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    San Diego Perl Mongers

  similar:
    DBIx::Class, RoseDB::Object - Somewhat similar concepts, with very
    different implementations

  rationale:

    DBR is comprehensive DB development platform that stands on it's
    own. Admittedly, it IS dependent on several other Cpan modules, but
    does not, and should not inherit from them in an object oriented
    fashion.

    From my discussions with coworkers, fellow perl mongers and others,
    DBR is materially different from any existing Module suite, and it
    would not be appropriate to be a subclass of anything currently in
    cpan. It is the basis for future packages, and not vice-versa.

    Please feel free to contact me should you have any additional
    questions.

The resulting entry would be:

DBR               bdpOg Database Repository - A highly focused ORM   IMPIOUS
