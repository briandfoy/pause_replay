Hi - 

I just received a PAUSE account so that I could add a Perl interface
to my library for working with CD disc images and CD-ROMs called
libcdio (http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio). Many thanks for the
very quick registration response.

In reading the proper procedures for uploading new software, I read
that it is a good idea to talk over and register a namespace. Hence
this email. My thought was to put this under the "Device" section with
the name Cdio (e.g. Device::Cdio).  Short of some fairly small
remaining changes the code, I plan a package out of is in libcdio's
CVS already and can be viewed via:
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/libcdio/Perl-Device-Cdio/

The one thing that is a little bit awkward is that the Cdio interace
does have it's own "Device" class so that is referred to as
Device::Cdio:Device - a little long perhaps, but there it is. 

(Note: a "device" is not the same thing as a Compact Disc (CD). A
Compact Disc is the thing that you put in a CD-ROM; there is also a CD
image -- a file which could be burned to a real CD which is neither a
CD-ROM nor a real Compact Disc)

Anyway, unless there are comments on this matter I'll probably
register Device::Cdio and upload in a couple of days. 

Thanks. And thanks for such a wonderful system and tools (and people!)
which make up CPAN.
