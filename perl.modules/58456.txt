Hiya

Text::Markdown doesn't seem to be maintained at the moment, is it  
possible that I can have a maint bit so that I can add tests to  
Text::Markdown and then merge the codebases with Text::MutliMarkdown  
(which I already have a maint bit for) at some later point?

I've contacted SRI by his email address on CPAN.org, and writing in  
the open bug tickets for Text::Markdown.

As SRI is 'known dead', and none of his modules have been maintained  
recently (last updated module was 29 May 2006) - do you think that  
it's worth me posting to see if I can reach him on perlmonks?

Thanks for the help in advance.

Cheers
Tom
