The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Tmpl
  DSLIP:       MdcOa
  description: Very fast text templating
  userid:      DLOWE (J. David Lowe)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    Text::Tmpl is a module for very fast templating. There are dozens
    of templating modules on CPAN, each only a tiny bit different from
    the others. This one is no different - what sets it aside is speed.
    The entire module is implemented as a C library, with only a thin
    XS/Perl layer to make the calls available from Perl. The same
    templates, then, can be used from either Perl or C/C++ programs.

    This was originally designed to completely isolate HTML programmers
    from module/CGI programmers, or at least completely separate logic
    from content in dynamic web applications. Since it original
    creation, it has also been put to good use in code generation, email
    templates, and so on.
