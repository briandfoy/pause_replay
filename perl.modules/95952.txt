We'd much rather have a long-absent author voluntarily hand over
permissions or give PAUSE admins an assent for a takeover than doing it by
executive fiat.  If something has been broken for a long time, an extra few
weeks won't really matter one way or another.  And if you think about it
from the PAUSE admin perspective... a petitioner not willing to do some
legwork =E2=80=93 whether because they don't care about the original author=
's
feelings or don't want to do the work or whatever else =E2=80=93 isn't a go=
od
indicator of someone to take over long-term stewardship on behalf of the
community.

In any case, following the direction of the Berlin Consensus, it seems like
the cpan-workers mailing list is the right venue for a discussion about
those guidelines, possibly leading to discussion at a future Perl QA
hackathon.

Neil has expressed some interest in exploring a "one-off fix" process, with
a temporary takeover, a fix released to CPAN, and a release of permissions
to ADOPTME or something like that.  You might want to brainstorm ideas with
him and develop a proposal for discussion.
