The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::MultiMarkdown::XS
  DSLIP:       adhfo
  description: Interface to MultiMarkdown C Library
  userid:      ANDREWF (Andrew Ford)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::MultiMarkdown

  rationale:

    Text::MultiMarkdown uses an old version of MultiMarkdown.pl by
    Fletcher Penney. He has more recently released two versions of his
    multimarkdown processor as a C library based on a PEG/LEG grammar.
    (see https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-4). These are an
    order of magnitude faster than the Perl regex version. I have
    produced a thin XS wrapper to the later version this library
    (currently still alpha and not yet uploaded to CPAN) and intend to
    use it in my Template::Plugin::MultiMarkdown module.

    I will collaborate with Tomas Doran, author of Text::MultiMarkdown
    to provide a compatible interface and hopefully feed in patches to
    him to make his module use the XS version if it is present on the
    system (in a similar manner to Readonly and Readonly::XS or possibly
    more explicitly).

The resulting entry would be:

Text::MultiMarkdown::
::XS              adhfo Interface to MultiMarkdown C Library         ANDREWF
