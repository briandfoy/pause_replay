they don't mention fixing the real problem: relative paths in @INC.
If you fix that, most of that problem is fixed.

The other problem is when a user wants to load the same module
name, but from another location. Technology isn't going to fix
that problem. Don't choose names of modules that already exist
for your own, use a namespace that separates your modules from
everyone else's, or load the module by filename. That last one
is especially important: if you know that's the one you want
and that you don't want others, you have to make sure that's
the one you get. You can't rely on @INC to find one that has
a matching name.

Besides all this, I don't think "personal" is a name that 
describes what you are actually doing. Even with a good name,
you have to tailor a bunch of code to use it, which means you
could have just done the other fixes the mod_perl traps
suggests, I think.
