That might do, although this is the sort of instrumentation you'd
probably leave running constantly, rather than running as a stand alone
benchmark, or a one time development task.

If Benchmark:: is where other performance measurement items have landed,
then perhaps that's the right spot. 

I would envision perl modules related to Oracle Trace or perhaps some
BEA Tuxedo performance measurement modules as potential siblings under
whatever category this lands. Anybody who currently uses Perl with 
ARM, or Oracle Trace have ideas on where this class of measurement 
hooks should live?
