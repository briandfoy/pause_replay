Subject: Module submission Twitter::Badge

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Twitter::Badge
  DSLIP:       cdpOa
  description: Displays the Twitter status of any user
  userid:      ARUL (Arul John)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms, etc.

  similar:
    Net::Twitter, Net::Social::Service::Twitter

  rationale:

    Twitter::Badge is unique in that it displays the status of any
    Twitter member when you have his/her Twitter. Also, the user is not
    required to login. All other Twitter modules are meant to be used
    for the current user and after he/she logs into Twitter.

    Twitter status refers to various tags/actions in the XML file
    generated by Twitter's badge (http://twitter.com/account/badge). My
    module will help web developers use this information from their Perl
    scripts either on the web or on console instead of having to rely
    solely on Twitter's Javascript code.

    Thats the gist of what my module does and I would like it to be
    listed in the module list when its finished. Thank you.
