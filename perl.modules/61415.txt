if you can't envision how somebody else may use your code, there's
likely going to be some use case you haven't thought of yet. This is to
say: By all means upload your module to CPAN. You should just make sure
that it has some accessible documentation so people can find and learn
how to use it reasonably easily.

If you don't have a PAUSE account yet, you can apply for one via
pause.perl.org.

Cheers,
Steffen
