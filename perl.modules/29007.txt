The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::LibIDN
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Perl bindings for GNU Libidn
  userid:      THOR (Thomas Jacob)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    https://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=4263

  similar:
    IDNA::Punycode Encode::Punycode Net::IDN

  rationale:

    The name space choice is based on the fact that Internationalized
    Domain Names are somehow related to DNS which is related to
    Networking, LibIDN is the name of the library this module links
    against.

    What's unique about Net::LibIDN is that it links against the
    defacto standard open source IDNA ACE and nameprep library, GNU
    Libidn, instead of reimplementing it in pure perl like the other
    modules, thus profitting from maturity (Libidn aims at implementing
    IDNA completely and correctly) and the evolution of the latter. It
    is probably faster, and has more options.

    Also, together with my additions to GNU Libidn, it provides support
    for checking top level domain specific rules, something which is
    AFAIK not yet available anywhere in the open source world.

  enteredby:   THOR (Thomas Jacob)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar  1 22:54:50 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::LibIDN          Rdpfp Perl bindings for GNU Libidn                 THOR
