G'day Brian / All,

Firstly, thanks very much for the prompt response!

"Pay As You Go" (PAYG, also called "Pay As You Earn" PAYE) in Australia 
is a way of taking tax from a taxpayer's income each pay period.  It's 
almost exclusively used when processing payroll, as that's when the 
instalments are made.

I can't find any mention of the Payroll::* namespace on The Module List, 
although a number of such modules have been uploaded to CPAN, which 
formed the basis of my original naming convention.

Business::Payroll::* is arguably a better location for all of these 
modules, and I'm happy to release under Business::Payroll::AU::PAYG if 
deemed a superior choice by the members of the module list.

Please consider this such a request, to rename the proposed module from 
Secure::UID to Proc::UID.  First revision of the code to appear on CPAN 
in the near future so I can get feedback on how it tests on various 
operating systems.

Many thanks again,

	Paul
