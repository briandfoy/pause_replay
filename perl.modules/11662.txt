 Description:

    bivio OLTP Platform (bOP) is a multi-dimensional, application
    framework.  At the highest level, bOP provides support for
    web-delivered applications based on a Model-View-Controller (MVC)
    architecture.  At the lowest level, bOP provides a cohesive
    infrastructure for any Perl application.

    bOP provides 250 classes in the following categories:

	Agent - controls execution flow and security
	Exceptions - structured exception handling
	IO - class loading, tracing, logging, and configuration
	Mail - support for manipulating and sending mail
	Models - object-relational mapping plus lists, forms, and list forms.
	PetShop - an example to compare with J2EE's Pet Store demo
	Type - type hierarchy with interfaces to SQL, HTML, XML, etc.
	UI - facades, views, and widgets to generate HTML

    You can download the latest version at:

        http://www.bivio.biz/hm/download-bOP

    The evolution of bOP has occurred over a period of two years
    explicitly and over two decades implicitly.  For the general
    philosophy behind bOP, please read:
