The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Security::CVSS
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Calculates CVSS values
  userid:      JDENNIS (James Dennis)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Security::CVSS was suggested by someone on the modules@perl.org
    list. There appears to be no existing top level domain to include
    this is.

    CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is an attempt to
    standardise on the way in which vulnerabilities are assessed and
    rated.

    It is in use by a number of big players such as Cisco and US-CERT
    (see http://www.first.org/cvss/eadopters.html).

    This module allows you to calculate the CVSS base score, temporal
    score and environmental score.

  enteredby:   JDENNIS (James Dennis)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov  1 13:58:41 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Security::
::CVSS            bdpOp Calculates CVSS values                       JDENNIS
