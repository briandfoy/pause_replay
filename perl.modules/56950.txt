That's odd. Andy volunteered to take care of the permissions and I
passed over to him hundreds and he has since passed them over to
others. I think that modules@ was informed

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/w3glimpse/modules?query=Lester&errors=0&case=on&maxfiles=100&maxlines=30

gives plenty hits, focus on September 2006.

Let's fix what needs fixing but let's take Andy into the loop.

At the moment http://search.cpan.org/~ni-s/Tk-804.027/ shows nothing
as unauthorized, so this task seems mostly finished. I see no reason
to add anybody to TKML unless Slaven asks me to do it.

Maybe I'm missing something. When I search around on search.cpan.org I
find only Tk::DragDrop::KDEDrop and Tk::DragDrop::KDESite in
Tk-800.024 that are unauthorized. Owner is in both cases TKML, so we
best ask Slaven to make Nick comaintainer for those. Are there any
further packages that need action?
