The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::MockObject
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Module for creating fake objects for tests
  userid:      CHROMATIC (chromatic)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa mailing list, my use.perl journal

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is built on Test::Builder, and uses a test pattern
    called 'Mock Objects' (http://www.mockobjects.com/). This does very
    little a clever hacker could not do manually, but it is
    encapsulated, abstracted, and integrated. The combination will,
    hopefully, make it easier for the average hacker.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::MockObject      adphp Module for creating fake objects for tests   CHROMATIC
