     why:

    SiteControl : An module that allows for a rule-based set of
    restrictions to a web application that is written using apache and
    mod_perl. It uses AuthCookie for session handling, and allows a
    developer to manage authentication in a more abstract way. For
    example, it makes it possible to more easily write pages that have
    permissions-based content. It also adds an easy mechanism for
    saving/restoring data with a "User" object.

    GPW: A password generation module based on the FIPS181 government
    standard. It generates pronouncable passwords that include optional
    pronunciation guides.

    If you want to glance at the source, it is already available from
    my public Subversion repository (you can view with a browser):

    http://whizzo.uoregon.edu/public/src/site_control
    http://whizzo.uoregon.edu/public/src/pwgen

    A tar.bz2 archive of site_control is available at
    http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~tkay/site_control-0.41.tar.bz2
