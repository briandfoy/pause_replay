The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VMware::VIX_Contrib::VMhost
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Manipulate VM guests on a VM host
  userid:      COLINCCI (Colin Campbell)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl

  similar:
    None that I know of.

  rationale:

    This module and several others I have in mind will provide object
    oriented interfaces to manipulate VMhosts and the guests running on
    these hosts. The main purpose is to provide an easy to use interface
    the new VMware::VIX perl modules from VMware.inc to aid in batch
    manipulations of guests on a particular VM host (such as batch
    Suspend/Backup operations).

    The VMware::VIX_Contrib was suggested as a suitable namespace to a
    query placed in comp.lang.perl.modules. I believe this names space
    clearly defines the modules purpose and origin, without implying
    that they are written by, or associated directly with VMware.inc.

    Thank you for your consideration.
