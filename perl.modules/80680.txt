The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       B:CodeLines
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Lists executable lines of a Perl Program
  userid:      ROCKY (Rocky Bernstein)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/rocky/Perl-B-CodeLines

  similar:
    B::Concise

  rationale:

    This is useful in code coverage tools or debuggers where one wants
    to know which likes of a Perl source have code that can be executed.

    In theory one could extract and/or extend this from B::Concise but
    that really has a different focus and in my opinion is already too
    large.

  enteredby:   ROCKY (Rocky Bernstein)
  enteredon:   Sat May 26 13:47:17 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

B:CodeLines       Rdphp Lists executable lines of a Perl Program     ROCKY
