all my modules don't show up on http://search.cpan.org
and the latest versions don't show up on http://search.cpan.org/~PODMASTER
and some of them weren't listed on http://search.cpan.org/recent

I went through a few rounds of reindexing/deleting
trying to get 
HTML-Scrubber-0.06
and
PPM-Repositories-0.07
to show up.

also, what's up with the module list? I asked before
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2003-09/msg00063.html
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2003-04/msg00440.html

Did I mention I'm increasingly becoming fond of kobesearch.cpan.org,
even  though it's not as "pretty"? ;)
