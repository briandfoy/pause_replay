Hi Simon!

Please acknowledge you have received this message.

Why didn't you reply to the comment I left on
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=44899 4 weeks ago? Your
lack of responsiveness is killing me here. I've already filed two new
top-level bugs for getting bug #44899 closed and you're still being
non-responsive.

I don't care what it will take you to promptly reply in time for
comments I leave on XML-Feed bugs, but please get to it. One option
would be to use the rt.cpan.org API to periodically list all comments
on the XML-Feeds bugs and notify you on changes. In any case, this is
not a good way to treat your users, contributors and/or co-developers,
even if you're not getting paid to work on XML-Feed.

Regards,

P.S: I'm sorry if this email sound rude, but it began as sounding much
more profane in my thoughts, so this is the best I could do given the
circumstances.
