The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Rdiff
  DSLIP:       adchl
  description: interface to librsync (signatures/patches)
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace Choice: rdiff is a commandline tool that uses librsync,
    and it is the more sensible choice (remote diff). I chose File,
    because it mostly works on files (but it's not set in stone).

    Unfortunately, since it's already used in some projects (it has
    been on CPAN for more than a year, and I forgot/neglected to
    register it's namespace), changing the name would be relatively
    painful.

    Uniqueness: AFAICS there is neither any other librsync interface,
    nor any other module that does the same thing.

    Why it should be listed: Well, I think every general-purpose module
    should be listed ;)

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Rdiff           adchl interface to librsync (signatures/patches)   MLEHMANN
