Does anyone have to know about the cURL bits? If it's completely hidden
behind the interface, it probably shouldn't be in the name. That way
you can change the implementation without changing the name.

Also, API is redundant. You know it's an API because its a module :)

How about WWW::VPSNet? That's where people typically put these things/
