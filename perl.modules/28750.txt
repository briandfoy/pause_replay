From: cpan.org@daveola.com (David Ljung Madison)

I've written a module that reads bitmaps (the actual image, not just
the bitmap info) and I'm trying to find a name for it.

I'm aware of "Image::Info:BMP" - but the point of this was to
read more than just the info information.

I'm thinking that either "Image::Bitmap" or "Image::BMP" - but as
this is my first CPAN experience, I thought I'd get some advice
from the experts first.


Also, the module is pretty straightforward - doesn't depend on
any other modules besides IO::File and doesn't need any compilation,
what's the best installation method to use.  Do I need something
like Makefile.pl?
