I stand corrected, well to be exact, your upload was 12 days ahead,

-rw-rw-r--    1 root     root        10589 Feb 19 19:26 D/DR/DROLSKY/Params-Validate-0.01.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     root        13104 Mar  1 19:44 R/RA/RAM/Getargs-Long-0.1.0.tar.gz

but are you sure your registration was?

Your mail was sent Date: Wed, 14 Feb 2001 21:06:13 -0600 (CST)
and Raphael's was sent Date: Thu, 24 Aug 2000 21:52:26 +0200

Getargs::Long is listed in the Module list since $Revision: 3.64
$$Date: 2000/10/27 07:12:33 $

I can't make any sensible suggestion here. I'd ask you both to
cross-reference each other's module in your POD so that people can
find the other.

Let's agree to disagree. Fine by me.
