The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::XHTML::DVSM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: XHTML/XML Transformation
  userid:      DVSM (Stuart Butler)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Module is mainly aimed at web development but requires XHTML. It
    embeds instructions in the XHTML/XML itself. The effect is to spin
    XML from within the XML document itself.

    DVSM stands for dynamic visual software modelling - referring to
    the use of a working storyboard of XHTML markup to design an
    application.

    This really is a very simple but utterly new concept - there is
    nothing else that uses the principle of completely preserving the
    designer's XHTML. This is NOT any of the following: a document merge
    module, a replacement for asp/jsp, just a way of embedding perl
    script.

  enteredby:   DVSM (Stuart Butler)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 25 11:44:06 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::XHTML::
::DVSM            bdpOp XHTML/XML Transformation                     DVSM
