Hi Brian,
sorry for my bad english :/

Fractal Numerical Algorithm is totally new encryption technology (I have 
completed my work on november 2009).

With this implementation I have win Perl 2009 Contest on 
http://www.perl.it/contest/2009

My article is "Anak Fractal Numerical Algorithm...." (soon published)

I have not uploaded the files on CPAN  because I knew that the U.S. is 
illegal to publish new encryption algorithms. Is true? Consider that I am 
italian: I dont want to do anything illegal. What do you recommend?

Thank'you

Mario Rossano aka Anak
