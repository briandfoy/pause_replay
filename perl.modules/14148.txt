The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fractal::DLA
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Creates an DLA-fractal with GD
  userid:      ARCOLF (Wolfgang Gruber)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) fractals belong to the group of
    stochastic fractals. The module Fractal::DLA creates this type of
    fractal and stores it in a jpg- or png-image. By subclassing the
    module can be easily extended with different creation modes.

    Currently the rootlevel namespace Fractal is not registered on
    CPAN, but due to the enormous amount of different kinds of fractals
    the best solution -IMHO- would be to organize them with this
    namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

Fractal::
::DLA             bdpOp Creates an DLA-fractal with GD               ARCOLF
