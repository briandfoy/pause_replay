Subject: Namecase.pm module author (Mark Summerfield) cannot be found

Hello CPAN,
  I've been unable to reach Mark Summerfield (summer@perlpress.com) about
including some enhancements to the namecase.pm module he wrote.  The module
was fantastic and really sped up development for a project I was working
with.  I extended the module and I'm interested in giving the changes back
to him and the community.   

All email sent to him is bounced back as unknown recipient and if you look
at the perlpress website it seems to have been taken over by a link spammer.

Any suggestions on what to do next?
Pedro Febles Cortez

P.S.  I also tried to reach him through a co-author of the book  C++ GUI
Programming with Qt3 (ISBN: 0131240722) but have not received any response.
