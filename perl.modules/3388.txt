Welcome Thomas Linden,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

    TLINDEN

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      Thomas Linden

  homepage:  
  enteredby: Andreas J. König

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
if you want to protect yourself from SPAM. If you want to do this,
please visit
  https://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred
or

If you need any further information, please visit
  $CPAN/modules/04pause.html.
If this doesn't answer your questions, contact modules@perl.org.

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Andreas J. König:
There are really more than a dozen modules to read and manipulate
config files. Please try the
    m /^config/
command on the CPAN shell and if really all suck for you, then
try again in the Apache namespace (348 modules there) and if you still
find nothing that comes close to yours, then, please, name your module
Config::Something or Apache::Something but do not open a new rootlevel
namespace. Thanks!
