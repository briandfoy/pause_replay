Hello,

I have recently uploaded the module in the subject to CPAN. On the same
day I have received the attached email. While the message was in good
intention it was sent from a noreply/anonymous email address so there is
no way to ask further questions. So I thought asking you guys :

1. What would be a good name for this module ? Should I renamed it to
WebService::YQL as suggested ?

2. If so, then which is the proper procedure for renaming a module ?

3. Why would anyone send good advice using an anonymous email address ?

Thank you.

This should probably be under the WebService namespace (i.e.
WebService::YQL). WWW is usually used for libraries that
interact with websites by parsing the HTML.
