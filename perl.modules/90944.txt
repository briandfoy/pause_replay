     why:

    I have been using perl for over fifteen years and have developed a
    number of modules for various work and personal projects. I am
    currently evaluating whether any of these are appropriate for
    distribution on CPAN. In addition, I am aware there are a number of
    modules looking for maintainers and I am looking to give back to the
    perl community. The immediate impetus for requesting a PAUSE account
    at this point is that I am participating in brian d foy's CPAN
    workshop.
