The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::OCS
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: OCS (Open Content Syndication) parser
  userid:      BHANN (Brian Hann)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    XML::RSS

  rationale:

    XML::OCS works nearly identically to XML::RSS except it processes
    OCS (Open Content Syndication) feeds instead of RSS feeds.

    There used to be a project for a perl module to process OCS feeds
    (also called XML::OCS) on Freshmeat but it was removed long ago and
    appears to have disappeared completely. The module was also at one
    time stored and documented at: http://internetalchemy.org/ocs/perl/,
    but now it is gone as well. I am not aware of any existing ways to
    parse OCS feeds with perl, although sites such as moreover.com,
    syndic8.com and 10.am still provide (some free, I believe) OCS
    feeds.

    http://internetalchemy.org/ocs/ for more information on the OCS
    standard.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::OCS             cdpOp OCS (Open Content Syndication) parser        BHANN
