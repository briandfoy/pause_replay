Dear Perl meisters,

Context:
I've developped a library for managing plugins and extensions, with a
model similar to the Eclipse platform.
This library is already used in the IMC project (see
http://imc.sourceforge.net/ ). You can find more information about IMC
and the plugin framework in some slides I have presented in the past:
http://www.idealx.org/prj/imc/dist/imc.pdf (or imc.swf for Flash users).

For IMC, I've used the private IMC:: module namespace, knowing that I do
not intend to maintain it on the CPAN in the near future.

However, I've started extracting 2 modules that are not IMC specific:
    * the plugin and extension framework (already uploaded as
http://search.cpan.org/~dbarth/PXP-0.1.1/ )
    * Struts4P : a port of Struts to Perl 5

I intend to publish these modules on the CPAN so they can be more
usefull to Perl developpers that don't need the full IMC environment
(embeded Net::Server, Webmin connector, SQL log viewer module, LDAP
account management, etc.).

What is the best module name for a plugin and extension framework ?

The plugin framework does not require that one inherits the base Plugin
class : any CPAN module can be loaded and extended with this mechanism
(thanks to Perl flexibility of course...) So it is sufficiently generic
that it could just be :

Plugin.pm
Plugin/Extension.pm
Plugin/ExtensionPoint.pm

Or is PXP (Perl Xtensions & Plugins) a good name, knowing that it will
pollute the top-level namespace with the PXP prefix ? Knowing also that
this top-level PXP namespace will not be populated by PXP-based plugins,
because precisely they do not and must not inherit the PXP::Plugin class.

The question is a bit easier for Struts4P : it could go in
HTTP::Struts4P as it relates to HTTP servers and requires other HTTP::*
modules. It is not tied to Apache, so I don't want to use the Apache
namespace.

Is HTTP::Struts4P ok for you ?

Thanks for any advice.
