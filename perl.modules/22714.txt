The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Mail
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Sends an HTML email with text alternative
  userid:      PLANK (Cláudio Valente)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    MIME::Lite::HTML

  rationale:

    This module is intended to send an email with html (with associated
    media) and an alternative text part.

    I think the namespace HTML::Mail is appropriate, because:

    1. The purpose of the module is to send/construct emails with HTML
    2. I subclass HTML::Parser

    I wrote this module from scratch due to MIME::Lite::HTML
    limitations namely:

    1. only supports gif and jpeg (this module should support all
    mimetypes that perl knows of) 2. Actually parses the HTML in order
    to replace the url only where it is supposed to and not in text
    nodes. 3. It's relatively small and lightweight 4. Because I believe
    MIME::Lite::HTML's approach in inherently flawed (point 2 can't be
    solved without an almost complete rewrite)

    I plan on implementing some kind of persistence in order to make
    the process os generating custom messages more lightweight.

    It's still beta

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Mail            bdpOp Sends an HTML email with text alternative    PLANK
