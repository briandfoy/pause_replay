Hi folks,

- Some time ago I submitted a request for namespace registration for
SimTools::SynSim (2002-11/msg00127)

- Following the suggestion of a referee, I re-submitted it as
Simulation::Tools::SynSim (2002-11/msg00331)

- Following another suggestion of a referee, I re-submitted it as
Simulation::SynSim (2002-12/msg00261)

- After yet another suggestion, I submitted Simulation::Automate
(2002-12/msg00424)

Since then, silence. No reaction except the automated response.

Could somebody please either accept or reject this?
What's the point of asking people to register their namespace, if nothing
happens when they do so?

Thanks a lot,

Wim
