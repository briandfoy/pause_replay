I have a small bundle of modules and utilities relating to bioinformatics
that I'd like to share with the community. The primitives were developed
over the past couple years, and in a post YAPC flurry of activity I've
finally gotten around to finishing the ongoing project of making them
independent of our site and including full documentation and tests.

A current incomplete distribution is already on our FTP site at
ftp://mcclintock.bu.edu/BMERC/perl/ by the name of CompBio-0.2.tar.gz. Most
of the soon to be deprecated versions of the modules and scripts which led
to this bundle are also available there. I'd like the namespace CompBio,
for computational biology, but am open to suggestions. I hope to have the
fundamental set of CompBio.pm Core.pm and Simple.pm ready for review at the
next Boston.pm tech meeting.

BTW, is there any documentation on making bundle distributions? make dist
doesn't walk the directories like perl Makefile.pm and make do (unless I
missed a dist target for this). I would appreciate advice on just how much
stuff to bundle together, and how much to leave to be gotten individually?

Thanks!
