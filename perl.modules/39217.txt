The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shell::Jobs
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Job control module
  userid:      PARDUS (Jaap Karssenberg)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    zoidberg-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    IPC::Run

  rationale:

    This module will implement (POSIX) job control code that is at the
    heart of most shells. Code is taken from the Zoidberg shell so it
    has some level of maturity allready; it will include both the basic
    signalling code and most of the parser code, so it accepts basic
    shell syntax.

    As for interfaces, the module will export an @JOBS wich containes
    objects that each corespond to one group of processes. These objects
    support methods like "kill", "fg", "bg" etc.

    Although some functionality overlaps with IPC::Run it will have
    some distinct features; not in the least that it is tuned to be used
    for building shell-like applications.

    I think this belongs in the 'Shell::' namespace rather then the
    'IPC::' namespace because it tries to implement functionality from
    the POSIX section about shell applications. Also it doesn't really
    do IPC more then basic signalling.

  enteredon:   Tue Mar 22 08:38:57 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Shell::
::Jobs            adphp Job control module                           PARDUS
