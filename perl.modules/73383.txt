this mailing list is for administrative purposes, not for support with 
individual modules. I suggest you check the module's documentations for 
pointers to support venues. You may attempt to get help at the usual 
places such as perlmonks.org or stackoverflow.com. As a last resort, you 
can try writing to the author himself.

Best regards,
Steffen
