Hi CPAN/BackPAN,

I really appreciate the persistence of the BackPAN and really like that
it is hard to get stuff out of there but with no other way to get it out
of the more visible (and better indexed) MetaCPAN I really want to ask a
favour here and get these two releases out of the index.

The BackPan URLs are:
http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/N/NO/NORBU/Giovanni-0.4.tar.gz
http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/N/NO/NORBU/Giovanni-0.3.tar.gz

I would really appreciate if the two releases and all associated files
(or at least the CSVs in there) would go so that I put our customer at
rest who is quite upset that he can find his email address in Google.

Really sorry for the hassles, anyone willing to look into this?

cheers
Lenz
