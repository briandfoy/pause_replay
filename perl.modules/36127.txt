     why:

    For now 1-dimensional numerical root finders:

    Math::Solver1 - base class Math::Solver1::Bisect - bisection
    Math::Solver1::Falsi - regula-falsi Math::Solver1::Newton -
    newton/secant method

    These are ready with POD and some built-in testing. If you have
    better name suggestions, I'm open. Maybe something to do with root
    finding to not get confused with symbolic equation solving solving.

    N-dimensional root-finders would also be nice.

    Some other non-linear programming/optimization/minimization methods
    (other than amoeba) would be nice. Putting constraints in (combining
    root-finding with minimization) would be ideal.
