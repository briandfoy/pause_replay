May I suggest 'epoch' and 'ical' as additional formats?

Mind you, I think it might be better if you could work with the author
of Date::ISO to combine the features of the two modules.  It seems that,
for some reason, Date::ISO has no method to directly produce an ISO date
string, even though it can parse them.  With the addition of such a
method, Date::ISO should be able to do most of what your module does.  I
have no idea to about the internal error checks in the two modules, but
I see no reason why those could not be combined.
