The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Tea
  DSLIP:       adhfp
  description: TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Crypt::Tea because it's encryption and it implements TEA, the the
    Tiny Encryption Algorithm. I think it'll be useful because it
    implements TEA compatibly in both Perl and JavaScript thus enabling
    CGIs to communicate with browsers. Subroutines offer encryption,
    decryption and digest and all cyphertext is ascii-encoded to prevent
    munging. Another subroutine returns JavaScript code which offers
    identical functions in JS, and this will be used by GCIs to feed the
    browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line
    use. Triple encryption will be offered later. Tea.pm is used by the
    yet-to-be-registered CGI::Htauth.pm authentication module ...

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::Tea             adhfp TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm           PJB
