The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::Hybrid
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: promote Perl primitives to hybrid objects
  userid:      METADOO (Alexandr Kononoff)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    autobox

  rationale:

    In Perl objects and primitives are different things. Hybrid object
    is a special case of Perl object that can be seen and treated as
    both primitive and object at the same time. In general case, it is a
    violation of object encapsulation to access object's underlying
    bless()ed primitive directly (at least outside of class's methods),
    but in special case of hybrid objects it is perfectly ok to do so -
    no violation of encapsulation takes place.

    The Object::Hybrid implements default hybrid class and exports
    promote() function that bless()es Perl's primitives (hash, scalar,
    array, or filehandle) into either default or user-specified (custom)
    hybrid class to make them hybrid objects.

  enteredby:   METADOO (Alexandr Kononoff)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar 29 02:02:20 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Object::
::Hybrid          bdpOp promote Perl primitives to hybrid objects    METADOO
