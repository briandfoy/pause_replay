I'm not sure. I'm very reluctant of creating new toplevel namespace. I'm
not the least afraid of using long module names. (Did you ever look at my
CPAN directory? ;) )
Second argument against switching, of course, is that this is always,
connected to work. But you have a point. Perl programmers tend to think of
regular expressions whenever you mention pattern matching. It's not
necessarily relevant whether or not the expression has another valid
meaning in the context of computer languages.

Perhaps others reading the modules list would want to comment? Did the
namespace and abstract chime the regex bell for you, too?

Steffen
