The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AI::PSO
  DSLIP:       bdpfo
  description: The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
  userid:      KYLESCH (Kyle Schlansker)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    namespace --------- The Particle Swarm Algorithm is often thought
    of as an Artificial Intelligence algorithm which is why I chose the
    AI::PSO name. Ideally, I think there should be an Opt:: namespace
    for Optimization, but PSO fits nicely within the exising AI::
    because it is often used to train Neural Networks (which are in
    AI::).

    approach -------- The PSO algorithm may be used in many ways, from
    ANN training to Reactive Power and Voltage Control. Most
    implementations tie the optimization algorithm in with their
    specific problem. I have separated the optimization algorithm from
    its potential uses by providing a functional interface where the
    users simply supply their own fitness function and control
    parameters. In the end, they simply receive an array of optimized
    parameters with which they can do what they like.

    why should this be in the modules list?
    --------------------------------------- While there are many papers,
    books, and pseudo code available for the PSO algorithm (and even
    some C code), not much of it is re-usable. At best, it requires the
    developer to seriously hack away to port code to a new application.
    Anyone interested in trying to use PSO for their purposes will
    easily be able to quickly implement it with this module, rather than
    reading research papers and trying to implement it themselves.
