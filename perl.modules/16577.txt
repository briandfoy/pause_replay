Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

Alain Barbett proposed all this stuff nearly two years ago in his 
analysis for what became Filesys::Samba.

At that time there was no contemporary SMB client library so he provided 
a very neat object interface to smbclient. Bravo !

However, now there is and I am enjoying using it for myself and learning 
about XS.

However there is almost no prospect of me making something that is going 
to be very useable by others - talent lacking.

That said, I am happy to make a start.

I await your suggestions.

'...No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a
manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes
me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know
for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee...'

from Meditation 17, J Donne.
