Well, apart from being N thousand kilometres closer to the WTC than I'd
like to be... :-/

So it does.  *sigh*

| So does anyone have any ideas about what I should call these modules? Perhaps Text::News::NewsML, or XML::App:NewsML...???

*NOT* Text:: ... talk about an overused, too-general namespace!

I think this comes down to making a decision on XML:: and where
specific applications of XML should go.  I imagine the modules list will
have some more opinions on it.

| The above quoted post was actually about a module called XML::OCS, which I can't find anywhere. It and XML::RSS are probably NewsML's closest relatives, but I do like Ken's reasoning that the XML:: space should be reserved for modules working with XML, not modules based on XML applications.

But what about the stuff under HTML?  There's a precedent for a
namespace with both generic parsers etc, and applications.
