The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::WS2000::IO
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Basic IO function for WS2000 Receiver
  userid:      MMBK (Michael Böker)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module contains lowlevel-routines for the communication with
    the ELV Weatherstation WS2000 PC connected to a serial port.

    Compatible Devices: CONRAD ws7000 WMR 900H La Crosse WS-2010 ( not
    tested )

    Following functions are implemented:

    open_ws ($port) opens the serial port and checks initial response,
    returns 1 on success, 0 on failure

    send_ws ($cmd,$par) send a command to the WS2000 Legal commands
    are: 0 read DCF-Time 1 read one datablock 2 next datablock 3 nine
    sensors 4 16 sensors 5 get status 6 uses parameter: set poll
    interval 1 - 60 minutes

    read_ws read response from WS2000 returns read buffer length is
    checked envelope is removed checksum is not yet checked (blame on
    me)

    close_ws closes the serial port

  enteredby:   MMBK (Michael Böker)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 30 09:04:01 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::WS2000::
::IO              bdpfp Basic IO function for WS2000 Receiver        MMBK
