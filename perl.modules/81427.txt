The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::JP::MUFG
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Checks balances and transactions of MUFG.
  userid:      PERFORB (Yusuke Maeda)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    https://github.com/perforb/p5-Finance-Bank-JP-MUFG

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::US::INGDirect

  rationale:

    I chose this namespace, following the similar modules that are
    already registered. As I felt sure it's useful for those who live in
    the same country as me, I want to register this module.

  enteredby:   PERFORB (Yusuke Maeda)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul 17 02:37:51 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::JP::
::MUFG            bdpOp Checks balances and transactions of MUFG.    PERFORB
