Actually, the hardware is not Mac, really.  I mean, sorta, but not really.
Apple likes to call the whole machine "Macintosh", but there are clones
that run Mac OS too.  Most of what makes Mac hardware Mac hardware is in
software these days (the ROM has been moved to software).

Most people think of "Mac" as just being a generic way to talk about
Macintoshes, hardware or software.

Agreed.

That seems to be the case.

Yep.

I am not saying it is a great way to do it (and I wouldn't mind a better
system); but part of the problem of modules@perl.org is that most of the
people who can be on the list (that know enough about the issues involved,
etc.) are (not merely conincidentally) also very busy people in general.  :)
