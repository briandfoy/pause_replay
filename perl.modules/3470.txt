Hi,

I have written a set of Perl modules that are used to grab backend 
news from different sites and dynamically dsplay it on any websites.
The Beta 1.0.25 version of this "NewsGrabber" module is available 
at http://backendnews.sourceforge.net 

Can you please let me know if this module is worthy of being included 
in the CPAN listing ?? Since the module is still in Beta, I would 
not like to distribute it for proper use riight not. So can you suggest 
the steps that I need to take to regsiter this module, when it reaches 
its "gold" state ?? 

Thanks and regards
Srijith
