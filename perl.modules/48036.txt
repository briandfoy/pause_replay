Subject: Module submission Text::CSV::Separator

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::CSV::Separator
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Determine the field separator of a CSV file
  userid:      ENELL (Enrique Nell)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::CSV::DetectSeparator

  rationale:

    I selected the Text::CSV:: namespace, which already includes
    several modules related to CSV processing.

    There's already one module in CPAN for this task, but my approach
    is completely different. My module doesn't require the support of
    other modules and it is quite fast. In most cases it will detect the
    separator after processing only a few lines of the CSV file (in
    particular, if the file contains a header line, processing one line
    will be enough to determine the separator).

  enteredby:   ENELL (Enrique Nell)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 26 23:34:34 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::CSV::
::Separator       bdpfp Determine the field separator of a CSV file  ENELL
