all lowercase names are conventionally reserved.  It's just
a convention.  However, since the similar modules have 
capitalized their initializations, you should too.

I'd like to see something in the name that says it works on
multiple strings at once.

it might even be good to make that the base implementation for
the other modules that do it with only two strings. :)
