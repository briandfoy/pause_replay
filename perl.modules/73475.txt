Hi, Ron.  You sent this to the "Modules" list, which is for PAUSE
admin requests.  Did  you mean module-authors@perl.org instead?

FWIW, File::HomeDir and Config::Tiny are great choices, but I wouldn't
put it under .cpan since people might think it was created by CPAN.pm.
 You might consider using the new "my_dist_config" method from the
latest File::HomeDir.
