'Not suitable' can have many meanings. If the module contains
proprietary information, or bears a restrictive license, it is not
suitable. If it contains functionality that makes only sense in the
context of some company specific application, I'd say it classifies as
suitable for distribution.

Yes, there are several hooks attached to a solution like that.
Hoewever, I do agree that such a construct would be very nice to have.
Compare for example the YUM and PPM package managers, where one can
add as many repositories as desired. AFAIK, current CPAN (don't know
about CPANPLUS) is restricted to one single index that contains all.

As stated, if it does not contain information that may not be
published or spread, there's no problem in putting it on CPAN.

While I write this, the YAPC::Europe conference in Birmingham has
started. One of the items on the agenda is a new structure for CPAN.
I'm curious whether it deals with the above issue.
