The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PJL::Configurator
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Interface to PJL compatible HP printers
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The closest module to PJL::Configurator is PCL::Simple, and even
    then only in the fact that PCL (Printer Command Language) and PJL
    (Printer Job Language) are related.

    There are no modules that have anything to do with PJL on CPAN
    currently.

    This is my first module, I am trying to mirror the setup of
    PCL::Simple as close as possible.

    I then propose the namespace of PJL:: for all modules that I or
    others may write having to do with PJL.

    The reason this module should be listed and the uniqueness of my
    approach is both the same reason, the perl community dosent have it.

    Any comments or suggestions by other more experienced CPAN module
    authors are very welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

PJL::
::Configurator    cdpOp Interface to PJL compatible HP printers      CMORRIS
