Why didn't you fill out these bits? At least, there should have been 
mention of Win32::Exe - at least since the module name is very simiar.

The functionality doesn't seem to be, however, and the name should in my 
opinion reflect that it is a tool to deal with perlapp only.

If you had supplied a rationale why this module should be named the way 
it is, perhaps I could have understood your reasoning?

Steffen
