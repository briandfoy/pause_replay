Hi,

Is there some criteria for modules being listed on the modules list
beyond giving a DSLI line? Here're the DLSI's for the modules I'd like
listed:


Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
CGI::
QuickForm      Rdpf  Easy & takes care of CGI form user interface SUMMER

Lingua::EN::
NameCase       Rdpf  Convert NAMES and names to Correct Case      SUMMER

Math::
Logic          RdpO  Pure 2 & 3 value plus multi-value logic      SUMMER

Text::
MacroScript    RdpO  C pre-processor type macros eg for HTML      SUMMER

readonly       Rdpn  Readonly scalars (compare with constant.pm)  SUMMER



readonly.pm is being uploaded to CPAN at the moment. I have long wanted
to use $SCALAR constants but hadn't realised 'til now how easily
achievable it is. I assume that new pragmas are 'allowed'?

The other modules have been available for some time; I don't know how
often (or if!) they are downloaded from CPAN (stats would be nice!), but
from my own site I get a lot of people taking CGI::QuickForm and
Math::Logic.
