Greetings PAUSE admins,

I've been unable to contact the owner of Sybase::RepAgent and
Sybase::TdsServer.  I'm including the most recent attempts to contact
the owner.

What must be done at this point for me to obtain co-ownership of the
two modules?

thanks

Jason

Hi everyone,

sorry for asking again, but does anyone know of any alternative contact
information for Bernd Dulfer?  I've been trying to contact him
regarding his Sybase::RepAgent and Sybase::TdsServer modules.  If I'm
unable to contact him, I'll ask to take ownership of the modules.

thanks

jason
