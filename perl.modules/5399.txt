I just used your nifty new namespace registration widget to enter
AnyLoader and I was about to do Email::Find but I've run into two
snags...

The interface choices... where would you put AnyLoader?  You use it
and it just works.  Perhaps 'm' for 'magical'? :) I think this has
befuddled other modules as well.  Lingua::Romana::Perligata and Bleach
are listed as having an OO interface, which doesn't seem right, but
perhaps he put in O for 'other'?  Perhaps 'l' for things which modify
the language itself?


The other is license issues.  Email::Find uses the Perl license with
a caveat...

LICENSE
       This module may not be used for the purposes of sending
       unsolicited email (ie. spamming) in any way, shape or form
       or for the purposes of generating lists for commercial
       sale without explicit permission from the author.

       For everyone else this module is free software; you may
       redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as
       Perl itself.

That seems to fall squarely under "Other (but still Free)", but
nothing applicable is available from the widget.
