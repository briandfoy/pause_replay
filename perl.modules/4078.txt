Hi,

I've been doing some genetic programming with perl recently but
didn't see any modules which help with the drudgery of splicing
things in and out of arrays in twenty slightly different ways
so have written one.  These modules offer base classes which
implement a range of mutations suitable for any sequential
genes.  One (Simple) just ensures that sensible arguments are
passed to each method while the other (Sequence) also provides
a means to enforce a gene grammar.

This has been discussed fairly widely, with requests for comments
on usenet, and the perlai mailing list.  I've had a couple of
emails expressing support and some warnings about the problems
associated with genetic algorithms in perl (speed wise) but for
some problem areas (eg. music composition) these become less
of a problem, so these modules should be useful to someone even
if not in any (computationally) serious context.
