Dear CPAN Module Maintainers,

Thank you for your prompt response.  We would like to register CAIDA
as a developer of Perl modules for CPAN.  We have created a new email
alias: cpan@caida.org that will reach all of our Perl developers.  Our 
web page is www.caida.org.  Our preferred user-ID is CAIDA itself.
The first contribution we will make is version 2.0 of Chart-Graph.pm;
however, we have a number of Perl modules in development and will be
submitting them shortly.

Thank you again for your assistance and support of the Perl community!


Peace, Edouard
