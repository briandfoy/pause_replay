True. I should've been a little more descriptive. I was also thinking 
that ::Commerce actually made a framework to tie the other Business:: 
modules together, like ::Shopping and ::Payment.

I'm starting with the cart, which could also just be Business::Cart, but 
I plan on taking that all the way to ::Orders, ::Quotes, ::Wishlist, etc.

Well, I thought of that too, but I guess I was under the impression that 
  the last resort was a new toplevel. On top of that, I just can't think 
of anything cool enough to be another toplevel. :-)
