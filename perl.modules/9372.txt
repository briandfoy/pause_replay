The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chatbot::TalkerBot
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Talker (telnet-accessible chat areas) client
  userid:      PKENT (Piers Kent)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    Talkers are simple chat systems, a bit like IRC but everyone
    telnets to the same machine and just talks. There are no modules
    that implement a talker client, so that's what this does. It
    provides a couple of utility methods to get you connected, and then
    you create a talker robot object.

    The robot object has methods to do all the things you'd expect, and
    it also has built-in ability to listen for and act on commands. An
    example use is where I whisper: > robot help and it replies robot
    >TalkerBot version 1.8! robot >Lines In: 234 ...

    Obviously you can do a lot more :-) (sorry if you got this twice)

The resulting entry would be:

Chatbot::
::TalkerBot       RdpOp Talker (telnet-accessible chat areas) client PKENT
