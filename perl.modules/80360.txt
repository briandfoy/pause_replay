The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::BinarySearch
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Binary Search ordered lists.
  userid:      DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://github.com/daoswald/List-BinarySearch

  similar:

  rationale:

    This implementation of a binary search acts upon flat lists (not
    binary search trees). Lists can be passed as plain old flat lists,
    or by way of array ref, which ever is more convenient. This is a
    general solution that is applicable to any sorted list.

    As I've searched CPAN I find plenty of linear searches, some binary
    tree searches, but I don't find a general solution providing O(log
    n) searches of flat lists. This module provides just that.

    The initial release is a pure Perl developer's testing release. The
    next step will be to add an optional XS component as
    List::BinarySearch::XS that can plug-in to this module.

The resulting entry would be:

List::
::BinarySearch    bdpfp Binary Search ordered lists.                 DAVIDO
