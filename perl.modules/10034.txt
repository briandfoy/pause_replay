The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::MsgQ
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: guaranteed message delivery system
  userid:      SPIRITSKY (Peter Tschipper)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    MsgQ is a guaranteed message delivery system that is based on Send
    and Recieve queues. It's very easy for administrators to setup the
    queues and collect data from various sources around the network and
    generate on the fly web pages using CGI. Although the system was
    originally designed for administrators there are no doubt other
    applications that could benefit from a system that guarantees the
    delivery of one and only one message. One unique thing about the
    send queues is their ability to read from messages from an incoming
    socket, as would be the case with a telephone switch that has "data
    steps" programmed into it. I've used this in a production
    environment and it works great especially since the telephone
    switches can not open a socket connection to a process that lives in
    a different domain. In a case like this all you have to do is setup
    the send queue in the same domain as the switch and have your
    receive queue on your web server which may be somewhere across the
    WAN.

    I think this module either belongs under the Net::MsgQ namespace or
    needs it's own MsgQ::...I don't see it belonging anywhere else
    unless you have other ideas...
