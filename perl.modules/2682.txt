Edouard,

    I'm delighted that CAIDA will be represented on CPAN.  You can
create an area by registering a new account:

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/04pause.html#registering

    You won't need to do anything special to be able to upload Chart-Graph
2.0 to your area, as long as it has a unique filename.

    Peace,
