Hi!

some time ago (about 3 months ago to be more precise), I set the
"lifecycle" module metadata setting on pause to "Can be deleted from the
database" for a number of my modules (e.g. Algorithm::FEC).

They are still listed on e.g.
http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html, so I guess they can, but
haven't been deleted :)

Does anybody know when these entries will eventually be deleted? Right now
these entries only serve to confuse readers of the modulelist.

Thanks!

(If this mail address is the wrong place to ask this question I'd like to
apologize in advance).
