SQL::DBI       RmpO  Wrapper for DBI that generates SQL.

It has been mentioned on one of the DBI lists (many months ago).  There was
some interest (a couple of downloads).  (It may have been named Shashou
then, I'm not sure.

As for the naming, it is arbitrary to me, so if you think another would be
better I'm very open to it.  I chose the SQL hierarchy as its primary
function is to generate SQL, which seemed related to other modules there
(like SQL::Parser).
