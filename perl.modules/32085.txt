The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Truth_Table
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Create and manipulate truth tables
  userid:      MJCARMAN (Michael Carman)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa

  similar:

  rationale:

    The baseline for this functionality is embedded in the report
    generation features of Devel::Cover. It has the potential to be
    useful outside of this specific application, however, so I've broken
    it out into it's own module. The target application is still code
    coverage (not digital design), so the Devel::* namespace seems the
    right place for it.

  enteredby:   MJCARMAN (Michael Carman)
  enteredon:   Thu May 20 13:44:33 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Truth_Table     bdpOa Create and manipulate truth tables           MJCARMAN
