     why:

    Iâ€™d like to contribute a package I wrote that allows you to take an
    array of objects and sort them based on the return value of a
    function call to those objects. I have to do a little more checking
    on the namespace for this package, but a brief description is listed
    below.

    Sort::Objects is intended to make it simple to sort a list of
    objects by one of the return values of a function on those objects.
    It is able to tell the difference between words and numbers and thus
    sort them appropriately. The goal of this package is to eliminate
    the need to write custom sorting code for each type of object you
    would want to sort.
