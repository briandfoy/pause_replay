Hi,
    I am writing a module to interface to the IBM LoadLeveler software.=20
LoadLeveler is used for "dynamic workload management" on large AIX server=
s=20
and MPP systems, very basically it is a batch scheduling system.

I would like a namespace of LoadLeveler, is this appropriate ?


Thanks for your time


Mike
