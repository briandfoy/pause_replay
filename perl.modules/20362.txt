I was originally going to put "US" in there somewhere, but this module
can be used internationally as long as the data is available.  I'm
packaging the module with a generic loader for populating the database
with US Census data, but it could just as easily populate it with data for
other countries, if it's available.

P.S.  Johan, I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity!  I originally learned
Perl many years ago using only your quick reference guide! :)
