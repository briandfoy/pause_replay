The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ai::nnflex
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Flexible API for neural networks
  userid:      CCOLBOURN (Charles Colbourn)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    ai-neuralnet-mesh ai-neuralnet-backprop ai-neuralnet-simple

  rationale:

    Various NN modules exist in the AI namespace. As far as I can tell
    the only NN modules in native perl - AI-neuralnet-mesh &
    AI-neuralnet-backprop modules written by Josiah Bryan - aren't being
    maintained anymore. AI-neuralnet-simple is purely backprop, and much
    simpler than either Josiahs or mine.

    My module comes with feedforward & backprop plugins, but is
    designed to allow easy development of other types of network as
    plugins, rather than having to rewrite existing code. Its purely
    written in perl, so its slow as neural net packages go, but pretty
    simple to understand and modify. I intend to write additional
    plugins for gamma networks in the future, as well as a cli frontend
    & a tk frontend.

The resulting entry would be:

ai::
::nnflex          cdpOp Flexible API for neural networks             CCOLBOURN
