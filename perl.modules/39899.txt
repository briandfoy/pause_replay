The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Fork
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: A simpe and intuitive interface to fork()
  userid:      ARISTOTLE (Αριστοτέλης Παγκαλτζής)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    rt.cpan.org

  similar:
    Proc::Forkfunc

  rationale:

    Proc::Forkfunc is the only module that is similar in scope, but it
    has a slightly different approach and far less .

    All the many other fork()-related modules seem to assume a parent
    process that forks many children and concentrate on offering
    facilities to simplify regulating such a scenario.

    The Proc::Fork interface only abstracts a single fork() call,
    aiming for syntactic sugar that increases readability.

    The choice of name is simply natural. Note that it's not my call;
    the module has been on CPAN for several years, I am just the new
    maintainer. But it's hard to imagine a better, or even just a
    different name.

  enteredby:   ARISTOTLE (Αριστοτέλης Παγκαλτζής)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 24 07:16:10 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Proc::
::Fork            Rdpfp A simpe and intuitive interface to fork()    ARISTOTLE
