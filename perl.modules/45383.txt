The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::TOTD
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Tip Of The Day dialog for PerlTk
  userid:      KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tk::Toplevel, Tk::Splash

  rationale:

    Tk::TOTD provides a Tip of the Day style dialog box for Perl/Tk
    apps. It's a highly customizable TOTD-style Toplevel that can be
    used for a wide variety of things--not only limited to Tip of the
    Day: All labels, colors, and images can be customized.

    Tk::TOTD is an appropriate namespace because TOTD is the acronym
    for Tip Of The Day.

  enteredby:   KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  enteredon:   Sun Oct 16 20:09:12 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::TOTD            adpfp Tip Of The Day dialog for PerlTk             KIRSLE
