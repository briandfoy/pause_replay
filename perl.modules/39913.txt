Sorry if I gave that impression.

File::Find::Iterator is an mjd-inspired iterator implenetation as
lexical closures, with Class::Iterator O-O dressing wrapped around,
many features, but no support for prune.

My find module is desperately bereft of features, nothing but what's
in the summary I emailed out, and implemented directly as an OO
module.

Give the author of File::Find::Iterator another week, or perhaps
longer, seems in order, but seizing ownership would make me
squemish, my module has no connection with his other than the fact
that mjd inspired us both, and mine's a lot less featureful.
