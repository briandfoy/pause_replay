Subject: Module namespace for BerkeleyDB based Caching

From: rba@cpan.org (Roman Baumer)

Dear all,

I like to release my module currently named Cache::BerkeleyDB into the  
wild,
but unfortunately the name is allready taken. So, I will rename the  
module.

Can you please help my to find an appropriate namespace. The module  
does allow
caching and has a similar interface like IPC::SharedCache, but is using
BerkeleyDB::Btree to store it's data. It has noting to do with the  
Cache:Cache
interface.

Regards,
Roman Baumer
