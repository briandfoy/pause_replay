Hi,

    Over a year ago I uploaded a module, followed the process for registering
    the module to a tee, and the module STILL isn't listed under my CPAN
    login:

    MAXSCHUBE

    Nmap::Scanner

    What is going on here?  I did the request for a namespace THREE TIMES and
    now I want to upload an updated version of my module but the old one still
    isn't listed as registered under my ID?  What gives?

Regards,
Max
