The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perl6::Interpolators
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: Use Perl 6 function-interpolation syntax
  userid:      BRENTDAX (Brent Dax)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    PerlMonks, perl6-language

  similar:

  rationale:

    I picked this namespace because it makes perfect sense--it
    simulates Perl 6's interpolation. Also, Perl6:: has already been
    created--it holds Damian Conway's Perl6::Variables module.
    (Actually, Damian was the one who suggested using Perl6::--I'd
    originally written it for Filter::.) It's a source filter--I don't
    know of a better way to implement it (or another way without
    patching the interpreter, for that matter)--thus it has no
    interface. It ought to be listed because it has uses outside work on
    Perl 6. (We /are/ putting this feature in for a reason, y'know...)

The resulting entry would be:

Perl6::
::Interpolators   bdpnp Use Perl 6 function-interpolation syntax     BRENTDAX
