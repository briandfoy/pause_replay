Hi Galen,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I working through situations where t=
here are permissions oddities with CPAN distributions, or conflicts betwe=
en two or more distributions.

This affects your MARC/XML releases. It looks like this is what happened =
in the past:

=E2=80=A2 User BBIRTH first released the distribution MARC-XML, which con=
tained the module MARC::XML
=E2=80=A2 User ESUMMERS took over the distribution, and renamed the MARC:=
:XML module to be MARC::=46ile::XML, and added MARC::=46ile::SAX to the d=
istribution. But the distribution name renamed MARC-XML.
=E2=80=A2 User KADOS took over, and did a number of releases, the last on=
e in 2007. Same distribution name, same two modules.
=E2=80=A2 You took over the distribution in 2009, and in the first three =
releases, didn=E2=80=99t change any of the naming.
=E2=80=A2 You did a 1.0 release of MARC-XML, where you dropped MARC::=46i=
le::SA, as you were using XML::LibXML.
=E2=80=A2 Then in 2017 you renamed the distribution to be MARC-=46ile-XML=
, to match the module name, as per PAUSE=E2=80=99s expectations.

Because the old MARC-XML releases are still in your directory (and those =
of the previous authors), if a user searches on MetaCPAN, they can appear=
s find two different modules called MARC::=46ile::XML, but really one is =
an earlier version of the other.

I think the best way to resolve this situation is:

=E2=80=A2 =46or you to delete the old releases of MARC-XML from your auth=
or directory on PAUSE
=E2=80=A2 =46or BBIRTH to delete MARC-XML 0.4 from his author directory o=
n PAUSE
=E2=80=A2 =46or ESUMMERS to delete all releases of MARC-XML from his auth=
or directory on PAUSE
=E2=80=A2 =46or KADOS to similarly delete all releases of MARC-XML from h=
is author directory on PAUSE

Then we=E2=80=99ll end up with just the latest version of MARC::=46ile::X=
ML showing up on MetaCPAN, and much less chance of someone accidentally i=
nstalling an old release.

I=E2=80=99ve copied BBIRTH, ESUMMERS, and KADOS in on this email as well.=


If you=E2=80=99re all happy with this plan, I can schedule the deletion o=
f the old releases on your behalf. Is that ok=3F

Cheers,
Neil
