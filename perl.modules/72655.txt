Hi there,

We're trying to use Text::Hunspell.

It seems that the currently this module, at least
on Debian stable, is unusable.

We have worked out a solution, and tried to contact
the author (eleonora@cpan.org) without any response
in about a week.

I also tried to contact him/her to her private email
address which I found on tkltrans.sf.net (lantol46@yahoo.de).
No response so far.

I'm working on a new version of the module
that compiles and runs the tests.

In the meantime, can I get (co-)maintainership status (COSIMO@cpan.org) ?
Thanks,
