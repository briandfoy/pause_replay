Hi gang

This is mainly a mistake on my part.

I'd spoken before Tassilo about doing some updated releases to fix the
packaging issues, and he was fine with it.

When I looked at the permissions last week to do so, I saw Jens as the
primary. But when I looked at his page it appeared that he had never
released it. I assumed this meant that he had done an accidental
release of the namespace many years ago but then deleted the upload
(creating a persistent primary) and so all of Tassilo's work had been
done under secondary. I didn't realise he'd handed off permissions,
and so I have myself the secondary to do the packaging update.

The two releases I've done contain no changes to List::MoreUtils
whatsoever, I only updated the way it was packaged to flush out some
long standing false positive test failures and get it off the FAIL 100
list.

Nothing I've changed has any effect on the module itself, and Jens
should be able to continue his work and do his first release as per
normal.

Sorry for the confusion.
