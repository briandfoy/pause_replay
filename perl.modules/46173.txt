Who needs a stubbing tool *after* development ? It would only hide
bugs.

According to the author, this module is intented to be used *during*
the development of an application. So most application author will
probably remove it once their application dev is done.

So (IMHO), I think that Devel::Autostub is better than a Class::*
name.
