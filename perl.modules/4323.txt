Description : Lightweight IIS emulation under Apache 
DSLI	      : impO

Have been in contact with Joshua Chamas, author of Apache::ASP (enclosed)
who suggest publishing it in the Apache::ASP::Lite namespace. (Originally
Apache::ASPLite)

thanks

I use it to write "ASP ready" CGI scripts under Apache. It makes for future
porting to IIS almost seamless. 

thanks for your input on this...

Have you looked at Apache::ASP?  http://www.apache-asp.org

If you wanted to submit this to CPAN, I would recommend a
CGI::ASP::Lite module, since this is really for use under
CGI style programming.  But tell me, why have ASP objects
under CGI, where there are other CGI interfaces, especially
CGI.pm ?

Also note, I plan to release a CGI compatible Apache::ASP
version one day, but have never been inspired to finish the
job.  Let me know if this would interest you.  As it provides
a full ASP environment though it will be much slower to run,
but would provide things like full script compilation, and 
richer API.
