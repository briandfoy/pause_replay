     why:

    I plan to contribute a perl app called vuser with associated
    modules. vuser is designed to automate many backend sysadmin tasks
    such as adding users for postfix, courier and asterisk. It also has
    early support for managing bind zone files. Tasks can be run from
    either a shell or via a SOAP interface.

    vuser supports a plugin system that allows others to create modules
    to support any system or task they need. It is possible to unite
    related modules to that a single command can, for example, add a
    user to postfix, setup spamassassin dirs and create the user's
    personal web space.

    The vuser web site is at http://vuser.org/
