I'm not sure I understand the connection between CGI and CPL. I assume 
you are referring to the HTML generation capabilities of CGI.pm? I 
believe the general consensus is nowadays that those shouldn't have been 
part of CGI.pm but a different library.

 From your dscription, I believe CPL or Video::CPL would be fine. I'd 
stay away from CGI::CPL if possible.

I generally agree with this assessment, but see below.

My thoughts exactly.

Searching for CPL using google and on Wikipedia, I did not find your use 
of the acronym in the disambiguation page of Wikipedia. There were, 
however, a few other prominent meanings. The one that worries me a 
little regarding a top-level namespace is:

"The Call-Processing Language: An XML-based language used to describe 
and control Internet telephony services"

It is, of course, a completely different thing. But some keywords are 
related and may contribute to confusion.

Since I don't have a better suggestion, I'd be fine with CPL as a 
top-level namespace. Video::CPL seems relatively appropriate as well.

Best regards,
Steffen
