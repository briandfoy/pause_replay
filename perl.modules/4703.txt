'edit modules' only knows about modules that have been registered
(i.e., stored in the database). Apparently, SlideShow and
Class::MethodMapper have not yet been entered in the database. 
If you send a DSLI entry for these modules, we can register them.
It's probably best to register WWW::SlideShow after it's renamed.
