     why:

    A Perl module which allows one to connect to the Tridion CMS's SOAP
    interface and perform various useful actions upon it. This is more
    useful than it sounds as that CMS contains no meaningful documention
    on this interface, so a lot of stuff is reverse-engineered. However
    it's not patented info or anything so should be fine.

    I also have a module to connect to Minidisc players via the NetMD
    USB interface that i'd like to contribute sometime, although as it's
    a totally reverse-engineered protocol, I should probably check on
    the legality before I submit that one.

    I also have some addon's for the OpenGuides/CGI::Wiki stuff managed
    by Kake and Earle.
