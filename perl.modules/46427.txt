One part of my PhD work is comparing various intrusion detection
algorithms.  I have a framework running, and I have a PAUSE ID.  The
test framework has two parts, a data source, and a learning/testing
algorithm (most of the testing I am doing is with anomaly detection
algorithms, hence the learning part).

I propose the following namespace:
IDS::Test - the test framework itself.
IDS::Source - the base of the IDS data source hierarchy.  I will be
providing IDS::Source::HTTP, and possibly some generic sources as well.
IDS::Algorithm - the base of the IDS algorithm hierarchy.  I will be
providing several of these, such as IDS::Algorithm::DFA,
IDS::Algorithm::HMM, IDS::Algorithm::Length, etc.

The idea of the framework is that any algorithm should work with any
data source.  I have it running on my machine now, with four functioning
algorithms, and several more in varying stages of completion.

Any objections or modifications to the proposed hierarchy?
