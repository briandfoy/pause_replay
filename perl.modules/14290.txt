The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ExtUtils::XSLink
  DSLIP:       cdcfp
  description: runtime binding for XS modules
  userid:      JASON (Jason Adams)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    not sure yet

  similar:
    ExtUtils::Depend

  rationale:

    Although I haven't tried ExtUtils:Depend these are the two main
    differences I can see. ExtUtils::XSLink does it's linking at run
    time rather than build. Also ExtUtils::XSLink uses a perl hash to
    pass function pointers rather than using a linker. Thus it should be
    more machine independent. Also it should soon be possible to
    dynamically select which XS module is linked against.

The resulting entry would be:

ExtUtils::
::XSLink          cdcfp runtime binding for XS modules               JASON
