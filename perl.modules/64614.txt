Subject: Module submission IPC::Lite

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: share variables between processes
  userid:      EARONESTY (Erik Aronesty)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://code.google.com/p/ipc-lite/

  similar:
    IPC::Sharelite

  rationale:

    Shared memory implementations vary in their stability and support
    for multiple platforms.

    SQLite, however, is extremely reliable on a broad range of
    platforms.

    Accordingly it's possible to create a shared memory structure that
    accomodates complex perl variables (multiple nested references,
    etc.) without resorting to platform-dependent code (or, at least,
    without much of it).

    IPC::Lite does this now, and works well on, at least, Mac, Win, BSD
    and Linux.

    It also has a cute syntax.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::Lite            bdpOp share variables between processes            EARONESTY
