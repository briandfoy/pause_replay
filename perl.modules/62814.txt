Hi Andreas et al,

I know I wrote in about this before, but it seems everything is set up
correctly now.

For some reason, my lib-0.60.tar.gz is not being indexed by PAUSE. I got
the permissions and META.yml clearly advertises that the distribution
has a lib.pm.

Any insight? Any idea how to fix it on my side?

Cheers,
Steffen
