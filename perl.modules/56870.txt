Ah.  I see.

As it turns out, I figured that I would leave the base namespace clear
and just add subordinate modules, for instance FameHLI::API and a couple
of others.  The current FameHLI::API module is a very low level access
layer to Fame software (www.fame.com).  While I don't currently have
plans for a FameHLI.pm module, if an idea presents itself as a more
Perl-ish fashion, the namespace is ready and the low level sub-module is
already there.

Or something like that...

TTFN,
--daveo
(That's my story and I'm sticking to it.)
