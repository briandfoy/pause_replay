    I would strongly favor Crypt::ECDSA, etc.  Almost all of the
cryptographic algorithm modules are named Crypt::<algorithm name>,
and it's a system that makes sense.

    If you don't know what ECDSA is, then you probably don't have a
use for it.  And if you do want ECDSA, you don't want just any old
pseudovariant of DSA that's based on some kind of elliptic curve math
or another -- you want exactly that standard.
