The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::File::Ver
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: Reads Win32 exe,dll (PE) version information
  userid:      ALEXEYT (Alexey Toptygin)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace reasonong: this is a Win32-only module so it's under
    Win32:: It reads file version information, therefore
    Win32::File::Ver. The last bit is shortened to Ver from Version,
    because the Microsoft library it links to is called version.dll and
    if they have the same name the Microsoft compiler gets confused.

    Also, there already was a module of the same name that did the same
    thing (albeit using Win32::API, not XS) that was written by Mike
    Blazer sometime in 1999. This seems to have vanished off the face of
    the earth (and was never on CPAN).

    This module is a perl wrapper for the Win32 Version API. It lets
    you read the version information resource from files in the
    Microsoft Portable Executable (PE) format (including programs, DLLs,
    fonts, etc).

    This module is useful for writing installers, or other tools that
    need to deal with versioned programs or DLLs.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::File::
