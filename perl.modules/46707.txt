Subject: Module submission Mail::Sender::Friendly

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Sender::Friendly
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: User friendly "email or die" style subclass
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module makes it "Easy" and "Simple" to use Mail::Sender.

    It does so by giving you a

    "single funtion/method" or die

    conscise interface to all of Mail::Sender's multitude of methods to
    accomplish very complex things without needing to remember the order
    and necessary calls to make to make it happen *and* have a single
    way to check for failure (or die ...) vs Mail::Sender's multiple,
    hard to remember ways to check for failure

    This is the 3rd time registering as "Easy"and "Simple" were shot
    down as too vague, etc.

    If this name is not acceptable either I beg someone to recommend
    something that is short and descriptive of what I am trying to do
    that will be approved as all of my requests for that so far go
    unanswered.

    I chose "Friendly" because it makes is "Simple" to use by being
    more "User Friendly" by being:

    do or die; in stead of

    openthis

    open that

    close that

    close this

    or was it the other way around, did I encode it right or did I use
    the raw send? and now which of the 3 ways do I use to see if it
    failed and how do I do each one again?

    If this is no good either *please* recommend something that is more
    what you're looking for, thanks!
