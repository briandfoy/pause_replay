The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       caGRID::CQL1
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Query the caGRID services using CQL
  userid:      BOSBORNE (Brian Osborne)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://cagrid.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This code is dedicated to submitting and retrieving from caGRID.
    caGrid is a service-oriented platform that supports initiatives in
    basic, translational, and clinical research. The focus of caGRID at
    the moment is primarily cancer research, and publicly available data
    offered by caGRID currently is concerned with proteins and genes and
    experiments on proteins and genes as they relate to cancer.

    The modules in this package are dedicated to constructing,
    validating, and sending CQL queries to caGRID, as CQL is the
    structured XML query language used in caGRID.

  enteredby:   BOSBORNE (Brian Osborne)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 24 13:52:33 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

caGRID::
::CQL1            RdpOo Query the caGRID services using CQL          BOSBORNE
