Hi, I found and downloaded the following module:
http://search.cpan.org/~syamal/Uniq-0.01/Uniq.pm

And found that the "distinct" subroutine has a bug. I've Identified the
problem, but don't know how to fix the module on the CPAN site...

In the source:
sub distinct{
	# Eliminates values mentioned more than once from a list of
	# sorted values presented.
	my $prev =3D undef;
	my $ctr =3D 0;
	my @out;
	foreach my $val (@_){
		if ($prev){
			if ($prev eq $val){
				$ctr ++;
				next;  			 #<--- this is a
bug in the CPAN module...It needs to be removed...DKG
			}
			push(@out,$prev) if ($ctr =3D=3D 1);
			$prev =3D $val;
			$ctr  =3D 1;
			next;
		}else{
			$prev =3D $val;
			$ctr  =3D 1;
		}

	}
	return @out;
}

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
There are a couple ways to fix the problem, I'll leave it to someone
else to figure out the best way, but the simplist way is just to remove
the line I've identified above...
