The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RHP::Timer
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A low footprint hires timer abstraction
  userid:      PHRED (Fred Moyer)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    use.perl.org

  similar:
    Time::HiRes

  rationale:

    This module makes it easy to gather high resolution timing
    information with a minimun of syntax. It uses Time::HiRes but
    doesn't import any symbols to save memory on large installations. It
    uses methods qw( new start stop last checkpoint interval).

    The tests include accuracy and precision measurements, so make test
    will tell you the wallclock resolution you can expect on your
    platform. If all tests pass, you have the default resolution, if
    some don't you'll see how yours compares to the platform where all
    pass.

    I wrote this module to make it easy to place high resolution timers
    in codebases with a minimum of syntax impact on the coder, and a
    maximum of information gathered. Also I try to maintain a low
    footprint of the code (no symbols imported). My timing calls in an
    apache installation went from 3 lines of crap to 1 line of readable
    code.

The resulting entry would be:

RHP::
::Timer           bdpOp A low footprint hires timer abstraction      PHRED
