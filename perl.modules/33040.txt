The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Magick::BarChart
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple interface for creating bar charts
  userid:      AWESTHOLM (Alexander Christian Westholm)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    PostScript::Graph::Bar

  rationale:

    Tucked away under the Image::Magick namespace, the name of this
    module clearly implies that it is for creating bar charts, and bar
    charts alone, using Image::Magick. It is simple in its approach. The
    BarChart object can be thought of as a widget placed on an
    Image::Magick canvas. As of yet, it does not deal with the area
    surrounding the graph, such as labeling of axes, and generation of
    keys. It merely provides a convenient, simple way to create graphs
    of data and stick them anywhere inside an Image::Magick canvas. That
    being said, it aims to be fairly flexible in how it does this, and
    makes most all of its potential parameters configurable. Of course,
    since simplicity is the goal, you can create super-simple charts
    using almost no options.
