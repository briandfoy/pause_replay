a description of what you're planning to contribute

dbfileutil.pl Ver 1.0


Export/Import between DB_File and SDBM_File
from Windows and Unix platforms

SDBM_Files can be ftp'ed across Unix/Windows
platforms and work without a hitch. (.pag and
.dir files).  DB_Files CANT be ftp'ed across
platform.  (something to do with edian)
I like to use DB_File instead of SDBM_File
This util will export a DB_File to SDBM_Files
for you to ftp.  Then you can import the
files (after ftping) to autoconvert to DB_File
at destination workstation using this same
util.  You can also clean up the SDBM_Files
after you are done ftping (source side) and
done importing (destination side)
This same code will work on the unix or win
side.  NOTE: be sure DB_File has less than
1024 bytes per entry, or it wont fit into a
SDBM_File (unless you recompile the SDBM_File
to support bigger buckets.

I have tons of perl stuff.  I'll try to contribute
soon as I get an id.  check this out...
