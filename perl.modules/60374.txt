The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EMC::Symcli::Symm
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl Interface to EMC Symmetrix Symcli
  userid:      FUNKJAMES (James Spurin)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    EMC::WideSky::symmaskdb

  rationale:

    The current namespace EMC already exists, as the module will be
    interacting with EMC Symmetrix Storage Arrays it seems appropriate
    to continue with this namespace convention.

    I have chosen Symcli as opposed to Widesky as Widesky is now a
    legacy naming convention and is no longer used within the public
    domain. The 'Widesky' software is now called Solutions Enabler but
    more commonly refered to as Symcli.

    In comparison to Lukas Fiker symmaskdb module the module I have
    created is similar but much more extensive. It is designed to
    provide an interface to the whole EMC Symmetrix storage array as
    opposed to the area of the masking database.

    Through the use of OOP function calls the user can interrograte
    many areas of the array, command output has also been combined to
    provide simple functions that combine the logic from many different
    commands.

    These commands include -

    symdev symconfigure symcfg symdg symdisk symmask symmaskdb symrdf

  enteredby:   FUNKJAMES (James Spurin)
  enteredon:   Tue May  6 13:03:11 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

EMC::Symcli::
::Symm            bdpOp Perl Interface to EMC Symmetrix Symcli       FUNKJAMES
