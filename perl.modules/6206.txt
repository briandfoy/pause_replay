The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::SKey
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Perl S/Key calculator
  userid:      KWILLIAMS (Ken Williams)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    (none)

  similar:
    Digest::MD4

  rationale:

    This is a simple module that calculates S/Key challenge responses.
    It's interesting to note how much more straightforward the Perl code
    is than the standard C code, even though it's doing lots of
    bit-twiddling and stuff. As such, it's a modestly interesting module
    just for the code comparison to C.

    If this should go in the Digest:: namespace instead of the Crypt::
    namespace, let me know. Wasn't sure. It uses Digest::MD4, but I
    think most people think of S/Key as a way of encrypting their
    password transmissions (even though that's technically not what's
    happening).

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::SKey            bdpfp Perl S/Key calculator                        KWILLIAMS
