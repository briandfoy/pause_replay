Subject: PAUSE Registration/ Module Net::Hesiod package
Cc: payerle@physics.umd.edu
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: payerle@phys-mail1.physics.umd.edu ("Thomas M. Payerle")

Hi,
I have written a Perl interface to the Hesiod library API, which I would
like to contribute.  The CPAN docs indicated that I should email to this
list to registerto use PAUSE and/or register the module name.  I have been
using the name Net::Hesiod for the package, as that is where I believe it
belongs, but am open to other suggestions.  The package is currently working,
but needs some minor work for porting to other systems, docs, etc.

Preferred CPAN ID: PAYERLE
Contribution: Net::Hesiod - an interface to the Hesiod library.  Provides
	non-OO routines hesiod_init, hesiod_resolve, etc. plus a simple
	OO wrapper ($obj=new Net::Hesiod; $obj->resolve(...)).  Complete
	(but not quite finished) doc available at 
	http://www2.physics.umd.edu/~payerle/Software/perl/Net/Hesiod.html

Description: Interface to Hesiod library API

I confess that this is the first public discussion of this module.  I have
looked but have not found anything else in CPAN which does Hesiod lookups
(except possibly in a rather raw fashion by Net::DNS).  I am not sure how
much Hesiod is actually used outside a couple of campuses, and even then
relatively few who need to interface to it.  However, as a systems person
at a campus which does use Hesiod, I have been using crude Hesiod module
(just calling /usr/local/bin/hesinfo and parsing output) for some time,
and it seemed natural to do as a first project in a C-based extension to
Perl.
