    Not necessarily.  A company isn't a breathing entity, and a company
didn't send the email requesting the PAUSE ID.  A person did, and we don't
want to get in the business of determining whether that person speaks for
that company.

    It's also entirely possible that support for and awareness of some CPAN
effort by a particular company just dies (say, the last or only employee
involved in the project leaves).  Now, say I want to take over maintenance,
and I email `the company', and either receive no response, or a response from
a pointy-haired manager saying `I don't understand Open Source, but that code
belongs to my company, and I don't want you to change it, nyah.'

    Yes, you could have, and that would have been lying, and I ask you not
to do that.  You would have been declaring yourself the only point person,
and I would _hope_ that, if anybody else on the AXKIT list declared in a
public forum, `I wrote such-and-such module and here is my response to your
bug report/feature request', that said person would be flamed or ignored.

    If you're claiming that there's some hardship for you in creating a
list and one or more ID's, please describe it.  If not, then I think you're
just proposing a scheme to hide information, which I don't support.
