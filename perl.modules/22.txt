its basically just a hashtable on steroids:

1) you can load a stream of name/value pairs into a hash,
and write that hash back out to a stream. this is an
alternative to say, Data::Dumper and eval, or XML::Writer
and XML::Parser.

2) you can associate a default properties object, which can
itself have its own default properties, etc.
