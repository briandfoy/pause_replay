The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Reliable
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: Reliable subprocess execution, many options.
  userid:      DGOLD (Dan Goldwater)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)

  similar:
    Proc::Short

  rationale:

    Hi! My Proc::Reliable has an API based on Proc::Short, but the
    implementation is superior and there is a lot of added
    functionality. As far as I know there is no other module which
    duplicates this functionality. I discussed with the author of
    Proc::Short whether he would like to integrate my code as a new
    version of Proc::Short, but he was not very enthusiastic so I would
    like to release the module myself. Most of the new functionality and
    new implementation I have written in comparison to Proc::Short has
    been targeted at highly reliable subprocess execution, so I chose
    the name Proc::Reliable. * MODULE OVERVIEW * Proc::Reliable is a
    class for simple, reliable and configurable subprocess execution in
    perl. In particular, it is especially useful for managing the
    execution of 'problem' programs which are likely to fail, hang, or
    otherwise behave in an unruly manner. Proc::Reliable includes all
    the functionality of the backticks operator and system() functions,
    plus many common uses of fork() and exec(), open2() and open3().
    Proc::Reliable incorporates a number of options, including sending
    data to the subprocess on STDIN, collecting STDOUT and STDERR
    separately or together, killing hung processes, timouts and
    automatic retries.

    thanks, -dan-
