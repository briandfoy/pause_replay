version numbers in perl are... tricky at best.

Executive summary: Never mix multi-part (X.Y.Z or even more .'s) version 
numbers with floating point (X.Y) version numbers.

Due to a number of historic accidents, an X.Y.Z(...) style version 
number can be converted to a float by assuming three digits per part: 
XXX.YYY.ZZZ => XXX.YYY.ZZZ. If you previously uploaded a version 1.1, 
you now have:

1.001001

and previously uploaded

1.1

Unfortunately, 1.1 is larger. Even more unfortunately, there is so much 
code relying on this that we cannot ever change it. You will need to 
decide on whether you want float-versions or multi-part versions and 
stick to it to prevent this from happening. (1.1.0 is fine)

Then, upload either 1.11 (or bigger) or 1.100.1 or 2.0.0 (or bigger). 
All of those are > 1.1.

Best regards,
Steffen
