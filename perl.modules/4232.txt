Hmm...

Yes I am 'both' Chris Dagdigian's...the first account (CHDAG) was created 
initially when Ewan Birney and I were kicking off the BioPerl.org project. 
There were some problems with my password and I don't believe that I was 
ever able to login as CHDAG. I let the account go fallow as Ewan handled 
the CPAN upload process for the bioperl project.

The 'CRAFFI' account is the newly created one and is what I used to upload 
Bundle::BioPerl.

So, I would recommend that the cdagdigian@genetics.com account (CHDAG) be 
deleted. Any bioperl related uploads I will do from the CRAFFI account.

Your help has been greatly appreciated!

Regards,
Chris
