The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Backtrace
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Object-oriented backtrace
  userid:      PEPE (Christoph Buﬂenius)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Carp::Trace

  rationale:

    There are already some modules which generate backtraces, such as
    Carp and Exception::Base. But these modules use it for a specific
    purpose, such as generating exceptions or printing error messages.

    There's also Carp::Trace, which will generate a backtrace in string
    form.

    My module is more generic and flexible. It generates a backtrace so
    that other modules or scripts can use the backtrace data for any
    purpose they like, in an object oriented way.

    It provides several human-readable representations of the data, and
    accessors for the individual fields (line number, etc.), so that the
    information can be processed by a program. It is also possible to
    access only some selected trace points.

  enteredby:   PEPE (Christoph Buﬂenius)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 25 20:54:15 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Backtrace       bdpOp Object-oriented backtrace                    PEPE
