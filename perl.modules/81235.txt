     why:

    I have been asked to package the sourceplot application. Sourceplot
    is a simple astronomical source plotter. It was created to help
    observers decide which sources to observe at particular times to
    optimize the observing time at a telescope.

    Sourceplot is used at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and has
    also been distributed as part of Starlink (
    http://starlink.jach.hawaii.edu/starlink ). It uses Astro::Telescope
    to allow it to be configured for other sites.

    I have updated sourceplot to use the CPAN modules Astro::Catalog
    and Astro::Coords. I would like to upload it as App::SourcePlot.
