The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nmap::Scanner
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perform nmap scans with perl wrapper classes
  userid:      MAXSCHUBE (Max Schubert)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    nmap-hackers mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    I expect and hope this will be the first of several Nmap wrapper
    sets of modules ... mine specifically deals with performing nmap
    scans and acting on the results using perl, so Nmap::Scanner seems
    to me to be a natural choice.

    If someone chooses to make nmap into a shared library and release
    that with perl wrappers, then perhaps mine would be better called
    Nmap::ScannerWrapper??

    I don't know ... and I don't mind either of these :), because mine
    is just a perl wrapper for performing Nmap scans and does not
    involve any C-perl glue.

The resulting entry would be:

Nmap::
::Scanner         bdpOp Perform nmap scans with perl wrapper classes MAXSCHUBE
