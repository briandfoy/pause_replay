The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MIME::AltWords
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: properly deal with RFC-1522 encoded words
  userid:      PTS (Péter Szabó)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:

  similar:
    MIME::Words, MIME::WordDecoder, Encode::MIME::Header

  rationale:

    MIME::AltWords is an up/downward-compatible reimplementation of
    public functions of MIME::Words (about which their author admits in
    the .pm files that they are buggy). MIME::AltWords contains the
    necessary bugfixes so that now it can cooperate properly with Mutt,
    Pine, JavaMail and OpenWebmail.

    MIME::AltWords contains proper test cases which catch the problems
    found in MIME::Words and corrected in MIME::AltWords.

    MIME::AltWords contains some feature improvements (new options and
    new functions), which are about to be documented.

  enteredby:   PTS (Péter Szabó)

The resulting entry would be:

MIME::
::AltWords        Rdpfp properly deal with RFC-1522 encoded words    PTS
