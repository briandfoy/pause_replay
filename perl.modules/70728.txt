The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::FixedIncome
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: A library aimed at easing FI modeling
  userid:      GRODITI (Guillermo Roditi)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    in the future: http://blogs.perl.org/users/guillermo_roditi1/

  similar:
    Finance::BDT (it's old and unitelligible and doesn't do what I am
    trying to do)

  rationale:

    I am aiming to create a comprehensive set of libraries which will
    eventually be combined in to a full-featured Fixed Income security
    pricing engine complete with different price / risk models, a
    complete implementation for yield curve derivation as well as a
    model layer which retrieves information from web interfaces at the
    US treasury and other central banks.

    The libraries will be a mix of classes (Consol, Bond, Annuity,
    YieldCurve etc) and functions (tvm, bey_to_apr, irr etc) and will be
    implemented in Perl, with certain components maybe re-implemented in
    C if performance requires it.

    Source control will be based on github and I expect to begin the
    process of releasing pre-alpha snapshots as early as May 31st
