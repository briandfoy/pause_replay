Shellf bdpfP   printf-style shell quoting for arguments      JBUHACOFF

NAME
        Shellf (until the CPAN folks tell me what is a better name)

SYNOPSIS
        use Shellf;
        $str = <DATA>;
        $result = shellf("/run/a/program --with-args %s",$str);


DESCRIPTION
        Shellf does the same thing as qx{} or backticks in the style of
        sprintf, where you supply a format string with arguments.

        It is intended for programmers who cannot be bothered with first 
quot-
        ing a string and then interpolating it into a command line, and 
need to
        use qx and not system in order to capture the command stdout.
