It's not a question of sound. If the primary purpose of the module is to 
emulate the behaviour of rdist then the name should reflect that. If it's
just to read rdist files then the name should reflect that.

In this case perhaps it could be two modules.

But an Emulate::* namespace doesn't appeal much. Many modules emulate
something.

Perhaps Filesys::Rdist.
