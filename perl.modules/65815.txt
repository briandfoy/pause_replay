I think this is the first version I've tried to upload with
Safari 4, and I may have added a couple of rules to my ad proxy,
but I tried turning that off.  I suspect the problem is with the
HTTP auth and on my end, but will probably be hard for me to
track down.

That must be it, then, because it takes me back to the home page
that describes the various options.  The strange thing, though,
is that

Thanks -- I didn't know about this option, but it gives the same
behavior, taking me back to the home page.  However, the "file
upload disabled" form apparently works, so I'll just use that.

Thanks for looking into this,
Sean
