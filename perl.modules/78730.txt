I seek advice on software licenses!


In many cases, my modules' current documentation says, as 
copyright/license, simply "This library is free software; you can 
redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself."
But I'm told that modern practice involves explicitly making clearer 
(in docs and probably metadata) the choice between perlartistic and 
perlgpl,... or what are the other well-known options that I can use?

I'm not up on these things-- and I've recently been emailing with 
someone who wants me to have Unidecode be under GNU *Lesser* General 
Public License (the existence of which I was unaware of), because he 
wants it as part of a project that's MIT licensed, and that's a 
problem somehow-- so now I'm feeling like I should put actual thought 
into this now.

Suggestions?

My perspective, and goal for my code, is that I'm entirely happy if 
anyone wants to use my code as part of a proprietary product, as long 
as, in the big legal blob somewhere in the product's About screen or 
wherever they put it, there's a note that this product includes 
ThatBurkeLibraryName (or: code that is based on 
ThatBurkeLibraryName)-- so that any interested programmer who wants 
that feature can go google for ThatBurkeLibraryName and get it and 
join in on the fun of using it.

I've /been told/ that the LGPL gets what I want.

But then, /I've also been told/ that an obese white man from the High 
Arctic will soon infiltrate my house thru ventilation and leave me 
presents, iff I've been a good boy.
