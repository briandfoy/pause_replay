OK, I _do_ plan to write the Bunch.pm or whatever the root module for 
this namespace is. It will provide documentation, nothing more. It won't 
be a dependency for Bunch:: modules.

The easiest way I know to do a module that does actually go fetch the 
deps is using Module::Install.

use inc::Module::Install;

name           ( 'Bunch-Email'                );
abstract       ( 'Install the most common Email:: modules' );
author         ( 'Adam Kennedy <cpan@ali.as>' );
version_from   ( 'lib/Bunch/Email.pm'         );
requires       ( 'perl'            => '5.005' );
requires       ( 'File::Spec'      => '0.80'  );
requires       ( 'Email::Address'  => 0       );
requires       ( '...etc...'       => $etc    );
...

auto_install();
&WriteAll;


On your second point, including OTHER modules in the package is 
inherently bad, and to be avoided most of the time.

If you really want something like that, one of the Google Summer of Code 
projects did something like that.
