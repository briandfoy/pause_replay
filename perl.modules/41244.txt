Hi modules,
My name is Daniel. I found you on http://www.cpan.org/modules. I am sorry
if I intrude but I just have a quick question for you.
Since you seem to be more acquainted with the Internet than I am, maybe you
can share your thoughts. A year ago I had started posting my own macro work
on my site at http://macrodream.iloweb.com. Many of my friends and members
of my photo club here in Paris, France told me that I should create a real
portal for macro photography. That's how I created
http://macrodream.iloweb.com a few days ago. 

Now, could you have a look at it and tell me what you think? Go to
http://macrodream.iloweb.com and please post a message in the site's forum
to let me know what you think. You can also use the poll on the first page.
I am also open to doing this with other folks - if you want to publish
articles or photos, please do so - just ask me and I'll make you an editor
or moderator of the site with me. There is a very easy interface available.
Much thanks!
Cheers, 
Daniel Nicollet, Paris, France
