Not DBIx as yours is a framework that extends beyond DBI.

The use of Data::* is inappropriate here. The Data:: is more for
'narrower' modules implementing or manipulating data types.

(Think of it this way, almost all the modules on CPAN could be
moved under Data::* is we used a looser definition.)

Since yours appears to be an extensible framework perhaps a new
toplevel is appropriate:

	DataSyncer::*
	DbSyncer::*
	Syncer::*
