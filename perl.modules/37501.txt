Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. . One of these days is none of these days. . Better to be poor and healthy rather than rich and sick. .
All promises are either broken or kept. . Distance lends enhancement to the view. . Patience is a virtue. .

Good wine ruins the purse, and bad wine ruins the stomach. . A short cut is often a wrong cut. . Damage suffered makes you knowing, but seldom rich. .
