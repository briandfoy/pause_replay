Subject: Naming a module...

From: fibonaci@babylonia.flatirons.org (Luke Palmer)

I'd like assistance in naming a module that I'm working on.  It's a 
basic predicate logic solver (like prolog, but easier to access through 
perl and not as full-featured).  I call it Logic now, but I'd like to know 
where to put it in the tree. I would use Language::Prolog, except it is 
pre-pre-pre-alpha and doesn't do anything.

A sample use: (also some suggestions on the names or usage of these 
functions?)

$logic = new Logic;
$logic->parse( 'door(a, b)' );
$logic->parse( 'door(a, c)' );
$logic->parse( 'door(b, c)' );

#Find doors from a to some place X
$query = $logic->parse( 'door(a, X)?' );

#Find first one
$pad = $logic->match( $query );
$pad and print "Door from a to $pad->{X}\n";

#Find next one
$pad = $logic->match( $query, $pad );

# ... et cetera


Thanks,
Luke
