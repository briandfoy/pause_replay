     why:

    I am currently working on a project that will use a mod_perl
    interface. This interface is based on a kind of framework that takes
    a site description in the form of a Config::General file, including
    pages hierarchy (with access rights) and forms definition (with
    validation regexps), and generates HTML (from HTML::Template's) with
    menus and navigation links. The whole project is under GPL and I
    plan to release the framework as modules to be used by others. Hm,
    seems a bit complicated to explain, but it is roughly what I am
    doing.. ;-)
