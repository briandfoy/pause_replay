Carp::TypeCheck uses croak, so it will have a passing similarity to other
Carp modules. The purpose of TypeCheck is to encapsulate subroutine calls in
a closure which performs runtime argument type checking. Types can be
checked for conformity to a basic Perl type specifier, and for being an
appropriate reference or object class (or sub-class).

The module exports a single function, 'typecheck', which operates on either
named or anonymous subroutines.

		But lets talk about the others.  Please provide some detail
on what
		they do, and also on how they work, to the extent relevant.

		And let's have a separate [sub]thread for each one.

		Thanks.
