     why:

    I've been doing work with the Gentoo linux project, mostly making
    it viable to install on older Sun Cobalt RaQ systems (x86 based). In
    the process I ported across a 2.4 kernel patch to 2.6 to give access
    to the system's LCD front panel display, among other things. I've
    written a Perl module which allows easy access to the functionality
    provided by the kernel patch and a toolset. The Perl module is
    nearing a state where it can be released, and CPAN is one of the
    better ways of doing this.
