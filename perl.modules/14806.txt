Hello,

I've got some modules that I'd like to contribute to CPAN. I understand 
that in order to register with PAUSE I need to provide the following 
information:

My name: John Clyman
My email address: module-support@clyman.com
My home page: http://www.clyman.com
My preferred CPAN ID: JCLYMAN
My planned contributions: Some modules to perform text and language 
manipulation. Two of them are described in detail on my site at 
http://www.clyman.com/s/pm/

I'll be posting to the modules list and/or onto c.l.p.m shortly to get 
suggestions on module naming and to provide further information.

Thank you.
