I've been pondering this, and I think Pod::Tools would be a good place for
the POD tools ... but then I couldn't think of a good place for PM and PPT.
Yes, PPT and PM are confusing, but then again, we have precedent for what I
think are far more confusing acronyms as top-level namespaces.

Maybe there could be a Tools::Pod, Tools::PM, Tools::PPT.  But what is a
tool?  What isn't a tool?  I don't think the fact that there are combined
modules and tools necessarily matters, except in the fact that you want to
keep them together.  For instance, if tcgrep were merely a module, you
might put it in File::Grep or something.

How about a Tom::Tools namespace?  :-)

You could do Module::Tools and Pod::Tools.  Maybe PPT could be in
Power::Tools, POSIX::Tools, Unix::Tools?
