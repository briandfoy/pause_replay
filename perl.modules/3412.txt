So they will. (Actually while I typed this email, I already registered
Michael's two modules)

This doesn't make it clear to me if I should register P:C:Client and
P:C:Server.

This page looks to me like the start of a module list. If you expect
hundreds of small modules in there, then the PoCo namespace would
greatly reduce the typing requirements for the POE community, right?
Should we use PoCo instead of POE::Component? If so, it's easy for me
to change Michael's registrations.

No preference on my side.
