Oh yes, well combined:) Yes, I remember that I tampered a little bit
on the database to let 0.4.12 appear as a bright parrot.

I just figured I could undo this dirty act of white washing and so I

records in the perms (co-maint) table should not do any harm anywhere,
I think. Let me know if you see this differently.
