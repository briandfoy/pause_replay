Hi all,

I'm very new to the world of writing Perl modules, but find myself writing 
some modules for parsing and graphing Squid 2 access logs, and figure that 
once they are done, I may as well share them!

I've had a look on CPAN, and can't find anything that does the job already, 
nor can I find a namespace that seems appropriate. I've also searched the 
archive of modules@perl.org to see if this has been discussed before, but 
again haven't found anything.

I was thinking about using the namespace Squid2::Log as the base for my 
modules (so, Squid2::Log::NativeAccess would be one of the modules).

Does this seem reasonable?

Thanks everyone!

Cheers,
