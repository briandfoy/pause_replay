Request to register new user

fullname: Maciej Ceglowski
  userid: MCEGLOWS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.idlewords.com
     why:

    This is not a new submission, but a request for a change of ID. My
    current PAUSE ID is 'MACIEJ', which I realized is rude of me (Maciej
    is a common name in Polish), and somewhat presumptuous. I had not
    realized when I registered that I was picking a handle for everyone
    to see, and I think it is more appropriate to use my full name.

    I have refrained from uploading anything in hopes that this name
    change request will be honored, to avoid renaming issues on my
    modules. My apologies for the hassle, and for not reading carefully
    enough when I requested my account.
