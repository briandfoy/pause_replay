The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::KontoCheck
  DSLIP:       Rdcfl
  description: Validate german/austrian Bank Account Number
  userid:      MICHEL (Michael Plugge)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Business::DE::KontoCheck

  rationale:

    The namespace could be Business::DE::KontoCheck and
    Business::AT::KontoCheck, since the module implements Tests for both
    countries. Business::DE::KontoCheck is allocated already by Tina
    Mueller; she uses a different interface style (object oriented), so
    it would be awkward to transfer the namespace.

    The library checks the validity of a given Bank Account Number
    using several checksum methods defined by the Deutsche Bundesbank
    and the Österreichische Nationalbank. It is quite usefull for many
    Business Applications. Currently no CPAN module implements this
    function completely.

    Some years ago there was a perl module Business::Konto.pm by
    Andreas Butzko (I used it for debugging my library, and found a lot
    of bugs in both programs :-) ); this module vanished from CPAN.

    Currently Business::DE::KontoCheck (by Tina Mueller) is on CPAN,
    but she did not implement all defined checksum methods. And, even
    worse, the format of the BLZ file of Deutsche Bundesbank changed on
    June 5th, 2006; the module needs a rewrite to implement the new file
    format.

  enteredon:   Fri Jun  8 06:53:51 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::KontoCheck      Rdcfl Validate german/austrian Bank Account Number MICHEL
