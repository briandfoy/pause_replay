James,

 From your description, the DBIx namespace is definitely where you 
want it to be.

However, you should think up something quite different for the rest.

Having 'DBI' in the second part of the name is redundant.

Also, 'Wrapper' is too generic to be helpful.  EVERY "DBIx" module is 
a "DBI wrapper"; that's what the namespace means.

Think about one or two descriptive words that makes your module 
different than all the other DBIx modules, and different than other 
database related frameworks in other namespaces, and try putting 
those together.

Or, if you simply can't think of anything unique, you could use the 
cop-out but humorous "yet another DBI wrapper" (one or more similarly 
named modules already exist on CPAN).

And the comparison has to be vs what is there TODAY, not when you 
started your modules.
