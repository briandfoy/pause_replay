Hi Joel

Yeah, I'm a bit uneasy about it too, but I assume the author has given 
his real name, so at least it's not anonymous.

I replied to him and the list re the structure of the name (e.g. rather 
use Mail::Cracker::GMail, since he's used a top-level name), but did not 
mention the morality of the topic.

As for password (strength) testing, someone may use it for nefarious 
purposes, or for good purposes. Hard to tell.
