The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Cipher
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Flexible text cipher class and interface
  userid:      CHIA (Robert Fischer)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Regexp::Tr Text::Bastardize

  rationale:

    This class allows people to easilly create text ciphers. Classes
    which inherit from it (including Text::Shift, and the
    soon-to-be-published Text::Cipher::Vigenere) have a simple, uniform
    interface, making it very easy to change which cipher is used in
    your code. Building off of a single interface also saves quite a bit
    of compile time and saves the user's hassle.

    The class also provides a clean and uniform definition of
    alphabets. This allows users to easilly design ciphers which adapt
    automatically to non-Latin alphabets, and prevents the wasted time,
    space, and hassle posed by handling alphabets for many different
    ciphers.

  enteredby:   CHIA (Robert Fischer)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun 23 19:34:59 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Cipher          adpOp Flexible text cipher class and interface     CHIA
