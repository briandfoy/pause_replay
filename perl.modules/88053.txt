The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::FromArrayref
  DSLIP:       adpfa
  description: Output XML described by a Perl data structur
  userid:      NICWOLFF (Nic Wolff)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    https://github.com/nicwolff/XML-FromArrayref/issues

  similar:
    XML::Writer, XML::Simple

  rationale:

    Writing out valid XML is still a pain. The procedural approach of
    modules like XML::Writer is clunky - you still have to balance
    closing tags! Perl's data structures can express hierarchical data
    very concisely, but there's no easy way to turn a data structure
    into XML. XML::Simple::XMLout() kind of works, but uses a hash for
    element content so it loses child element order.

    This module turns an arrayref into XML in a straightforward and
    predictable fashion. Elements and attributes whose names eval false
    get skipped, which makes optionally wrapping an element very
    natural:

    [ $bold && b => 'This is bold if $bold was true' ]

    And using map() and grep() to generate or filter repeated elements
    is great fun.

    I considered a more general namespace, maybe under SGML::, that
    this and my similar HTML::FromArrayref could be under, but that
    module is already in CPAN under HTML:: so this one would just have a
    weird name.

    Thanks for your time!
