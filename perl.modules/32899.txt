Well, I already thought about Local or something, but that's even more
ambiguous than UNIX, so I decided to use that one. Maybe having Socket
in the name would be nice, but how should it look alike then?
LWP::Protocol::http::Socket::UNIX? No, that wouldn't make sense in my
eyes. So the current LWP::Protocol::http should be named something like
LWP::Protocol::http::Socket::INET or something like that..

Maybe you've got an other idea? I don't, really...

Florian
