I don't think so, because pragmas generally control the compilation
environment rather than the runtime environment, and one of the
features of Readonly is that you can make a variable read-only with a
value computed at runtime.  Pragmas also generally have a blanket
effect on the program ("use constant" is an exception), and don't
introduce functions as Readonly does.

I'm not closed to the idea; it just doesn't seem to me that a pragma
is a good fit for this.  I do plan to experiment with attributes,
something like "my $foo : Readonly ('somevalue');", but at this point
I don't have any idea whether that'll work well or not.
