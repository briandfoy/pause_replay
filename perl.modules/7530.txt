The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::OpenIndex
  DSLIP:       Rmpfp
  description: Apache modperl module to manage site files
  userid:      SANDERSON (George Sanderson)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modperl@apache.org

  similar:
    Apache::AutoIndex provides index listings without management
    commands

  rationale:

    The name "OpenIndex" follows from AutoIndex writen by "Philippe M .
    Chiasson" <gozer@cpan.org>. OpenIndex was derived from OpenIndex,
    however most of the orignal code was replaced or modified, therefore
    it made little sense to override functions, but rather make it a
    seperate module.

    Phillippe is aware of the module and he did not express any
    objections to it's release.

    I did upload the source code using my PAUSE user name "sanderson"
    and the file name is OpenIndex-1.00.tar.gz.

    I am not clear how the file I uploaded gets place into this name
    space that I am applying.

    Thank you, George
