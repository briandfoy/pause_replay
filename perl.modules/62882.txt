The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AC
  DSLIP:       adcfg
  description: Interface to HP AssetCenter
  userid:      TACOTOM (Tom McLaughlin)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows a developer to interface with HP AssetCenter
    (formerly Peregrine). This is the first and only perl interface to
    AssetCenter as far as I know... unfortunately this is only for the
    windows platform and requires the installation and configuration of
    the commercial software to work. Help with testing and development
    is welcome.

  enteredby:   TACOTOM (Tom McLaughlin)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 28 16:45:53 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

AC                adcfg Interface to HP AssetCenter                  TACOTOM
