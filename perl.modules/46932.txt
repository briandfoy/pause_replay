     why:

    I plan to contributes modules that I sometimes require in my
    adventures which are not on cpan at all or can use a good overhaul.
    It is a pretty diverse description, but it must do for now.

    Most of the modules I plan to write over the next 6 months to 1
    year will focus on the admin of certain systems such as
    qmail/ldap/vsftp etc as I am part of the Techincal Staff at the
    Department of Computer Science at the University of Pretoria.
