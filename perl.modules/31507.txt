I have re-indexed them on search. However I must agree with a comment 
on that second page

   Although I still think that asking before making a network connection 
that the user
   didn't ask for is the only polite thing to do.

making a connection without first asking, which your code still does, 
is not polite
and many will see that alone as an issue.
