The problem is that XML/Stream/Namespace.pm in 1.19 does not define
a $VERSION at all, so the version is "undef".

This makes CPAN.pm think that 1.18 is "newer", because the version
number went from "undef" (in 1.19) to "1.18" (1.18).

Again, either release a new version, or delete all prior versions.
Until then, CPAN.pm bitches at me daily, and I will continue to annoy
you for a fix.
