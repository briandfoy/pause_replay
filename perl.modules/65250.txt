The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       EEDB
  DSLIP:       SdpOb
  description: a systems biology data/ws/visualize system
  userid:      JMS (Jessica Michelle Severin)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    RIKEN yokohama, japan

  similar:
    Bio::...

  rationale:

    This is a new system of doing Systems Biology data management,
    web-services, and AJAX based visualization. It was developed as a
    bioinformatics toolkit and API at RIKEN, japan and will be published
    in a scientific journal soon. The system is called EdgeExpressDB and
    the module tree is rooted on EEDB:: This API/toolkit/system has been
    under development and testing for the last 2 years within RIKEN. I
    would like this to be easily accessible from CPAN in addition to the
    .tar.gz packages I will be providing from RIKEN (osc.riken.jp). This
    request for a new root namespace will allow for the entire
    EdgeExpressDB system (over 30,0000 lines of perl) to be nicely
    packaged and not collide with other sytems. The system is planned to
    be ported to C/C++ and maybe Python or Ruby which is why I did not
    want to be tied to the bio-perl system. I have not uploaded yet
    since we are waiting for final approval on our publication. Jessica

The resulting entry would be:

EEDB              SdpOb a systems biology data/ws/visualize system   JMS
