Hi fellow PAUSE admins,

I'd like to create a new mailing list user for PAR. The reason is that
while par@perl.org has been long established as the central place for
discussing PAR development, all RT tickets just generate a mail to me
directly instead of going to the list where they might get resolved more
quickly. Would this work at all? Or would RT still only carry the PAUSE
IDs of the uploaders?

Is this a valid use case or is the PAUSE-mailing-list feature intended
only for the case where various PAUSE users need to upload a
distribution in turns?

Best regards,
Steffen
