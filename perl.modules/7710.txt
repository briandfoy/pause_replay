What's the address for submission, then, for the CPAN scripts
repository, the half-forgotten step-child of CPAN?
http://www.cpan.org/scripts/index.html , for example, lists several
different scripts, organised by category, which lie in different
authors' directories, so they should be findable as long as someone
categorises them in the correct scripts category.

If it's not modules@perl.org who does that, who then? Kurt Starsinic,
whose email address is at the top of the page, perhaps?

Ah, hold on -- there are instructions at
http://www.cpan.org/scripts/submitting.html , which imply that simply
uploading a properly formatted script (not compressed or tarred or
anything) automatically makes it available, and that scripts@perl.org is
available for discussion (e.g. for creation of new categories); this
appears to be a real mailing list that one can subscribe to.

Cheers,
Philip
