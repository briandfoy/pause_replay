Hello Adam,

The framework differences between TagLib and Audio::File, Audio::File::Tag,
Audio::File::AudioProperties are not so big. But currently Audio::File
series have not implemented some key functionalitiy, save() for instance,
and are pretty much dependent on other audio processing packages I mentione=
d
by different authors. It behaves much more like a pure abstract interface.
TagLib is actually a porting from the C/C++ package, which has constructed =
a
similar framework but implemented all the necessary stuff. Thus gains a
better change to keep a very same style of implementation.
I'd like to accept your suggestion, take Audio::TagLib as the root namespac=
e
of the module. New request will follow.  Great thanks for the hint.

BTW: there are over 20 single modules in my package. Should I request for
each?
