OK, so...

The published module list, which is stalled... it's useless.  Why's it
still there on websites and stuff?  It just confuses people.  So,
proposition the first:  the published modules list should be un-published.

Secondly, the abstract list in the database.  As I understand it, there
are all the modules which have been uploaded to CPAN, and then there is
the "module list database" for want of a better term.  The module list
database does not contain all modules uploaded to CPAN, only those for
which the authors have filled in the "register namespace" form on PAUSE.

Now, assuming someone does "register namespace" and their module gets
into the module list database... what purpose does this serve?  It no
longer results in the module being published in the published module
list (which, as previously mentioned, is stalled).  It doesn't give them
any kind of priority ranking in the results of search.cpan.org.  It
doesn't cause any update of the category listing on search.cpan.org (at
least as far as I can tell - or am I confused? - there's no dates
mentioned there to help me).  The DLSIP codes aren't included in the
search.cpan.org results.  So what purpose does that database serve?

It just seems to me that the entire idea of "module registration" and
"applying to have your module listed on the modules list" is
conceptually broken.  Why don't we just admit that modules@perl.org is a
volunteer consulting service for module naming, and let anyone update
the metadata (DLSIP etc) for their own modules without spamming this
list with it and making the m@p.o team go pointy-clicky to approve each
one?
