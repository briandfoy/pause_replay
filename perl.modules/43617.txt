Philippe,

the appended email exchange seemed to me a more urgent than usual call
to make the requestor a co-maintainer immediately. The fact that you
have not uploaded anything since 2001 and that one test fails makes me
believe that you will not object if I give Luke the minimum
administrative rights required to upload a new version.

Please file you veto and better suggestions as soon as possible, so we
can find a better solution. For now I suppose you will be happy that I
make Luke (ID: LOOSIFER).

Luke,

please go ahead and make a new package and upload it into your directory.

Thanks,
-- 
andreas

Okay, I'll pass it on to them.

Six months?  I first contacted the author about this at least 18 months
ago, and there have been bugs reported on rt.cpan.org for 11 months.
Both fixes are absolutely trivial, and it doesn't even pass tests
without them.

Thanks for the help.

modules@perl.org is better.

They'll probably tell you to try contacting the author and if  
unsuccessful in reaching him for several months then they can help  
you to get access to upload a fixed version of Parse::Lex to CPAN.

  - ask

Hi,

I dunno if this is the right address to send this to, but...

I've got a module in CPAN, ldapsh, that requieres Parse::Lex, which in
turn requires (and I believe includes) Parse::Template.  Unfortunately,
Parse::Template has been syntactically broken for something like three
years -- it doesn't pass its own tests and it doesn't even parse.

It's two very small edits to fix the library:  The initial 'use strict'
is missing a semicolon, and one of the variables is not declarated with
a 'my' statement.  Everyone who's talked to me directly about ldapsh has
been able to easily fix the library, but if they never contact me
directly they usually just give up and assume it's a problem with ldapsh
or something.

I've emailed the author of Parse::Lex multiple times in an attempt to
get a new version of the library posted with those errors fixed, but
I've had no luck.

Is there any way to get a small patch applied to the library and then
post a new minor revision, so people can just use CPAN to install a
working version?

I don't have a patch to fix the library, but it's very easy to find the
problems, and if a patch is required I should be able to make one just
by reinstalling the library.

Thanks,
Luke (loosifer)
