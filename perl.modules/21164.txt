The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Oracle::Debug
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: perldb like interface to Oracle DBMS_DEBUG
  userid:      RFOLEY (Richard Foley)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This module is an interface to the Oracle Debug packages for
    PL/SQL, DMBS_DEBUG. It offers the perl-debugger-like command line
    interface 'oradb', through 2 scripts: debug and target currently.

    It is possible to walk/step through a procedure into a package, as
    per the demo example included with the distribution, and interact
    with the interupted process, in a similar manner to using the perl
    debugger.

    Oracle Debug seems a logical, and reasonably concise, choice, given
    the myriad other naming possibilities.

  enteredon:   Fri May 16 13:09:06 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Oracle::
::Debug           cdpOp perldb like interface to Oracle DBMS_DEBUG   RFOLEY
