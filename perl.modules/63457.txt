The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::PageRank::XS
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: Calculate PageRank in Perl for many nodes
  userid:      AXIAK (Michael Axiak)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Algorithm::PageRank

  rationale:

    I was dumbfounded when I found a complete lack of good PageRank
    modules for PERL or Python. By Good, I mean it should handle a
    decently-sized graph and not soak up every byte in memory.

    I tried to write a good one in strict PERL and Python (using PDL
    and numpy), but neither really did the trick. So I finally caved and
    wrote a quick C program to do the task. It was orders of magnitude
    faster and less memory hungry, so I made it an XS module.

    Since it's a superset of functionality of Algorithm::PageRank, I
    think it might as well be called Algorithm::PageRank::XS.

    Thanks, Mike
