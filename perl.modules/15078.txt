I thought of Convert::yEnc when I had a go at fiddling with it (I think
there's still a module in my CPAN directory, but it's pretty broken[*]).
First in with Convert::RACE, for example (for internationalised domain
names).

Same with Convert::yEnc::Decoder and Convert::yEnc::Encoder, though
I'd've thought it'd make more sense to stick both into one module. After
all, we have Compress::Zlib and not Compress::Zlib::Deflate and
Compress::Zlib::Inflate, and MIME::Base64 not ::Encode and ::Decode...
you get the idea.

(a) I don't see why that's a problem
(b) I think Whatever::yEnc should be able to encode *and* decode

Cheers,
Philip

[*] The fact that it's a bit of a shambles -- I think it kind-of does
encoding but doesn't do decoding at all yet -- is why I didn't apply for
namespace registration. In case someone else did a proper job, they were
welcome to the namespace.

OTOH, if you want to use part or all of my code, you're also more than
welcome to do so.
