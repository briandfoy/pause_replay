Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.  -  STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL.

It is with my profound dignity that I write you this very important and highly confidential letter. First,I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction.  This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and “TOP SECRET”. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, considering the fact that we have not met each other before, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of three to four weeks for a normal post to reach you, so we decided it is best using the e-mail which is quicker and more reliable right now.

However, let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am DR .PATRICK OJAME an Accountant by profession and also a Director General in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), right now I am presently the chairman of the ContractAwards/Review and Payment Approvals committee. We came to know of you in our search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum CONFIDENCE.  My colleagues and I are Top Officials of the Federal Government Contract Review and Award Panel. Our duties include Evaluation, Vetting, and Approval for payment of Contract jobs done for the N.N.P.C e.t.c. In order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your Account the said funds.

The source of this funds is as follows: In the first quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of over US$400 million US dollars to a group of five firms for the supply, construction and installation of Oil Pipe lines in Warri and Port Harcourt environs. During this process my colleagues and I decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately over-inflate the total contract sum from US$400 million to US$428 million with the main intention of sharing the remaining sum of US$28 million amongst ourselves. The Federal Government of Nigeria has since last year approved the sum of US$428 million for us as the contract payment, and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to the foreign
companies concerned as contract entitlements for the various jobs done, but since the companies are entitled to US$400 million dollars only, we are now left with US$28 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of  this panel, we cannot do this by ourselves, as  we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in Government service, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in our  names right now. I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$28 million. Hence we are writing you this letter.

My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of these funds on our behalf, you or your Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$28 million), while 60% will be for us (OFFICIALS) and the remaining 20% will be used in offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return we demand your complete honesty and trust. You must however NOTE therefore, that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below; 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your custody, or any form of blackmail.
c) That upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your share of 20% from the total amount.

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary requirements from you. We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your Total confidentiality in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I give you my word that you are completely safe in doing business with us. Most Government executives have successfully carried out transactions like this in the past. Here in my country there is great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant and the order of the day amongst high ranking government officials, thus explaining why you might have heard stories 
of how money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future, so that when we retire from active service we do not languish in poverty. I will explain more to you when I have heard from you.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above email address. I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending business transaction when I have heard from you and also receive your confidential telephone and fax umbers to enable me fax to you all necessary information you need to know about our pending business transaction.  Your urgent response will be highly appreciated to enable us still transfer the funds under this first quarter of the year 2003.

Thank you and God Bless.  Yours faithfully,

DR.PATRICK

N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION
IS 100% LEGAL AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR
MONEY LAUNDERING. THIS IS A COMPLETE LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS TRANSACTION.
