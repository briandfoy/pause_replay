Hello Graham Barr, in a previous mail you wrote:

No. Therefore I need the new wrapper, Date::Object!

And I don't want to put the OO frontend right into Date::Calc (which is
technically possible), because the module is already quite large as it is,
and its man page even more so.

Moreover, maybe some people don't want to use the OO frontend, so there
is no point in forcing them to load it anyway whenever they want to use
Date::Calc.

Sounds ugly indeed... :-)

Something like Carp::Date?

The changes are quite minimal. Maybe one could change the Carp.pm in
the CORE so that "croak" and "carp" etc. would accept an additional
parameter or flag (or configuration global) to instruct Carp.pm to skip
certain packages; either the named package hierarchy, or the caller's
package hierarchy.

Yes, if one could change this into a more general solution, as described
above. Certainly.
