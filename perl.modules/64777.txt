Greetings:

Like an idiot I must have added a few modules into CVS with -r0.1 rather
than with -r0.01, and now that the revs have increased from .9 to .10 I'm
getting a warning from PAUSE that those modules have not been indexed.
Luckily, these are modules that are merely part of the distribution, but not
the ones that the distro version number is taken from.

My question is this:  is this something that I should address immediately,
or can I safely ignore this with no adverse impacts?  I'd have to have to
upload yet another version with no real changes just for that.
