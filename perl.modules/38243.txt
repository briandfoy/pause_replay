The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       QWizard
  DSLIP:       MmpOb
  description: A system for running wizard screens
  userid:      HARDAKER (Wes Hardaker)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    net-policy-users ATATA lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module has been long used within the net-policy project on
    sourceforge but is independent of the rest of sourceforge, and thus
    should be uploaded to CPAN (and preferrably listed in the module
    list).

    DESCRIPTION

    The QWizard module allows script authors to concentrate on the
    content of the forms they want their users to fill in without
    worrying about the display. It allows "Question Wizard" like
    interfaces to be very easily created and the results of the input
    easily acted upon. Scripts written which are entirely based on
    QWizard inputs are able to be run from the command line which will
    show a Tk window or as a CGI script without modification. Script
    writers do not need to know which interface is being used to display
    the resulting form(s) as it should be transparent to the script
    itself.

    Other wizard interfaces exist for perl, but this one strives very
    hard to be both extensible and easy to code with requiring as little
    work by script authors as possible. It is also one of the only ones
    that supports both web environments and windowing environments
    without code modification required by the script author.

    There are a few other wizard like modules within CPAN, but few are
    in a polished state and don't offer the ease-of-programming use that
    this one does. Most also don't support the multiple backends and are
    targeted to single environments instead (ie, just the web). QWizard
    is designed to make programming multiple-screen forms as easy and
    possible and supports multiple backends (tk, Gtk2, html, readline,
    WAP soon, and curses soon).

    It doesn't fit under the hierarchy of the other standard top level
    widgets because it itself is a self contained system that implements
    stuff from multiple domains and the other hierarchies are more
    targeted to a particular environment.
