Subject: Module submission Protocol::Modbus

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Protocol::Modbus
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Classes for Modbus protocol request response
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It seems there isn't a CPAN distribution aimed at Modbus protocol
    implementation in Perl.

    The thing is almost working, with some reasonable test suite. I
    have a doubt on the same, though.

    Better Protocol::Modbus, or Modbus::Protocol, or
    Device::PLC::Protocol::Modbus? Device::PLC::Modbus?

    This classes are only about raw protocol, meant to be used by
    anyone using Modbus. In fact, they are meant to be used by another
    class I'm starting (Device::PLC), that ideally should be capable to
    interface to PLC devices with Modbus protocol but also (in the
    future, when there's need) with other protocols.

  enteredby:   COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb  1 09:38:11 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Protocol::
::Modbus          bdpOp Classes for Modbus protocol request response COSIMO
