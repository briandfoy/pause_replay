     why:

    I haven't really decided on a name, but let's go for Params::Lazy,
    which uses the call checker to create lazy/deferred arguments to
    functions; so delayed(bar()) would get a magic variable in $_[0],
    which when looked into calls bar(). Benchmarks missing at the
    moment, seeing how it's not finished and all, but the working
    assumption is that this is a lot more lightweight than creating an
    anonymous subroutine (since there's no entersub/closure), although
    certainly not as lightweight as refactoring the caller's code : D

    Plus, it (finally) allows people to do this:

    say my_map "my very own $_\n", 1..5;

    Which you simply can't do with prototypes at the moment.
