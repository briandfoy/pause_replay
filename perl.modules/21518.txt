The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Military::STD2167A
  DSLIP:       Rdpnb
  description: Defense System Software Development Standard
  userid:      SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This is the core document for software development. Most
    governments on this planet have their own version. ISO certification
    of commerical activities requires the activity to invent a tailor
    down version of this standard.

    Placing Military::STD2167A in the module list will make this
    document electronically available to all developers and users. The
    POD in the module allows electronic distribution and access.
    Paragraphs may be cited from other PODs by
    L<Military::STD2167A/xxxx> link. Easy electronic access provides
    capabilities that are impossible with a hard copy.

    As far as a new rootlevel, if there is a current rootlevel where
    this module will fit, feel free to change Military to whatever.

  enteredby:   SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun  5 04:34:09 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Military::
::STD2167A        Rdpnb Defense System Software Development Standard SOFTDIA
