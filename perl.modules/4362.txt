Fixed now:

cpan> m HTML::Tree
Module id = HTML::Tree
    CPAN_USERID  SBURKE (Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>)
    CPAN_VERSION 3.09
    CPAN_FILE    S/SB/SBURKE/HTML-Tree-3.09.tar.gz
    INST_FILE    (not installed)

PAUSE needed a kick to get this right.

These are still there as the referenced file has not disappeared.

I don't think, this is really needed. Our policy has always been to
not stop people from uploading namespace clashes but to disable
indexing of same. This went wrong in your case for obvious reasons and
is fixed now. Should this not do?
