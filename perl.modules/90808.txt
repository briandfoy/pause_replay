The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Eksisozluk
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Get Eksisozluk entries and debe lists.
  userid:      KYZN (Kivanc Yazan)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    https://github.com/kyzn/net-eksisozluk

  similar:
    No results for eksisozluk.com, but there are some modules for
    twitter, such as Net::Twitter

  rationale:

    This is going to be a module to communicate with eksisozluk.com, a
    user-based online dictionary like web site, which was founded in
    1999 in Turkey. The site is pretty popular, yet there are no modules
    for it. I've realized there are similar modules for Twitter
    (Net::Twitter), for Facebook (WWW::Facebook) and more.

    There are contents created by users, called "entries", and the
    current module can download entries given their ids. There is also a
    list published every morning, "debe", or "dÃ¼nÃ¼n en beÄenilen
    entryleri", which roughly means "top voted entries from yesterday."
    Module can download that list too. By using this module, one can
    easily get detailed information about these entries.

    I've chosen 'Net' mainly because it works in a similar way with
    'Net::Twitter'. Yet, I'd like to call it 'alpha' (I actually
    versioned it 0.04) because it still lacks a lot of functionality.

    Sincerely,

  enteredby:   KYZN (Kivanc Yazan)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 21 16:48:12 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Eksisozluk      adpfp Get Eksisozluk entries and debe lists.       KYZN
