Subject: Module submission Devel::DumpSizes
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, cgautam@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::DumpSizes
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Get name and size in bytes of all variables
  userid:      CGAUTAM (Chekuri Gautam)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The name Devel::DumpSizes was choosen because this module was
    written to see how the sizes of perl variables fluctuated during
    script execution. To allow this the module will dump the names and
    sizes (in bytes) of the variables into a file or STDOUT. It could be
    used during development/debugging of a script. It would most ideally
    belong under Devel:: becuase it mostly uses other Devel:: modules
    (except PadWalker)

  enteredby:   CGAUTAM (Chekuri Gautam)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 10 14:28:56 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::DumpSizes       bdpfp Get name and size in bytes of all variables  CGAUTAM
