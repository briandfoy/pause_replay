I saw VR and though "virtual reality" myself...

Is this a formal web service?

If so, something like WebService::VerticalResponse might be the most 
accurate.

If that is going to feel cumbersome to type, one mechanism I've used is 
to provide an exportable alias.

use WebService::VerticalResponse 'VR';

VR is a constant containing the string "WebService::VerticalResponse". 
So the following mean the same thing.

WebService::VerticalResponse->new;

VR->new;
