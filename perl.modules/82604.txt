If the NoSQL moniker continues to gain traction, then DBIx.NoSQL 
should probably not even refer to a specific implementation.  In response 
to my recent post in the Google Groups NoSQL discussion, someone suggested 
that DBIx.NoSQL should be reserved as an interface and implementations 
named underneath.  For example, my implementation would logically be 
DBIx.noSQL.rdb, which accurately describes using an NoSQL implementation 
using rdb.

Given a realistic timeline, I would be happy to coordinate the effort of 
writing such an interface.  That project sounds exciting, but requires a 
bit of effort to engage the appropriate experts.

I assume the maintainers who read this email have the best and broadest 
perspective about whether this approach makes sense.  I look forward to 
your response.

Thanks again!

Sincerely,

Jim Schueler - TQISJIM
