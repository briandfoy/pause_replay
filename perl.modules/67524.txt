The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::WordLevelStatistics
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Pure Perl implementation of the wsl alg.
  userid:      NIDS (Francesco Nidito)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

    to discuss about the module feel free to mail me nids@cpan

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module implements the word level statistics algorithm as
    described in: P. Carpena, P. Bernaola-Galav, M. Hackenberg, A.V.
    Coronado and J.L. Oliver, "Level statistics of words: finding
    keywords in literary texts and DNA", Physical Review E 79, 035102-4
    ( DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.79.035102 )

    The algorithm implemented in the module is able to extract (without
    "a priori" knowledge) the keyword present in a text.

    The algorithm is very good in finding out keywords and it is
    language agnostic, it takes into consideration just the words (as
    groups of chars) and their position. The algorithm does not need
    lists of stop-words or training to be used.

    The paper presenting the algorithm is quite recent (May 2009) and a
    good reading (and fast... just 4 pages). I tried it just to make
    some experiments and I noticed that it was very good. I looked on
    cpan but I was not able to find any implementation of it, then I
    wrote it.

    Im my opinion, Algorithm namespace is the right place for the wsl
    algorithm: as suggested in the paper, it could be used for texts,
    biological sequences and (this is my add) probably other kind of
    data.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::WordLevelStatistics RdpOp Pure Perl implementation of the wsl alg.     NIDS
