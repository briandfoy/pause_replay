It's not there. There is
http://search.cpan.org/~milso/SchemaView-Plus-0.16/ but that doesn't
include a DBIx::SchemaView module. I realize that the aforementioned
distribution is intended to be the DBIx::SchemaView implementation, but
it doesn't contain a module of that namespace. That's how you got the
original mail.

To see the problem, try running "cpan DBIx::SchemaView". It's not going
to work. (It should install the module.) Or check the "DBIx::SchemaView"
link under "Registered Modules" on your search.cpan.org author page.

Now, this isn't a huge deal. We're not going to pry the registration
from your hands. If you want to make DBIx::SchemaView indexable, you can
include a bare-bone .pm file which has mostly only documentation about
the distribution or so. That's optional and up to you, of course.

Best regards,
Steffen
