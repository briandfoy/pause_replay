     why:

    Over the course of my scientific and programming work (in
    theoretical physics and professional software development) I have
    developed some Perl modules which I would like to share with others
    on CPAN. I wrote those modules myself since I could not find the
    desired functionality in the already published modules on CPAN. My
    modules fit several categories:

    (1) for working with LaTeX/Plain TeX, Pod and HTML; (2) text file
    parsing utilities; (3) Vim editor's perl interface interaction; (4)
    Fortran 77/90 parsing. (5) working with Git.
