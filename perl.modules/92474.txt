From: rrwo@cpan.org (Robert Rothenberg)

I've been trying to track down GRODITI regarding bugs in
POE::Component::DirWatch::Object for a while, and have not gotten responses.
(I've also tried contacting him via what seems to be his LinkedIn profile,
with no response.)

I've offered to fix some of the bugs and upload a new version.

I've contacted the co-maintainers of the module, but I gather from the PAUSE
view permissions page that they can't give me the ability to update the module.

So aside from convincing them to make the requested changes, what's the
procedure for getting myself added as a co-maint of a module when the owner
is MIA?

Regards,
Rob (CPANID rrwo)
