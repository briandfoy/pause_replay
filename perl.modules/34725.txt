The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       reform
  DSLIP:       bdppa
  description: Third millenium syntax for Perl 5 OOP
  userid:      HKOCH (Henning Koch)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.netalive.org/swsu/

  similar:
    rubyisms

  rationale:

    Hello!

    The PAUSE site has asked me to provide a rationale for the
    barefaced atrocity of claiming a new rootlevel namespace "reform",
    so here it is:

    reform is a module that facilitates some of the most basic tasks in
    OOP with Perl. For a detailled list of what reform does please see
    the synopsis at

    http://www.netalive.org/tinkering/reformed-perl/reform-0.1/html/reform.html

    The rootlevel namespace was chosen because of reform's pragma-ish
    nature. The module gently changes (reform-ulates!) very basic Perl
    syntax such as the declaration of subroutine parameters and
    inheritance. Where necessary it does so through source filtering,
    which is known to be frowned up by those who believe that Perl shall
    only be extended by hacking its native syntax (thus 'reform' as in
    "to improve the old ways").

    Should someone decide to use reform in a project, I expect them to
    use it pragma-style at the top of every package in that project: The
    use of reform doesn't make a lot of sense on a class-to-class basis
    in one project, as it provides a basic extension of universal
    functionality.

    I was also asked to discuss the relation between reform and
    rubyisms (which with all its similiarity also occupies a rootlevel
    namespace):

    I began this module as an extension to Simon Cozens' rubyisms, but
    found Simon's implementation of Ruby's "super" lacking.
    rubyisms::super doesn't allow to pass a custom set of parameters and
    won't work within constructors. Also - as in Ruby - it doesn't allow
    to call a base class method other than the one calling "super".

    I chose to not simply contribute to rubyisms as

    - Some parts of reform.pm could only be realized through a source
    filter and rubyisms is supposed to work in unfiltered Perl

    - I didn't want to limit reform's functionality to mimicing that of
    Ruby

    This being my first submission to CPAN, I assume it is now your
    turn to gun down my proposal.

    - Henning
