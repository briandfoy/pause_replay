The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Server::Simple::Dispatched
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Regex-dispatched HTML::Server::Simple
  userid:      FRODWITH (Paul Driver)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI

  rationale:

    HTTP::Server::Simple is cool, but it's really not intended to be
    used directly - you're supposed to use its subclass,
    HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI, which has all the CGI.pm cruft - and even
    then, you're stuck doing a lot of things (like url dispatching) on
    your own.

    This module keeps the simplicity of Server::Simple, but adds URL
    dispatching, HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response objects (and all the
    convenience you get with those), and handles 500s, 404, and so forth
    for you, and doesn't lock you into CGI.pm's sometimes idiosyncratic
    behavior.

    This is much nicer for me to use (itch scratching!) when I want a
    quick and dirty little http server to wrap up some perl code with,
    so I thought other people would benefit from it! Also, I'd like to
    get input (bugs and ideas on how to make it better) from the
    community, so it can be even better than it already is. :)

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::Server::Simple::
::Dispatched      adpOp Regex-dispatched HTML::Server::Simple        FRODWITH
