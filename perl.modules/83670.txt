The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Println
  DSLIP:       Rdpfb
  description: Print with newlines
  userid:      PERLOOK (Alexej Magura)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    https://bitbucket.org/agalog/releases/downloads

  similar:

  rationale:

    Java has two system out functions. System.out.print and
    System.out.println. For a long time now I have been wondering why
    Perl didn't also have a println function just like in Java; so I
    wrote one--granted, it has more of a Lua feel to it than Perl, but I
    think that I might be able to make it more like Perl's print and
    less like Lua's eventually.

  enteredon:   Tue Dec 11 16:19:00 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Println           Rdpfb Print with newlines                          PERLOOK
