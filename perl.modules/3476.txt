Spectacularly bad timing on my part :(
Nonetheless, I still think that Approx::Sub is a better name
for it.

Well, it's still a stupid thing, but one that a number of people
seem interested in extending.

Well, we don't actually have any cool matching code. We use Text::Soundex
by default, but the module can be configured to use Text::Metaphone,
String::Approx or any code provided by the user.

The cool stuff (well, what people tell me is cool) is simply
the way that I've sewn together a number of well understood technologies
(AUTOLOAD, typeglobs, Text::Soundex) to do something which is
a very good example of something that you couldn't do in many
other programming languages.

Well having looked at Devel::Symdump, I see that they don't (except
for a potential bug in Devel::Symdump which I'll mail you about
separately). I'll switch to using Devel::Symdump and remove GlobWalker
from CPAN.

Hope this clears things up. If you'd rather it was called something
like Stupid::Approx::Sub, I'd be happy with that too.

Let me know if I can help any more.

Cheers,

Dave...
