Greetings,

I wrote a library which can be used to write a presentation in
Perl with Tk: you write a perl program which calls my modules.
The best explanation you get is on the website: http://www.dhp.nl/~gpp/

The official name will be changed into "Portable Presenter", or
"PPresenter" for short.  

Development Stage: R
Support Level:     d
Language Used:     p  (+Tk)
Interface Style:   O
Email contact:     gpp@dhp.nl  (Mark Overmeer)  MARKOV
Website:           http://www.dhp.nl/~gpp/

What would be the best place to store the package?  It is not a
script, and I expect people want to contribute modules to the
package, for instance to create fancy backgrounds.
Structured like the Tk directory?  ~/PPresenter/PPresenter-1.0.tgz

I hope you are able to host my sources.

Sincerely,

               MarkOv       %-]
