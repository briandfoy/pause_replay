The code has to free, as in gratis, but not free as in rms.

I agree that all code on CPAN should be suitably licensed, but we've
been really lax about that and so far the Perl community hasn't figured
out how to denote licenses.

If a module doesn't state its license, we should just prod the author
(like you did). If it states something that requires money or something
else, then we can either get the author to change it or remove it. :)
