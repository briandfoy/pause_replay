The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Set::String
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Strings as sets of characters
  userid:      DJBERG (Daniel Berger)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc, irc

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module serves a triple purpose. First, it provides an object
    oriented String class for Perl. Second, it provides set operations
    for strings, by treating strings as an array of characters. Lastly,
    by including the Want.pm module, it allows proper method chaining.
    This combination, in my opinion, makes it unique and worth being
    listed in the module list.

    The namespace was chosen, in part, because it is a subclass of
    Set::Array.

The resulting entry would be:

Set::
::String          RdpOp Strings as sets of characters                DJBERG
