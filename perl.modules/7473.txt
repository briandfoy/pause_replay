Is Es:: really the best top-level namespace for this?  I'm sure I
recently saw a similar module for another country, and it wasn't under a
top-level namespace indicating the language.

Also, the spanish ID number *isn't* in espanol, unless it's some meaning
of "number" that I don't understand.  Espanol refers to a language
spoken in many countries in the world, and modules related to that
language should be under Lingua::ES::*.  

I'd suggest putting this module under Number::ID::Spanish or similar
(see Number::Phone::US for an analogous module).  And yes, I mean
*spanish* as in related to Spain, because presumably these numbers
aren't also used in, say, Mexico?
