The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::ErrorPropagation
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Error of a function of statistical data
  userid:      ZBYS (Zbigniew Sroczynski)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    If we want to calculate a function of a number of variables which
    are statistical data (a common situation in science) then we must
    know how the errors of the data combine to form, the final error on
    the function. There is a simple formula to describe how errors
    combine, or in other words, propagate, in this way. This is what is
    automated in this simple little module; error propagation.

    I suppose it belongs in Statistics:: because it deals with
    statistical data, and ErrorPropagation is what it does.

    Correct me if I am wrong, but I haven't found anything on CPAN
    which does this.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
::ErrorPropagation bdpOp Error of a function of statistical data      ZBYS
