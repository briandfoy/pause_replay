The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::Gen
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: provides functions for generating lists
  userid:      ASG (Eric Strom)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    CPAN

  similar:
    List::MoreUtils

  rationale:

    In general, List::Gen (which is already up on CPAN
    http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?List::Gen) is a module that provides
    a robust implementation of generator expressions (lazy lists), which
    work with a map-like syntax. As far as I can tell, this type of
    functionality is not present in other CPAN modules. Generators are
    complex, and are best described by List::Gen's documentation.

    In addition to generators, the module provides a few novel list
    manipulation functions, such as `mapn` which is a version of map
    that takes multi-element slices of its source list. There are also a
    few re-imaginings of common functions such as zip (this version does
    not require all arguments to be "@" arrays).

    There is also a focus on syntax extension, through functions like
    `by` or `every` which add mapn's variable step size to other perl
    control structures:

    for (every 3 => 1 .. 10) {say "@$_"}

    Thanks for considering List::Gen for inclusion into the module
    list.
