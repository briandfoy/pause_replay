Hi,

I've written Perl extensions to the Ogg Vorbis audio format and ao
audio playing libraries and would like to register them on CPAN.  I've
posted these on the Vorbis devel mailing list (vorbis-dev@xiph.org)
and there has been some interest.

Modules:

Ogg::Vorbis
bdch
Interface to Ogg Vorbis audio format library
--------------------------------------------
Ogg Vorbis is a fully Open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
general-purpose compressed audio format for high quality (44.1-48.0kHz,
16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and variable bit-rates
from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis in the same class as
audio representations including MPEG-1 audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio
(AAC and TwinVQ), and PAC.


Ao (should this be Sound::Ao or something?)
bdch
Interface to ao cross-platform audio library
--------------------------------------------
ao is a cross-platform audio library which takes raw PCM data as input
and can output to oss, esd, alsa, irix and solaris devices, or wav
files.


Thanks,
Alex
