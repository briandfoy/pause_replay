Subject: Module submission Finance::Amortization

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Amortization
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: Amortization Table interface
  userid:      WAGNER (Nathan Wagner)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::Loan

  rationale:

    Loans and similar instruments can be represented by an amortization
    table. Not only loans, but present value calculations, annuities,
    and probably other things all call for the same calculations. A
    module to wrap these up in one convenient place would be useful, at
    least to me.

    Finance::Loan does some similar calculations, but is misnamed and
    has hard-coded assumptions about payment periods. It also has an
    ugly interface and limited support for getting data out of the
    amortization.

  enteredby:   WAGNER (Nathan Wagner)
  enteredon:   Tue Jan  4 05:42:02 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::
::Amortization    bdpOd Amortization Table interface                 WAGNER
