Hello again Atsushi,

I have had local patches to Net::Flow 
<http://search.cpan.org/%7Eakoba/Net-Flow-0.04/lib/Net/Flow.pm> running 
in production (flowalyzer 
<http://www.plixer.com/Flowalyzer/flowalyzer.html>) for the two years 
since I submitted bug reports and sent this forwarded email.  If 
interested I would be happy to take over as the maintainer for that module.

-Andrew

Hello Atsushi,

We are using the IPFIX module you posted on CPAN
(http://search.cpan.org/~akoba/Net-Flow-0.04/) and found it useful for a
couple different programs we wrote. Thank you for making it available to
all of us.

Recently we discovered that there is an issue where it doesn't send out
all flows.  The details are in RT ticket 55858.
(https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55838)

I was wondering if your services are available for hire?  We are
interested in paying you to fix it.  Are you interested or can you
recommend someone who might be interested in fixing it?


Sincerely,
-Andrew
