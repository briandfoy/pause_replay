     why:

    I am in the process of porting the RavenCore codebase (which is
    mostly in perl) into a set of modules which work together to be a
    Hosting Control Panel as a whole, with the ability to function
    individually for other purposes.

    Examples:

    * A perl module that creates, modifies, and deletes users on both
    linux and unix systems. * A perl module that provides shorthand to
    several objects in the IO family. * A perl module that provides
    session handling and authentication with either flat-file or a
    database back-end * A perl module that edits system conf files
    (syslog.conf, logrotate.conf, and have the ability for submodules
    for further customization, ie: editing yum.conf, dovecot.conf, and
    other popular programs)
