The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SSH::Cluster
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: run a command on a cluster of machines
  userid:      VVU (Alex White)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The core of this module was built from the core of one of my other
    CPAN modules, Net::CascadeCopy, which also executes commands over
    ssh on many servers in parallel. This module goes a step further and
    will support running any arbitrary command. This is similar to the
    'dsh' utility from the ClusterIt suite:

    http://www.garbled.net/clusterit.html

    I have been using ClusterIt for several years. ClusterIt contains a
    lot of tools, but I mostly rely on a single tool in the ClusterIt
    suite, dsh. Given a command and arguments, dsh will execute that
    command on many systems in parallel using ssh. The systems can be
    specified on the command line or can be configured into groups of
    servers using a simple config file.

    dsh is an invaluable tool, but unfortunately it has a few issues.
    The primary problem with is that it discards the exit statuses of
    each command. OpenSSH passes along the exit status of the remote
    command, so it need not be discarded. On a related note, dsh doesn't
    provide any way to determine which (if any) hosts succeeded or
    failed. If I run a command on a hundred hosts, it can require
    inspecting a lot of logs to determine if any failed. Also when there
    is a very large amount of output (e.g. > 1GB) it sometimes hangs for
    long periods or crashes. Also, it is not possible to check the
    progress of arbitrary hosts--frequently the first host outputs at
    normal speed and, on completion, the output of the rest of the hosts
    comes all at once. Another minor annoyance is that it discards
    stderr by default. Net::SSH::Cluster addresses all these issues.

    I am providing a command line script (cssh) that will work similar
    to dsh and will use the same format config file.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::SSH::
::Cluster         adpOb run a command on a cluster of machines       VVU
