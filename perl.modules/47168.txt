Indeed it is a problem. Having self-descriptive names is a strong CPAN 
tradition. Additionally, think of CPAN as a "shopping market" for Perl code.

People will be looking in places like search.cpan.org for modules to do 
certain tasks, and it's in everybodies interests to have clear names.

1. It helps end-users find modules to solve problems
2. It means more people using your module, which presumably is what YOU 
want.
3. It means we are less likely to see people writing new duplicate CPAN 
package, because they couldn't find yours when they were looking for 
existing modules, and so more namespace pollution for us.

At the very least you should be taking some minimal steps towards being 
more approachable to users.

If you like AEAE as a project name, then there's not reason not to use 
it. You can name the Perl module CGI::AEAE or Ajax::AEAE so at least 
it's under an expected namespace, and people searching for Ajax things 
can find your module.
