Good Day,
   
With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and mygreetings, and I hope this =
letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this =
proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely =
seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free =
mind and as a person of integrity.
   
My name is Luther Bulawa, the son of Steve Bulawa Zhiri a farmer from =
Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instinct, =
I decided to contact you through email,after searching for contacts via the =
internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting =
off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.=

   
The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a =
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe,as a =
result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform =
wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers,all =
white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for =
re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father =
though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member =
of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea.
   
He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade =
my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They killed my father =
and took away a lot of items from his farm. After the death of my father, our =
local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over the WILL =
documents with instructions from my father that we should
leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him.
The WILL documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit =
totaling twelve million five hundred thousand united state dollars.[$12.5m] =
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to the company that the =
content is money hence it was deposited as personal belongings.
This money was deposited with a Private Security Company for safety and =
security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines =
and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.This violent and =
barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of my beloved mother and =
kid sister
and other innocent lives.
  
I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father aftern =
he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger became =
unbearable,and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe to Holland =
with the help of my father's close  friend  Mr. John Casahans from Australia =
also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family =
following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but all to no =
avail.
   
I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political =
asylum.In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum is because the =
security company from Zimbabwe has a branch  here in Holland, I have =
contacted them to move the safe deposit from  their office in Harare  to =
their office here in Holland, which they have done since. I need to transfer =
this money to an account and  invest part of the money. Since the law of =
Netherlands prohibits a  refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or =
to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable =
partner, whose account this money can be transferred,and who can front me as =
the beneficiary inorder to help  me claim the FUND hence this proposal to =
you.
   
You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and brave =
one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping =
of this money.
   If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with =
arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office =
here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred from their branch =
office in Zimbabwe,Harare to their office here. The company will  be legally =
informed of you representing me.
   
For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to =
have 25% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for =
the money to be deposited here or in your country, or you can go into =
partnership
with me for the proper  profitable investment of the money in your country. =
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply.
   
I have also set aside 5 % of this money for all kinds of expenses that may =
come our way in the process of this  transaction, and 4% for Charity =
donation. If you prefer to accept the 25% for your moral and financial =
assistance then the balance will be left in the account for me,which I may =
follow you to your country for investment purposes.
 Please, I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this =
transaction. I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you =
in advance as I anticipate your co-operation.
NOTE:PLEASE SEND YOUR RESPONSE TO lutherrankky@netscape.net
   
    Sincerely,
   
   Luther Bulawa
