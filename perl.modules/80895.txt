This would be better called Assert::Inline or Assert::Simple then.

It's not a standard unless and until people adopt it and in any case STD is
short for Sexually Transmitted Disease in en_UK! :)

I've no idea why Brian registered this, it's an awful and undescriptive name
under the circumstances and I'd really really suggest you consider one that
actually describes your module before uploading to CPAN.

(of course, the registration is already made so if you disagree feel free
to ignore me and upload anyway :)
