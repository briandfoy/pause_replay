I am working on a Perl module I'd like to contirbute to CPAN. Here is the
info the PAUSE doc indicates to provide:

Prefered Userid: ZOGZAPPER
Module Description: Freq.pm is a Perl object that allows quick collecting
and reporting of the frequency of data. You save to the object values and
then you can get infomation back that gives you a count of how many times a
particular value was saved. Uses are for counting user logins and getting
quick info comparing how many times each user logged in, etc. Freq.pm also
allows you to save values by groups. So you can them compare how often a
value occurs in one gorup vs. another. You could use this to quickly
compare site hits by time of day across a number of days.
