The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Format
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Easy-to-use date/time formatting
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules; RPI lily

  similar:
    None known. Date::Format, Date::Manip (UnixDate), and POSIX
    (strftime), sort of -- but not really.

  rationale:

    The Time::Format namespace is currently registered on a first-come
    basis to PGOLLUCCI. A CPAN search for Time::Format under that
    author's name, or any other of the first-come modules registered
    under that name, comes up blank. Also, an email I sent to
    pgollucci@cpan.org is so far unanswered.

    My Time::Format module implements an easy-to-use and (at least as
    important!) easy-to-remember time/date formatting system. No awkward
    % codes like strftime or Date::Manip's UnixDate. (I personally can
    never remember %A vs %B or %d vs %e in strftime....)

    The interface is a tied hash (although a function interface is also
    provided). This makes it easy to interpolate dates and times
    directly into strings (eg log message timestamps or database queries
    or updates) where they are needed.

    A tied-hash and function interface is also provided for strftime
    and UnixDate, for convenience and for features that Time::Format
    doesn't natively provide. I believe this is a very useful module
    that could (and should) become widely used, perhaps even become a
    standard module some day.

    Thanks, Eric Roode
