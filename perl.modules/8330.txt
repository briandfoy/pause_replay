Planned Contributions:

I am currently building a new style of web application framework which I call
'OpenThought'.  Web applications built on top of this do not require the page
to reload, but communicate with the server "in the background". This gives the
look and feel of not just any web page, but that of a full blown application.

I would like to offer the OpenThought Engine itself, along with modules I've
developed which are dependencies of OpenThought.  While these modules are
required for OpenThought, they are in most cases designed to be generic enough
to work with any program or module.

Thanks!
  -Eric
