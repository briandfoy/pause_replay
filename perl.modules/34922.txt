I think that "Model" is more descriptive because it says what 
instantiations of the module *are*.  The fact that the model can be 
represented like a tree is merely an implementation detail that could 
possibly change.  (Moreover, it isn't even a true tree in its 
implementation, because every Node can have multiple parents in 
addition to multiple children; a true tree mandates that every Node 
has exactly one parent.)  The model's implementation is just as much 
a relational set.

Moreover, "Tree" is already used several times by other CPAN modules 
in connection with SQL or databases (eg: DBIx::Tree).  And those 
meanings are quite different, representing a hierarchical set of 
related data *records*.  I don't want to be confused with that, 
because SQL::SyntaxModel doesn't store database data, only schema 
descriptions.  But its "schema" is broad enough to include such 
things as queries, which are represented as client-side routines.
