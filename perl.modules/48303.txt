The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Email::Fingerprint
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Calculate MD5 or other digests of emails
  userid:      BUDNEY (Leonard R Budney)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    qmail@list.cr.yp.to

  similar:
    Digest::MD5 Digest::SHA1

  rationale:

    Duplicate emails could be identified by an MD5 checksum, but they
    are likely to differ in unimportant ways--for example, each might
    have a different set of "received" headers. Email::Fingerprint will
    excerpt relevant parts of an email for computing a checksum:
    Message-ID if it exists; otherwise From:, To: and Date: headers;
    otherwise the email body. Optionally, the body can always be
    included in the checksum, for added reliability. This might help if
    a mailer re-uses a message-id, for example.

    Email::Checksum will also provide a handy cache class to handle
    file-locking and storing of observed email fingerprints, for use in
    scripts that guard inboxes against duplication or other similar use.

The resulting entry would be:

Email::
