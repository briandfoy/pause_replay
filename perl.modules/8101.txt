It might sound like an easy thing to convert html to an array of arrays,
but I assure you it takes more than a simple method.  The object model
works well I think.  I just counted and I have 18 subroutines, and it will
be more once I pull some subroutines from some other shared code that I
have.  The object method also works well for handling user preferences of
which there can be several.

I would say that in following conventions, perhaps HTML2Results
would be better for the namespace, case wise, and perhaps it should go
into the HTML node.  It really is the sister module for results2html which I
also recently requested.  If you think they should both go into HTML, I
would be fine with that, but I think Data is a better place for them since
it is more an array of arrays thing then an html thing.

Thanks,
Earl
