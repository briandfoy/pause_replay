Subject: Module submission CLucene

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CLucene
  DSLIP:       RdhOl
  description: CLucene C++ free text search engine
  userid:      PEDWARDS (Peter Edwards)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl.modules post 40369, http://sourceforge.net/projects/clucene

  similar:
    PLucene (similar concept, but PLucene is pure perl while CLucene is
    a wrapper to a separate C++ engine). Search::FreeText. htDig/mifluz.

  rationale:

    The module is a perl/swig/C++ wrapper to CLucene, a fast C++
    reimplementation of the java Lucene free text search engine. CLucene
    has been around a few years and is stable beta quality software
    intended for real world use in searching. It is fast and the insert
    time does not degrade as you add new documents. This is a
    resubmission using the namespace CLucene following post 40369.

  enteredby:   PEDWARDS (Peter Edwards)
  enteredon:   Mon May 16 23:15:49 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CLucene           RdhOl CLucene C++ free text search engine          PEDWARDS
