Thanks for you suggestions.  I just need to clarify one detail:
Are the words NameOfAuthType and NameOfUIType intended as literal
suggestions for module names, or as tokens to be replaced later by
the real module names ?

If the former, fine, I will go ahead and register these namespaces :-)
If the latter, I must ask you again to suggest appropriate names for
these two modules, because, as I explained, I am unable to think of
better names than the names they already have.
