That actually sounds like an excellent name, though I think I'd use CmdMgr
or CommandManager for the last part.

The trick to unwieldy naming is you can do

use aliased 'Business::Intelligence::MicroStrategy::CmdMgr' => 'CommandManager';

my $cmd_mgr = CommandManager->new(...);

so the full name only has to appear once per module anyway.
