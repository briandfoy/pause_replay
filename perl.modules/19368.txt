Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Domain for sale: FDNINC.COM - US $ 620 
 
FDNINC.COM is now available from us for immediate transfer. 
 
The domain name market is extremely solid at the moment and similar
domains are currently selling on afternic.com, greatdomains.com (domain
auction sites), and by domain name brokers, in some cases for many
thousands of US dollars. 
 
Please note that transfers can be completed within a few hours and are
extremely straightforward. Absolutely no technical knowledge is required. 
 
We use two methods of payment, either via Escrow.com or PayPal.com. We pay
all fees connected with the transfer process.  
 
If you would like to use WWW.FDNINC.COM for your online business, please
contact us at your earliest convenience. 
 
We thank you for your attention and sincerely apologise if this e-mail has
not been of interest to you. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
Leonard
NG Marketing
