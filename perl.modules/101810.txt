Hi Torsten,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving sit=
uations where CPAN distributions have ownership split between two or more=
 people, or missing indexing permissions, and various related issues.

Net-=46TPServer is one such curious case. Three different people released=
 it over the years, most recently user RYOCHIN, who did three releases in=
 2012. These are the most recent releases.

RYOCHIN has first-come on the lead module Net::=46TPServer, but on all of=
 the other modules, you (GETTY) have the first-come permission and RYOCHI=
N doesn=E2=80=99t even have co-maint.

My best guess is that you planned to take over Net-=46TPServer, and RYOCH=
IN meant to transfer all permissions to you, but one got missed. Or maybe=
 it was BRONG or RWMJ, the other two who have co-maint=3F And you never g=
ot round to doing any releases.

There are at least two ways to resolve this:

1. If you don=E2=80=99t plan on doing any release, I could transfer your =
first-comes to RYOCHIN and re-index his last release (to clear up all the=
 =22UNAUTHORIZED=22 red text on MetaCPAN). If neither you nor RYOCHIN pla=
n to do a (further) release, but at least leaves everything in a better s=
tate.
2. I could transfer RYOCHIN=E2=80=99s first-come to you, give him co-main=
t on all modules, and still re-index his last release. Then you=E2=80=99r=
e good to do a release, and everything=E2=80=99s tidied up in the meantim=
e.

I=E2=80=99ve copied Okamoto-san (RYOCHIN) on this, in case my guess at hi=
story is entirely wrong.

Are you both happy for me to progress as per step 1=3F

Cheers,
Neil
