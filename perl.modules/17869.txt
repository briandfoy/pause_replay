Hi, I'm user CPAN GIULIENK
I uploaded the module Audio::Beep a couple days ago: it showed up fine after a few hours.
Then I uploaded a new version. After that the module disappeared. I see it if i go to the "Delete Files" options in my PAUSE menu. But it's not visible in my personal folder at http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/G/GI/GIULIENK/
I tried to "Reindex" it. I received email conferming the reindexing happened but i don't see the modules where they should be.
Is there anything i did wrong?
Thanks and kind regards.
Giulio Motta
