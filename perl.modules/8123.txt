The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Constants
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Resolve Constants back to their names
  userid:      CHROMATIC (chromatic)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=117349

  similar:
    constant

  rationale:

    Devel::Constants captures constant declarations (with the constant
    pragma), allowing values to be resolved to their symbols at runtime.
    It has a special method to resolve bitwise flag markers, such as
    those found in a TCP packet.

    This can be very convenient when dealing with users -- names are
    more convenient than magic numbers, which is why constant
    declaration is possible in the first place.

    The Perlmonks discussion used a namespace related to the 'constant'
    pragmata. The current suggestion seems more appropriate, as the
    scope of the module has expanded somewhat.

  enteredby:   CHROMATIC (chromatic)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct  9 22:24:41 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Constants       bdpfp Resolve Constants back to their names        CHROMATIC
