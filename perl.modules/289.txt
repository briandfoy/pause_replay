My module name should be DBIx::Profile.  It has that set in the
Makefile, and there is a class/package with that name in my module.

That appears to satisfy Tim's comments.

However, Andreas' comments I am not sure how to satisfy.

I believe it is going in DBIx/Profile.pm; from the resulting Makefile:
"FULLEXT = DBIx/Profile"

The way I understand Perl and packages, you must use the name of the
file in a "use" statement.  So, given "Profile.pm", "use Profile;"
would be the way my module would be pulled into an application.

Am I wrong?  (I doubt this question belongs in this forum, so I apologize)

Thanks!
