Dear modules,

I have an ownership tangle that I hope you can help me sort out.=20

I - WROSS - am the author of Geo::Postcode, a module that remains =
popular but has had very little attention from me in the last five =
years. I would like to give co-maintenance or complete ownership to =
LLAP, who has all sorts of excellent plans, but I see PAUSE has demoted =
me to co-maintainer and given ownership to GMRGD. That would be ok, =
except they're just as negligent as me.

Is it possible to do one of these things?

* give LLAP co-maint on Geo::Postcode and Geo::Postcode::Location
* restore WROSS to ownership of Geo::Postcode so that I can give =
co-maint to LLAP
* send a change-of-ownership proposal to GMRGD suggesting that LLAP take =
over
* er
* something else?

Recent developments mean there is an excellent opportunity for this =
module to make itself useful, and I'd hate to hold it back.

thanks,

will=
