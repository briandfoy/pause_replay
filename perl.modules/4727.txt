This got absolutely no comment last time so I'm going to try again.  The
04pause.html documents says "Generally a lack of response can be taken as
acceptance of the module name being proposed" but perhaps that's not the
case here because this module still isn't in the index.


Name:   Params::Validate
DSLI:   bdpf
Author: DROLSKY
Description: Validate subroutine parameters based on type, class, or
interface


Alternate namespace suggestions are welcomed if this does not suit.


Thanks,
