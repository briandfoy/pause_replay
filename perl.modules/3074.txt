    Yes, I was suggesting that you change the namespace to
DbFramework::Alzabo or somesuch.

    The purpose of the modules list is to advertise software on CPAN.  It's
not much of an advertisement if it's not descriptive, or categorized with
similar software.  So, if you want to put Alzabo on CPAN, but you want people
to prefer picking it up from Sourceforge, then I recommend that you not
register it in the modules list.

    Having said all that, it's your call -- except for the part about
getting the name in the modules list; you _do_ have to convince people
before that will happen . . . .
