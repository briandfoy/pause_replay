Chris, please have a look at 
http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover. It describes out 
procedure for taking over modules from unresponsive authors. Given that 
Sherzod has not been active for years, I'm willing to give you 
co-maintenance permissions for the module in question if you give me the 
name of your PAUSE account.

Sherzod, if you read this and object, please speak up! Note that all 
actions we take are reversible.

Best regards,
Steffen
