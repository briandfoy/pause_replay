     why:

    I powered through O'Reilly's Learning Perl in about 30 days (but
    need to finish the exercises from Chapter 12 on, so I kinda
    cheated). The effort scored me a job! But I really, really liked
    programming. Plus I keep trying to use modules which require an
    understanding of objects and whatnot.

    So I just bought Intermediate Perl with my first paycheck (not the
    whole thing of course), and it told me to request this account.

    Thanks!
