Class-SelfMethods-1.07 and Error-Unhandled-1.02 have been released.  The
patches involve modifications to the Makefile.pl.  At someone's suggestion,
I had placed SelfMethods.pm in the Class directory within the distribution
directory to make it easier to run test.pl and bench.pl and so forth.
However, having done so the MakeMaker process refused to actually install
the pm file.  After much frustrated poking around I finally broke down an
explicitly specified things in the PM option and things are working now.

There is no change to the code - only changes to Makefile.pl.

I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

P.S. It's a little heartbreaking that Class-SelfMethods-1.06 has been out
for over 4 months now and no one has noticed this.  *sniff*  Ah, well, I'm
hard at work getting the OO framework for doing database frontends in ASP
out, so then I'll have something nice and big for no one to use:).
