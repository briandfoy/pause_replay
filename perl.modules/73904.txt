The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Range::String
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: string and integer set arithmetic
  userid:      KAN (Kan Liu)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    chatrooms

  similar:

  rationale:

    Range::String is intended for large scale cluster management (>100K
    hosts) Given properly named hosts, Range::String can give your tools
    the ability to interpret range expressions from the command line or
    configuration files.

    In addition to expanding range expressions into lists, and
    serializing lists as range expressions, Range::String is also able
    to interpret and perform set operations.

    Union of sets A and B, is denoted as A,B.

    Difference of set A from B, is denoted as A,-B.

    Intersection of sets A and B, is denoted as A,&B.

    Catenation of sets A and B, is denoted as AB.

    Scope is denoted with { }.

    Union, difference, and intersection have equal precedence, and are
    preceded by catenation. Scope precedes all other operators.

    e.g.

    '{a1,b2}{1~9,&{3~11,-2~7}},-/^a/' results in b28, b29
    '{a1,b2}{1~9,&{3~11,-2~7}},&/9$/' results in a19, b29

    With overloaded operators +, -, &, +=, -=, &=, "", @{}, etc., set
    calculations on range objects are like simple integer arithmetic,
    and range objects can be interpolated like strings or lists.

The resulting entry would be:

Range::
::String          MdpOp string and integer set arithmetic            KAN
