The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Scalar::Array
  DSLIP:       Rmcfp
  description: Turn arrayrefs into iterators
  userid:      ALFIE (Alfie John)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Melbourne Perl Mongers, github

  similar:
    None that I know of

  rationale:

    There was a discussion today on Melbourne-PM about doing this. I
    knew it could be done. He's the itch I scratched.

  enteredby:   ALFIE (Alfie John)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb 19 15:21:17 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Scalar::
::Array           Rmcfp Turn arrayrefs into iterators                ALFIE
