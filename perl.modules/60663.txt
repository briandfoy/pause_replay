The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       autodie
  DSLIP:       adppp
  description: Lexically have functions succeed or die
  userid:      PJF (Paul Jamieson Fenwick)
  chapterid:   27 (Pragma)
  communities:
    p5p, p6l, my blog, Melbourne.pm, perlmonks, code at
    http://github.com/pfenwick/autodie/tree/master

  similar:
    Fatal does the same job as autodie, but with package scope. The
    autodie distribution will include an upgraded Fatal

  rationale:

    There's been general approval in p5p that autodie (and
    corresponding improvements) are a good idea. The best example of how
    autodie works, and where to get the development of the code, can be
    found at:

    http://pjf.id.au/blog/?position=540

    I'm not uploading my new code (which includes a new Fatal.pm) to
    CPAN just yet because of the risk of it being accidentally
    downloaded by someone thinking they're upgrading Fatal to a new
    stable release.

    This request is to essentially reserve the 'autodie' name. I hope
    to be uploading a placeholder module to CPAN in the near future,
    which does not contain a Fatal.pm, but does contain plenty of
    documentation as to the project status.

The resulting entry would be:

autodie           adppp Lexically have functions succeed or die      PJF
