     why:

    Text::VimColor -- uses the Vim text editor (by carefully forking
    and execing it) to do syntax highilghting on a file or string, and
    provides the results as HTML (with classes for coloring with CSS) or
    a simple XML format. Useful for pretty code samples in web pages.

    Search::DocumentDB -- full text search engine, which uses a DBI
    handle to store the index (currently requires Postgres, but I'll add
    MySQL support soon). Has good support for storing metadata for
    documents, which is handy for 'advanced search' features like
    searching within a date range.

    I've also got most of a module for handling password authentication
    and cookie-based sessions, useful for web applications. Haven't
    picked a suitable name for it yet though.
