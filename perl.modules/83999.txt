The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Subs
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Tests with anonymous code block
  userid:      MATHIAS (Mathias Kende)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Simple, Test::Functionnal

  rationale:

    This proposed Test::Subs module offer a lightweight syntax based on
    anonymous subroutine to declare Tap::Harness compliant test plan.

    As opposed to other module, the main functionnalities of Test::Subs
    are that the user does not need to pre-declare the number of test to
    run (so all modification) in a test file are locals and the
    declaration of the tests is done with a syntax based on anonymous
    code block, which I believe (subjectively) are cleaner and easier to
    read than the list of value used by other module.

    Similar modules includes: - Test, Test::Simple and Test::More,
    suffering from the (perceived) draw-backs described above. -
    Test::Functionnal is quiet close to the proposed Test::Subs but with
    a less straightforward syntax that may confuse non experienced Perl
    programmer having to maintain some code.

The resulting entry would be:
