I reregistered those two with the correct name. Is there a more
efficient way to change the name of a registered module?

Andreas: If there is no way that involved mysql shells, could this be
something that happens often enough to warrant a "change registered
module name" entry in the admin menu?

Test::WWW::Acc... won't be deleted.

Exhaustedly,
Steffen
