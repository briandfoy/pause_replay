Done.

That said, I do think we give original authors a little too much control 
here. In the case where the author has stopped releasing things to CPAN, 
insisting that we try to track them down personally outside of using the 
existing bug reporting mechanisms seems a little much.

I'm not sure how we can best have that conversation as a community.
