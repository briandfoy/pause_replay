Hello,

I have contacted the author of Device::USB about the possibility of taking
over the module. He has not had time to complete his implementation and mine
is almost ready. He has agreed to let me upload my implementation as the new
Device::USB.

Is there any process I need to go through to complete this conversion, or do I
just upload the module?

Thank you for your time.
