I'm ready to upload a new set of modules in what I'd like to call the
"Blatte" namespace.  Blatte is a new language for text markup and
transformation.  It's a successor to Latte (see http://www.latte.org/)
and has a very similar syntax.  The main difference is that Blatte
programs compile into Perl programs, and have access to all of Perl's
functions and operators (and vice versa).

The main Blatte distribution will include the parser-evaluator, the
basic text-transforming logic, and a generous set of Blatte
intrinsics.  Another module, Blatte::HTML, will follow shortly; it'll
allow the transformation of Blatte documents into HTML documents.
Other similar modules are possible (e.g., Blatte::XML and
Blatte::LaTeX), which is why Blatte should be a top-level namespace.

BTW, the B in Blatte stands for "Better."
