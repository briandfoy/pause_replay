The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Inspector
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Provides information about Classes
  userid:      ADAMK (Adam Kennedy)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:
    Class::ISA UNIVERSAL

  rationale:

    Provides a wrapper around a variety of different things, most of
    which need knowledge of perl wizard of varying obscurity, but which
    would be nice to be easier to get at.

    For example: Class::Inspector->methods walks the ISA tree and
    symbol table, and compiles a list of all the non-AUTOLOADed methods
    the class has.

    I've intentionally tried not to walk on the footsteps of anything
    else. Class::Inspector->method_exists was a logical one, but is
    implemented by UNIVERSAL::can well enough.

    Limited set of methods for now, but are expected to increase over
    time.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Inspector       RdpOp Provides information about Classes           ADAMK
