This is actually the CGI::MxScreen module I've already registered.
Christophe and I are co-authoring this one: I wrote a first version which
was about to be released, but we decided with Christophe that something better
could be done, so we re-engineered the thing together.  We're about 60% done,
but of course, we're using Devel::Datum heavily.

I'll let Christophe explain why "Devel::Datum" is such a cute and accurate
name for his module. ;-)

Cheers,
Raphael
