I am rather confused.

Many documents on PAUSE and CPAN refer to the Perl 5 module list.
It is, for example, to be consulted when considering module naming, and
to search for pre-existing modules.  Documents all over the web refer
to it.  Without exception that I have been able to find, all of these
references point to <http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html>
as the place to get hold of the module list.

The document served at that URI is dated 2002-08-27 internally,
and has a timestamp of 2002-08-28.  It lists (at a rough estimate)
somewhere in the region of only half the number of modules that appear
in the by-module hierarchy.  Evidently this is the module list as it
was eighteen months ago.

PAUSE appears to maintain all the metadata that goes into the module
list.  search.cpan.org searches on a recent version of this metadata.
Evidently the module list is still being maintained.

In web searches I have been entirely unable to locate a version of the
module list more recent than the 2002-08-27 one.  I have also failed to
find any mention of the module list being out of date, or anyone asking
about it.

This is why I am mailing you to ask: what's going on?  Why is such
an outdated module list being published in an authoritative location,
and where can I get an up-to-date list?

TIA.
