I think you're pretty clear.

Then get more people involved is all I can suggest.

I'm aware of the latter two at least (I don't do any Tk stuff really).

I guess I need to get on that module-authors list (any pointers towards a
signup.  web searches are proving fruitless.  and off-topic: where is that
damn advocacy list?).  I've tried discussing some of these issues on
c.l.p.mod but the newsgroup (and all of them in general) is so cluttered
with noise and the vast majority of readers are newbies with CGI questions
that it seemed fairly useless.

Hehe, no, that doesn't seem to be very sensible.

That's certainly fine.  I guess I'd just want to know if someone wanted to
upload a bunch of stuff into a namespace I know.  The only time that
someone has wanted to this so far she contacted me first and we discussed
it before it went to this list, which is obviously the best way to handle
things.

I really think you need to actively recruit some more help then.

Ok, I'm exaggerating for dramatic effect!

I think you (plural) have to work towards becoming a little more
institutionalesque.

Hmm, I'm still not convinced.  Ok, there's this modules-discuss
list.  Maybe some filtered version of what goes to modules@perl.org
should go there?  I need to subscribe to this modules-authors list somehow
I guess.

Well, like I've said twice so far.  I think the real problem is lack of
tuits.  Solution: get more people to help.  We've already got great
infrastructure with CPAN so I think its just a matter of available free
time.
