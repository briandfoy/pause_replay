     why:

    Initially I would like to contribute a module to provide an
    interface to the (fairly simple, but hopefully growing) Wally API
    for home sensor monitoring use (https://www.wallyhome.com/api/). I
    attempted to search for related modules first, but did not find any
    currently on CPAN.

    Additionally, I am a professional Perl developer whose focus
    usually revolves around building custom web applications and I may
    have interest in publishing a lightweight web framework as well as
    other related tools/utilities.

    Looking forward to hearing back soon and hope my initial
    contribution is worthy of consideration. Despite my historical focus
    on private, proprietary projects, I have an ongoing goal of trying
    to contribute more to the open source Perl community at large, and
    believe that this is a small step in that direction.

    Thanks!
