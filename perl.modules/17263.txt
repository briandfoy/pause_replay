Hello List,

I have recently released a fesh, new, and probably bugged module on CPAN
called TripleStore, because, err, that's what it is. Basically it's an
interface to manipulate triple stores (insert, delete, update) and also
to perform queries with a syntax inspired from the 'RDBF' style syntax,
i.e.

  # rdbf-style syntax
  # select ( ?x ?y ) from triple where (?x worksFor ?y) (?y name 'BBC')  
  
  # Equivalent TripleStore syntax
  my $x = $::DB->var();
  my $y = $::DB->var();
  my $res = $::DB->select (
      $x, $y,
      $::DB->clause ($x, 'worksFor', $y) &
      $::DB->clause ($x, 'name', 'BBC')
  );
  
I am looking forward to maybe rename this module, because I think that
TripleStore is too generic... I've previously been moaning about generic
namespaces being taken by modules on this list so I would like to avoid
making this mistake :)

Another thing to note is that this TripleStore module has __NOTHING__ to
do with RDF, you might be able to use it in conjunction with an RDF
parser to store RDF but that's where it stops.

Any ideas for an appropriate name?
Thanks in advance,
