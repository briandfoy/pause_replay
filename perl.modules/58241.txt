The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ham::APRS::FAP
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Stable and fast APRS parser and encoder
  userid:      HESSU (Heikki Hannikainen)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://oh7lzb.blogspot.com/ and the linux-hams mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    Ham::APRS seems like a natural choice, the Ham top level namespace
    seems to exist for Ham Radio (Amateur Radio) related modules, and
    this module implements APRS (Amateur Packet Reporting System)
    parsing and encoding functionality.

    A module called Ham::APRS::Parser has been published quite some
    time ago, but it isn't on the CPAN yet. Our module has been
    developed in parallel and is (in our experience) more complete and
    more stable, but hasn't been released before. The natural name
    choice would have been Ham::APRS::Parser, but that was already
    taken, so we settled on Ham::APRS::FAP (Finnish or Fabulous APRS
    Parser).

  enteredby:   HESSU (Heikki Hannikainen)
  enteredon:   Sat Dec 15 20:11:41 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Ham::APRS::
::FAP             Rdpfp Stable and fast APRS parser and encoder      HESSU
