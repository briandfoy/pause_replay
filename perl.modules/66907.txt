Subject: Change a PAUSE ID

From: doug@plainblack.com (Doug Bell)

I'd like to change my PAUSE ID from "HAWKALOOG" to something less  
retarded. "PREACTION" or "DOUGBELL" would be much nicer.

What was once funny (hawkaloogie) when I was 16 is now not nearly as  
hilarious now that I'm 26 and trying to write professional code for  
professional purposes and professional money.

What little code exists under HAWKALOOG is completely bit-rotted and  
obsolete.

What I plan to contribute: Test::A8N bits, a Continuous Integration  
framework (with Konobi and Nachbaur), modules to make WebGUI easier to  
develop for

Without a PAUSE ID that I can point to without fear of reprisal, I  
cannot put my code onto the CPAN.

Thank you for your help,
