Hi,

I have uploaded 2 versions of this but only the first is appearing in the
'distributions' search (version 130). The second appears to have uploaded ok
to CPAN as I received emails to that effect. I incremented the VERSION
variable within the .pm file, and changed the upload name too.

Can you please let me know what I need to do to :

	a) Get the latest version to appear on cpan

	b) Get the name added so that the indexer automatically picks it up?
(I've sent a request to this email a while ago to request this btw).

Many thanks,

Ian Steel.
