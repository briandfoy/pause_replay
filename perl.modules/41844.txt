Hello Perl People,

I have a Perl library to do high-performance web load balancing and static
web serving (GET, PUT, DELETE...) based on the Danga::Socket event loop
and socket class.

It's a proper library (currently Perlbal.pm) and a whole suite of
submodules under the Perlbal:: namespace... Perlbal::ClientProxy,
Perlbal::ClientHTTP, Perlbal::ClientHTTPBase, Perlbal::BackendHTTP, etc...

The actual load balancer / webserver is all in a tiny file called
"perlbal" which just uses Perlbal and pipes a config file into
Perlbal.pm's management interface parser.

Also, our company has a distributed filesystem (google: MogileFS) written
in Perl, which depends on Perlbal.pm.  There are a number of
high-load sites using both Perlbal and MogileFS.

We've paid a Debian developer to make packages for all the parts and
dependencies, but we're also wondering whether this should go into CPAN.

If so, I think it might be dirty uploading it as "Perlbal".  But it's
known/used as that so much, I'm also reluctant to change it.

Can I just upload it to my homedir on CPAN and not register the namespace?

Or rename at least the front-end module to be "HTTPD::Perlbal"?

Any suggestions welcome!

Thanks,
Brad
