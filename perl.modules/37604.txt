          No B.S. Way to Finally Making Real and Easy Multiple Income Streams 
          Online... And You can Join at NO cost...</b></font> 
          <p><font color="#000080"><b>Hi There!</b></font></p>
          <p><b>Would you like to make more of your life?</b> Make it more comfortable? 
            More enjoyable? More <i>profitable</i>?</p>
          <p>If so, this could be the most important No BS message you will ever 
            receive... because with our help you CAN achieve all of this and more.</p>
          <p>To those &quot;in the know&quot;, it is well-known there is only 
            ONE RIGHT WAY for the average person to earn a substantial income 
            online... by building multiple streams of residual income... <u>something 
            that pays you</u> month in, month out, indefinitely, regardless if 
            you continue working or not.</p>
          <p>Now, there are literally THOUSANDS of programs online all promising 
            you riches... Promising their program is the best. Promising you'll 
            make more money with them because of their compensation program. Because 
            of their &quot;superior&quot; product. Because of their &quot;experienced&quot; 
            management. Etc., etc.</p>
          <p>But you need to be ever-vigilant. <u>Not all opportunities are created 
            equal</u>... In fact, the vast majority will suck your hard earned 
            money out of your pockets so fast, you won't even realize until it's 
            far too late.</p>
          <p>If you've ever felt &quot;let down&quot; or disappointed by a business 
            opportunity... Or worse yet, have ever been just plain SCAMMED... 
            (and if you've been in the business for ANY length of time, you no 
            doubt HAVE been!), then you KNOW what I'm talking about. If you're 
            a rank beginner, then take heed!</p>
          <p>Too many companies that offer opportunities are:</p>
          <ol>
            <ol>
              <li>Too inexperienced;</li>
              <li>Too broke;</li>
              <li>Favor only the heavy hitter at the expense of the &quot;little 
                guy&quot;;</li>
              <li>Just plain <i>illegal</i>;</li>
              <li>One or more of the above.</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
          <p>So what it comes down to is that you never quite know what you are 
            getting into <u>UNLESS you know exactly what to look for</u>... the 
            right questions to ask... WHO to talk to to get the <i>straight</i> 
            scoop.</p>
          <p>But the problem is, the average guy or gal doesn't know the first 
            thing about evaluating an opportunity to determine if its good or 
            bad... And that's where NoBSzone.com comes in...</p>
          <p><b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Do YOU know 
            how to do the due diligence required to sift the gold nuggets from 
            the muddy waters?</font></b></p>
          <p>We do.</p>
          <p>We've been doing it for years. </p>
          <p>You see, we've been in the business opportunity field for decades 
            (literally, since the 80s). And in our business, we HAVE TO know what's 
            going on in the marketplace. We need to keep an eye on the competition... 
            stay abreast of what is working... <u>and what isn't</u>. And that 
            has given us the <b>experience</b>, the <b>knowledge</b>, the <b>expertise</b> 
            to properly evaluate a program to determine its potential for success.</p>
          <p>We scrutinize hundreds of programs, all down to the most minute of 
            details. And only when (and indeed IF) it meets our stringent requirements 
            will we allow it to be shared with you. In short, <u>we do all of 
            the due diligence FOR YOU and recommend only the best of the best</u>. 
          </p>
          <p>But more than that, we have structured our recommendation service 
            into its own &quot;matrix&quot; that allows you to have a built-in, 
            ready-to-join group EVERY TIME WE MAKE A RECOMMENDATION! This means 
            you simply refer people to our program, and <u>they will remain in 
            your group (earning for you), no matter what opportunities you become 
            involved in</u> through our recommendations! Incredible! (Plus, check 
            out the site to see how people you don't even refer yourself will 
            be placed in your group too, also earning for you!)</p>
          <p><b><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one is left 
            out</font></b></p>
          <p>NoBSzone&#153; is the best and biggest &quot;mega-commission club&quot;, 
            and for good reason... no one gets left out! It doesn't matter where 
            or when a new member joins because through our unique &quot;matrix 
            shuffle&quot;, they will be in a position to earn! Even if they <i>never</i> 
            participate in our program recommendations. You will see how this 
            works when you review our &quot;bonus programs&quot; at the site.</p>
