<BR>The three paid no attention to his wordsOne of them thrust his hand
into Rob's pocket and drew out the electric tube
His ignorance of modern appliances was so great that he did not know enough
to push the button
Rob saw him looking down the hollow end of the tube and murmured: I wish it
would blow your ugly head off! But the fellow, thinking the shining metal
might be of some value to him, put the tube in his own pocket and then took
from the prisoner the silver box of tablets<BR>
<BR>Rob writhed and groaned at losing his possessions in this way, and
while his hands were fastened behind him tried to feel for and touch the
indicator of the traveling machineWhen he found that the machine also had
been taken, his anger gave way to fear, for he realized he was in a
dangerously helpless condition
<BR>The third Turk now drew the Record of Events from the boy's inner
pocketHe knew nothing of the springs that opened the lids, so, after a
curious glance at it, he secreted the box in the folds of his sash and
continued the search of the captive
The Character Marking Spectacles were next abstracted, but the Turk, seeing
in them nothing but spectacles, scornfully thrust them back into Rob's
pocket, while his comrades laughed at him
