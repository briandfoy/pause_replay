The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       US_DOD::STD490A
  DSLIP:       Rdpnp
  description: Specification Practices
  userid:      SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    US_DOD::STD490A

  rationale:

    This is the standard that controls the format of every book type US
    DOD drawing. This includes standard, DIDs, specifications,
    documents, whatever.

    See US_DOD::STD2167A for more discussion.

    This is last of the US_DOD:: module I have for submission to CPAN.

    Maintance will be low priority.

    If want more, show DRAP or some other US DOD activity what you have
    on CPAN and ask for a grant. Grants are best effort. In others
    words, if you show up every day and keep a dairy to prove that you
    are not cross-charging and working on what you should be working on,
    you will get paid.

    Do not ask for a contact. For a contact, if you do not produce per
    a written specification in accordance with 490A, you will not get
    paid or only partially paid.

    DOD does have great source of steady income: taxes and printing
    press.

  enteredby:   SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun  5 23:08:12 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

US_DOD::
::STD490A         Rdpnp Specification Practices                      SOFTDIA
