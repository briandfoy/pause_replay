Hi Lukas

Thanx for letting us know. All PAUSE admins will appreciate that.

I've tried to make Rick the primary maint, even though the resultant 
display of his modules says he's registered in the module list but not 
actually primary maint. Sigh.

Over to you, Rick. Just upload a new version and tell us what happens.
