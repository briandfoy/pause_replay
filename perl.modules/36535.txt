The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::P0f
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl wrapper for the P0f utility
  userid:      SAPER (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    presented at the French Perl Workshop 2004 and YAPC::Europe 2004
    (slides available at
    http://maddingue.org/conferences/yapc-eu-2004/network-neighbourhood/)

  rationale:

    Hello,

    This module is a wrapper of the P0f network tool, which aim is to
    offer the functionalities of this very useful utility for Perl
    programs. The distribution includes different backends in order to
    be portable and to adapt to the requirements of the local system.
    Currently, only the command-line backend is implemented (which
    should be the most portable), but the others will be implemented as
    soon as possible.

    The name was chosen following Net::Pcap (which is used by Net::P0f
    in order to avoid unnecesary XS code) and because it's clearly a
    network tool.

    Thanks in advance
