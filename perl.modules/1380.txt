Re: NDBBKGENGKJAJILCHBJPGEHNCHAA.kryan@web.fairfax.com.au ,
could someone please reply.

I really want to use this module in my module, Lingua::EN::AddressParse,
but don't like forcing people to look in user directories. Can anyone
explain why this module doesn't exist in the Geography directory, or if
Locale::States is a better name for it (as Locale directory already exists).
If yes, then I can suggest to the author that it could be renamed.

It is very frustrating to be kept in the dark . Many postings here,
particularly
submissions to the module list just go ignored.
