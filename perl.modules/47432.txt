File:: would probably be right, Parse:: is the other namespace that is 
also used for this sort of thing.

Other than that, if what you are doing is really a database, simply do a 
DBD:: module (see DBD::Salesforce for an example of a virtual database 
interface).

Also, potentially something like File::Unix::passwd or 
Parse::Unix::passwd would also suffice.
