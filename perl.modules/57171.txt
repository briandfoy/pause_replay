The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Amazon::S3::Tools
  DSLIP:       bdpnl
  description: command line tools for Amazon S3
  userid:      MRA (Mark Atwood)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Amazon::S3 Net::Amazon::S3::Bucket

  rationale:

    The Net::Amazon::S3 and Net::Amazon::S3::Bucket modules give Perl
    code an excellent API to the Amazon S3 service.

    However, there is also a need to access and manipulate S3 from the
    command line, via executable scripts.

    There used to exist a toolset called the "Hanzo S3 tools", written
    in Python, but they had many limitations, and now have been
    withdrawn by Hanzo.

    I've written Net::Amazon::S3::Tools to fill that void. It's a set
    of useful command line invokable scripts that display and set ACLs
    on buckets and items, and list, create, and remove buckets, and
    list, get, set, and remove items.

    The scripts all use "use warnings" and "use strict", parse their
    command line with Getopt::Long, and each also has man-page-like POD,
    and also uses Pod::Usage.

    It's already got a couple of users, and I've been incorporating
    suggestions and patches from them.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Amazon::S3::
::Tools           bdpnl command line tools for Amazon S3             MRA
