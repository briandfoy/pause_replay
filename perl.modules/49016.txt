Subject: Module submission Sepia
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, seano@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sepia
  DSLIP:       bdhhp
  description: Simple Emacs Perl Interface
  userid:      SEANO (Sean O'Rourke)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Emacs::Lisp

  rationale:

    The name Sepia is arbitrary, like "Catalyst", "Maypole", and most
    of the other swiss army knife modules on CPAN, though at least it's
    an acronym. I don't know of another project to provide Lisp-like
    interactive development support for Perl in Emacs. Hopefully there
    are other people who, like myself, enjoy this style of development
    and can benefit from this module.

  enteredby:   SEANO (Sean O'Rourke)
  enteredon:   Thu May 25 01:32:43 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sepia             bdhhp Simple Emacs Perl Interface                  SEANO
