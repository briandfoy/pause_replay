Hi,
     Iam working on the DBI and DBD implementation in Perl. When I
downloaded DBD-Oracle-1.12 and tried to run perl Makefile.PL Iam facing
     Problem of the following
      Can't locate loadable object for module in DBI in @INC(..paths) at
DBI.pm line 189.
      This line contains bootstrap DBI;
       I have installed DBI-1.20 database properly and my "make test" also
is working fine.
       I want to know the exact linking problem.
       The DBI.bs file in DBI-1.20 contains the following line:

       @Dynaloader::dl_resolve_using = qw(DBI);
       1;

       Please help me with the problem since it helps me in my current
project.
Regards,
Srivalli.
