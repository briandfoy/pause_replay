The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AutoCons
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: A cons-based build system
  userid:      RIDDLE (Michael Howell)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker Module::Build

  rationale:

    Cons is an advanced build system with support for features like MD5
    signature-based dependency resolving, compiling C code, and is
    extensible. It's build files are written in Perl. so they are easily
    extensible and can handle all of the complex needs of a build. Cons
    is written in Perl, so it will run on anything perl will, and only
    requires stock Perl modules. AutoCons is a cons-based build system
    similar to programs like ExtUtils::MakeMaker and GNU
    Autoconf/Automake. Like Cons, it only requires stock Perl modules
    and it's metadata files are written in Perl. AutoCons can
    automatically handle Perl modules and easily work with C programs.
    IT IS NOT LIMITED TO PERL MODULES;IT IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR
    MAKEMAKER. Because no other modules do this job, AutoCons is not
    stored in any of the existing namespaces.

The resulting entry would be:

AutoCons          adpfp A cons-based build system                    RIDDLE
