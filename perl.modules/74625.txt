Hello :)

There are some problems in my opinion with transferring that namespace.

The module was intended to include a Pure-Perl implementation of the
CubeHash digest,
as well as the XS functionality implemented by Gray's module, and as
such it's taken
me more than 3 months to write; considering the responsibilities of
life and etc.

If I were to just hand the namespace over, I feel that the intended
implementation would never
be complete, and I am a bit dissatisfied with this outcome. Most
crypto stuff on CPAN is
lacking a PP implementation, I wanted CubeHash to be the first in a
long string of PP crypto
projects; due to its simplicity. People without C compilers should
have (slow) crypto too :)

On one hand, I registered the module to avoid this issue in the first place=
.

On the other hand, I understand Mr. Gray's conundrum as well,
it's hard to rename a module when it's sitting next to 14 others with
the same naming scheme.


Perhaps Mr. Gray has a solution to this problem?

If he will not rename his module,
I'd be willing to hand the namespace over if Gray included a Pure-Perl
implementation.
