I have no problem with giving Vernon co-maint on this. Probably makes 
sense to also give co-maint on the sister modules Net::OpenID::Consumer 
and Net::OpenID::Server; the ::Common distribution is just some common 
code used by both of these.

As with Robert I no longer have the time to maintain this guy since I'm 
no longer actively working on any projects with OpenID support.
