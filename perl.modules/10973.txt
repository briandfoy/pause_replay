Dear Sir,

I  hope this letter will not come to you as a surprise
since your Biography is well published as a
Distinguished person based on the noted information l
acquired about you in the recognised source book
information, from the chamber of commerce here in
Abidjan Cote d'lvoire.

It is therefore with respect and confident of the
above information that l decided to contact you with
hope you will not let down this Trust and confident l
am confiding and entrusting in you in this peculiar
transaction for a mutual beneficial relationship.

My name is MrRonald Lyons,the Assistance Area Controller
of the Board of Customs and Excise, charge of port
Authorityy De Abidjan (PAA) Zone 3 Republic of Cote
d'lvoire.

My Department made a wonderful revenue yield in the
two quarters of 2000 / 2001 that exceeded our budget
of  $250,000,000,00 USD (Two hundred and fifty Million
United State Dollars) the actual amount realised was
$380,500,000.00.( Three hundred and eighty million,
five hundred thousand united state dollars).having an
excess of $130,500,000.00 (One hundred and thirty
million, five hundred thousand united state dollars)
but at the end of this quarter we declared only
$290.000.000.00 (Two hundred and ninety million united
state dollars) leaving behind the total sum of
$90.500.000.00USD.(Ninety Million Five hundred
thousand United State Dollars).

Howbeit, the success was possible due to the
aggressive revenue strategy which the government
implored in dealing with importers by subjecting them 
to excess import duty payment. However, after much
protest and struggle by the importers who were charged
and compelled to pay excess import duty, the
government now mandated my ministry to refund the
excess amount paid by the importers. What l want you
do is to provide a private or company bank account
where part of this money could be deposited by
telegraphic wire transfer, while the fund is still in
a coded account and the commission of 10% will be for
your assistance.

Finally, l have no cause to doubt your trustworthiness to assist 
me in this project, therefore, if you have decided to help me to 
have this money through your account, you could just open a bank account
with the
sum of $100 (One hundred dollars) only and fax all the details which 
includes: the bank name and address, the bank telephone and fax 
numbers, account name and account number for a refund of excess 
import duty of $11,500.000.00USD(Eleven Million Five hundred thousand
United State Dollars).

Note: this transaction is smooth and secured as all
arrangements has been finalised and it will only take five working 
days to conclusion. Finally l expects your urgent responses by sending 
the requested information to me via email or direct Tel: 225-07-752722.
for further discussion.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.

Mr Ronald Lyons
