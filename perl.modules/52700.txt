Perl'ers:

I'm working on finalizing the initial public release of a development 
framework. This framework includes classes for configuration management, 
SQL generation, database wrappers that move connection configuration out 
of code, an object / relational mapping layer, exception objects, and 
other tools required for most large, integrated, applications. The 
(proposed) advantages to this framework and what sets it apart from 
others is the focus on integration, full application "stack" support, 
strong design pattern / "enterprise" (for lack of a better word) 
architecture influence, and simplicity of use.

I'm currently reviewing other similar systems that aim to be full 
application "stack" frameworks that are not glued to a particular 
environment. In other words, frameworks that are not just for the web or 
for implementing daemons and such. I've found a number of things, but 
most seem to focus on the web, specifically. POE is probably the closest 
thing to what I've been working on, but it (from my limited knowledge of 
it) seems to have a strong focus on a specific type of application. 
While POE seems extremely powerful and interesting, it also seems to 
field a slightly different problem domain then what I'm aiming for. I'm 
interested in hearing about other similar frameworks to POE and others 
like it.

Also, I'm curious about the categorization of these kinds of frameworks 
within the CPAN catalog. For things that are full frameworks (possibly 
with things like IoC containers and things that one's code fit into 
rather than get used by one's code) and span multiple areas, where do 
people suggest they live? The only place I can think of that is general 
enough to cover it would be "Development Support." Is this the right 
place? Ideas?

I'm also looking for a name if anyone has suggestions... ;)

Thanks in advance. Comments are more than welcome.
