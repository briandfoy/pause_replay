Subject: Module submission Marpa::HTML::XS
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Marpa::HTML::XS
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: XS-powered Marpa::HTML
  userid:      JKEGL (Jeffrey Kegler)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    My blog

  similar:
    Marpa::HTML

  rationale:

    This will be an XS-only version of Marpa::HTML. Marpa::HTML uses
    the standard mechanisms to choose between XS and Pure Perl. This is
    convenient, but has an extremely undesirable side effect -- the
    Marpa::HTML and Marpa::XS combination is rarely tested. Per that
    standard mechanism Marpa::PP is required while Marpa::XS is only
    recommended. And Marpa::XS is much harder to install. The tests for
    this module will guarantee that Marpa::HTML with Marpa::XS works.

    This module will also be useful to users who want to specify
    Marpa::XS only.

The resulting entry would be:

Marpa::HTML::
::XS              adpOp XS-powered Marpa::HTML                       JKEGL
