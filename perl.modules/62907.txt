The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ubigraph
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl client of Ubigraph software
  userid:      GAOU (Kazuharu Arakawa)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    glang-devel@lists.sourceforge.jp

  similar:

  rationale:

    I would like to register the namespace 'Ubigraph' for the module I
    have created, which is an object-oriented abstraction API over the
    XML-RPC access to Ubigraph software
    (http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/index.html). This package contains
    subclasses of "Ubigraph::Vertex" and "Ubigraph::Edge". Since this is
    a software interface to the Ubigraph software, which visualizes
    graph theoretical networks in 3D space which does not directly
    belong in existing top level namespace, I would like to put this on
    the top level namespace.

  enteredby:   GAOU (Kazuharu Arakawa)
  enteredon:   Thu Oct 30 00:13:16 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Ubigraph          bdpOp Perl client of Ubigraph software             GAOU


Thanks for registering,
