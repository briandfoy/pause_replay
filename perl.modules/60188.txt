Usually we wait several weeks starting from the day where somebody has
made the serious, intense, and publicly visible effort to contact the
author. That means chasing down potential other email addresses of the
author and CC'ing one or more relevant mailing lists, like cpan
authors or modules@perl.org.

We know from experience that not reacting on RT tickets need not be a
sign of ignorance, maybe just a misconfigured spam filter.

Clint Moore, can you hear us?
