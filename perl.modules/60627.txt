     why:

    I have written a module, that makes it easy to create so called
    DTAUS Files. These files are used in Germany for payment data
    exchange between banks and whoever wants to send or receive
    payments. It is useful for instance if you are running a service
    where you have to collect/send money from/to different people
    regularly.
