According to: http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html

I need to submit the following information for a PAUSE ID...

Name:   Andy Settle
email:  andy.settle@usa.net
home:   http://www.journeyman.net/
userid: ICENI

I have a number of modules which I would like to present for
submission to CPAN. Initially I'd like to submit a POSIX process pool
management module - which is pretty self explanatory. Others to
follow.
