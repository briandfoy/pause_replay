From: bj@it.uts.edu.au (Benjamin Kuit)

My name is Benjamin Kuit, I'm a systems administrator of a university
in Sydney Australia.

I've written a perl module which generates password hashes which can
be used in samba's smbpasswd files, which is samba's equivalent of
/etc/passwd. I'd like to contribute this module to CPAN.

It's a port from samba's distribution and written entirely into perl.
This makes a slow process, but it does make available a way for a perl
developer to generate the samba password hashes without calling an 
external program, and has the added benefit of not needing a compiler
to install it.

After some consideration I've called it Crypt::SmbHash. Currently the
module is at version 0.01, because that's what h2xs gave me =).

Example of use:

   # Generate smbpasswd entry
   use Crypt::SmbHash;
   ($login,$uid,$passwd) = @ARGV;
   ntlmgen $passwd, $lm, $nt;
   $flags = "[U          ]";
   $lct = sprintf "%08X",time();
   print "${login}:${uid}:${lm}:${nt}:${flags}:LCT-${lct}\n";

My preferred userid would be "BJKUIT".

Thanks in advance.

Bj
