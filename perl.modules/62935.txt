The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Builder::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Send UTF8 text/html email with attachments
  userid:      TEDDY (Octavian Râşniţă)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Catalyst-Dev mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    Mail::Builder::Simple is based on Mail::Builder and Email::Send. It
    can be used for sending UTF-8 encoded email messages (the body and
    headers). The text and html parts and the attachments can be created
    from a template.

    The users who want to send an UTF-8 encoded email with attachments
    and inline images don't need to encode the headers to UTF-8 because
    they are encoded automaticly as well as the body of the message, and
    they don't need to specify the Content-Type for the attachments,
    inline images or the HTML part of the message.

  enteredby:   TEDDY (Octavian Râşniţă)
  enteredon:   Sat Nov  1 13:56:51 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::Builder::
::Simple          bdpOp Send UTF8 text/html email with attachments   TEDDY
