Schmidt,

I was out of the country when you emailed me on June 20th, but I did
review your patches. Thank you for taking the time to help make
improvements. And thank you for your time to follow up. I apologize
for not responding earlier, but I want to assure you that I haven't
completely dropped off the face of the earth.

Mainly, I didn't immediately apply the patch because I already assumed
it didn't work on Windows. It is based on hard linking files after
all. And hard links just don't exist on NTFS or FAT32, right? But are
you saying that File::NFSLock actually functions on some flavor of
Windows with your patch? Is that because the NFS mount could be UNIX
on the actual host and so hard links actually could still work?

I'm just having a hard time fathoming this. But if it's true, I will
have a new version released to CPAN today or tomorrow.

Thanks again!
