     why:

    I'm am planning on releasing a framework for creating postfix mail
    filters. This framework allows one to combine a set f plugins to
    create a filter that can be tweaked by changed a config file. The
    other module I which to contribute, is something akin to alas, but
    for sub routines. This is really simple, and is essentially just:
    sub subalias($&){ my $alias_name = shift; my $sub = shift; { no
    strict 'refs'; *$alias_name = subname $alias_name, $sub; } }

    One would call it as such: subalias foo => \&bar; Assuming there is
    a function called bar.

    I have looked but can not find a module that does this.
