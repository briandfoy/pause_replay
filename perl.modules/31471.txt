i've been told that some people have recently written to him, but
without a reply so far (but too soon to give up hope of a reply).

another troubling bit appears though.  Rather than include contact
information in his docs (not a requirement, but a convention), he
points at his website, which also does not show contact info, but 
does have an HTML form to send him comments.  He has configured
domizio@cpan.org to not be forwarded to any address, and he put
a domain name in the public email address for his PAUSE acccount.
He does have a private email address, but I can see that only
because I put on my PAUSE hat and peeked.

none of this is necessarily nefarious, but it does seem really 
wierd.
