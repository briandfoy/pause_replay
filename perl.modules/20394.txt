The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::GetImages
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Spider collects images from HTML pages
  userid:      LGODDARD (Lee Goddard)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    perl-win32-users

  similar:

  rationale:

    I get quite a lot of correspondance on this module, which has been
    around for a few years now. Didn't realise the namespace wasn't
    registered.

  enteredby:   LGODDARD (Lee Goddard)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 14 09:36:27 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::
::GetImages       MdpOp Spider collects images from HTML pages       LGODDARD
