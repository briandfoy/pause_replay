Subject: Module submission SVG::Rasterize

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SVG::Rasterize
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: rasterize SVG content to pixel graphics
  userid:      LGEHLEN (Lutz Gehlen)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Gnome2::Rsvg Image::LibRSVG XML::LibRSVG

  rationale:

    I think the choice of namespace is rather obvious. The module
    rasterizes SVG, and the SVG namespace is well established.

    The modules mentioned above offer a solution to the same problem,
    all by implementing perl bindings to the librsvg library. However,
    they are all old, two of them have bad reviews, and they are all
    quite thin wrappers for librsvg. The documentation is rather sparse
    which is also true for librsvg itself. You cannot (as far as I know)
    rasterize SVG object trees directly, but you have to xmlify them and
    then parse them back with librsvg.

    SVG::Rasterize aims at providing a more flexible, more
    introspective, and more Perlish way to rasterize SVG from within
    Perl. Although it will be less complete than librsvg for a long
    time, it aims at full support of the SVG Static specification.

The resulting entry would be:

SVG::
::Rasterize       cdpOp rasterize SVG content to pixel graphics      LGEHLEN
