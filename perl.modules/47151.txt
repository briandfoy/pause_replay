The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AEAE
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: the Ajax Enhanced Asynchroneous Experience
  userid:      JETEVE (Jerome Eteve)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Ajax

  rationale:

    AEAE stands for Ajax Enhanced Asynchroneous Experience.

    This module enables you to quickly implement long duration task at
    server side while allowing the user to control those task at client
    side with an ajaxed page. It consist on two main parts:

    One to simply implement an asynchroneous task at server side: Async
    Experience .. The second to generate a ajaxed webpage that allow the
    user to control the task : Ajax Enhanced .

    With this module, you can allow the user to see what exactly
    happens with the command he ordered at server side, allowing him to
    abort the command if he wants to.
