Hi,

I've recently been looking at modules for spelling out numbers in =
English,
and ended up posting a review on blogs.perl.org:

	=
http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2011/09/cpan-modules-for-spelling-out-nu=
mbers-in-english.html

In doing this I've submitted bugs and/or patches on all 4 modules =
reviewed.

The most useful, and seemingly most widely used, module is =
Lingua::EN::Numbers.
Sean M Burke took over maintenance of the module from its originally =
author,
and did two releases, the most recent in early 2005.

I emailed Sean a patch a couple of weeks ago, and also said I'd be happy =
to do a release
if he didn't want to. In the comments to my post someone has already =
commented that
they've done the same. I've mailed him again today.

I've similarly emailed Lester Hightower, who is the author of =
Lingua::EN::Nums2Words,
though given he last did an update in 2009, I'm thinking I might get a =
reply.

I'm mailing you this:

	(a) in case one of you [*] knows Sean Burke, and can nudge him =
to reply.	=20

	(b) as a first step towards asking for upload ability on =
Lingua::EN::Numbers,
             so I could release my patch.

cheers,
Neil
