The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Soar::Production::Parser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Parser for Soar productions
  userid:      NGLENN (Nathan Gary Glenn)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Soar is a cognitive modeling architecture (see
    http://sitemaker.umich.edu/soar/home). It is programmed through
    productions. In the future I would like to release a module for
    modifying/building individual productions. This module will be
    essential for all input/editing activities.

    I used a root namespace because I could not find a specific
    namespace for processing another language. This is the first
    Soar-related module ever released to CPAN, as far as I know.

    Unfortunately, I uploaded first (with dzil) and then noticed I
    needed to register a namespace. Please tell me if I need to
    re-upload or make changes to this module.

The resulting entry would be:

Soar::Production::
::Parser          bdpOp Parser for Soar productions                  NGLENN
