Hi there,

Anybody know where I can get a hold of DBURDICK?

I'm going through the steps towards requesting co-maint on Boost::Graph.
The module fails to make (as described in
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=80465 )  and the RT queue
hasn't been answered in 7 years.  I've tried the listed author emails, but
dburdick@systemsbiology.org and dburdick@cpan.org immediately bounce with a
"no such user" message.  Googling his name gets me to a Linkedin profile
for a David Burdick working for Synapse in Seattle, but no email (I have no
Linkedin account to contact him with)

I've posted to perlmonks and module-authors@perl.org looking for the author
with no success, but in the process I have garnered 3 collaborators who
have done most of the necessary on github to get the module ready for cpan
again.  If he hasn't surfaced by the time we are ready to upload, I'll
email this list again requesting co-maint.

best wishes,
--
