Hello,

Randal Schwartz has politely educated me in the error of my ways in uploading 
my "WebDyne" distribution to CPAN.

WebDyne is basically "Yet Another Web Framework", similar in aims to 
HTML::Mason or EmbPerl.

Because I did not want to tread on any namespace toes (by uploading individual 
modules), and I wanted the package to be easy to install I created a self 
installing archive called "Bundle-WebDyne-Dist" and uploaded it to CPAN.  

The dist installs with "perl Makefile.PL; make install". It contains all 
modules needed for WebDyne to run frozen *in the dist* (including non-WebDyne 
modules like Time::HiRes), and installs them if necessary.

The apparently is not the right thing to do (at least from a CPAN 
perspective). So wanting to do the right thing, could you help me with the 
following questions:

1 .. Can I use the WebDyne namespace, or do I need to wade through all the 
modules and rename them (obviously a pain in the backside for me, as all my 
private apps reference the existing namespace - but I understand that is 
probably not a major consideration !)

2 .. I think that the distribution makes it easy to install WebDyne, and would 
like to keep it available for people. Please let me know if it is OK to keep 
it on CPAN, or if it should be removed.

Obviously feel free to remove the WebDyne dist from the CPAN archive if it is 
not suitable or breaks the rules, and I will try again when the namespace 
issues are sorted.

If this is not the right forum/address to ask these questions please let me 
know where I should direct them ..

Thanks,

Andrew Speer
