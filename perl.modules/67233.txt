That's funny. I had the impression that Paul had transferred the module
to me, already. I have access to it on PAUSE (I'm a co-maintainer), and
you can see the transfer acknowledgment from Paul in the attached message.

Paul, I'm really sorry to disturb you about this again, but it looks
like there is something wrong abut the Net::Whois::RIPE module transfer.
I know you're a busy gentleman, but please try to review this as soon as
you can. I will make another "unauthorized release" with the patch as
soon as I review it, either way. I'm sure you won't mind. :)

I'm copying <modules@cpan.org> so they stay on picture, like requested
under the "About PAUSE", section "7. Taking Over" -- thanks also for
your attention.

Thanks for helping me understand what's going on, Marco. I will send you
news about that soon.

Thanks for your time, Paul. I hope I read from you soon.

Cheers.

Done. Very sorry for the delay.

It is all available at sf.net. I've imported the source tree there.  Do you 
have a sf nick I can add?
