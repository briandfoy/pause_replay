No, you didn't miss a protocol issue. You can always take any name for
a module and upload the work without asking. But if you do, you better
be prepared for later renaming. I have no objection against the name,
but you might like to ask elsewhere if people have better names.

The module looks very nifty. Please use the form
https://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery?ACTION=apply_mod so that it is
easier for me to add it to the module list.

Nice idea. If you want to write this pragma, please call it
ex::caution, ex:: is for experimental pragmas. Then you can lobby the
pragma to get out of the ex:: into the core.
