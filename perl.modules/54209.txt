The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::Exercise
  DSLIP:       Rmphp
  description: Exercise object for testing bulk execution
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module exports a function/method that takes the object and a
    data structure of method + arguments with optional return value
    checks (done via Test::Deep::cmp_deeply). It will halt execution on
    $@ true, failed comparison (if given), or included breakpoint
    directives. It also supports a benchmark mode that only
    reports/halts on errors.

    The commands are executed as closures, which allows re-executing
    failed method calls via perl -d.

    This can be used to exercise the module for testing during
    development, for regression testing (via comparison), or
    benchmarking, or for bulk execution in production with sanity
    checks.

    If there are any alternatives to "Object::" that better fit please
    warn me.

The resulting entry would be:

Object::
::Exercise        Rmphp Exercise object for testing bulk execution   LEMBARK
