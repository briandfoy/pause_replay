Hi Tom,

I=E2=80=99ve transferred ownership (first-come permission) for all the =
Net::AMQP packages in Net-AMQP to you.
The distribution was originally released by Eric (EWATERS), who had =
first-come on two thirds of the packages, and then by Chip (CHIPS), who =
had ownership of the remaining packages.

Eric said he was happy for ownership to be transferred to you.

One of the issues I had to resolve recently was caused by the fact that =
the 0.04 release had $VERSION=E2=80=99s in all the modules, but the 0.06 =
release didn=E2=80=99t. I notice that you use Dist::Zilla, so hopefully =
your first 0.07 release will have $VERSION in all modules, and thus =
prevent that issue arising again.

Thank you for taking this on.

Cheers,
Neil
