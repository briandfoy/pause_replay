Sounds reasonable to me; my guess would be p5p would be a place to ask
about it, since it is in the perl core.  But you might want to ping Jarkko
about it first, or just see if anyone here thinks it is a bad idea, before
proceeding.  Sometimes discussing ideas like that in p5p can be ...
counterproductive.  :)
