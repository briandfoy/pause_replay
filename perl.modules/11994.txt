The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::Krb5::Admin
  DSLIP:       bdhOb
  description: MIT Kerberos 5 kadmin interface XS module
  userid:      KORTY (Andrew J. Korty)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.protocols.kerberos, comp.lang.perl.modules, private e-mail with
    Jeff Horwitz and other Kerberos 5 developers

  similar:
    Authen::Krb5

  rationale:

    While Authen::Krb5 is an interface to Kerberos 5 authentication and
    encryption functions, my module provides access to the kadmin
    administration and maintenance functions. Specifically, it is an XS
    module interface to the libkadm5clnt library, which means it can
    manipulate principals and policies on a remote KDC running kadmind.

    Rather than adding on to Authen::Krb5, I decided to create a
    separate module since most developers won't need the kadmin
    functionality, which only KDC administrators can use. Also, long ago
    Jeff Horwitz suggested a separate module since Authen::Krb5 was
    already so large.

    Since this implementation is MIT-specific, it's tempting to add
    "MIT" somewhere in the name. But I think it would be better to keep
    the name simple and eventually add compatibility with other KDCs to
    the module. Users should not have to care which KDCs they're talking
    to.

    Originally, I named this module Authen::Krb5::Kadm5, but I decided
    the Ks and the 5s were redundant.

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::Krb5::
::Admin           bdhOb MIT Kerberos 5 kadmin interface XS module    KORTY
