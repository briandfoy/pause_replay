The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IaaS
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A common cloud interface library
  userid:      EWINDISCH (Eric Windisch)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    irc.freenod.org#annelidous cloudforum@googlegroups.com
    git://github.com/annelidous/annelidous.git http://www.annelido.us

  similar:
    Net::Amazon::EC2 Net::Amazon::S3 Net::Mosso::CloudFiles -- This
    module will provide a common interface to interact with such
    services (such as DBI does for databases)

  rationale:

    I had wished to use Net::Cloud, but this namespace has already been
    taken by another CPAN user. There are not currently any modules
    uploaded to that namespace and the email address of the registrant
    is invalid.

    Other namespaces might be suitable, such as Net::IaaS,
    Net::Infrastructure, or others. The goal of this project is to
    provide a common client interface library for "Cloud Infrastructure"
    services. These services may be public, such as Amazon EC2, or
    private. To this end, we have already completed functional code
    which communicates to a private cloud implemented as a subclass of
    our ::Connector module. This is very much functional, we are
    currently working to support additional providers, which the
    architecture easily supports at this time.

    Currently, the project goes by the name "Annelidous" and we use a
    top-level namespace of Annelidous in our modules. We would change
    this to whatever we can agree upon with PAUSE/Cpan.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::IaaS            adpOp A common cloud interface library             EWINDISCH
