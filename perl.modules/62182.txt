None that you don't have, too.

If you can't get hold of the author at all, we can grant you
co-maintenance permissions. However, we only do that after we have seen
plausible "proof" that you have tried to contact the author in any way
possible. This includes the following steps:

- Searching the web (as you did) and sending mail, CCing modules@perl.org.
- Posting in public places such as your Perlmonks or your use.perl.org
journal that you're looking for him or her.
- Waiting for at least several weeks.
- Contacting us again about getting the co-maintenance permissions,
pointing at the evidence of your trying to contact the author.

Please understand that these measures are necessary. We want to make
extra sure that we don't take away anything from a contributor just
because he went on a long hiking vacation.

Best regards,
Steffen
