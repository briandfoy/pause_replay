Request to register new user

    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    I have completed testing on a bit of code that is a pure perl
    implimentation of Lawrence Philips Double Metaphone. I could not
    locate a pure perl version of this on CPAN so I decided I would turn
    it into a module and put it up so others would not need to re-create
    this.
