I'm not definitly sure what this module will do.
Will it manage access to persons/personaldata or
manage the subscribing of different persons or
manage to download a person list from a database in CSV format or
to show persons listed in a database or 
...

However, CGI::Listman sounds odd,
as it either sounds like a module for
listing manuals or a module for
mangaging of (CGI-)lists (whatever it means),
where you want to manage some persons.


I don't want to suggest other names,
as I don't know good enough what the module has to do.


Greetings,
