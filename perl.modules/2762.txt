The reason that I contacted you was that I very surprised to find that
none of the Net::Whois modules are in the current 'official' cpan module
list.

Point taken.  After having to wait for internal sign-off for so long,
I'm probably a bit _too_ anxious to move on this.  Please accept my
apologizes for any breach in approval protocol.

Well I thought modules@perl.org is the cpan name space authority, hence
I contacted them, but perhaps you are a member.

Awaiting your review,
Paulg.
