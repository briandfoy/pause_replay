The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Getopt::Long::GUI
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: An automatic GUI help screen
  userid:      HARDAKER (Wes Hardaker)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    Discuss on the net-policy project at sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Getopt::Long

  rationale:

    Getopt::Long offers a parsing mechanism so coders don't have to
    figure out how to parse options. Getopt::Long::GUI takes this one
    step farther and offers the user a GUI (Tk or Gtk2) screen full of
    options and help text if they type a command without any arguments.
    If they do use arguments this module doesn't get in the way and is
    really only useful for people who like GUI interfaces.

    (there are some screen shots of some interfaces to some of the
    dnssec-tools utilities at http://www.dnssec-tools.org/)

The resulting entry would be:

Getopt::Long::
::GUI             bmpOp An automatic GUI help screen                 HARDAKER
