Subject: input for proposed namespace

I'm requesting input on a proposed namespace for Geo::TiledTIFF per the
PAUSE about section. Here's what I would put in the rationale box if I
registered now:

*Rationale*

Please discuss your reasoning about the namespace choice, the uniqueness of
your approach and why you believe this module should be listed in the module
list. Especially if you suggest a new rootlevel namespace you are required
to argue why this new namespace is necessary.

No functional implementation of the libgeotiff library exists on CPAN (that
I'm aware of - see http://search.cpan.org/search?query=tiff&mode=module). My
class provides a partial coverage (for now) of this interface but for tiled
TIFF images only; reason being is I wrote this to deal with large raster
data stored in tiff format and accessing the data per-tile is more efficient
than per-row (the two options). Furthermore, I needed to collect and extract
data in the image corresponding to arbitrary shapes, so I have classes to do
that also. All non-trivial methods rely on the image being tiled and I have
no plans to provide per-row support, hence I've hard-wired "Tiled" into the
namespace. The main class is an object storing a handle to the tiff file,
and the name I think reflects this.

Thanks,

Blake
