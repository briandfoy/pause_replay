I hereby apply for a developer registration.

NAME:=09Anders Sonderberg Mortensen

EMAIL:=09sondberg@indexdata.dk

URL:=09http://www.indexdata.dk

LOGIN:=09SONDBERG

PLAN:=09The company I represent is developing open source implementations o=
f=20
the Z3950 protocol. This is a client/server based protocol maintained by
the Library of Congress intended mostly for exchange of bibliographic
information.
Until now, the server specific issues have been developed in terms of the
YAZ toolkit based on C. However, our company has repeatedly received
recommendations of developing a Perl API for this YAZ toolkit.
Therefore, we have just programmed and released an alpha test version of
this new Perl wrapper. And it seems to be a success. Our customers and
cooperators are very happy with this new easy approach to the Z3950
protocol.
After a concluded test phase, we like to publish the Perl YAZ API on
CPAN. Therefore, we wish to reserve the name space Z3950:: for this
purpose.

Many thanx in advance!

Cheers,

=09Anders S=F8nderberg Mortensen
