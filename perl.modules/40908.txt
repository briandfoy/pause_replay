I have the same thoughts, so instead of approving Business::BR, 
I'd like to see individual modules. However, if Business::BR is
some sort of glue that ties them all together or somehow
connects everything, that might be different. Even then, the
name seems really general.

Good luck though.  Randal jsut got back from Brazil and has
been telling me cool stories about the projects he's seen
down there. :)
