i have two modules which i find usefull and would like to contribute:

Macro - template/macro mechanism, unlike POE::Preprocessor the macros
look just like perl builtin constructs (ala if/while). uses
Parse::RecDescent to allow maximum flexibility in rewritting your
scripts. NB: in order ot make this script work modified versions of
Parse::RecDescent and Filter::Simple are required.

PPrint - Equivalent to sprintf but the directives are easily
programmable. contains directives for advanced number formatting
(specifying radix, min columns, padding, comma char, etc.),
Data::Dumper interface (able to specify all the boolean options in
Data::Dumper), and join (with single char between elemnts and single
char before and after).

I have tried to be brief, if more explanation is wanted i can send the
first few paragraphs of the pods.
