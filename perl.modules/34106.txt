     why:

    I wrote a module, which basically implements the "net send" command
    on windows in pure perl, so one can send popup messages to windows
    machines from any platform, without the need to install a big
    package like samba and without the need to use system(). As an
    administrator I find it very useful to have my perl scripts
    reporting errors to my windows box instantly via a popup.
