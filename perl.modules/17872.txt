I believe it's a lot more than that. When searching or browsing in CPAN, 
I don't see *any* modules uploaded later than 10 February.

My own module is CGI::ContactForm. It shows version 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4, 
even if all those should have been deleted via PAUSE. Version 1.0 
(scheduled for deletion) and 1.01, uploaded 12 respective 13 February, 
are not visible.
