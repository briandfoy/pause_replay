     why:

    Hello guys here comes 'the brief story' ...

    My employer End2End Germany is a division of End2End, Europeâ€™s
    leading B2B managed service solution provider for mobile data
    services and content.

    Currently we are developing a new service called MRS which stands
    for 'MSISDN Resolver Service'.With the help of the 'MRS' service
    mobile application developers are able to obtain detailed
    information about a given MSISDN - a mobile phone number.

    This returned information includes the MCC (mobile country code),
    the MNC (mobile netework code) and detailed information concerning
    the mobile's current status, location and more ...

    To provide a Perl interface in order to use this service we
    developed a Perl module 'MRS.pm' that we are now planning to
    publish/contribute to the Perl community.

    Further questions regarding 'MRS' can be emailed to
    'hotline@end2endmobile.com'.

    Best regards, Christian Malter
