The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::OFX::Parse::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Same terms as Perl itself
  userid:      JJONES (Jeremy Jones)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::OFX::Parse -- a fully-featured OFX implementation

  rationale:

    In an effort to work with OFX files downloaded from my online bank
    I had trouble using Finance::OFX::Parse, perhaps because the
    original files weren't syntactically correct. After many tries to
    massage the original files before input I resorted to writing a
    simple parser using regexes, and it's been working very well. I
    thought I would release it in case anyone else is working with
    sloppy OFX files and needs an easy way to create Perl data
    structures from them.

  enteredby:   JJONES (Jeremy Jones)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan  5 17:05:02 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::OFX::Parse::
::Simple          bdpOp Same terms as Perl itself                    JJONES
