The college football season kicked off this past weekend and the NFL will kick-off their season this week.  The kick-off is 
a sign of excitement, action and good competition. At ASI, we have a lot of exciting things going on with our products 
and with our customers ordering direct on-line saving both time and money. To show you how well our power 
supplies stand up to the competition we are having a "kick-off" sales promotion. This is your opportunity to join the 
game along with many other satisfied customers and try the best designed modular din rail mounted power supply on the market at 
substantial savings, as much as 50%!
<p>
The "kick-off" sales promotion will run during the month of September and will include special "low" Internet pricing on the 2.5, 
4 and 6 amp power supplies. Check our website for these special promotional prices. If you use another size of power supply, 
then go to our website, 
<a href="http://www.asi-ez.com">www.asi-ez.com</a> and check the already low prices on one of our other 25 types of 
power supplies.
<p>
The ASI power supplies feature more design benefits than any other modular din rail mounted power supply on the market. 
Check out some of these important features:
<p>
<b><i>Compact Design</i></b> - The ASI power supplies feature one of the smallest footprints on the market, saving 
valuable panel space.
<p>
<b><i>Auto Ranging Input</i></b> - With auto voltage detection circuitry, these power supplies can be used for domestic 
or foreign applications without the concern for jumpers or additional part numbers.
<p>
<b><i>Front Replaceable Fuse</i></b> - No need to open the case and search the printed circuit board looking for a fuse. 
The ASI input fuse is accessible directly on the front panel, saving time and making replacement simple.
<p>
<b><i>Output Adjustment Potentiometer</i></b> - A full +/- 5 % adjustment is at your fingertips with the ASI power supplies and 
it is not hidden inside. We make it easy to adjust the output in those applications where it is needed.
<p>
<b><i>Unique Spring Metal Mounting Foot</i></b> - The ASI power supplies lock on the din rail and stay there until 
you need to remove it. Removal is as simple as rocking the power supply in the opposite direction.
<p>
<b><i>UL 508 Listed</i></b> - With a power supply this well designed, you would expect it to be UL listed, which they are 
as well as having other important certifications such as CE.
<p>
Our list of features does not stop here. We also use a metal housing, we print the power supply with clear and 
understandable wiring directions, there is a LED to indicate proper operation, there are parallel versions available, 
pluggable terminal blocks are used to simplify wiring and the output of each power supply is protected against 
short circuits and over-loads. The ASI 3-phase power supplies feature many of these same designs and are among 
the most compact, newest power supplies on the market. Check out their specifications at the ASI website,
