     why:

    i'm going to contribute my very first perl script... a win32 dialer
    for dial up internet connection sharing... cause windows sucks
    almost as much as dial up... but sometimes you have to deal with
    both of them. oh... and whatever is left of my soul after years of
    accepting the terms and conditions of membership for websites
    without reading what i was giving them.
