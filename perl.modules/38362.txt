Request to register new user

fullname: John Harrison

    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    I have a utilty script similar to rename for backing up files to
    filename + datestamp which I would like to contribute now, and I
    hope to contribute more in future.

    I don't know who "we" of "If we know you" means... I contributed an
    example to the documentation for Net::SSH v0.02 (
    http://search.cpan.org/~ivan/Net-SSH-0.02/SSH.pm ) in November 2000
    if that helps identify me.
