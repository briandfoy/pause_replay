The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::MP3::Skin
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Enables use of skin files with Apache::MP3
  userid:      RGRAFF (Robert Graff)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.apachemp3.com/forums/

  similar:
    Apache::MP3 Apache::MP3::Sorted Apache::MP3::Playlist

  rationale:

    This modules builds upon the level of interface customization
    offered by Apache::MP3. While in most cases customizing with CSS
    will suffice, some users (like me) would like to control more
    aspects of how Apache::MP3 renders html. By sub-classing
    Apache::MP3::Playlist and using HTML::Template, Apache::MP3 takes a
    skin file (.tmpl) fills in the variables & loops and then outputs
    HTML. There are 8 different TMPL_LOOPs defined (which may be nested)
    and more than 80 TMPL_VARs many of which are scoped by loop
    iterations. Through these, almost every aspect of Apache::MP3 can
    used in controling the output of HTML.

    There is currently one skin that comes with the module and serves
    as the default. A demo of Apache::MP3::Skin using the default skin
    is available at http://www.apachemp3.com/demo/skin. Add a file to
    your playlist (shopping cart icon) to see how user playlists are
    handled by the skin. This is an example of something that can not be
    achieved with CSS customization in Apache::MP3.
