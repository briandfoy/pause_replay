The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::KMeans
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Data clustering - a pure Perl implementation
  userid:      AVIKAK (Avinash Kak)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups

  similar:
    Algorithm::Cluster

  rationale:

    Being pure-Perl, this module is particularly suitable for research
    folks who want to experiment with the different aspects of
    clustering multi-dimensional data. Automatic clustering involves
    choosing a criterion for measuring the "distance" between two data
    points, for judging the quality of the overall clustering achieved,
    for selecting a stopping rule for terminating the clustering
    iterations, etc. One must also build in some protection against
    getting trapped in a local minimum when trying to optimize a
    Quality-of-Clustering criterion. It is easier to experiment with
    these different aspects of clustering when all of the code is in a
    high-level language like Perl. The currently popular module
    Algorithm::Cluster is a Perl wrapper around the C library Cluster.
    Changing the low-level code in the C library is not convenient as it
    requires re-compilation of the code.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
