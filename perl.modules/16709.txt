i don't think you should use DBI in the name (unless you put it
in DBIx::*).  the DBI namespace is a definite group of modules
that do things in a certain way, unlike, say, modules in HTTP::*
that do things in different ways.

i think you should either use a fanciful name (like Tim suggested)
or something descriptive (e.g. DBIx::Common, etc. ).
