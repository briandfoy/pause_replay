Hello,

I uploaded a package to PAUSE (/G/GA/GAAL/Class-Accessor-Ref-0.01.tar.gz)
which contains a .pm file in its examples/ directory. The pm is not part
of the module per se; I called it "API.pm" to illustrate how my module
can be used when working with a third-party library.

I just got an email from the PAUSE indexer saying that this API.pm had
been indexed. I'm not sure that it ought to be; it's not very useful as
anything but part of an example.

Should I unindex this file? How? Was I supposed not to use ".pm"
extensions in my examples? What should I have done then?

Thanks,
Gaal
