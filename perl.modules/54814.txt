The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Task::DependenciesCatalyst
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: installs all prerequisites for Catalyst
  userid:      SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    I wrote Bundle::Dependencies::Catalyst, but it doesn't work. I'm
    writing Task::DependenciesCatalyst because I'll have better control.

  rationale:

    The "Bundle" fornat isn't working for me with
    Bundle::Dependencies::Catalyst, so, by switching to the "Task"
    format, I'll be able to test and fine-tune
    Task::DependenciesCatalyst, something I can't do with the "Bundle"
    format.

  enteredby:   SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  enteredon:   Sun Jun 10 18:25:03 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Task::
::DependenciesCatalyst adphp installs all prerequisites for Catalyst      SKI
