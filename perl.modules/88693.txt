Gah, that's my mistake. I was positive it was under the XML namespace =
due to the nature of that module.

Sounds good, thank you.
I am in the process of implementing their web service API, so =
WebService::Fitbit (or FitBit, if that's easier for CPAN to handle) =
would be the natural name.

I don't know how to continue from here. I take it that already released =
modules (such as WebService::FitBit) can not just be deleted from CPAN?
Perhaps it would be easier if I just took over the existing =
WebService::FitBit namespace and bumped the version of my first release =
to indicate the API change?

Anybody know how to handle the "duplicate" namespace reservations? =
WebService::FitBit vs. WebService::Fitbit?

Best regards,
Brix
