     why:

    I wrote a module that allows an information array along with some
    other variables to be dumped into an excel spreadsheet that is
    formatted into a basic report, then posted as CGI or send via email.

    I wrote it as part of a reporting engine and would like to share
    it. Some CPAN fame would be nice too!
