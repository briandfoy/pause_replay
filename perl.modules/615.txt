       Hi,

       I'm writing a Perl interface to the mifluz full text index library
(as found on http://www.senga.org/mifluz/html/). This library is used
by ht://dig (http://www.htdig.org/) and by the webbase crawler 
(as found on http://www.senga.org/webbase/html/). 

       Looking at Search::InvertedIndex, I was pleased to see that we
use the same underlying product to store the inverted index data : Berkeley DB.
Although the mifluz approach of the problem is different from 
Search::InvertedIndex, I think we have a lot to share. For a start, you 
would certainly be interested by the Berkeley DB patch we did to compress
the file to 1/8 of its size.

       Since I'm looking for a name for the Perl interface to mifluz, I thought
Search::Mifluz would do, even if not very explicit :-) Better yet, we could
work together to define a common interface to Search::Mifluz and 
Search::InvertedIndex so that people could switch from one to another 
painlessly. Even better, Search::InvertedIndex could be a generic interface to
which you specify either Search::Mifluz or Search::Snowhare (;-?). 

       Someone rightfully suggested that the query interface to inverted index
could be a DBD module, even if no SQL is involved. This is yet another topic to
discuss together.

       Please let me know what you think,
