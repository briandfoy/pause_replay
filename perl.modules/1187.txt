Subject: registering as a developer.

From: ian@lugh.uchicago.edu ("Ian B. Robertson")

I would like to register as a perl module developer.  My name is Ian
Robertson; my email address is ian@lugh.uchicago.edu.  A good userID
would be IROBERTS or I-ROBERTS.  I'm planning on contributing a module
to interface with Solaris system C calls for Access Control Lists
(ACLs).  A DSLI entry follows:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Solaris::ACL   bdcO  access Solaris ACLs			  IROBERTS

I have mentioned this on comp.lang.perl.modules; no discussion ensued.

P.S.  Unless there were mailing problems, you probably received a
similar request a month ago.  I appologize if this is already being
handled.
