Folks,

I've written a simple module which calculates the CRC identically to the
cksum UNIX command. This was necessary because the few existing CRC/checksum
functions available at CPAN do not appear to produce the same result as the
cksum program.

The code is taken from a C example, converted to Perl. It processes an
in-memory string, but a really really obvious extension is to make it
process from a File handle too.

So, the module itself is very straightforward; the only tricky bit is
picking a name. Any suggestions? CRC:: is not really a suitable top-level.
Perhaps something inside Algorithm:: will do? eg Algorithm::Cksum

Apologies for the excessive sig.
Big Boss insists the mail server adds it.
