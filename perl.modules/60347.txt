Oops. Sawyer X dropped modules@ from the CC list. Short recap: We 
discussed this further.

Turns out, some of my initial ideas weren't so good. The existing 
DBIx::HTML::* modules are unrelated, so that area's out. I wouldn't have 
included "HTML" in the module name anyway.

DBIx::Web and DBIx::Admin exist, so Sawyer X considered adding a third 
DBIx::WebAdmin confusing. I tend to agree.

That only left my suggestion to choose a catchy *name*, potentially 
unrelated to the module purpose (such as Rosetta, etc.).

I don't think there's a good place to put web applications right now. 
App:: doesn't really seem right for web apps. Most apps are under their 
respective web framework top level namespace such as Catalyst. That also 
seems wrong.

Web:: isn't really crowded compared to WWW:: or WebService::. So I 
thought it would be okay to use that top level namespace.

Sorry if this is off.

Cheers,
Steffen
