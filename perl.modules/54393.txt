The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::ECell
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: Perl interface for E-Cell Simulator.
  userid:      GAOU (Kazuharu Arakawa)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    ecell3-devel@bioinformatics.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I would like to register the namespace 'Bio::ECell' for the module
    I have created, which is a Perl API for E-Cell simulation
    environment (http://www.e-cell.org/). Since this is a scientific
    software for cell biology researches, I believe a top level of 'Bio'
    would be suitable, and since this API is specific for E-Cell and the
    goal of this software is quite different from bioperl (mathematical
    simulation rather than sequence analysis) I think ECell can be
    placed at the second level. Thanks for your feedback.

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
::ECell           adhOp Perl interface for E-Cell Simulator.         GAOU


Thanks for registering,
