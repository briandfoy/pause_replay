The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Numbers::Base::DWIM
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Just in time based numeric constant parsing
  userid:      CMO (Clayton O'Neill)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will delay parsing of based numeric constants
    (0b010101, 0655, 0xff) until the last possible moment. This means
    that if you use the constant as a string, then it will evaluate to
    the same form that the constant was declared in. This module was
    developed after an discussion where some people found the behavior
    of C<perl -e 'print oct 011, "\n";'> to be confusing. This module
    works around this by overloading the parsing of binary, hexidecimal
    and octal numeric constants. It then stores them as a string
    internally, until either numification or stringification is
    requested.

  enteredby:   CMO (Clayton O'Neill)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 10 01:22:43 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Numbers::Base::
::DWIM            bdppp Just in time based numeric constant parsing  CMO
