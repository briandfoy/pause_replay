The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Tempi
  DSLIP:       cdcfg
  description: Tempi is a HTML template system written in C
  userid:      RFAUST (Roger Faust)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    I don't know, why I've chosen the name Tempi. The name HTML seems
    for my clear. The uniqueness is, that I don't think that anybody has
    been so stupid to write a perl modul by using flex. The reasons for
    writting the modul: -just for fun, one learns a lot -using C makes
    the modul faster than pure perl solutions (i hope so)

  enteredby:   RFAUST (Roger Faust)
  enteredon:   Sat Jan 19 17:21:37 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Tempi           cdcfg Tempi is a HTML template system written in C RFAUST
