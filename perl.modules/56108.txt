As I understand it (and I could be wrong), Win32::TieRegistry was originally
a standalone distribution, but at some point it started to get bundled into
libwin32, but that co-maint for the namespace was never formally added.

When I took it over and started releasing it separately, I believe it should
have stopped being released with libwin32, as it has basically been split
back out again.
