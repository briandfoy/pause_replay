I believe the convention is for the portable C library to be named 
something short like libSQLOM, with the Perl code either in 
SQL::ObjectModel or a related namespace like SQL::ObjectModelXS or 
SQL::ObjectModel::libSQLOM.

Consider this guidance from perlmodlib: "Generally the name should 
reflect what is special about what the module does rather than how it 
does it."

The name you pick should focus on the distinct purpose of the module -- 
ie, providing a static representation of various kinds of SQL 
statements.

The fact that your module is implemented as a tree of objects, rather 
than as functions which operate on nested hash-refs or whatever, is an 
implementation detail. In practice, many of the modules on CPAN are 
based on some kind of "object model," but don't use it in their class 
names -- for example, think of the many distributions that could have 
been named "XML::ObjectModel."
