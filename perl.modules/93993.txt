Hello,

Apologies for the bother, but could we get Net::AMQP version 0.06 
(~CHIPS) reindexed on MetaCPAN. No new upload or anything, just looks 
like there may have been a permissions issue.

It seems like when v0.06 was uploaded to CPAN, ~CHIPS may not have had 
authorization to upload Net::AMQP, as many of the packages in this 
distribution are flagged as Unauthorized[1].

If I'm reading 06perms.txt[2] correctly, it looks like he is authorized 
now for the packages in this distribution.

Additionally, the distribution on CPAN matches what looks to be 
~EWATERS' GitHub repository[3], where ~CHIPS looks to have committed the 
v0.06 work.

Thanks in advance for any aid, and I hope you're having a brilliant day,

-Spikes
