Andreas, please have a look at the (very new) section of 04pause about 
this: http://cpan.noris.de/modules/04pause.html#takeover

Mark, if you don't mind Andreas taking care of your module, simply send 
a short reply to the modules@perl.org list and we'll set him up.

Best regards,
Steffen, for the PAUSE admins
