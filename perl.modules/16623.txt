     why:

    i was thinking of developing a module which would contact
    weather.com and fetch today's outlook and also the extended
    forecast. i would attempt to make it as robust as possible and easy
    to use.

    i would like to add this to CPAN as a module... i basically have
    the code from a previous project, i just have to turn it into a
    module.

    thank you
