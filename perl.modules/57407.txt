I'll remove it from the todo list. You're welcome to keep it as long as
you have the intention to work on it eventually. If you at some point
feel you won't ever touch it again, you can select lifecycle="delete" in
the module-metadata dialogue on pause.perl.org or mail this mailing list.

Best regards,
Steffen
