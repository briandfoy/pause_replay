     why:

    I want to contribute File::Find::Node which is a package that
    combines features from File::Find and File::Stat and the Unix "find"
    command with new features resulting in an efficient and
    comprehensive directory traverser.

    The package defines a File::Find::Node object. The constructor
    takes a directory name and creates a "top level" object. Other
    methods associate call back functions with the object and the "find"
    method does the traversal. The user supplied call back functions are
    passed a File::Find::Node object for each item visited. The object
    has methods to access information such as the path, the base name,
    stat information, search depth level, etc.

    You can also access the parent object of an object, and follow the
    parent chain up to the top level object. You can store data, such as
    counters, totals and other state information in objects.

    There are methods to "prune" the search tree, control whether
    symlinks are followed, and to sort the output of readdir() before
    traversing it.
