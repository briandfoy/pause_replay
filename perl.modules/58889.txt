The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Formatter::Html
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Formats datastructs for HTML presentation
  userid:      ZBLAIR (Zachary Blair)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    Data::Dumper

  rationale:

    This module converts Perl data structures into formatted HTML, for
    presentation to a human. For instance, refs to arrays are converted
    into bulleted lists, refs to arrays that contain only refs to arrays
    are converted into tables, and refs to hashes are converted to
    definition lists.

    Elements can be nested, so, for instance, you may have a bulleted
    list inside a table, which itself is inside a definition list.

    In addition to the Data::Formatter::Html module, I've written a
    Data::Formatter::Text module that has the same interface but uses
    ASCII text to output the tables, lists, etc. I plan on writing other
    modules that are all drop-in compatible with one-another for
    outputting to other formats, like LaTeX, for example.

    Thus, this module provides an easy way to output complex data to
    several different formats (currently just text and HTML, but more to
    come). This lends itself to applications like logging especially
    well where it may be useful to keep a text-only log and a nicely
    formatted HTML log.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Formatter::
