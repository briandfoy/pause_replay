From: sterling@cis.ksu.edu (Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp)

It's all (more or less) syntactic sugar. I don't necessarily think it 
provides any value beyond notation.  It just removes the extra noise of 
the curly braces.  For my purposes, this is value enough.  However, I 
figured that if I was going to add a module I might as well give it some 
additional functionality besides simply adding an lvalued AUTOLOAD that 
might make it even more generally valuable.  So, I added the ability to 
use (or not) a bunch of helper methods that look more or less like the 
tied interface of a hash. Some might prefer:

  $hash->clear;

to:

  %$hash = ();

This class lets you do both, if you turn on the clear method--by default 
$hash->clear will just return the value of $hash->{clear}.  That is, if 
you don't like the additional methods, you don't turn them on.  If you 
like the additional methods, but you aren't real fond of the named 
accessors using AUTOLOAD, turn the methods and the accessors off.  Still 
further, if something has been turned off and you still want to use the 
functionalty use the Class::Hash syntax or use the hash directly.  I 
think this module just takes hashes to a new level of TMTOWTDI.

Cheers,
Sterling
