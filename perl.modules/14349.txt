Just wanted to drop a note and let you all know that I will be taking
over POE::Component::SubWrapper and POE::Component::RSS . This transfer
is blessed by the author, MSTEVENS.  If you would be so kind as to
transfer their modules list entries to CPAN user SUNGO, I would be very
pleased. thanks all
