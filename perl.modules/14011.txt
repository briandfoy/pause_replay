The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Convert::AcrossLite
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Convert AcrossLite files to other formats
  userid:      DSPARLING (Douglas Sparling)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    rec.puzzles.crosswords

  similar:
    None that I'm aware of

  rationale:

    I needed a way to easily convert binary AcrossLite data files to
    plain text and xml. Not finding an existing module on the CPAN to do
    this, I wrote one and would like to share through CPAN.

    I wasn't sure whether to register this module under
    Convert::AcrossLite or Games::AcrossLite. This module is only used
    to convert AcrossLite files to other formats (text for now, xml and
    others to follow), so it didn't seem to be a candidate for the Games
    namespace.

  enteredby:   DSPARLING (Douglas Sparling)
  enteredon:   Fri Sep 27 21:21:55 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Convert::
::AcrossLite      adpOp Convert AcrossLite files to other formats    DSPARLING
