I recently discovered that I can't install what i refer to as
'script distributions' via CPAN or CPANPLUS because the modules
can't find the distributions. I believe that's because they are
omitted (deliberately for some good reason??) from
02packages.details.txt.gz.
 
What i mean by script distributions are distributions such as cpan-
upload and httpd_ctl. Afaiks the only way to install these is to
manually pull the tarball from search.cpan.org and  build via
MakeMaker/M::B one's self. That seems like a massive shame.

Can this be 'fixed'?

I know that CPAN has a 'dedicated scripts area' - but let's face it
that area is pretty old and not maintained with the same level of
resources as the main CPAN site and again tha requires people to
manually pull the files and doesn't allow authors to include a
Test::Harness based test rig blah blah blah...
 
 
I'd be grateful on people's thoughts regarding my request/suggestion.
I'm happy to muck in and do any the actual changes to the code that
generates this file.


Cheers
