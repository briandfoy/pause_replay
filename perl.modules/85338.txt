Request to register new user

fullname: Rob van Son
  userid: RJJHVSON
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I am the author of CGIscriptor.pl and CGIservlet.pl, both on CPAN.

    After a looong time I have updates of these two scripts. My userid
    was ROBVANSON I think. However, I have forgotten my password and my
    old email address has long been deactivated (as has all hardware
    from that time).

    You can find the scripts at: http://repo.or.cz/w/CGIscriptor.git
