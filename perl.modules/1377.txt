Greets.  Looking to register a namespace IO::Filesystem.

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
IO::Filesystem cdpO  OO interface to a filesystem-like datasource DEUSX

Comments on this namespace or an alternate one for the above package would
be appreciated.  It's basically an abstract class presenting a set of
methods which roughly correspond to the set of standard operations
possible to a filesystem.  

Sounds silly since we already have those as functions.  But, it becomes
useful, for instance, when one creates a subclass which implements a
simulated filesystem interface to a MySQL database.  And then you may
uses it in such beasts as an FTPd, or a set of commands like cp, ls, rm,
etal...  Because IO::Filesystem::* classes would all present the same
interface, one is free to swap out various implementations, yet use the
same set of tools/apps.

Thanks!
