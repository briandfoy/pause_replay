Hi,

I'd like to register the namespace Config:Ini.  Details are listed below
for your consideration please.  Andreas agreed earlier on this module
name but said he would welcome suggestions for a more distinctive name.
Is there a formal waiting period or am I supposed to upload a new
version with the proposed namespace first?

Name              DSLI  Description                             Info
----------------  ----  --------------------------------------- -----
Config::Ini       RdpO  Accesses Windows .ini and .reg files    AVATAR

I think it should go to the "12_Opt_Arg_Param_Proc" category.

This modules provides easy access to MS-Windows style .ini files, Unreal
style extended .ini files (where multiple values can be associated with
a single key), as well as registry files with automatic conversion from
native Perl to Windows registry data encoding and vice versa.

Config::Ini was first released half a year ago and is used by UmodPack,
an Unreal mod installer:
    http://umodpack.sourceforge.net/

This module differs from another module, Config::IniFiles (formerly
IniConf), in that this one supports single-key-multiple-value, Windows
registry file format and has a different parser that may be a little
more tolerant about wierd data.

Thanks for your time.
