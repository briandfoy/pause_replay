The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       News::GnusFilter
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: gnus MIME-hook filter to score usenet posts
  userid:      JOESUF (Joe Schaefer)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc (based on TomC's msgchk code)

  similar:
    (none)

  rationale:

    Module provides a simple interface for scripting scoring rules
    based on a post's message format / content. Being part of the News::
    heirarchy is natural choice.

    Although the module itself and documentation are geared slightly
    towards gnus, it should be portable to newsreaders that provide a
    programmer interface similar to gnus.

    The code is largely based on Tom Christiansen's msgchk script,
    which was posted and referenced many times on clp.misc.

The resulting entry would be:

News::
::GnusFilter      bdpfp gnus MIME-hook filter to score usenet posts  JOESUF
