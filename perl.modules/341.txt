So you replace

    s/^(.+)|(.+)|(.+)$/$3|$1|$2/

with

    Regexp: /^(.+)|(.+)|(.+)$/
    Eval string:  $3|$1|$2\n

? Sorry, that looks backwards to me.

One thing is a strict requirement for a perl module: it must have an
advantage over perl without the module. So far you didn't show, what
it is that your module "does well".
