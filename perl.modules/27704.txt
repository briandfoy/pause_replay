     why:

    I would like to contribute a Perl module called Perl Template.
    Parallel to the idea of JSP and PHP, Perl Template was designed to
    separate data from presentation. The data is encapsulated in Perl
    objects, like Java Beans. The presentation is represented by Perl
    template files, like JSP files. Perl Template consists of a
    templating language that is a set of XML tags and a rendering engine
    that parses templates and generates output using specified Perl
    objects. Perl Template is suitable for any environment where dynamic
    content needs to be produced based on Perl objects. For instance, it
    can be used for developing CGI programs, where Perl developers can
    concentrate on writing business logics and data retrieval, while
    content developers can focus on producing presentation layout.

    Compare to Andy Wardly’s Template Toolkit, Perl Template is much
    more compact and lighter.
