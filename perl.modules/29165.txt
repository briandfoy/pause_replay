Well, I figured it was kind of a toss-up.  Since there are only two
modules in Acme::, and two modules in Silly::, I didn't think that
either was necessarily the preferred option.  One reason I went with
Silly:: was because Silly::Werder does a similar thing, only with
syllables to generate 'snoof' (upon inspection, I see I forgot to list
that under similar modules).

So given that, is the general consensus still that it should be in
Acme::, or would it be fine to stay in Silly::?  I'm really ok with
either, Acme:: just means a well-used :%s///g in vim and a repackaging.
