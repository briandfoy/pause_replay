The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Trampoline
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Delay construction until a method is called.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are times when constructing a class is expensive due to time
    or resource constraints (e.g., DBI handles in a heavily forked
    apache server). This class generates a trampoline object that delays
    construction until a method is actually called on the particular
    object. By splitting the class into two packages (one for
    construction, the other for dispatch) the caller uses the 'real'
    class' constructor with an extra leading argument of the class being
    constructed:

    my $dbh = Devel::Trampoline->connect( 'DBI', $dsh, $u, $p );

    my $sth = $dbh->prepar( 'select foo from bar' );

    or

    my $fb = Devel::Trampoline->frobnicate( 'Foo', Bar => 1 );

    This allows minimal changes to existing code or simpler
    construction via an array-based config object w/ plugin values for
    the handling class and its arguments.

    The trampoline is more effecient since each AUTOLOAD is only called
    once: the first real method call replaces the trampoline object with
    the real one and all dispatch from there forward is via the standard
    mechanism -- which can include the class' own AUTOLOAD if necessary.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
