The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CaCORE
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: A Common Framework for Cancer Data Managemen
  userid:      JIANGS (Shan Jiang)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/NCICB/infrastructure/cacore_overview

  similar:
    BIOperl

  rationale:

    caCORE is the open source group of software products developed by
    the NCICB (National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics) Core
    Infrastructure Group. By providing a common data management
    framework, caCORE helps streamline the informatics development
    throughout the cancer community. The components of caCORE support
    the consistency, clarity and comparability of biomedical research
    data and information.
