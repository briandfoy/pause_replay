     why:

    A company called TIBCO produces a product called TIB/Rendezvous. It
    is a proprietary publish/subscribe message-passing API. It's
    basically a C library with C++ and Java API's built over it, along
    with a very simple Perl XS module (it's little more than wrappers
    around the C functions).

    I am writing better Perl bindings for it (using Inline, actually),
    and putting it all together in an OO API. I'm hoping to use the
    Tib::Rv namespace.

    My code will be licensed under the same terms as Perl itself, but
    TIBCO only provides a developer version for free (otherwise, it's
    pretty spendy).
