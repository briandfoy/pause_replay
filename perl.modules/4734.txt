I'd like to contribute the Inline-Tcl module, part of the Inline project.
I'll need an id.

Inline-Tcl allows inline sections of tcl code within perl.
It's part of the Inline package and is based on Inline-Python.  I haven't
figured out why I would want to do this, but I have large amounts of tcl
code that I don't want to port so it might come in handy later.  In
talking with neil watkiss (NEILW) of Inline-Python, it seems there have  
been a few (3-4) requests for inline-tcl.  Should offer the same
functionality as Tcl::, but will be easier to read.  The latest snapshot
of the code can be found on my webpage.

My name is Ryan Sadler.
Email:  rrsadler@ttul.org
Webpage:  http://ttul.org/~rrsadler/
Preferred user-ID:  RRS, or RYANS
DLSI entry: adcO, Write Perl subroutines in Tcl

Thanks
