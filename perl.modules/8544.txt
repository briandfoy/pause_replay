The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::UUID
  DSLIP:       RdcOp
  description: UUID/GUID Generator
  userid:      AGOLOMSH (Alexander Golomshtok)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This module provides a framework for generating UUIDs (Universally
    Unique Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique
    Identifiers). A UUID is 128 bits long, and is guaranteed to be
    different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until 3400 A.D. UUIDs
    were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and later
    in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing
    Environment. Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to
    provide unique identity for various software components, Microsoft
    COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs very extensively to uniquely
    identify classes, applications and components across
    network-connected systems. Since this module is likely to be used to
    provide unique identify for objects or generate unique database
    keys, it is designed to be a part of Data namespace, hence the name
    Data::UUID. Currently, there's no other Perl extension for
    generating UUIDs/GUIDs on UNIX systems.

The resulting entry would be:
