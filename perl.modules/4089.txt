Hi,
     I'd like to have considered for upload a module, Math::FFT,
for doing Fast Fourier Transforms and related things (correlations,
convolutions and deconvolutions, and power spectra). My CPAN id 
is RKOBES, and the dsli information is
  Development - a (alpha)
  Support - d (developer)
  Language - c (a C compiler is needed)
  Interface - O (object oriented)
A description of the module is
   "Perl extension for Fast Fourier Transforms"
Thanks.

best regards,
randy kobes
