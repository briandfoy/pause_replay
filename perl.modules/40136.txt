Hi Brian (or other PAUSE Admin),

After an e-mail discussion with Adam Kennedy, I've been persuaded
to have Menus.pm associated with the Term:: namespace. None of the
existing namespaces is a *slam dunk* as far as really representing
what this thing is and does. That was why I lobbied for a new namespace
called Menus - and was willing to change the module's name to Menu.pm
i.e. Menus::Menu.

However, I encountered quite a bit of resistance which I'm sure wasn't
personal on Adam's part, and more represents the collective sentiment of
the CPAN maintainer community.

So, having to choose the "most appropriate" home of the existing one's
on the market (so to speak) - Adam and I both came to agree that Term::
was the *best* fit - poor as it is. I'm definitely not happy - but I
am resigned and willing to be a team player. If Term:: it must be ---
then Term:: it is.

I appreciate all YOU do on behalf of the Perl and CPAN community.

(If you have, what in your opinion, would be a *better* suggestion, by
*all* means - I'd like to hear it!)

In the meantime, the module package has been updated to reflect this
choice.
Term-Menus-1.04.tar.gz was uploaded to the PAUSE server this afternoon.

Thanks for your assistance!

Brian Kelly

P.S. - What *are* the 'UI' namespaces?

Can this fit under one of the UI namespaces?
