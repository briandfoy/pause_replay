     why:

    I am planning on contributing my project, for Google's Summer of
    Code, in which I developed a project called the "MegaDistro" (AKA
    PerlPlus), which uses CPANPLUS and some other modules to generate
    [binary] packages, from a list of modules, with some other features
    - I would like to post the content on CPAN :) I worked very closely
    with TPF (The Perl Foundation), on this project, if it has any
    bearing on the decision process :P
