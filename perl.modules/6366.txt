Subject: Namespace for an application?

From: autarch@urth.org (Dave Rolsky)

We are currently working on a web based task/bug tracking system that we'd
like to publicly release sometime in the near future.  The system is
mostly Mason components plus some modules.  The question is what namespace
the modules should occupy.

Is there any consensus in the Perl community on a namespace for apps?
Perhaps Apps::*?

That would make us Apps::Tracker.


Thoughts?
