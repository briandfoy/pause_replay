The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Polyhedra
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: vertices, edges, faces of common polyhedra
  userid:      HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    IRC, perlmonks, website, other scripts

  similar:
    no similar module found

  rationale:

    It's of benefit to mathematics, is compatible with other modules in
    Math::* namespace (such as Math::VectorReal), and other modules of
    similar complexity are in Math::*. It's the most obvious name for
    searching. A previous email to modules@perl.org gave no negative
    feedback.

    I didn't want to try to develop some rich taxonomy underneath
    Math::Geometry::foo::bar, of which this module would be alone. The
    Math::Geometry namespace seems too deep for a straightforward
    data-sourcing module like this.

  enteredby:   HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  enteredon:   Wed May  7 23:16:18 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::Polyhedra       bdpfp vertices, edges, faces of common polyhedra   HALLEY
