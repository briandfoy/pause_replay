That's s'okay, y2k is just a legacy wrapper anyway.  If it was a few
months ago I would have argued that it would be a Good Idea for it to
show up in the module list, but as it'll only be useful for a couple
more months its not a biggie.

The Tick will NEVER be deprecated!  SPOOOOOOOON!

Just consider it D::oh for all intents and purposes.  I don't know if
that can be considered a root namespace or not, but that's how
everything else treats it.

If you can give me a compelling reason, its not too late to change the
name.  Carp::Date might be better... Style::Date might make more
sense, if you want to crack open a new namespace.  I've got another
module checking for use of open() and chdir() and such in void context
which I'll be cleaning up and releasing soon.  I was thinking of
calling it D'oh::Files but Style::Files would work and probably be
more descriptive.
