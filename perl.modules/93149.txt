This brought back some frustrated memories. I tried to take over 
Math::Brent, for the purpose of upgrading the package and fixing an 
error. I managed to locate John Williams, who was fine with it -- but 
who then couldn't grant me co-maintenance because PAUSE didn't have him 
as the owner (I checked, and all of his modules at that time were 
co-owned by another user, although only one had been worked on).

At that point he didn't feel like proceeding further, and I didn't feel 
like making an issue of it, especially if the other user was going to 
make the fixes anyway.

It's now two years later. The other user doesn't seem to have ownership 
anymore, but Math::Brent is still has an outstanding bug.

I'm still interested in being a co-maintainer. For that matter, I'd be 
interested in co-maintaining Math::Fortran and Math::Derivative, 
although I would probably retire the Math::Fortran name for something 
like Math::Util.
