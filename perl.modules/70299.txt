The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Predicate
  DSLIP:       bdpha
  description: Transportable boolean logic
  userid:      AYATES (Andrew Yates)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://github.com/andrewyatz/Data-Predicate

  similar:

  rationale:

    This library allows for the application of an object which responds
    with a true/false return. The overall rational of the module is to
    provide programable hooks into complex rule and filtering systems.
    It also allows for very complex and/or/not statements to be composed
    in parts and then combined together at the last moment allowing for
    a user to switch in/out logic quickly when developing systems.

    The name space Data is chosen because this is what it primarily
    works with and the name Predicate is chosen from similar systems
    developed in other languages.

  enteredby:   AYATES (Andrew Yates)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar 12 17:22:11 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Predicate       bdpha Transportable boolean logic                  AYATES
