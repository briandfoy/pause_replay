The issues are several.  

    What is the namespace to use for pod related utilities and
    libraries?  Should it be something like Pod::Tools::podgrep?
    Or Pod::Utils::podpath?   Or something else, like Tools::Pod
    or PodTools?  How many should be merged into one, allowing
    imports like Pod::Tools qw/podpath/?  This is not very 
    extensible though.

    What is the namespace to use for Perl-Module-related utilities
    and libraries?  Should it be something like PM::Tools::pmeth,
    PM::Tools::pmpath, etc?  

    What about the Perl Power Tools stuff, that is, the standard
    Unix tools replacements?  PPT::tcgrep is weird, because what's
    "PPT"?  And if it's replacing grep, oughtn't we call it grep?
    No, can't do that -- can't import a grep function.  Should it
    be PPT->main("tcgrep") or something?  I'm not sure that helps.
    Note that this is the i/f for simu-exec'ing, not the same as a
    per-line in-out filter equiv.

    Does or should the fact that these all files are a superpositioning
    of a Perl module *and* its documentation *and* an executable
    standalone Perl program have any effect on the decisions about
    the previous three questions?
