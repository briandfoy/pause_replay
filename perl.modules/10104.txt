FWIW, I am in favor of this collaborative author id. I guess I'm biased
but...

DataBuilt Inc (DBI) is a current hotbed of Perl activity and looks to
continue to be for some time. Having a common corporate id gives credit
to DataBuilt and thus (as Dave Paris pointed out to me) partially
justifies using some of the company's resources to developing and
maintaining Open Source Software. This is a boon to the CPAN and Perl.

Credit will still be given to the individual authors but the ownership
will belong to DataBuilt, This protects DataBuilt's interest in
developing it's Intellectual Property using these contributions, without
fear of an employee leaving and failing to maintain the module in a
manner consistent with the company's needs.

DataBuilt is a company that not only knows the value of OSS, but
realizes the benefit of contributing to it. I see the potential for DBI
to set a positive trend for corporate OSS contribution in the post
dot-com era.

Cheers, Brian (INGY)

PS I have a cool new module idea to release soon... :)
