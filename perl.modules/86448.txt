[apparently it is not possible to cc this list from rt.cpan.org... I've
waited a few days and the message has not shown up, so I am resending it
manually now.]

--------------------------------------------------------

It has been six weeks since my last ping, and I haven't heard from you, since
trying to reach you since March.

This message is an official request to modules@perl.org to formally adopt
Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped so I can get the aforementioned rewrites into the
PAUSE index.

(Log-Dispatch-File-Stamped-0.10_010 has been up for over a month, with no
failure reports.)
