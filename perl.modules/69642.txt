Whenever anyone says obvious, it automatically means it is not.

First, if you mean flexible, use "flexible".

Next, how is your improvement flexible? Looking at the docs, I don't
see how it's more flexible. It looks like a nicer declarative syntax,
but I don't see that you can do any more than any of the other
File::Find modules will let you do.

Perhaps there's another distinguishing feature of your module that
could be part of the name?
