Matthijs: Florian, myself and others have tried to contact you about the 
Sub::Name situation for many weeks now. We tried various email 
addresses, tickets in RT, as well as IRC (where you -- fwvo you -- are 
online in #p5p).

For the time being, I will assign co-maintenance permissions to Florian 
so that we can fix the problem and move on with the perl development. 
This is a temporary measure. Should you object or wish to pick up 
Sub::Name maintenance again, you, as primary maintainer, can modify the 
co-maintenance permissions yourself any time. If in doubt, contact the 
PAUSE admins via modules@perl.org.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
