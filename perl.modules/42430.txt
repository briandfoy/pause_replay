No.  I made an update.  I sent him mail but no answer.  Maybe he is on
holiday.  I did ask Marc some months ago if he would be interested to
make the changes to accomodate version1 format but he said he was not
interested.  So I and someone else did the work more recently.

(Spamassassin etc are now on the version1 format.)
