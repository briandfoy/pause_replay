PAUSE crew,

I have not been successful finding the Business::UPS authors
1. Multiple RT tickets open for 6 weeks with no response.
2. Emailed them on Feb 17. Email bounced.
3. Posted via ironman fed blog:
http://perl-toddr.blogspot.com/2010/03/looking-for-mia-cpan-authors.html
-- March 22
4. Googled for more ways to contact with no success

I'd like to PAUSE ID TODDR be added as co-maintainer of Business::UPS.

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
