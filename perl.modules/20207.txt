Dear Module Mavins

The main Perl 5 Module List page:

    http://cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html

Claims to be extremely out of date, last revised
on 2002/08/27.  I only noticed this while checking
it every day to see whether my new modules DBIx::CodeKit
and DBIx::BabelKit were accepted.

Does it take too much work to keep this text page
up to date with the CPAN database?

Perhaps we can write a little database perl script to
recreate the document or one like it on a daily basis?

The reasons that I suggest this are:

1.  Until now I had no idea that it was not up
    to date and never looked at the other listings.

I never looked at the other listings because:

2.  The other listings do not include the nice
    short description so it is impossible to figure
    out which modules are of interest.

If we do nothing else at least an "Out of date"
disclaimer would be helpful.

Thanks for all of your work.

Cheers, John
