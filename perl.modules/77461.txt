The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::RecordStream
  DSLIP:       Rdpho
  description: Commandline Text Analytics
  userid:      BERNARD (Benjamin Bernard)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    github.com/benbernard/RecordStream, freenode: #ex_bow

  similar:

  rationale:

    RecordStream is a set of commandline tools and OO interfaces to
    slicing and dicing JSON data on the command line. Tools that allow
    grep, transform, sort, collation on JSON data are includes as are
    tools for creating JSON data from various data sources (Text, CSV,
    Databases, process trees, etc), and also tools for outputing the
    transformed data (or analystics), output forms such as HTML,
    Database (insert statements), CSV, ascii table, etc.

    While there is an OO interface for these tools, these things are
    primarily meant to be used from the commandline as scripts directly
    invoked. Hence the choice of the App:: top level name space.
    RecordStream is the name of the project (and we have a community of
    users).

    Thoughts? Comments? Is App::RecordStream too high level? (This is
    my first CPAN contribution) Thanks for your advice / assistance!
