Please have a look at our policy documentation at

http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/04pause.html#takeover

Essentially, we need some "proof" that you've been trying to contact the 
author. Try google to find a working email address. Send mail to him and 
CC this mailing list. Then allow for a little time for the author to 
react and we can give you co-maintenance permissions. But really, I'm 
just repeating what's explained much better in the above document.

Best regards,
Steffen
