The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NBU
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO Interface to Veritas NetBackup utilities
  userid:      DUTCHMAN (Paul Winkeler)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Veritas' NetBackup software, commonly abbreviated as NBU, is in
    dire need of an OO abstraction layer. Out of the box its GUI is
    decent but its command line utilities are enough of a mish-mash to
    drive anyone insane.

    The modules in the proposed NBU namespace implement all the
    concepts touted in the NetBackup documentation: Volume Pool Robot
    Storage Unit Drive Image etc.

    There currently exists no generic top-level namespace for
    backup/archiving concepts, although perhaps there should be one.
    Hence I am proposing that the NBU namespace be reserved for
    NetBackup and that the modules be categorized under commercial
    software interfaces.
