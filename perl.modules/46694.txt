Subject: Taking over WWW::Search::PubMed

Hello,

I've been meaning to write this list for a while regarding the  
WWW::Search::PubMed module. The CPAN version of this module was  
released in June of 2000, and has been broken for years. I haven't  
been able to contact Jim Smyser, the author. His email address  
<jsmyser@bigfoot.com> does not exist anymore, bouncing messages with  
an error. Likewise, his URL <http://irover.org/> seems to have been  
replaced with other content.

I've rewritten the WWW::Search::PubMed module [1] to work with the  
existing pubmed service, and would like to take over maintenance of  
the module. I believe it's important to release a working version of  
this module, because even though there is a (much newer)  
WWW::Search::NCBI::PubMed module that has similar functionality, the  
WWW::Search::PubMed module has a much simpler API, and requires far  
fewer required modules (especially modules requiring compiling C  
libraries, making it much more difficult to use  
WWW::Search::NCBI::PubMed on Windows).

I haven't found any specific information in the CPAN or PAUSE  
documents explaining how I can become listed as the maintainer of the  
module on PAUSE when the original author is unreachable. Is this the  
appropriate list for this type of request?

thank you for your time,
gregory williams
