Subject: Module submission Sys::Filesystem
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Filesystem
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: List UNIX filesystems and their properties
  userid:      NICOLAW (Nicola Worthington)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Private GPL development group and LUG

  similar:
    Solaris::DeviceTree Win32::DriveInfo

  rationale:

    This module is aimed to be a cross platform API to mounted and
    unmounted filesystem information. It will provide methods to list
    all, mounted and unmounted filesystems available to a system, and
    then query as many properties about each or any filesystem which can
    be found. It is intended to provide a single consistant API across
    as many platforms as possible. This module was originally required
    for a home brew platform independant backup script written in perl.
    The namespace is unique and not stepping on anybody's toes. I
    envisage Sys::Filesystem::Platform, eg: Sys::Filesystem::Solaris
    Sys::Filesystem::AIX Sys::Filesystem::HPUX Sys::Filesystem::Linux
    Sys::Filesystem::BSD Sys::Filesystem::Tru64 etc etc as the platform
    specific data gatherers which will inherit from Sys::Fileystem. I
    feel this will be a valuable tool.

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::Filesystem      adpOp List UNIX filesystems and their properties   NICOLAW
