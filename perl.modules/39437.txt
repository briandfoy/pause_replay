The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::CreateTestData
  DSLIP:       cdpfl
  description: Creates test data for use in programs
  userid:      KEVINRICE (Kevin J. Rice)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://www.justanyone.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=5

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    I have a need to generate a set of test data that I can pump
    through my application. But, I need to go out and find data I can
    use. Unfortunately, at various jobs, i've had to create small
    spreadsheets with data in them to use for this purpose.

    My current situation is one where I have to create 100,000 rows of
    name and address data to fill a database so I can run other tests on
    it. This is troublesome and I'm too lazy to type that much.

    This module will create test data that I can use to load my
    database.

    Formally, here's the description:

    Test::CreateTestData is designed to allow people to create test
    data very quickly, including test files of arbitrary length, in a
    variety of formats.

    Test data to be generated will include any/all of the below
    columns: 1. Names 2. Street Address 3. Sub Address (stuff like,
    "Apt. 12B") 4. City 5. State 6. Zip or Zip-Plus-4 7. Phone numbers
    8. Email address 9. Web addresses 10. IP addresses 11. Company names
    12. Country 13. 2-character ISO country code 14. numeric data

    Other ideas are welcome. If someone knows of a module that's
    already written to do this, please enlighten me, but I've found
    none, and I hope my effort here this will help people avoid the
    drudgery of creating test data.

    One thing I'm doing is having 'seed data' which allows people to
    use predetermined values for some fields and generate random values
    for other fields. This would allow more memorable test data (in
    small data sets), such as using names of famous personages as people
    with random addresses.

    A future enhancement would seem to be to validate the address with
    the city, state, and zip code (using real street names but random
    house numbers).

    Internationalization of this also presents many opportunities for
    enhancement, but I'm not worrying about this until I get the base
    module checked in.
