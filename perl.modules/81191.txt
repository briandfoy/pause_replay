I still get a bug report every year or so that it doesn't work, because Yahoo Groups has changed over time and nobody has updated the module, and I don't expect anyone ever will.  I don't see that it will ever work again, and I'd just like to delete the whole thing, RT queue and all.

Doubt it.

What I'd do instead is upload a release with DEAD in big letters or something
- see Net::IRC for how we did it with a similarly expired module, including
a warning in Makefile.PL that it flat out doesn't work right.

Maybe also a recommendation that they try using Mechanize themselves, and
a note that if somebody produces a working module they're welcome to the
namespace.

(if you don't want to be responsible for this part, I can probably arrange
you a volunteer)
