I don't see any benefit from the work. If you game it out


If someone wants to take over the module, we have the process for that
and it happens.

If someone wants to give up the module, they can.

If no one wants to take over the module and there's no one to give it
up, does transferring the module improve the universe enough to offset
the extra work we do? I don't think it does.
