     why:

    Just some code...

    Seriously though, my plan is to submit a documentation generator
    that will display inherited methods inline. I am currently working
    on a fairly large framework that would benefit from API-level
    documentation that showed what methods were available to a given
    class, including those from their base class and their classes base
    class, and so on.
