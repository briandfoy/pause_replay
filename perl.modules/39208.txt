It was patterned after Time::DaysInMonth.  There exists a
Date::DayOfWeek that does not have the useful wrapper functions mine
does.

It depends how you look at it.  DateTime seems to be all about
creating DT objects.  My module just exports several useful DayOfWeek
&& WeekDayName functions.  If someone just wants the DayOfWeek
calculated (similar to DaysInMonth), then creating a DateTime object
can be overkill.  DateTime (like Date::DayOfWeek) only returns the
integer DayOfWeek where my module has optional (&& useful) name
functions in addition.  I think my module does a small thing well &&
deserves inclusion in the registry for this reason.

  Thanks for all the great work on PAUSE.
