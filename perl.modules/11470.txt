The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::OOEnigma
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO Enigma machine: create your own Enigmas
  userid:      SJBAKER (Steve Baker)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org and with the author of Crypt::Enigma

  similar:
    Crypt::Enigma

  rationale:

    A flexible, object-oriented interface to a WWII Enigma machine for
    the creation and exploration of the user's own Enigmas. It provides
    some sample Enigmas.

    The apparently similar module Crypt::Enigma is aimed at providing a
    historically-accurate Enigma rather than providing the facility to
    create and explore your own, which may or may not use
    historically-accurate ciphers. Crypt::OOEnigma has been briefly
    discussed with the author of Crypt::Enigma.

    This module was created in the process of reading and understanding
    the related chapters of Korner's "The Pleasures of Counting". It is
    hoped that other students of the theory of the Enigma will find
    useful the opportunity to explore various Enigmas and their
    components.
