My Fellow Nonprofit Leaders & UW Partners,
My name is Karen Knapp and I was recently privileged to attend a Major Gifts Ramp-Up Event with my United Way Board Chair. The time we spent with the team from National Development Institute turned into the most valuable and entertaining training event I'd experienced in years which is why our United Way is co-sponsoring an upcoming Major Gifts Ramp-Up Conference here in Florida.

 If you're considering new ways to increase revenue in 2015 I highly recommend that you and your team register today for Major Gifts Ramp-Up.  

 Did you know that there are 47,000 families in your service region with a net worth in excess of one million dollars. This conference event will reveal how to reach these donors who already believe in your important mission but have yet to hear about your good work.

 The team at National Development Institute knows that you're working to diversify your revenue sources. In support of your efforts NDI is hosting this two-day session to ensure you launch a successful Major Gifts Fundraising Program that raises 5, 6 & 7 figure gifts.

 Tuition for a conference of this magnitude would normally run upwards of $600 per person. National Development Institute understands that budgets are tight and are making this two-day offering available for only $98 for one person or $198 for UNLIMITED REGISTRATIONS for every member of your team.                        

 Please note that due to space limitations seating will reach capacity shortly. Please make your reservations right now by pressing the "play" button above!

 Attending a Major Gifts Ramp-Up Conference Event is the first and best right step you can take this New Year to generate the revenues you need for 2015! 

 Sincerely Yours, 

Karen Knapp
