Hi George,

You've done everything you need to.  Now we need to approve your
namespace registration.  This takes a few days... we're all busy people
:-/  Meanwhile, people can still download the module from your author
directory, and it'll still show up in places like search.cpan.org.
When we approve the namespace registration, your module will show up on
certain other lists that we maintain, but your module is effectively
released *now*.

Anyway, sorry for the delay... "your request has been placed in a queue 
and will be answered by the next available operator" :)

K.
