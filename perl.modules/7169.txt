The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::String
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Math w/ strings represented as big integers
  userid:      TELS (Tels)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Nobody had much interest in it yet ;)

  similar:
    Base::Convert, Math::Flex (or was that String::Flex? Cant check,
    cpan.org is down)

  rationale:

    The module is a subclass of Math::BigInt and represents both
    strings and integers by providing a 1:1 mapping between these two,
    hence Math::String.

    (It is basically a giant frog-leap from $x = 'aa'; $x++; to a
    full-fledged string-math allowing $x = 'aa' + $y etc.)

    There are also two other modules in the tar:

    Math::String::Sequence, which is simple 'aa' .. 'zz' with
    Math::Strings. Math::String::Charset, which is used by Math::String,
    but can also be used on it's own if you need describing character
    sets.

    Cheers,

    Tels

The resulting entry would be:
