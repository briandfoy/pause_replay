is Jochen still around?  i'd like to give him the chance to clean out
his directory on his own in case he wants those distros for some reason
(although they are on the BackPAN).

if he is not around, please download the old versions (just to have a
copy), and i'll delete the old versions.  ping this list next week if
you still need that to happen (and Cc: me too, please).
