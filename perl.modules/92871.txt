     why:

    I am multilingual and work with translators for whom I have created
    modules to assist with things like word-splitting in Thai and Lao by
    first providing fundamental tools for addressing the characters in
    regular expressions. These tools could be building blocks of any
    major project addressing textual manipulations in Thai and/or Lao,
    and a Thai to Lao conversion utility may be in the future. At this
    point, the modules are very simple, but I have been using them in my
    own projects for a couple of years. Very little exists in CPAN for
    either of these languages. We need more developers in these Asian
    languages, and my hope is that these tools will encourage them to
    start.
