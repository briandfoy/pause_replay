     why:

    I have written a modification of Lingua::TypoGenerator, calling it
    Lingua::TypographicalError. It's like the former, except that it
    allows for typographical errors from every key immediately adjacent
    to the target key, not just the keys to the left and right. For
    example, the former gives /D/ and /G/ for /F/, whereas mine gives
    /R/ /T/ /V/ and /C/ as well as /D/ and /G/.
