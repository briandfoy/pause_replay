    LSF PERL API

    This package contains two modules allowing Platform's LSF APIs to
    be called by PERL.

    The current revision (May 2008) has been tested with LSF 7 Update 2
    on Linux2.6-glibc2.3 and Solaris 10 by Platform. It does not form a
    part of the LSF Product Suite. An open source project based on this
    revision is hosted at http://www.hpccommunity.org/. The pakcage can
    be downloaded from that website and CPAN (http://www.cpan.org/) and
    can be installed in a standard way as other regular perl modules on
    CPAN. Refering the usage at:
    http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/perl/pod/perlmodinstall.html

    Thanks to Paul Franceus from Capita Technologies for the original
    version of this package.
