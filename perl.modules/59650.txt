     why:

    I have been working on a module to implement a large number of the
    Coda File System management functions. I find Coda to be a great
    solution for replicated file systems but I become annoyed by having
    to exec out many commands in scripts I have to run at work in order
    to keep everything stable and clean. I think a full module could be
    useful for others who use Coda and I have been unable to find
    anything Coda related on CPAN except for the AFS related modules
    which do not work directly with Coda. I continue to search for any
    current Coda related modules but have not found any via
    google/irc/mailing lists. Until I find a better solution I plan to
    continue working on a module to help call out the management
    functions required to use Coda in a high demand environment. Thank
    you for your consideration ;P
