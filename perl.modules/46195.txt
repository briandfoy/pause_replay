     why:

    I am planning to contribut modules that I have written with the
    hopes that I can make the lives of other Perl programmers easier.

    I write frameworks mostly. For instance, I wrote an object-oriented
    Perl framework called Mind.pm that allows for you to buid your own
    irc bots, and allows for you to use your own subroutines to alter
    the bot's behavior.

    I wrote anothe module that acts as a go-between for bladeenc and
    cdparanoia, to allow developers to make mp3's with their own
    scripts, rather than using a resource intensive GUI.

    ... thank you for your time.
