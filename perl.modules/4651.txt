Additional information (from GISI pod):

=head2 What is GISI?

GISI stands for 'Geographic Information System Interface'.

GISI is an experimental object-oriented API (Application Programming
Interface) to access spatial data from Perl programs.  GISI intention
is to define a set of classes and conventions to provide a consistent
interface to access spatial data independent of underlying file format
or access method.  GISI is based on the OpenGIS
Abstract Specification Version 4 (http://www.opengis.org/).

Similar to L<Perl DBI>, GISI is an interface layer providing
communication between Perl scripts utilizing GISI and drivers that
provide actual access to the sources of spatial data.  All effort was
done to keep GISI thin and limit its scope to the data access
purposes.  GISI is sought to be a glue between various pieces of the
GIS software and libraries written in a variety of programming
language, including but not limited to Perl.

=head2 Architecture

GISI as implemented as a set of Perl modules of 'core GISI' and
optional drivers.  GISI itself performs the following actions: loading
of the specified driver(s), dispatching its method calls to the
drivers and error checking/handling.  All other actions should be
implemented outside of the GISI driver loader although they can share
GISI data model.  The drivers implement support for a given type of a
spatial data sources that can be a file in some format, a database
server or almost anything else.

In term of the abstract model of spatial data GISI relies on the
OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Version 4.  The best way to get a good
understanding of the matter is to download the specification and read
in GISI:

Discussions and publicity:

GISI.pm under the current name and architecture has been under
development for almost 2 years and some pieces of its code may be
traced back even to 1994.  Originally it was a set of Perl scripts to
convert between various GIS (Geographic Information Systems) formats,
later they were rewritten as modules and unified around the model of
the OpenGIS Abstract Specification
(http://www.opengis.org/techno/specs.htm).

We had made a presentation about GISI.pm at the Technical Committee
meeting of the OpenGIS Consortium (http://www.opengis.org/) this June.
Also we will be presenting a paper concerning GISI.pm design
philosophy and surrounding software architecture issues at the ACMGIS
Symposium on November 9-11 in Washington DC
(http://acmgis.cs.pusan.ac.kr/html/acmgis2000/index.html).
