The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sendmail::M4::mail8_zombie
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: sendmail zombie spammer helper
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Sendmail::M4::Mail8

  rationale:

    The sendmail m4 macro file that Mail8 generates can not cope with
    all types of zombie spammer's, and so the generated file relies on
    an external Perl script to deal with those zombie's that it can not
    detect.

    Our commercial version used a program very like the one that we are
    proposing. It just needs rewriting to be compliant with Mail8's
    generated sendmail.cf files.

    Currently the generated sendmail.cf file refers to this program and
    is setup not to mind it not being there.

  enteredby:   CML (celmorlauren limited)
  enteredon:   Fri Sep 21 14:31:56 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sendmail::M4::
::mail8_zombie    cdpfp sendmail zombie spammer helper               CML
