The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Qt4
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: Perl interface to KDE/Qt 4
  userid:      FREQUENCY (Jonathan Yu)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    module-authors list, Google Summer of Code (Debian project)

  similar:
    Qt

  rationale:

    This collection of modules will implement bindings to the Qt4
    application using Smoke (KDE's binding meta-language).

    There is a project at: http://code.google.com/p/perlqt4/

    Why Qt4 rather than just Qt? The existing module there is for a
    very old version of Qt. There is the chance that using that
    namespace may break things. It might be useful to use that one
    though, instead of Qt4. I leave that up to the PAUSE admins to
    decide.

    Anyway, because the API is vastly different from earlier versions
    of Qt, this collection of modules should be under the Qt4 and Qt4::
    top-level namespace. This is to match similar conventions with, say,
    Wx::

The resulting entry would be:

Qt4               adhOg Perl interface to KDE/Qt 4                   FREQUENCY
