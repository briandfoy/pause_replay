Hi PAUSE admins,

I've been unable to reach the author of Sybase::RepAgent and
Sybase::TdsServer.  I've been trying to reach the author (Bernd Dulfer
<bdulfer@cpan.org>) since July.  No response.

I would like to take over the two modules.  I have a pause account and
am ready to go on them.  Barring that, different name spaces would be
sufficient and I'll use those if necessary.

please let me know if/when I can take over these two modules.

thanks

jason
