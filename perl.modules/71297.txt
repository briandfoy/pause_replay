The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FusqlFS
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: fusqlfs - FUSE file system to mount DB and p
  userid:      KSTEPME (Konstantin Stepanov)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://github.com/kstep/fusqlfs

  similar:

  rationale:

    The idea behind this module is to provide interface between file
    system and DB, so that all objects in database are represented as
    file system artifacts (files and directories).

    Unlike modules like Fuse::DBI, which tries to provide file system
    with SQL database as a backend for files storage, it centers on
    database itself, striving to provide file system interface to SQL
    database.

    E.g. tables in FusqlFS are represented as directories, table fields
    and data rows are files, indices are directories with symlinks to
    fields' files etc. Everything is editable, so you can administer
    your database in your favorite file manager, not some special admin
    tool like PgAdmin3 or something.

    I'm not quite sure if I should put this module into Fuse or DBI
    namespace as it belongs to both at a time, so I apply for new root
    module name, but I totally trust your opinion in this case.

The resulting entry would be:

FusqlFS           cdpOg fusqlfs - FUSE file system to mount DB and p KSTEPME
