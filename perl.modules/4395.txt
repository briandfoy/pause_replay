Dear Sir or Madam:
   I am submitting this description for your review. It is a module called
Config::DynaConf (for now) and the ManPage is at
http://www.neonedge.com/perl_tools/Config/. I am curious what your thoughts are
on whether or not I should bother signing up and posting it (see below).
Thank you for your time, and any suggestions are welcome,
Grant Mongardi

Summary: Parses .ini, .properties, or 'special' files
Description:
    The intent of this module is to parse Windows *.ini files,
    java *.properties files, or a variation of the above. This
    module is similar to the Config::IniFiles module with the
    following differences:
       1.> It should correctly parse java .properties files
       2.> It only reads one section per object (saves space).
       3.> It doesn't require the <<here operator for
              multiline directives.
       4.> It separates out the administrative functionality
              into a separate module (Config::DynaAdmin)
              (more secure).
       5.> It allows 'special' variables to be defined within
              comments that only DynaConf should read ( Java
              or Windows should treat them as comments).
       6.> It Autoloads the 'special' variables
              (i.e, "$obj->_my_var();" ).
       7.> It allows multilines to be Joined automatically
              (or not).
       8.> The resulting object includes some CGI/ENV variables
              as a 'bonus'.
       9.> If no section is specified, it ignores section
              delimiters and sucks up all the directives
              (this is for simple config files).
    I tried to contact Rich Bowen, the author of Config::IniFiles,
    but I have not heard anything to-date.

Public Discussion: Other than with other developers whom I
   have worked with, there has been no public forum discussion
   on the merits of this module.

Future plans: May add .rc files, and perhaps *.conf files.
