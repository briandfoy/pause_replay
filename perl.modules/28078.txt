The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBM::Deep
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Pure-perl multi-level hash/array DBM
  userid:      JHUCKABY (Joseph Huckaby)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Brand spankin' new (haven't submitted it anywhere yet)

  similar:
    MLDBM DWH_File

  rationale:

    A very unique DBM, written in pure-perl. True multi-level
    hash/array support (unlike MLDBM and DWH_File, which are faked),
    hybrid OO and tie interface, multi-platform FTPable files (unlike
    BerkeleyDB), and quite fast.

    Most of the other DBMs on CPAN are in the top-level namespace, with
    class names suffixed with "_File" (DB_File, SDBM_FIle, etc.). I'm
    sure this isn't desired for new modules like mine, but I also see
    the "DBM::" namespace in the list, with one module already under it
    (DBass). This seems like a better choice for Deep.

    The actual name of the project is "DeepDB", but I dropped the "DB"
    from the name because my proposed prefix "DBM::" contains that.
    "DBM::Deep" is my favorite choice, but I am completely open to
    suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

DBM::
::Deep            adphp Pure-perl multi-level hash/array DBM         JHUCKABY
