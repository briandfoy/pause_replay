The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graphics::Canvas
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Generic canvas with plugin image formats
  userid:      RPETTETT (Roger M. Pettett)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    drawing code has been discussed on ensembl-dev@ebi.ac.uk

  similar:

  rationale:

    These modules have been condensed from generic, modular drawing
    code I wrote for the Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org/).
    There they have been used in a live, production environment since
    Ensembl v1.1.0 (current version is 1.1.3).

    It consists of a generic canvas object with basic shape primitives
    and multiple rendering objects supporting different image formats
    (currently gif,png,wmf,imagemap, postscript,svg). Shapes and image
    formats are easily extended. GD is currently used for gif and png
    support.

    Afaics nobody appears to have written anything quite this flexible
    yet. Of course I'd be interested to know if anything exists.

The resulting entry would be:

Graphics::
