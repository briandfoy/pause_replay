Sorry, I don't think my last attempt at this went 
through correctly.  

We're trying to switch the maintership of "Text::Capitalize" 
from SYP to DOOM, but mistakes have been made... 

Is it possible for the Powers that Be to switch it to me (DOOM) 
or back to Stanislaw (SYP)?  

If I'm not asking in the right place, please give 
me a pointer...

Oooops... It seems that I clicked the wrong button :)

Now I am co-mantainer of Text::Capitalize but no one is
primary mantainer! So I do not have permissions to add you
as co-mantainer and neither to put myself back as primary
mantainer... Please take a look at your PAUSE account if you
could associate Text::Capitalize to yourself, if it's
impossible I think that the only way is to mail PAUSE
guys...
