The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Scalar::Number
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: numeric aspects of scalars
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Integer Data::Float

  rationale:

    This module is about the numeric values of scalars. Scalar numeric
    values can be native integers or floating point; despite the lack of
    strong typing the difference is visible. The functions supplied by
    this module are mostly about coping with this duality: functions to
    determine which type a value has and to convert between the two
    types. Also planned: lossless numeric comparison between int and
    float; extraction of numeric value from dualvar (like 0+$_ but
    preserving signed zeroes).

    Data::Integer and Data::Float manage details of the native integer
    and floating point types respectively, and handle the data in the
    form of plain scalars. This module is logically distinct because it
    manages the relationship between the two types, and the way values
    are stored in scalars, rather than working with a particular data
    type.

    I think this belongs under Scalar:: because the API is determined
    by the structure of scalars rather than by the structure of the
    numeric data types.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Wed Jan 17 11:31:03 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Scalar::
::Number          adpfp numeric aspects of scalars                   ZEFRAM
