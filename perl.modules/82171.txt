     why:

    I have written a perl module that uses XS to interact directly with
    the WMI library that is used by the wmic binary from the Zenoss WMI
    code. That binary is currently used by the check_wmi_plus.pl Nagios
    plugin, and the module is designed to eliminate the extra fork
    overhead by keeping the WMI calls directly within Perl. I plan to
    make the module available on CPAN for anyone who needs it, as the
    author of check_wmi_plus.pl is planning on integrating it into his
    code.

    For reference, I was planning on calling the module WMIClient, and
    have it export 1 function (wmiclient), but I'll be double-checking
    that per the PAUSE FAQ before I release anything.

    Thanks!
