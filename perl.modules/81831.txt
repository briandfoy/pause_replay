The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Services
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Reusable Services like Logging, Connectivity
  userid:      SBLANTON (Sean Blanton)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    mailinglists, chatrooms, github

  similar:
    App, App::Framework, POE::Component, Bread::Board

  rationale:

    Not sure about the module chapter - 003_Development_Support. If
    that means supporting people who are writing Perl programs by giving
    them generic components so they don't have to go through the hell
    that I went through, then that's it.

    The goal of providing generic services (logging, object store, ssh
    and db connectivity) for applications performing a variety of tasks,
    suggests the App:: namespace. It is similar in this respect to
    App::Context/App and App::Framework, which use the same namespace.

    Like POE::Component, it seeks to provide reusable core
    functionality and I consider that functionality to be a service,
    hence App::Services::*

    Unlike POE::Component and App::Framework, App::Services will not
    lock you into a particular framework. It is heavily based on
    Bread::Board and Moose, so it will require those dependencies.

    Maybe it's a bit ambitious to take such a generic namespace (App
    really polluted that top level, didn't it?), but it is an accurate
    description without having a really long multilevel namespace (maybe
    that's where Perl needs to go - how will we expand to 200,000
    modules?).

    Thanks for your time and consideration. Sean Blanton Finally my
    first module request!
