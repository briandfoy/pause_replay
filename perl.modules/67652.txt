Hello,

It was brought to my attention that I was using Acme wrong. I have three
modules there which were placed there because I thought it was a generic
namespace, and am seeking input for better locations.

Acme::CSV - Simple CSV manip functions
I found this one years ago and much preferred its simplicity to the other
stuff I could find on CPAN, so I got in touch with its original author and
he let me put it there. It's a purely functional module.

Acme::Shell - Interactive Perl 5 shell
I just really wasn't sure where to put this. It's a persistent shell for
Perl, like "irb" for Ruby. I could not find any other projects which just
glued Term::ReadLine to Lexical::Persistence in the manner I wanted to, so
this module is the result.

Acme::Noisemaker - Visual noise generator
This is a purely functional module which outputs various types of fractal
noise sets.

In addition, I searched for my name on the list, and saw an older message
from April which I missed because I was not receiving mail to my
cpan.orgaddress at the time. Someone asked if my project "OP" could
possibly use a
more descriptive and longer name. OP is a class prototyping framework,
similar to Moose and several other distributions with weird names, but
specifically written as an object persistence layer. Its name is a multiple
acronym and its brevity reflects its use... but like I said, I am open to
suggestions, for any of my modules, and I probably should have solicited
comments sooner.

Thank you for your suggestions.
