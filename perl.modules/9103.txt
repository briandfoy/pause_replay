It is a problem, and I belive it will remain so because some people
just don't know how to package things.

Take a look at these

http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=perl_ste
http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=IO::Socket

The problem is not people uploading competing modules, but including
others modules in thier own distributions instead of using a bundle.
Without the protection we have, trying to install Net::FTP or
IO::Socket (and I guess there are many many more) will result in
installing a dist that really should have been a bundle.

IMO, the controls that PAUSE has for determining a distribution from a
package name should stay.
