Greetings, Modules Group:
I am about to upload a module that is a wrapper around the GCTPc 
library.  What this module does is convert coordinates from one map 
projection to another.  It is currently named Cartography::Projection, 
but I am thinking perhaps it should be renamed to Cartography::GCTP so 
that it would be named after the underlying C library.  The advantage 
is that the name would not clash with future projection libraries that 
people may write, the disadvantage is that not everyone knows what GCTP 
is.  Do you have any thoughts on this?
