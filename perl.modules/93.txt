I'd prefer a name below Exporter:: or Alias:: and not a root level
namespace, either Exporter::Import or Exporter::Importer. Or I'd even
prefer to have it split into two modules with one doing the aliasing,
maybe Alias::Package and the other one does the globbing in @INC,
maybe Alias::Package::WholeSale or some such (the latter being meant
ironic but without a smiley).

If you'd split it into two, I'd expect, people would be less annoyed
by the invention. I personally regard only the wholesale directory
importing stuff as misguided, but I'm not going to repeat the
arguments that have already been said about that.

This question always arises when somebody exports or when somebody
imports, so I'd like to keep Exporter as the top level.

We are not talking about including, we are talking about namespace
sharing which is quite a normal thing in the perl world.

I believe this doesn't count as a strong argument.
