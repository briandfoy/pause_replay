I forgot to mention there's also Meta::Lang::Pod::DocBook which does the
job. The downsides of this module  is that users have to install all of
Meta which means quite a few pre-reqs (although power users will
probably have many of the pre-reqs installed).

I discussed my idea with Mark Veltzer (author of Meta) a few weeks ago.

So i've got two options of a base:

1) Meta::Lang::Pod::DocBook
2) Pod::XML

The advantage of using 1) is that it can already do the job, so it might
just be a case of doing a code review and maybe adding an extra feature
or two... or maybe just repackaging.

The "disadvantage" of 1) is that i'd have to have a license of GPL only.
Not GPL and Artistic which i think eq 'same terms as perl itself'. I'd
kinda prefer to go the 'same terms as perl itself' route, but since i
don't know the licenses that well i've got no fundamental objection to
GPL only... perhaps i'm just being stubborn. I'd be interested to hear
other views [no attempt to start a flame war here tho!]

The advantage of using 2) is that Matt's stuff is usually great and it's
under the 'standard' license. 

The only shame (and this is really an implementation issue) is that from
my early impressions i might have to do a bit of a cut-n-paste job
rather than inhertience... although on second thoughts..if i go down the
2) route i should mail Matt and ask him if he'd be happy to accept
patches to factor out some of the hard coding
