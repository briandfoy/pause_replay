Request to register new user

fullname: Florian Merges
  userid: FMERGES
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I am writing a simple interface to PGPLOT, so that one can do
    simple graphic plotting without knowing all the functions of the
    PGPLOT library, but also allowing the user to make any call to the
    PGPLOT library directly for advanced features or low level access.

    And more things everytime I find something missing on CPAN that I
    can do or need for my work.
