The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Apple::Profile
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Create & manage Apple Configuration Profiles
  userid:      AKKORNEL (A. Karl Kornel)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://prepan.org/module/nY2FAS627N9

  similar:
    Mac::PropertyList

  rationale:

    Apple provides users with a way to configure Apple devices (running
    iOS or Mac OS X) using ready-made configuration files, which Apple
    calls Configuration Profiles. This suite of Perl modules is intended
    to aid people who would like to generate their own configuration
    profiles, without having to mess around with the XML themselves.

    These modules use Mac::PropertyList to write out the XML. My
    modules add functionality by giving the users a framework tailored
    to configuration profiles. I also perform validation of client
    input, making sure that numbers are numbers, making sure that all
    required items are present, etc..

    I brought up this release in perl.module-authors (under the subject
    line "Correct placement for modules for making Apple Configuration
    Profiles") and PrePAN (available at
    http://prepan.org/module/nY2FAS627N9). I didn't get many comments,
    but one comment I did get suggested placing my modules in Config::.
    I did not want to do Config::Profile, because that was too generic,
    so I chose Config::Apple::Profile.

    I did consider requesting Apple::Profile (or something similar),
    but it seems like those types of namespaces (Mac::, Win32::, etc.)
    are for modules that only run on those platforms, whereas my modules
    can run on Linux, BSD, etc. (as long as the prerequisites are
    installed).

    The repository is on Github, at
    https://github.com/akkornel/Config-Apple-Profile

The resulting entry would be:

Config::Apple::
::Profile         adpOp Create & manage Apple Configuration Profiles AKKORNEL
