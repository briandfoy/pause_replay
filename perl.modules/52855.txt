The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Modem
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface modems and other AT based devices
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.announce

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is an already released module, present on CPAN from 3/4 years.
    The initial module registration never went through...

    DESCRIPTION

    Device::Modem class implements basic AT (Hayes) compliant device
    abstraction. It can be inherited by sub classes (as Device::Gsm),
    which are based on serial connections. Things Device::Modem can do

    * connect to a modem on your serial port * test if the modem is
    alive and working * dial a number and connect to a remote modem *
    work with registers and settings of the modem * issue standard or
    arbitrary AT commands, getting results from modem

    Things Device::Modem can't do yet

    * Transfer a file to a remote modem * Control a terminal-like (or a
    PPP) connection. This should really not be very hard to do anyway. *
    Many others...

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::Modem           RdpOp Interface modems and other AT based devices  COSIMO
