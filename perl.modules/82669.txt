     why:

    I would love to contribute back to the community after being a Perl
    monk since ~10 years. Strong passion for code, in love with OOP,
    code golfer in the free time. Did bunch of work for a POE::Wheel
    that allows the Device::Gsm being used in an event driven
    environment (usage: SMS Gateway in/out, call handling), lot's of
    modules for various web service APIs flying around as well.
