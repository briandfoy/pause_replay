The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Simpy::API
  DSLIP:       cdpOo
  description: Simpy (social bookmarking) service API
  userid:      BEADSLAND (Beads Land)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/simpyapi,
    http://www.transpartisanmeshworks.org, simpy-dev@yahoogroups.com,
    transpartisanmeshworks@yahoogroups.com

  similar:
    Other than two misspellings of "simply" in CPAN, does not appear to
    be addressed yet.

  rationale:

    Although the Simpy project on SourceForge.net is titled "SimpyAPI",
    it seems to me that Simpy::API is more in keeping with Perl module
    naming conventions, and will allow for the creation of other
    Simpy-connected or Simpy-derivative modules in future (already
    contemplating a Simpy::Session object for persistent storage of data
    retrieved through Simpy::API).

    No attempt has yet been made to develop a Perl module for Simpy. As
    it stands there are only modules in Java (1.1), Python (0.1), and
    PHP (0.1) (all of which have their CVS repositories hosted as part
    of the umbrella sourceforge project). Development of the Perl
    Simpy::API would run concurrently with development of the other
    language packages for the API.

    Distributing production versions of Simpy::API through the CPAN
    module list would be consistent with current best practices in Perl
    development, and would expose the Simpy::API module to use by a
    wider community of Perl developers than availability through
    SourceForge.net alone, thereby creating a more robust feedback cycle
    to continuously improve both the Simpy::API Perl module and the
    Simpy API more generally.

The resulting entry would be:

Simpy::
::API             cdpOo Simpy (social bookmarking) service API       BEADSLAND
