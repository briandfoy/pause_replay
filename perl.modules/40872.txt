     why:

    I've been working with Perl for awhile, but haven't (yet) put
    anything into the CPAN.

    I have a couple pieces of code that may be suitable.

    One is a generic object with getter/setter methods that I use with
    Class::DBI, Session.pm and all that web application stuff. I'm
    calling the pieces Object::Generic, Object::Generic::False, and
    Object::Generic::Session.

    The other is "vector" of floats with a perl-ish interface, written
    with inline C, overloading, and all that. It's at least useful as a
    demo of the techniques. I'm not sure where it should be in the cpan
    namespace yet, but its under Math/Vector in files.

    The current state of both of these is visible at
    http://cs.marlboro.edu/code/perl/modules/
