Hi Reiner,

The 'problem' is that PAUSE now considers package names =
case-insensitively when resolving permissions.

The Finance::Quant module defines a package =E2=80=98chart=E2=80=99, so =
SANTEX got ownership of =E2=80=98chart=E2=80=99, and now when you try to =
upload something with =E2=80=98Chart=E2=80=99, it=E2=80=99s the same =
permission that=E2=80=99s being checked. And because someone else has =
permission for that package, the indexing step fails.

I=E2=80=99ll raise an issue on Finance-Quant, and ask Hagen to refactor =
his dist to use package names under Finance::Quant::*. Once he=E2=80=99s =
done that he=E2=80=99ll need to delete all releases from CPAN that =
contain the =E2=80=98chart=E2=80=99 package, then free up the permission =
or transfer it to you.

Please bear with us while I try to get this resolved as quickly as =
possible.

Neil
