I believe that the copyright transfers to the deceased's estate, which 
would mean his family.

If it's been a respectful amount of time since their death (over a 
year?) perhaps a polite tactful letter to the family asking for 
permission to change the license would suffice.

Or alternatively, just change it yourself on the practical assumption 
that nobody would ever come after you for it...
