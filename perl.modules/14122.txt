I apologize for the delay in getting back to you, but I am not real
sure how I am supposed to reply to modules@perl.org (a closed list)
since I didn't even know you had posted a comment about School::
until Friday.

Anyhow, I am forced to contact you directly, please excuse this
intrusion if this method of contact was not appropriate - if there
is a preferred communication procedure please let me know of it.

I am wondering, do you mean:

"A pragma usually conveys non-essential information, often intended
to help the compiler to optimise the program."

The fact the the module name appears in lower-case is strange as I
posted it like "School::"

To answer your first question "How will this help" -

The intent is to distribute, in module or DocSet format, a series
of Perl How-Tos (not just my ideas regarding How-To, but the module
Namespace can be a WIKI - so it will be a complete set examples
(not fragments.)

The various modules on CPAN are generally written in the spirit of
TIM-TOADY which my research has shown to prove disenchanting to new
learning of Perl - especially when some have little or no
programming back ground (much like me when I first started in 1996.)

I realize there is already a couple of places (like beginners and
cgi-beginners) - Seriously, do you feel those lists are helping?

I propose a very BASIC Perl-Baby talk series, then follow up with a
grade school approach, etc.

Each 'series" to be completely self-contained.

Anyhow, I do appreciate your efforts and especially your time in
considering my proposal.

Thank you/Bill :)
