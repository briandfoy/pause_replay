     why:

    Interested in building on HTTPD::Bench::ApacheBench to include
    Chart::Plot functions and easier data access methods. I am also
    emailing the Author to see if he is still maintaining it, I like the
    principle of what he did and haven't found anything similar and
    would like to take on its maintenance, if possible.
