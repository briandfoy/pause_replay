Hi,
I have written an extension that wraps the MPFR (multiple precision 
floating point arithmetic) library functions, and also provides operator 
overloading.

For details of the MPFR library see:
http://www.loria.fr/projets/mpfr/mpfr-current/mpfr.html

I plan to upload this module to cpan as Math::MPFR.

Since the MPFR library depends upon the GMP library ( 
http://www.swox.com/gmp ) I guess one could make some sort of argument 
that my module should be called Math::GMP::MPFR. I don't believe it's a 
  good argument as my module has very little to do with the Math::GMP 
module (which deals solely with integers). The only conection is that a 
small few of the Math::MPFR functions can take Math::GMP objects as 
arguments.

I am, however, no expert on namespace appropriation - hence this post - 
a copy of which has been sent to comp.lang.perl.modules.

Cheers,
Rob
