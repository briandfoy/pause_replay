I just have scheduled the uploaded 0.01 version of BSD::setproctitle for
deletion and hereby revoke my namespace registration request!
Actually the modules functionality is already built into Perl.
Assigning to $0 does utilize setproctitle(3) where available.
It's documented in perlvar but somehow I was thinking too "shellish"
and missed it. ;-/
Searching CPAN, and grepping Perl manpages was not good enough.
I should have grepped the Perl sources or perllib's symbol table!
Next time I'll try to do my pre-upload homework better.

BTW Sys::Proctitle is obsolete. Setting the process title by assigning
to $0 is supported on Linux too.

   Martin
