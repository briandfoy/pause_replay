The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Server:::Brick
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple pure perl http server for prototyping
  userid:      AUFFLICK (Mark Aufflick)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org, perlmonks.org

  similar:
    HTTP::Server::Simple, HTTP::Daemon::App HTTP::Server::Singlethreaded

  rationale:

    HTTP::Server::Brick allows you to quickly wrap a prototype web
    server around some Perl code. The underlying server daemon is
    HTTP::Daemon and the performance should be fine for demo's, light
    internal systems, etc.

    Over the past few years I've spent quite a bit of time noodling
    about with Ruby based web code - whether Rails or super cool
    continuation stuff - and it's always easy to get a prototype up and
    serving thanks to WEBrick (the pure-Ruby server that's part of the
    standard Ruby distribution). I've never found it quite as easy to
    throw together such a prototype in Perl, hence YASHDM (yet another
    simple http daemon module).

    HTTP::Server::Brick is not a clone of WEBrick - it's "in the style
    of" WEBrick like those movies in the discount VHS bin are "in the
    style of Lassie": The good guys get saved, the bad guys get rounded
    up, but the dog's never quite as well trained...

    To be more fair, I have just taken the ideas I have used (and
    liked) when building prototypes with WEBrick and implemented them in
    (what I hope is) a Perlish way.

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::Server:::
