Hi,

I found this address on cpan.org searching for advise on how to 
distribute a modified Module.
In my case, I have made some modifications on IO::LCDproc which was 
initially developed by Juan C. Muller.

Should I distribute it under a new name or would it be better to update 
it somehow!?


Thanks in advance for your reply.


Regards,
René Weber
