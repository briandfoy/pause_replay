     why:

    I work on the Media Cloud project (http://mediacloud.org) at the
    Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard. Media Cloud allows
    automated downloading and analysis of on-line media. It is intended
    to automate what was previously a tedious process of painstaking
    manual content analysis.

    Although the software is open source and available on Source Forge
    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mediacloud/), I am interested in
    making pieces of it into separate modules so that the wider Pearl
    community can benefit.

    Possible pieces of Media Cloud code that could be broken out into
    separate modules include RSS discovery routines and code to extract
    article text from an HTML page while removing ads, navigation, and
    other cruft.
