     why:

    At the very least, I'd like to update/fork Bloom::Faster. I have my
    own module that I'm using in production called BloomFilter, which
    started from Bloom::Faster (to keep my sysadmin sane, I renamed it).

    I have tried contacting the original developers in many, many ways.
    And they have sort of disappeared after they left Ask.com. There are
    just so many feature and fundamental changes from Bloom::Faster it's
    hard to explain all of them, but the first bugfix is that my version
    compiles/installs on 64-bit machines.

    In addition to this module, there have been a few other
    encryption/algorithm modules that I've been toying with. And I'm
    finally starting to understand XS (actually, no...it's a crazy
    mess).
