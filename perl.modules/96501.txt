     why:

    I used perl for many years, usually I just use the modules on cpan,
    but when I tried to ping 10,000 servers with async ping module on
    cpan, none of them really worked. It isnâ€™t so hard, I just wrote the
    code by myself in perl. I have made the perl library locally, and I
    think other people could benefit from it.
