Well, yes... I truly got it all reversed...

Considering that Integrator::Module::Build comes bundled with two other
modules (Integrator::Test::ConfigData and
Integrator::Test::TAP::Model::Patch), I thought it would be nice and
clean to group the whole thing under Integrator.

But it now looks like I would have to go with:

Module::Build::Integrator
Test::ConfigData
Test::TAP::Model::Integrator

But then, what I did with Integrator::Test::TAP::Model::Patch is nothing
to be proud of. I should probably have asked for a patch with an
activation switch in the code and rely on a fresh version in my
'requires' for Module::Build::Integrator. Do you believe this is
something that would be possible/good/welcomed ?

Test::ConfigData is not much better: it is a blatant hack to pass serial
numbers, measurements and files into TAP format, something I perceived
to be in violation of the design intent of the brave folks who brought
TAP to existence. Plus, ConfigData was another serious case of an
overnight hack that survived far more than expected/desired but I use it
*a lot* now. I don't really see this one fly anytime soon... What do you
think ?

All in all, it comes clear that I took the 'sweep it under the rug'
approach. But then the ideas in Integrator::Module::Build are now mature
and will stick around for a while (the Integrator framework is
definitely getting traction now), so I feel that there is a case for
putting things in the right format anyway...
