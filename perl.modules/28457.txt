I am thinking about a set of modules, tentatively named Data::Table::Simple 
which allows simple creation of "abstract" tables by specifying rows/columns 
and headers and supporting simple rotation, appending of tables.

This would be connected to another set of modules which names like 
Data::Table::WriteXXX where XXX is some format, such as HTML and TeX. 
Basically my needs are to easily create tables and then be able to output them 
in multiple formats.  Kind of like:

   my $table = new SomethingOrOther::WriteTeX;

   $table->add_header_row(qw( x y z));

   foreach (@calculation) {
     $table->add_row($x, $y, $z);
   }

   print $table->as_string;

Data::Table does not appear to suit these needs, since it's focus is on 
creating tables from different sources rather than outputting in different 
formats.

Table is an older version of Data::Table.

Text::Table appears only to handle text tables.  Likewise, for HTML::Table.

Other table modules deal with databases or with "tables" specific to files or 
applications.

Opinions, ideas, (especially in terms of naming this module!) would be 
appreciated.
