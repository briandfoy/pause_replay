sure you can.  i suggest registering those names while we figure out
how to name the base class.

Net::SMTP::Server looks like it hasn't been updated since 1999.  you
might be able to take over the development of that module (essentially

i don't think you need a separate namespace, although you think you
do because part of the namespace you should have is already taken.
i'd rather work that out then register a kludgey name.  :)
