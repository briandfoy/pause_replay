Hi

I'm afraid this isn't a Perl technical support channel, but a channel 
for module authors dealing with release issues to the CPAN.

But in general, you will need to install, or have installed, the modules 
you need to use.

Since you are working in a large corporate, this generally involves 
talking to your system or network administrator. Any system admin or 
network admin who works with Unix/Linux should be quite capable of 
installing the modules you need, or teaching you how to.

They also should be able to put you in contact with people inside the 
company that can teach you more.
