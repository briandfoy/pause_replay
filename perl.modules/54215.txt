Sorry for the late reply, but I just saw your message from the web archive.

I've extracted (and cleaned) that code from another code of mine. It looked
like something enough to be a module :) Time calculation is not perfect and
I' m using fixed values for day/month/year values (I'll add this to the
caveats section). 

DateTime pod says:

> The last example demonstrates that there will not be

> hours <=> minutes 
> seconds <=> nanoseconds

So, I can not get that output from DateTime. It recommends:
DateTime::Format::Duration, but this module also seems to suffer the same
fate. Since I'm using fixed values, this module's calculation is only an
approximation, and I can convert seconds to any other format unlike
DateTime. This may or may not be "right" from your point of view. I must
admit that I didn't search the possibility of some complex calculation very
well, and I may check the existence of DateTime or some other module and
enable it in a future release.

I also want this to be a multi-lingual module, and that's not supported with
DateTime and related modules AFAIK...

I guess this is okay, but I always do this with DateTime. :)
