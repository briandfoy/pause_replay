Hi Bastian, hi Jarkko,

In light of Jarkko's arguments, I have to admit I'd change my mind about 
this case. Maybe I've been doing the "namespaced advice/approval" game 
for too long. Can't keep up with the number of registrations and brain 
cycles are spread too thin :(

Besides, how can you argue with the master librarian? ;)

Cheers,
Steffen
