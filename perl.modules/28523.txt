The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Events
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Asynchronous IPC IO events object framework
  userid:      KARASIK (Dmitry Karasik)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    IO::Select IO::Event POE Event

  rationale:

    This is IO::Events, the module for using asynchronous IO in a
    event-driven loop around select(). The module contains predefined
    classes for standard IPC tasks, such as communicating with children
    and co-processes in read, write, and bidirectional fashion.

    Traditionally such tasks are solved with select() or IO::Select (
    IO::Multiplex, IO::Nonblocking, Event, POE, IO::Event lie very close
    ), and this module provides another high-level insight to the same
    functionality. See an example of encapsulation of standard line
    calculator 'bc' in a co-process in IO::Events/SYNOPSIS section.

    The module doesn't use any third party event loop modules such as
    Event or POE and is focused on IPC pipe IO, although sockets can be
    used straighforwardly.

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
