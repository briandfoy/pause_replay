Both CPANPLUS-0.056 and 0.0561 were uploaded to PAUSE without a 
META.yml.
This META.yml tells the indexer to skip files under inc/ and 
cpanplus/inc.

They are now *not* skipped and the indexer is pointing people to 
CPANPLUS
for the bundled files. I've scheduled both for deletion, and uploaded 
0.0562
with the proper META.yml file, and set all the bundled files to be 
re-indexed.

However, deleting seems to take at least 3 days (too long :( ) and 
re-indexing
is not allowed:

      module: IPC::Cmd
     version: 0.24
     in file: IPC-Cmd-0.24/lib/IPC/Cmd.pm
      status: Not indexed because
              CPANPLUS-0.0561/lib/CPANPLUS/inc/IPC/Cmd.pm in
              K/KA/KANE/CPANPLUS-0.0561.tar.gz has the same version
              number and the distro has a more recent modification time.

How do i correct this *now* so that users are pointed to the right 
package
for downloading the bundled modules?
