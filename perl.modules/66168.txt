The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Twitter::ZenTwitter
  DSLIP:       adpfb
  description: An implementation of the Twitter API
  userid:      ZEFONSECA (Jose M. A. Fonseca)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://zefonseca.com/blogs/zen/zen-twitter-perl-api/

  similar:
    http://search.cpan.org/search?query=twitter&mode=all

  rationale:

    The Twitter:: root namespace exists but did not yet offer a object
    representation of core Twitter data structures such as the User and
    the UserStatus(the heart of Twitter).

    Building on top of these 2 base structures I implemented the
    Twitter API with the exact same namespace as Twitter as documented
    at:

    http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation

    Example: the Twitter API Timeline methods documented on the apiwiki
    URL above map to Twitter::Timeline directly. Same for all the other
    REST functions.

    So Timeline public_timeline in REST becomes
    Twitter::Timeline::public_timeline method in Perl.

    The entire REST API is implemented and tested through the scripts
    on the "Zen Twitter Tools" distribution.

    See version 0.12 of Zen Twitter Tools for a set of scripts that
    will use the CPAN distribution. I will be uploading the
    Twitter-0.12.tar.gz immediately after the submition of this form.

    Until version 0.11 the modules used a local ./lib directory, not a
    centrally installed CPAN module set.

    Currently the only part of the Twitter API not implemented has been
    the JSON-only Trends section of Twitter Search. Apparently, the
    Twitter search was a separate system that is still being integrated
    into the REST API. This causes names to be different and I still did
    not map the trends. As an example of still-to-integrate, the User
    returned in searches is not a Twitter::User as returned by all the
    other User-related functions.

    All methods on this proposed Twitter:: lib use a standard interface
    to call Twitter's services which can be reused by all future CPAN
    modules needing to call Twitter services.

    Example: Any future twitter.com/ETC/SERVICE.xml can be passed to
    the Twitter::HTTP get() and post() and the return hashref will be
    standard.

    I hope this set of modules offers a base on which we can proceed
    building Twitter support for Perl. The current attempts are a bit
    scattered, perhaps we can unify it all.

The resulting entry would be:

Twitter::
