Hello, PAUSE/CPAN people,

After the Parse::Yapp adventure, I'm seriously thinking of
writing a flex-like lexer in pure Perl, so it could be easily
embbeded with yapp parsers.

Unlike Parse::Lex, which is already registered and relies on
Perl's NFA engine, it would be a complete rewrite of a DFA
lexer, which would provide more deterministic lexing (the
order of patterns don't really matter and it would naturally
match the longuest expression) and it could input either from
strings and files. I'd try too to make it fully OO, so it will
be easily embeddable in other modules too.

By now it is just a project, but I already solved (on the paper)
the major issues, so it's now just a matter of time to write it
out (I already get the parser and NFA build partly running).

So I would like to register a namespace for it. Parse::Lex would
have been the right name I think, but as it is already registered,
I'm thinking of Parse::Flex to reflect it's strong relationship
whith flex. Or maybe Parse::DFALex. Or Parse::DLex. But I really
prefer Flex.

Of course it's DSLI would be 'cdpO' and it's short description
something like:

Generates "à la flex" OO DFA lexer modules

What do you think about it ?

Thanks for your time,

François Désarménien
