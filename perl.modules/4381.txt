Description: Initially, a module that allows access to Collabra's access
control functions.  Collabra is Netscape's hack of inews, with access
control and a (horrible) web interface.  This module allows direct access
to those functions (using LWP::UserAgent et al) so that you don't have to
suffer through Netscape's crufty JavaScript.

Eventually, we have a fairly large set of perl modules which provide
the back end for the my.monash portal (http://my.monash.edu/) which
will be submitted.  However, these will probably need some adjustments
to fit in to the CPAN hierarchy (many are fairly localised at the moment).

Thanks,
Nate
PS: Searching the archive seems to indicate no reference to Collabra
so far...
