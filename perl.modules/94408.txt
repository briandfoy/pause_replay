     why:

    I developed a lot of scripts to automate tasks related to the tools
    that I manage in my company. Most of the tools are automation to CA
    Toolset (Spectrum, CAPC, NFA, etc). I also have scripts to allow
    integration between Spectrum and Remedy, and many other tools I've
    used in my job. I'm converting them to modules and would like to
    contribute them.
