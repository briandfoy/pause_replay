I discovered that mail to this list goes out on the Web.  In fact,  
Google lists the "I am JKEGL" thread as the 6th hit under my name.

Anyway, I put my email address in one of the "I am JKEGL" mails and  
it got repeated throughout the thread.  The cat may already be out of  
the bag, I suppose, but can you hide that thread, or just edit out my  
email address?

I'm making all sorts of pleasant discoveries about CPAN, by the way.   
Like, when I put development releases out there, they get  
automatically tested for implementation-dependent boo-boos.  Cool!

thanks, jeffrey kegler
