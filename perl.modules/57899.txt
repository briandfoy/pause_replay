Yes.

I've looked at several of these since my last post.  Nothing, I can find
compares favourably with Class::Struct in terms of ease-of-use.

Proper OO: it turns perl into python in a very minimal way; a public
constructor, 2 protected, and 3 private (in java-speak) methods.

Obviously that's a religious statement.  I started looking seriously at
python about 2 years ago but perl is imbedded in my brain.  Python is
still too much work for me to use easily.

Anyhow, a single module doesn't need a namespace.  I finished a 0.1 this
morning and I will post it under the namespace I wish to use.  I am
going to set up a web-site and git repository before I do this so I will
get back to this list shortly (days rather than weeks) before I post it
on CPAN.
