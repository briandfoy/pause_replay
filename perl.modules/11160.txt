Unless, of course, someone does *main::DEBUG = sub { ... } from their
module. Of course, this is "asking for it", but so is your example.

My docs also imply that this is incorrect usage. It wouldn't make sense to
place "use define DEBUG => 0" inside of a module. Modules shouldn't "use
define", rather they should "no define", and let the user decide if s/he
wants other values compiled in.
