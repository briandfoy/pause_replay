Hi Adam,

Thanks for getting back to me, I'll try to give you a concise overview.

The system is designed to launch, control and monitor unix based
processes, it's currently tested and deployed on solaris but should run
on any of the system V based unixes and I can't see why it wouldn't work
on BSD (but as I come from a test back ground I won't make any claims I
haven't put through a test cycle)

The system can optionally gather STDOUT and STDERR from the process, it
can also monitor log files. Notifications are either by email, or by
watchdog file (which is the prefered method here for interfacing with
tivoli)

Extending notificaitons would not be difficult for anyone that wants
more functionality.

DSA key authentication is built in (as all processes run with the
daemon's UID connecting to it needs to be secured)

I'll admit it's a fairly simple concept, and one that has been solved in
various ways by other systems - I've had to implement solutions for this
before and usually only had a very small amount of time to do it in so
they've been little more than hacks. This is the first time I've had
several weeks plus the resources of 2 test departments in order to do
this properly and I'd like others to be able to benefit from that
effort.

Modules in the program:

ProcessControl.pm - doesn't really do much code wise, contains the main
version string for the release and large pod containing end user guide
and sample simple script to use the suite as it is used here.
ProcessControl/Server.pm - Daemon process routines
ProcessControl/Client.pm - Command line client library
ProcessControl/Interfaces.pm - Communication between client and server -
kept separate to make it easy to add to other projects, eg a web front
end. ProcessControl/Instance.pm - The base class of the object used to
control and monitor each process and the workhorse of the system.
ProcessControl/Instance/LogFile.pm - a sub class of Instance that does
not run a process, but adds the same log file monitoring to an existing
proces

(there are other sub classes, but since they were written purely to run
interal ING applications they will not be released as would not be of
much use for anyone outside of ING - obviously others are more than
welcome to extend these)

If you would like any more information or detila please feel free to ask

Simon

It depends entirely on what it does :)

How about you elaborate.
