Hi,
Ingy has given me co-maintainership of Inline. At least, I can see that I'm 
specified as one of the maintainers at 
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Inline .

I now have a bugfix version of Inline (Inline-0.44_01) ready to be uploaded 
to CPAN, but it's not apparent to me just how I should upload it. As I 
understand it, Inline-0.44_01.tar.gz ought to be uploaded to INGY's 
directory. I don't want it showing up as an UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE in my own 
directory.

Is there somewhere that explains how I need to proceed ?

Cheers,
Rob
