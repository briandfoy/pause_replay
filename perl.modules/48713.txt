Subject: Module submission Test::Group

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Group
  DSLIP:       Rdpha
  description: Group together related tests in a test suite
  userid:      DOMQ (Dominique Quatravaux)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa@perl.org

  similar:
    Test::Class

  rationale:

    Test::Group is a Test::Builder companion module, like many other
    Test::* modules so I guess the choice of the name is pretty
    straightforward. What it does is to allow for the following syntax
    in a Test::More-style test suite:

    use Test::More tests => 1; use Test::Group;

    test "hammering the server" => sub { ok(I_can_connect);
    for(1..1000) { ok(I_can_make_a_request); } };

    which produces

    1..1 ok 1 - hammering the server

    Test::Class offers a similar functionality with the ":Tests" method
    attribute (introduced in version 0.10), but using it requires
    turning one's test suite into a full-blown object class. Test::Group
    is more on the quick-and-dirty side of things, providing some
    TIMTOWTDI to the task of refactoring a test suite.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Group           Rdpha Group together related tests in a test suite DOMQ
