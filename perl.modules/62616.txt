Hi Chris,

sorry it took so long to get back to you.

Ideally, the original author would step up, apply the patch or argue
against it. Barring that, I guess the only way to get the patch applied
is to do it yourself.

PAUSE policy dictates that people try to contact the authors of modules
in any reasonable way before we assign co-maintenance. Given that you
mailed Joshua and reported the bug a long time ago, I guess giving you
co-maintenance is in everbody's best interest.

Joshua, if you read this, please note that:
- We're not taking your primary maintainer status nor your module from you.
- All of this is reversible either by yourself (in your PAUSE menu,
"Making and unmaking co-maintainers") or by the PAUSE admins.
- If you have any questions, please let us know via modules@perl.org.

Best regards,
Steffen
