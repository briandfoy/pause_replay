uploaded English::Reference v 0.03

         The select box shows all the modules that have
         been registered for user JPIERCE officially via
         modules@perl.org, i.e. that are included (or about
         to be included) in the module list
         ...
         Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging
         to JPIERCE. Please note, only modules that are
         already registered in the module list can be edited
         here. If you believe, this is a bug, please contact
         modules@perl.org.

Despite what can be seen at
	http://cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/J/JP/JPIERCE/
namely
	Data::JavaScript::LiteObject
	English::Reference

And I am guessing the module meta data sectionis where I get
to say that English::Reference is v0.03 so
http://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
would be correct (instead of the 0.01 it lists...)

Or is there something wrong with PAUSE itself?

thanks!
