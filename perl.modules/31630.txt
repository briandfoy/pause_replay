This is Cory Johns, the original author of the Syntax::Highlight::Perl module. 
Unfortunately, I've lost access to my old email address and forgot to update my
CPAN account when it happened.  I'll look into updating my email address as
soon as I can, though my computer recently died, so it might take me a little
bit.

I honestly didn't realize that anyone was actually using that module, much less
that there was a mod_perl wrapper.  :)  I had originally written it mostly as a
learning exercise, but I'm glad if people actually found it useful (and
endurable, efficiency-wise).

If David wanted to take over maintainence, I would be more than happy to allow
it to be transferred (not sure what the procedure would be, exactly).  Or, if
he would rather, I would be willing to include his changes myself if he could
send them to me or someone could point me to them.

Anyway, I apologize for not being responsive to any emails that may have been
sent to my previous address.

Cory Johns
