contribution:  A script named tksort.  tksort is a Tk app that
demonstrates sorting algorithms graphically.  It also allows users to
import their own sort routines, without modification, and watch them
perform beside the standard algorithms.  After writing tksort, I wrote
a paper about the experience, and that paper has been accepted by the
2000 Perl Conference.
