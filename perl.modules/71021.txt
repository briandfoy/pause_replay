The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::ParallelSubtest
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: fork subtests to run in parallel
  userid:      NCLEATON (Nick Cleaton)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Fork Test::SharedFork

  rationale:

    Allows you to speed up a test script by running
    L<Test::More/subtest>s in parallel in forked children, and marshals
    the output and results so that your test script produces exactly the
    same output as it would if you ran the subtests one at a time.

    Test::Fork and Test::SharedFork don't keep the output from each
    child process separate, and neither is geared towards the
    one-subtest-per-child-process approach.

  enteredby:   NCLEATON (Nick Cleaton)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 28 18:05:25 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::ParallelSubtest bdpfp fork subtests to run in parallel             NCLEATON
