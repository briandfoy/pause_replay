I don't think it's too specific. I think Unicode::LineEnding might be
better.

The readline parts have been a Perl wishlist item seemingly forever.
People want to put a regex in $/. Whatever you come up with probably
will have applications beyound just Unicode newlines since you can give
the code any set of line endings.

The chomp would be nice for people using pre-5.10, although s/\R\z//
isn't too hard to type. ;)
