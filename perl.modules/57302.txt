Hi Jim,

I'm just replying to modules@perl.org and you directly, skipping 
module-authors.

I'm sorry, but this is not the right place to announce such changes. The 
modules@perl.org list is read mostly by the PAUSE admins and is intended 
as a place to ask about administrative CPAN or PAUSE issues. 
Additionally, we provide some help with namespace choice.

You could try to announce these changes in some more visible place like 
Perlmonks or use.perl.org. module-authors@perl.org is a better place as 
well.

Best regards,
Steffen
