The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Steam::Convert
  DSLIP:       am+fg
  description: Convert SteamIds
  userid:      FANK (Florian Kinder)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    chatrooms

  similar:

  rationale:

    The reason why i chossed "Steam" as a rootlevel namespace is that,
    i haven't seen a better root for it. And a lot of libraries will
    follow to make a easier handling for the "Steam" service. IF THERE
    IS A OTHER prefered rootlevel for it than let me know, i currently
    haven't found a better one.

    Here some reasons why i choosed Steam: - Steam::Convert -> this
    will convert informations can also be named "Convert::Steam" -
    Steam::Web::API -> this will handle the API communication can also
    be named -> "Net::Steam::API" And if more Steam Libraries will
    follow its crap if they have different root level.

The resulting entry would be:

Steam::
::Convert         am+fg Convert SteamIds                             FANK
