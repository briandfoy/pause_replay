The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::NDGOL
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Conway's game of life in N dimensions
  userid:      GUIDOPIAN (Steve Piantadosi)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I think that NDGOL is an appropriate namespace because it stands
    for N-Dimensional Game of Life. The module allows the user to run
    Conway's game of life in any number of dimensions (say, 2? 3? 45?)
    and it output the cells that are alive and dead. I think that it
    should be listed in the module list because it is the solution to a
    neat problem, that I'm sure many amateur and professional
    mathematicians would find very interesting--how to run a GOL
    simulation in an arbitrary number of dimensions. While it may not
    have a real use, it certainly is an interesting amusement to play
    with. If it's not listed in the module list, i doubt many people
    will search for such a toy--just because it's so strange and
    unique--but if it is there for people to browse through and see,
    people might become interested. Thanks. ++Steve
