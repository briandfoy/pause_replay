Hello!

Let me find out what failed with the uploading of the modules QtCore and QtGui on pause.cpan.org (http://cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/V/VA/VADIML/).
I uploaded them on 27th of January but they were not confirmed.

Perhaps, it happened because of the following:

Status: Permission missing
==========================

     module: MyApp
    version: undef
    in file: QtCore-4.000/examples/App2/MyApp.pm
     status: Not indexed because permissions missing. Visit PAUSE and
             click "View Permissions" to find the legitimate
             maintainer(s).

     module: Dialog
    version: undef
    in file: QtGui-4.000/examples/dialog/standarddialogs/Dialog.pm
     status: Not indexed because permissions missing. Visit PAUSE and
             click "View Permissions" to find the legitimate
             maintainer(s).

     module: Window
    version: undef
    in file: QtGui-4.000/examples/widgets/sliders/Window.pm
     status: Not indexed because permissions missing. Visit PAUSE and
             click "View Permissions" to find the legitimate
             maintainer(s).
....

But these modules are the examples of working with library and must not been indexed.
I would be grateful if you help me how to exclude the example catalogues from indexing, the more so that its amount will grow.

If the reason is something else, would be so kind to let me know.

    Sincerely yours,
    Vadim Likhota.
