Why not put that under WWW::YouTube?  Perhaps WWW::YouTube::Secrets or
WWW::YouTube::Config?

I'd stay away from anything to do with "My" since services tend to
launch personalization services called "My X".

Also, you don't have to register every package name that you want to
use. Once you upload to PAUSE, any module name the indexer hasn't seen
before will be assigned to you as "first-come". Now that you have
WWW::YouTube registered, you don't relly have to register anything else
for that. :)
