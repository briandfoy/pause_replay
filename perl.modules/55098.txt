     why:

    A Perl interface for creating STAF services. (They have support for
    Perl clients, not services) See STAF homepage:
    http://staf.sourceforge.net/index.php I want to name the module
    STAFService.

    Why no contribute to the STAF project? they are trying to basically
    do the same thing, but their way is connecting to a standalone Perl
    program, while I embed Perl inside the service.

    Thank you. Shmuel.
