Everything is simple. I see my module as a light-weight SSI directives
parser designed for heavily loaded sites. As a consequence it doesn't
require any additional modules, its functionality is very limited.
I don't plan a full implementation of all directives.
<!--#perl ... --> won't be supported for sure. Also, I haven't yet decided
if if/else structures will be supported. The main goal is the support of
base directives - exec and include. These are the main differences.

Maybe, as for now I should call the module CGI::SSI_Lite, but I think that
CGI::SSI_Parser fully reflects its goal.

Sorry for a late answer.
