Subject: Module submission Games::Dice::Probability
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Dice::Probability
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Calculate dice probabilities.
  userid:      JAD (Jason A. Dour)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    Games::Dice is an excellent set of tools for simulation of complex
    dice sets, but there was not an easy way to calculate probabilities
    or obtain distributions for those dice sets. While other math
    modules exist, they are not intuitive from a non-mathematician
    perspective. This module is meant to make it easy to do the complex
    math involved with probabilities for dice expressions. At present it
    does not integrate with Games::Dice or Games::Dice::Advanced dice
    expression objects, but my goal is to someday make it do so.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Dice::
::Probability     bdpOp Calculate dice probabilities.                JAD
