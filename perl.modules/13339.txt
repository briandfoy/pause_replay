Do what? Set env vars? Of course it should... if it's safe. But as you 
can see from the recent mod_perl thread about Oracle DBD not working 
with mod_perl 2.0 when %ENV was set in the registry script, since %ENV 
isn't tied to environ, because it's not thread safe. I wrote this module 
to debug the case, since I don't have Oracle to test with.

This module was only needed for getenv() and dumpenv() so those who 
don't know C can at least debug things. But I've generalized it and 
added setenv() and unsetenv() while I was at it.
