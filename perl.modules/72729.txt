Hi Abhijit

Can you please give me co-maint for B-Flags and optimizer?

I already uploaded some needed updates (5:10 and 5:14 support, ...),
but I want proper indexing because I need those modules in other modules 
also.
So far only me, Artur and Simon did any work on those.

B::Flags is optional for the core module B::Debug,
optimizer is needed to make any practical use of B::Generate.
p5p was questioning the practical usage of B::Generate, and refused some 
needed API's, so it would be better to have it maintained officially.
