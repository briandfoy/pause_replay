Hi!

I was wondering if i could get access to my old PAUSE account:

ADAVIES

registered at my old email account Alex.Davies@ti.com

I've also forgotten the password :-\ (I only used it
the once back in 1999!).

I'd like to upload the latest version of my script "peg".
The now ancient previously released version can be seen from:
 http://www.cpan.org/scripts/Search/index.html

It's a command line tool file search tool which is mostly
compatible with GNU grep, plus extra bells and whistles.
The new version benefits from being Windows friendly, runs faster,
can (automatically) handle encodings, colours output, with more
options than you want, plus the usual bug fixes.


Many thanks,

Alex Davies.
