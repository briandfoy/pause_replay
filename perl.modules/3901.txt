Heya, I'm looking for some naming ideas for the following module
(currently used internally at Emap). I haven't really got any good
ideas: Number::Page, Number::Pager?

NAME
    Emap::Page - a module to help when paging through sets of
    results

SYNOPSIS
      use Emap::Page;

      my $page = Emap::Page->new($total_entries, $entries_per_page, $current_page);

      print "         First page: ", $page->first_page, "\n";
      print "          Last page: ", $page->last_page, "\n";
      print "First entry on page: ", $page->first, "\n";
      print " Last entry on page: ", $page->last, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    When searching through large amounts of data, it is often the
    case that a result set is returned that is larger than we want
    to display on one page. This results in wanting to page through
    various pages of data. The maths behind this is unfortunately
    fiddly, hence this module.

    The main concept is that you pass in the number of total
    entries, the number of entries per page, and the current page
    number. You can then call methods to find out how many pages of
    information there are, and what number the first and last
    entries on the current page really are.
