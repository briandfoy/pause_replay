The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Cleanup
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Cleanup of old files or directories.
  userid:      BUDNEY (Leonard R Budney)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Maintenance, File::CleanupTask

  rationale:

    This module doesn't use the task-oriented structure of
    File::CleanupTask, and it's more specifically named than
    File::Maintenance. It implements features missing in
    File::Maintenance, such as cleanup of directories, and checking for
    "old" directories by confirming that nothing under that directory
    has been touched in the requisite time period. This module is
    intended for no purpose other than file cleanup.

  enteredby:   BUDNEY (Leonard R Budney)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb  5 21:27:43 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Cleanup         cdpOp Cleanup of old files or directories.         BUDNEY
