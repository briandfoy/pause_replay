Hi, Folks

Clint Moore (http://search.cpan.org/~cmoore/) has a nice module
(Archive::Any) that includes a broken test. Something really easy to
correct: a test POD coverage that is not properly skipped if
Test::POD::Coverage is not installed. Also, as you might guess, this
module is not in the dependencies. Thus, sometimes the installation of
this module fails.

Now, what is the problem? The release is from September 2006.
A ticket was opened on Fri Jan 05 10:27:33 2007. Since them, different
people added comments and patches to the ticket.

I am trying to contact Clint by mail (using the CPAN mail). How much 
should we wait before shooting up a fixed version up to CPAN?

Cheers
Alberto
