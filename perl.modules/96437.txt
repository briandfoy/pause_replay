Subject: Abuse of CPAN: Net-FullAuto-1.0000327

CPAN Librarians,

The author of Net-FullAuto-1.0000327 has continued, for two years, to
upload an inexorable stream of incomprehensible drivel.

CPAN is being abused here; there is no meaningful attempt to create
anything useful.

CPAN guidelines for authors are not being followed.

The Makefile.PL can only be characterised as malicious.

The author seems impervious to savage reviews, so clearly he is not
employed anywhere where reputational damage might have some measurable
effect on salary and career prospects.

IMHO, this is one of those rare occasions where robust action by CPAN
librarians would be fully justified.

As a minimum, authors maintainer rights over Net-FullAuto should be removed
to prevent further uploads, and existing versions deleted.

Longer term there may be value in rate-limiting uploads to an average of 10
per distro per year.  Sufficient to recover from the occasional mishap, but
strict enough to persuade legitimate authors to test stuff properly before
uploading and CPAN spammers to lose interest.


Dick Franks
