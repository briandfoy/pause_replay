The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Redirect
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: redirect|duplicate FH and restore them
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I found myself redirecting STD* and FH's and then restoring them
    and made this module to simplify it.

    Previously it was an ugly tied interface, but based on suggestions
    and use I made an OO version that works like so:

    use IO::Redirect;

    my $ior = IO::Redirect->new();

    my $verbose;

    print "Starting Loud stuff...\n";

    $ior->redirect_stdout(\$verbose); $ior->redirect_stderr(\$verbose);

    # do funtion you can't control it # printing to STDERR or STDOUT
    like a CPAN:: funtion

    $ior->un_redirect_stdout(); $ior->un_redirect_stderr();

    print "Done\n"; print "Vebose: $verbose\n" if $DEBUG;

    ### $ior->redirect($fh, $fh_to); my $fh_copy =
    $ior->duplicate($fh);

    ###

    open my $debug_fh, '<', './nooutput_debug_info' or die $!;
    $ior->redirect_stdout($debug);

    print "foo\n"; pritn STDERR "bar\n";

    # now when run in terminal there is no output in the terminal but
    it is in the file for review.

    Currently it works with open()'s FH and STD* with special methods
    for the STD*s.

    Eventually I'd like to add funtionality for other IO:: handles or
    add similar funtionality as a subclass of said modules depending on
    what makes sense.

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::Redirect        RdpOp redirect|duplicate FH and restore them       DMUEY
