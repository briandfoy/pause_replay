The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DTS
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl classes to access Microsoft SQL Server
  userid:      ARFREITAS (Alceu Rodrigues de Freitas Junior)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Quoting the module documentation:

    "DESCRIPTION Although it's possible to use all features here by
    using only Win32::OLE module, DTS (being more specific, it's childs
    classes) provides a much easier interface (pure Perl) and
    (hopefully) a better documentation. Since it's build over Win32::OLE
    module, DTS will only work with Active Perl distribuition running in
    a Microsoft Windows operational system.

    The API for this class will give only read access to a package
    attributes. No write methods are available are directly available at
    this time, but could be executed since at each DTS object created a
    related object is passed as an reference to new object. This related
    object is a MS SQL Server DTS object and has all methods and
    properties as defined by the MS API. This object reference is kept
    as an "private" property called _sibling and generally can be
    obtained with a get_sibling method call. Once the reference is
    recovered, all methods from it are available.

    The DTS class does not much: it will server only as an interface
    class, since it cannot be instancied or the available methods be
    called directly (as an abstracted class). The inheritance will help
    only to make available easier (and globally) access to the methods
    kill_sibling and get_sibling.

    Why having all this trouble? You may be asking yourself why having
    all this trouble to write such API as an layer to access data
    thought Win32::OLE module.

    The very simple reason is: MS SQL Server 2000 is terrible to work
    with (lots and lots of useless indirection), the documentation is
    not as good as it should be and one has to convert examples from it
    of VBScript code to Perl.

    DTS API was created to provide an easier (and more "perlish") way
    to fetch data from a DTS package. One can use this API to easially
    create reports or implement automatic tests using a module as
    Test::More (see EXAMPLES directory in the tarball distribution of
    this module)."

    "DTS" looks the most obvious option for namespace, having sublevels
    on it's own (for example, DTS::Task and DTS::Assignment::INI).
    Searching at http://search.cpan.org I was unable to identify any
    related namespace that could be used. I thought about using "MSSQL"
    but there are no such name. "Win32" is the next option, but I'm not
    sure if this namespace should be used, since it's related to general
    modules that works only in Windows OS. DTS module is directly
    related to MS SQL Server, not to Windows directly (although it uses
    the Win32::OLE to access MS SQL Server API).

The resulting entry would be:

DTS               bdpOp Perl classes to access Microsoft SQL Server  ARFREITAS
