You mean like XML::Simple? ;-) I don't see how I can fit the
"converter" part in the name, no other XML module does it.

Nothing? Then lets see what I can come up with.

The main point of the module is that the user can specify the
layout of the XML/perl data structures. The "Structured" in the
name was not to say that XML is structured, but that it creates
fixed perl data structures.

    XML::Fixed
    XML::Precise
    XML::Outlined
    XML::Determined
    XML::Defined
    XML::Arranged
    XML::Ordered

What do you think?

Cheers,
  Michael.
