The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::PW44
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: xkcd/936 style password generator
  userid:      BRIAND (Brian Dickson)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    water cooler

  similar:
    SKey (basis for dictionary), other password generators

  rationale:

    It's based on Crypt::SKey, which arguably generates passwords.

    PW44 means "PassWord generator, 44 bits strong".

    It creates random passwords which are very strong, but very easy to
    remember. See xkcd/936 for where the idea came from.

    It should eventually replace stoopid passwords (and corporate
    password policies) which do not provide adequate password strength.

    It is very cool. Enjoy.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::PW44            bdpfp xkcd/936 style password generator            BRIAND
