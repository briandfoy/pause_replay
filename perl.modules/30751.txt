Oops, sorry, wasn't reading your message closely enough.  You said that
you had already tried to contact the author, with no luck.  I misread
that the website wouldn't have been working.

I would try to contact him through his employer, the URL
http://www2.okisemi.com/us/docs/Home.html
seems to be working.
