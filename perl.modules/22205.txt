Dear modules@perl.org! Dear Andreas!

Could you please help me becoming a co-maintainer of namespaces Tcl and
Tcl::Tk?
Should I perform some steps in order to do that?

Previous maintainer, Malcolm Beattie seems to be not reachable right now.
I tried to contact him and I have not succeeded.

Besides, I sucessfully released few beta releases after that and I hope
those modules could be quite useful for some people (including me of
course). Also I am planning to do more releases of those.

Thanks in advance,
Vadim.
