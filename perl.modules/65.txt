That is a good goal. However, I'm not so sure that taking the Java approach
works. I reiterate my earlier suggestion:

use Alias qw(alias_package);
alias_package 'Really::Long::Namespaces::That::Programmers::Hate::To::Type'
=> RLNS;

(I bet that line gets wrapped somewhere :-)

Effectively this steals an idea from C++ (namespace ABC = DEF) instead of
from Java (import a.b.*).

I am against wholesale importing in principle, and this "everything
currently installed under this namespace" approach is a particularly extreme
example. Particularly as installing new modules could silently change the
effect. Imagine someone installing a new package XML::gotcha which included
an exported subroutine open. This would silently override the builtin open
for ANY module which did a use import 'XML::*'. That CAN'T be a good thing!
