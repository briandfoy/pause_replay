Hi Paul,

(originally sent to cpan@husk.org which bounces)

I don't know if you're still interested in maintaining File::Type -  
but if you're not I'd be happy to take over maintenance of it. I see  
a few outstanding bugs and I'd like to have a go at making it a  
little more memory efficient.

Let me know what you think :)
