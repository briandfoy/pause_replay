The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::Radio::Sirius
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Control Sirius satellite radio tuners
  userid:      JTATUM (Jamie Tatum)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, Sirius related forums

  similar:
    Audio::Xmpcr Audio::Radio::XM::PCR

  rationale:

    Sirius is a US based satellite radio service. Nearly all generation
    2.5 tuners can be connected to a computer via serial and USB. This
    module is designed to communicate with these tuners. XM is a
    competitive service and the PCR is their computer connected tuner.
    The XMPCR modules serve the same function but for XM. Sirius has a
    totally different protocol and there are a few fundamental
    differences between the two which would make a unified module
    difficult, and probably unneccesary since there's no reason you
    can't use one of the PCR modules and the Sirius module.

    Namespace was chosen based on the existing XM modules.

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::Radio::
::Sirius          adpOp Control Sirius satellite radio tuners        JTATUM
