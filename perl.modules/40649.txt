Subject: Module submission Grid::GridPerls

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Grid::GridPerls
  DSLIP:       bdphg
  description: Set of Grid Services, run with GSI on Apache
  userid:      AMERZKY (Andre Merzky)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    private CVS

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Grid Computing is an emerging paradigm for distributed computing,
    allowing to scale distributed systems over multiple administrative
    domains (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing)

    The modules to be added are based on SOAP::Lite, and provide some
    simple Grid enabled services for development tests. The services can
    run stand alone, or can be hosted via mod_perl on apache. The latter
    approach allows to integrate Grid Security (GSI) via mod_gridsite.

    GridPerls is just the name of the set of services we develop --
    seemed catchy :-)

    A new root namespace for Grids may seem overkill right now, but I
    am confident that content in that area will grow rapidly. Also, I am
    not sure where else to put them.

    If 'Grid' seems a bad term (its semantically overloaded *sigh*),
    GGF might be an option: the Global Grid Forum is the standardization
    body for Grid protocols/services/APIs (see http://www.ggf.org/)

    Please contact me on andre@merzky.net if you need more infos.

    Also, if a new root namespace entry seems a bad idea, I would
    welcome suggestions for module placement.

    Thanks, Andre.
