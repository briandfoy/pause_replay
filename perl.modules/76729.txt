We have a process, which I don't think will be a problem:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_04about#takeover

Since it's a ten year old release, I'm 99.996% confident that the
transfer won't be a problem, so set up your repo, do the work, and by
the time that all happens, the original author will have had a chance
to respond to either transfer the module, or not respond and we can do
it for you.
