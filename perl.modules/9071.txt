Tim,

I do not understand 'where' it is.
When I go to register the namespace, I get this:

ERROR: The submission didn't succeed due to the following reasons:
Module DBD::Multiplex has already been registered by DBIML.
Dist T/TI/TIMB/DBI-1.19.tar.gz, current version 0.2 has been uploaded by TIMB.
Please contact TIMB or choose a different namespace.

And when I log onto PAUSE and look for the module, I get this:

Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to TKISHEL.
Please note, only modules that are already registered in the module list can be
edited here.
If you believe, this is a bug, please contact modules@perl.org.

Yet my uploads exist:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/T/TK/TKISHEL/

So I am cc'ing modules@perl.org with this message.
