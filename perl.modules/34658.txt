I'd like to have permission to maintain Win32::Clipboard. What should
I do? My PAUSE ID is HIMAZU. As you can see, I'm a newbie to PAUSE.

A while back, I found a bug in Win32-Clipboard-0.51, the latest
version of Win32::Clipboard. Its GetBitmap() doesn't handle image data
properly except with 24 bit color bitmap.

I fixed it and informed that to the current owner, Aldo Calpini
<dada@perl.it>, a couple of times.

But Aldo hasn't responded so far. So I uploaded
Win32-Clipboard-0.52.tar.gz, but the PAUSE system rejected it since I
don't have permision. And I'm stuck now.

Regards,
Hideyo Imazu
