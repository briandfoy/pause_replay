Well, starting by saying that "I'm no lawyer, but..."

Unless you're claiming a patent or trade secret on the algorithm in
question, I don't see that you really have any complaint here.  There
are no lines copied from the C code to the Perl code.

In fact, the courtesy of a reference for the original algorithm source
is given just a few lines later in that same file.

Considering that the .pm file is released under the GPL (as well as
the Artistic license, which is even more free than the GPL), and that
proper acknowledgement was made, what greater remedy are you seeking?
