What a scam!

Friend,

Yesterday afternoon I was sitting in my lawyer's office waiting for my appointment, knowing I was going to be there for a while. You know how most lawyers say you have a 1:00 appointment, when that really means 2:30! Anyway, that's a different story.

Well, what happened is I picked up a copy of a well-known financial magazine. I won't list the name here, but I'm sure many of you know which one I'm referring to.

So I started flipping through the pages and noticed an article on some of the country's top fund managers. You know, the "financial geniuses" that everyone talks about on the 9 o'clock news.

They all looked like they were in their late 40's or early 50's and very sophisticated - wearing their 15K watches and 4K custom made suits. You know what I'm talking about - they looked like a million bucks! And rightfully so; some of their bonus checks - not salaries - are in the high eight figures. Tens of millions of dollars . . . over a quarter million per week. Not too bad, by anyone's standard! 

Needless to say, I was very interested and started reading more. Hey, maybe I could pick up some pointers from these financial masters!

As I started reading into the article, I noticed the last reporting of income they brought into the funds. It literally shocked the hell out of me!

Every single one of the "financial wizards" were at a loss.

Can you believe it??

They actually lost money. They get paid millions and millions of dollars to lose money.

YOUR money!

I just sat back in complete shock. I hope this doesn't sound like bragging, but I personally have helped my own clients bring in millions of dollars in profits on an investment of less than eighty dollars.

Take a look at this:

First of all, let's get one thing straight. What I'm about to tell you is real. Some of the skeptics out there might think I'm just making this up to sell you on something. Sorry, but I wouldn't risk my businesses, my real estate investing, my reputation, and face possible jail time to make up what I'm about to say. Not in a million years! 

Moving on - let me share with you an email I just received yesterday from a client of mine by the name of Steven, from the state of Texas.

He just closed his first flip and made twenty thousand!

He purchased a printed copy of my course, which is 97 bucks, and the return it gave him was twenty thousand. That's a return percentage of over 20,000! 

In this day and age, people are turning cartwheels in the streets if they get just 5 percent on their money. That really doesn't make sense to me; especially nowadays, when the "experts" are getting paid to lose your money! 

My point of this email is that no one knows for sure what the guys from the financial magazine do. With all the confusion, financial experts, and contradicting news reports, it's really no wonder why Americans are frozen and don't know where to start to invest and build wealth. Let me tell you something - it is everyone's right to have the opportunity to build a secure and rich financial future for themselves and their families.

Friend - it's your RIGHT!

So the solution is . . .

Learn to invest yourself. And I can't think of a more lucrative, easy way to do just that, other than real estate investing. Especially with today's economy, where stocks are getting killed and interest rates are at 40-year lows. NOW is the time for real estate.

Real Estate has always been and always will be America's #1 wealth builder - period. Millionaires and billionaires use real estate as a safe and profitable way to invest. You know, Ted Turner has one of the biggest portfolios of privately held land in the United States. If it's good enough for one of the richest men on the face of the earth - then it's certainly good enough for you and me!

Stop the worrying, stop the living from paycheck to paycheck! Friend, you owe it to yourself. My system has already been proven over and over again, and will continue to do so for hundreds of others this year. 

Will you be one of my next success stories?
