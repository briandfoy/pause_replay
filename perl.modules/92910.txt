Yes, I know. What do you suggest in trying to contact him aside from emaili=
ng
his CPAN address? This search -
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=3D%22kees+jan+hermans%22 yields a LinkedIn page t=
hat
appears to belong to him, but I cannot send him the so-called "InMail" beca=
use
this requires a premium (and paid) LinkedIn account. Does anyone here have =
that?

I can also try to contact his present workplace (the one that is mentioned =
on
the LinkedIn page).

Does anyone have a different suggestion?
