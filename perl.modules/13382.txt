The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Piece::MySQL
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: MySQL-specific functions for Time::Piece
  userid:      DROLSKY (Dave Rolsky)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    with Time::Piece author, Matt Sergeant, via email

  similar:
    Time::Piece, numerous date and time modules

  rationale:

    This is a very simple mixin class for Time::Piece which adds some
    handle MySQL-specific methods to Time::Piece, like
    "Time::Piece->from_mysql_datetime" and "$time->mysql_date". It's not
    very fancy but it's easier than typing the same strptime formats
    over and over.

  enteredon:   Fri Aug 23 15:34:53 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::Piece::
::MySQL           RdpOp MySQL-specific functions for Time::Piece     DROLSKY
