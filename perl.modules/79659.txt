Hi Team,
=20
Thanks for your suggestion.
=20
As per your suggestion i have added MQClient::MQSeries in my script. After =
that when i have tried to execute the script, it didn=92t connect to queue =
manager.
=20
Even it is not giving the proper completioncode and reason code, it is givi=
ng garbage value instead of the proper code.
=20
When i am printing below code, inside open Queuemanager function it is prin=
ting garbage value

<code>
      my $compCode =3D 0;
      my $Reason =3D 0;

      print "Inside openqueuemgr \n";
      my $qm_name =3D "QM.A108020";
      print "Queue Manager is $qm_name \n";
      print "Santosh Inside connect\n";

      print "Printing completion code and reson before connect\n";
      $compCode =3D MQCC_FAILED;
      $Reason =3D   MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR;
      my $mnone =3D MQRC_NONE;
      print "mqnone is $mnone\n";
      print "code is $compCode\n";
      print "Reason is  $Reason\n";
      print "Before calling MQCONN\n";
      print "-------------------------------------------\n";
<code end>

Output-
Printing completion code and reson before connect
mqnone is 4185249900
code is 12775184492
Reason is  9431638464620

if i run this code (having defined $qm_name to be relevant here), i
get just this output:

    After new and before connect

and that's it.

what exactly do you get?  i get this:

   Inside openqueuemgr
   Queue Manager is MQCRSH4
   Santosh Inside connect
   -------------------------------------------
   mqnone is 0
   code is 2
   Reason is  2195
   Before calling MQCONN
   -------------------------------------------
   Connection to Queuemanager failed

   Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (=3D=3D) at /ms/user/a/anbrown/=
rm.helpme line 82.
   Reason is  2058

   After MQCONN

but that's expected since the perl code is using MQServer::MQSeries
and not MQClient::MQSeries.  the former only works for talking to
locally installed qmgrs.  the latter can be used to talk to local or
remote qmgrs.  why don't you try changing that first.

try using MQClient::MQSeries instead of MQServer::MQSeries.  also fix
those warnings about uninitialized values (hint: you are mixing up
$Reason and $self->{"Reason"}).

it seemed to do so for me.  what output are you getting exactly?
