Neither is DBIx::Lite - it just blesses hashrefs into a package with
an AUTOLOAD, which isn't really the same thing.

Plus ->single was a design error and should never be used.

So was ->next - there should an an ->iter method that returns an
iterator instead.

Copying my stupid mistakes from DBIx::Class that Aran didn't because he
spoke to me first and I was able to warn him they were stupid does not
a better module make :)

I've cc'ed Aran in so you can sort out re-sending the requests rather
than producing another module - if you're having trouble contacting an
author please contact modules@perl.org - we can usually track them down.

Aran, aar's got some really nice ideas here and since you're already looking
at adding joins to SQL::Abstract we three need to collaborate so I don't
completely break your codebases when I release 2.0 using Data::Query.
