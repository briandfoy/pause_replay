Sorry folks, I lost track on this one.

Searching for 'Win32 asp' on
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/ reveals there was a
bug on PAUSE at that time. To fix things, I now redid the transfer of
maintainance to Bill. Hope that works out as it should. If not, please
let us know.--Thanks!
