     why:

    I have a few Perl modules that I have completed that I would like
    to contribute back to the community at large. One being a Canadian
    Address parser (I have only been able to find Canadian Geocoders,
    this is not the same). Another being an interface for Bell Canada
    wholesalers to qualify submit and monitor orders.
