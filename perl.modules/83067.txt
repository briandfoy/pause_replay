The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Plugwise
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Interface to Plugwise hardware
  userid:      HOLLIE (Lieven Hollevoet)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    This module provides an interface to Plugwise hardware. This
    hardware uses a custom protocol to communicate with it. The module
    is useful for other developers that want to reuse the work I did.

    I'm currently working on re-writing the xPL support for this
    hardware. A previous version of this interface was written in a
    single codebase. For the new version I thought it would be useful to
    separate the xPL handling from the actual support.

    The reason I put it under the namespace 'Device' is because I think
    it is the only local place to put it. The idea is to enable
    communication with a hardware device that currently has no driver
    written as a module in Perl.

    Any other suggestions are of course welcome.

    Kind regards, Lieven.
