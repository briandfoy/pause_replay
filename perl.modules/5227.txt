The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CSS::SAC
  DSLI:        bdpO
  description: Perl implementation of the Simple API to CSS
  userid:      RBERJON (Robin Berjon)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    www-style@w3.org

  rationale:

    Hi,

    I know that the CSS toplevel namespace doesn't exist, but I fail to
    see other good top levels that wouldn't be hacks.

    This version obsolete CSS::Parser which was a poorly written early
    module. I know of at least one other person's ongoing work on CSS in
    Perl which is to provide CSS generation subs in the same way CGI.pm
    does for HTML. There is also a CSS::DOM module in the works, though
    it will take some time to appear as it needs to support a mass of
    SVG options to be useful.

    Have a nice day,

The resulting entry would be:

CSS::
::SAC             bdpO Perl implementation of the Simple API to CSS RBERJON
