The module I wrote, provide some methods like

@valid_addresses = Module->check(@email_addresses);

It also provides other quick methods:

$mail = Module->new;
$mail->address($email_address);
$mail->validate; # test if it is a valid RFC822 address
$mail->mx_records; # return the mx records or already resolved ips
$mail->connection; # test if its able to connect to the mail server
$mail->callback; # callback test
$mail->check # make all tests
$mail->error; # why a test failed

These can also be used as class methods, passing the e-mail as a
argument. I am planning to add other methods, to change de behavior of
the checks.

I took a quick look at the Email::Valid doc, but seems that it doesn't
do a callback verification. This could eliminate some e-mails that are
valid, but don't really exist.

I need a help choosing the Module name. Ricardo Signes also suggested
Mail::AddrVerify, but I don't know if I should use it.
