I have been having people reporting problems with search which when I looked closer
it was because a dist was not there that they were expecting and when I
looked in the rsync logs the dist in question was being deleted. So I did
no look much further. But now I look closer I see

grep -c "deleting authors" var/log/rsync.log.20030214161500
203

That does seem a lot to be deleting.

The two distributions I have had reported are Acme-Time-Baby and Filesys-Ext2
both of which were deleted by the above rsync run.
