Well, unlike Mail::Folder, MboxParser is actually supported and
maintained, no longer in alpha-state, about one hundred times faster,
doesn't let you fiddle too much with MIME etc. Did you ever have a look at
its interface or even used it? I guess not.

Anyway, this is quite an irrelevant question: Mail::Box by Mark Overmeer
is also to be found in the module list despite the face that is similar
to Mail::Folder (just much more powerful and modern).

The nature of emails have changed a lot since 1998 (think of MIME).
Mail::Folder does not reflect these changes in any way. Once Perl 6 is
out it will be gone forever since no one is maintaining it.
