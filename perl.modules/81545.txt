     why:

    Hi, I would like to publish a module supporting database testing by
    allowing to inflate database tables in a controlled manner. I have
    written a working PL/SQL procedure and I am about to reimplement it
    in Perl and for a wider range of DBMSs. I found the procedure very
    useful for testing database client applications and it seems that it
    may be useful to have as a Perl module, too. In particular, I have
    posted a question here: http://perlmonks.com/?node_id=983419 and got
    some positive feedback. Kind regards José Diaz Seng
