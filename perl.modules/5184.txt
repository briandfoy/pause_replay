Oh no, I wouldn't. People who know me, know I'm not a ruthless business
person out to do nasty things like that. I'm just a Perl hacker who
happens to own a business with other people producing modules.

I don't want to hide information. The (only) benefit in having a single
PAUSE ID is simply to have everything in one directory, without having to
create a new top level namespace. I know this has been raised several
