Thank you for your reply, Steffeen!

Fundamentally, I would agree that a memory leak and similar small changes
should be a patch to an existing module; that was my original intent.
Though, while waiting for the author's responces (now nearing 3 months), I
have added much more to what started as a Base for clone.  Just a few:

 - Hooks - similar to that found in Storable
 - Fuller control of the cloning of ciruclar references
 - Potential Test integration with available boolean routines

Given this, the fact that I want to continue to build onto this framework,
plus the fact that there is no longer a bit of code left in Clone::More from
Clone's author - it doesn't appear to be a patch any more.  What are your
thoughts?

Subsiquently, I would like to see the maintenance of Clone get a little
better; I think it's a widely used module that gets little attention.  Given
the fact that I can't seem to get ahold of the author (I have tried nearly 5
different e-mail addresses, Google, WhitePages.com, perlmonks.org, for
nearly 3 months; with no avail), you mentioned I could get permission from
perl.modules to upload - would this be a one-time thing, or something
pernament moving forward?  The reason I ask is because I would be very
interested in becoming the maintainer of the module; perhaps giving it the
due attention needed.

Let me know you thoughts, and thank you again for your quick reply!
