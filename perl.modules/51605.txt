Greetings.

There has been no activity on Pod::HtmlEasy for two years, and email to =20
the author (both directly and via his CPAN account) has gon unanswered. =20
I've uploaded a new version, Pod-HtmlEasy-0.08_01, to my directory =20
(GLEACH) and it has passed the automated tests. There have not been any =20
user tests, other than my own.

Is it reasonable at this time to request to be added to the maintainer =20
list?
