The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Nessus::ScanLite
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Requests nessus host attacks using NTP 1.2
  userid:      JPB (John Ballem)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    netreg-devel@lists.sourceforge.net netreg@southwestern.edu

  similar:
    Net::Nessus::Client

  rationale:

    ScanLite may me a bit of a misnomer as nessus scan latency is
    defined by the plugin list not the protocol. This module does
    however take advantage of the nessus NTP 1.2 "fast_login" method. It
    allows applications to request a nessus daemon perform an attack in
    a time sensitive environment. This will allow CGI applications and
    systems such as NetReg to request real time scans.

    1) Using NTP 1.2 protocol over a socket connection means you don't
    have to have the nessus client install locally. 2) Supports ssl and
    non-ssl nessusd connections. 3) Performs a "fast_login", bypassing
    the huge list of nessus plugins. 4) Supports ini style configuration
    files as well as methods for specifying plugins and preferences.

    This application does not support the full NTP 1.2 protocol hence
    ScanLite.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Nessus::
