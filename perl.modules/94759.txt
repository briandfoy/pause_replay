used PAUSE since 2003 and is looking into adding licensing information<br>
to one or more of his modules.<br>
<br>
The email address linked to his PAUSE ID (<a href=3D"mailto:steve@colgreen.=

expired years ago. He now has no way of recovering his forgotten PAUSE<br>

working address with this message.<br>
<br>
Is there a documented process that he can follow to successfully<br>
recover his PAUSE account and regain write access to his modules? I<br>
haven&#39;t yet found anything detailing this process - the nearest is for<=

recovering a PAUSE password which is not going to work in this<br>
