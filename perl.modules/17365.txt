Maybe i did something wrong?
i think i only did an ordinary "make dist" and uploaded it..
I could make a new version and re-'make dist' it, if that helps. But i
don't think so because the problem started with the last version (0.01).
At first i could download it with CPAN.pm, but after some days it didn't
work anymore.

Thanks for your help!
