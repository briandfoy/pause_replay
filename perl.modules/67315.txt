Hi Moritz,

disclaimer: I'm not the one to decide and not the right person to 
discuss this since I don't currently have the time to think this 
through. I'll just try to add some facts and speculation.

This is opt-in which could produce some noise from distributions whose 
authors neglect to set the META bit.
General META.yml issues should be brought up elsewhere. I'd suggest 
#toolchain.

Well, obviously Andreas is key to much of the practicalities. I can't 
say how much he wants to be involved in the design.

Could there be some sort of safety net/heuristic in the indexer that 
temporarily rejects a distribution that:
1) does not specify the "is perl6" flag at all (neither true nor false)
2) look like perl6.

In that case, the author could just explicitly set the flag and 
everything would be fine.
