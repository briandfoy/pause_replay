Hello,

Two weeks ago I uploaded Term::RawInput, and it was approved for inclusion
in the Module List:


The next version of the Module List will list the following module:

  modid:       Term::RawInput
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: A simple drop-in substitute for <STDIN> that
  userid:      REEDFISH (Brian Kelly)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  enteredby:   BDFOY (brian d foy)
  enteredon:   Fri Jan 21 08:25:23 2011 GMT

The resulting entry will be:

Term::
::RawInput        Rdpfg A simple drop-in substitute for <STDIN> that REEDFISH

Please allow a few days until the entry will appear in the published
module list.

Parts of the data listed above can be edited interactively on the
PAUSE. See https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_mod

Thanks for registering,

The PAUSE


========

I still don't see it in the module list, but that concerns me far less
than the fact that I can't install it via the CPAN command line utility:


cpan[2]> force install Term::RawInput
Running install for module 'Term::RawInput'

  The module Term::RawInput isn't available on CPAN.

  Either the module has not yet been uploaded to CPAN, or it is
  temporary unavailable. Please contact the author to find out
  more about the status. Try 'i Term::RawInput'.

cpan[3]> bye


I *really* need this to work as soon as possible. Is there something else
I have to do to make this happen?

Thanks!
