I've often thought there should be a namespace for these sorts of
things, but I don't think Validate::* is it either.  That limits
the scope of the functionality.

I'm not saying it should be in Business::* either, but that's 
where these things tend to end up.

What about 

   SocialSecurity::US::Validate?
   SocialSecurity::FR::...

?
