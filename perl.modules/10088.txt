The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::SessionTicketCookie
  DSLIP:       adpOr
  description: simple user login/logout with cookies
  userid:      WICKLINE (Matthew Wickline)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    code based on RS's Web Techniques column (see module credits)

  similar:

  rationale:

    module is for use in CGI scripts, hence under CGI::

    I'm not entirely positive SessionTicketCookie is the best name
    within that space, but would like your feedback if you feel it is
    not appropriate.

    The module uses HTTP cookies to track user login sessions with a
    ticket metaphor. Tickets and users have a many-to-many relationship.
    One user could be useing multiple browsers and so logged in under
    several tickets simultaneously, or multiple users could
    consequitively (not simultaneously) use the same the same ticket in
    one browser.

    So, the ticket metaphor is relevant, and differs from other common
    ways of handling user login sessions. See Randal's WT column (linked
    in the module credits) for exaplanation and critique of those other
    methods.
