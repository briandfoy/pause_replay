Subject: I need to upload a new CPAN web page

  Hello,

It has been a couple of years since I uploaded anything to CPAN.  I 
don't want to upload a module this time.  I want to change the actual 
CPAN web page at 
http://search.cpan.org/~mnooning/Net-Daemon-0.43/lib/Net/Daemon.pm.

How do I just change the web page?  When I took the baton five years 
ago, the original author, or the CPAN maintainer, changed the web page 
to put my name on it.

I need to warn people that it no longer passes the threads tests due to 
fundamental changes in the Perl threads model.  I think it was as of 
5.10.  I do not know threads programming, and the original author told 
me he did not put it in, either.  I have no desire to learn it, 
especially since much more of my job tends to be non-programming.  
Potential users need to know that there is no pending fix.

BTW:  Anyone out there want to look into taking over my modiles?

The thread at
     https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55512
and particularly, at the entry of
         Fri Jul 16 10:07:14 2010 m.nooning [...] comcast.net - 
Correspondence added
alludes that there is a deeper rooted problem that is a little beyond me.

Any advice?
