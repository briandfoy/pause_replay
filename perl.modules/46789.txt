From: grant@cscorp.com (Grant Grueninger)

I'm planning on uploading a module that allows Perl scripts to log  
into a user's account and perform tasks on Myspace.com. Method  
functions include:
- get (and count) friend IDs
- get friends who mailed the user
- get a user's profile
- approve friends
- comment a friend
- message a friend

etc.

The module is currently named Myspace.pm. There are a few related  
modules (and will probably be more):
Myspace::Comment
Myspace::Message
Myspace::Friend_changes

So my question is, what is the best name to fit into the general CPAN  
naming scheme:

	1) Myspace
	2) WWW::Myspace
	3) WebService::Myspace
	4) Something else?

Thanks in advance,

Grant
