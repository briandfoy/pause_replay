The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::LectroTest
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: automatic, specification-based testing tool
  userid:      TMOERTEL (Tom Moertel)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Pittsburgh Perl Mongers, community project site
    (http://community.moertel.com/LectroTest)

  similar:
    None really, although LectroTest output is Test::Harness compatible

  rationale:

    Howdy! I'm requesting the Test::LectroTest namespace. Here's the
    rationale.

    Test::LectroTest is the natural choice for the namespace. A root
    level name doesn't make sense, and Test is a fitting non-root parent
    for the module.

    As to why "Test::*LectroTest*" and not something else, well, that's
    a longer story. LectroTest is an automatic, specification-based,
    random testing system. Ideally, we want name that conveys that idea,
    but we also want it short enough to be practical. So
    Test::AutomaticSpecificationBasedAndRandom is out. But
    Test::Automatic doesn't make the cut, either, because most people
    equate "automatic" tests with those that can be *run* automatically
    (a la Test::Simple and friends). LectroTest, however, will
    automatically *create* (and then run) tests for you. So we also need
    to convey a degree of magicness, which is how I ended up with
    "LectroTest." That the name also projects a friendly,
    hey-this-is-fun! quality is a bonus that we can hope will encourage
    programmers to write more tests and improve the quality of their
    Perl code. We can always use better code, right?

    If you want to know more about the system, check out the slides for
    my Perl Mongers talk:

    "Free Unit Tests in Perl with LectroTest"
    http://community.moertel.com/ss/space/Talk+-+Free+Unit+Tests+In+Perl+with+LectroTest

    That's about it. If you have any questions or concerns, please
    don't hesitate to throw me an email.

    Cheers, Tom
