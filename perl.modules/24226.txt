Hi,
    This module looks interesting, but could I try persuading you to rename it
as Games::Chess::DotCom, or, if you must, Games::Chess::Games::DotCom?

    I understand what it means to be passionate about chess, but I'm not sure
it deserves its own CPAN top-level namespace when there's a perfectly good one
in Games::.

Thanks,
Simon
