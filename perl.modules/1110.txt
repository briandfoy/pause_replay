Hello,

I am trying to get the CGI::Session namespace on CPAN changed to my cpan
id (JAMES). I've been told that this is the address to write to for help
with this kind of thing.

I've written to the current owner of this namespace (Marc Hedlund, MGH,
hedlund@best.com) about this, and he's agreed to give up the project and
hand it over to me. But that was over a month ago and nothing's been
done to officially transfer 'ownership' of this namespace. I've sent
follow-up messages to him, but have not received replies.

Can you help me with this, or please let me know where to turn to get
this done. I have an alpha version of the module and would very much
like to begin public discussions on it's development.

Thanks very much for your help,

James Tolley
