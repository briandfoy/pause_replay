Currently POE is in chapter 6, "Data Types and Data Type Utilities
(see also Database Interfaces)" which really seems inappropriate. 20
("Control Flow Utilities (callbacks and exceptions etc)") seems fine
but also 16 ("Server and Daemon Utilities") . Let me know, I'll make
the change in a batch. No need to change the chapters for each and
every subnamespace.

Yes, I'd prefer to have all subnamespaces listed under the top
namespace which implies that they are kept in the same chapter.
