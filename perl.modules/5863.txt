Well, the story goes like this: from about January 2000 I started
making the releases for Gtk-Perl and Kenneth kindly uploaded the files
to CPAN. After a while I didn't get any feedback from Kenneth and 
registerd with PAUSE and started making the uploads myself.
I think that at some point CPAN.pm started using the tarballs in
my homedir, but it looks like now it's back to Kenneth's: I don't
know what changed meanwhile.
Anyway, if Kenneth doesn't speak up for himself, I think he is not
against me handling the Gtk-Perl namespace for the time being:
for what I know I hasn't worked on the Gtk module since 1999.
And yes, 0.7006 is so much better than 0.7000 that you want it anyway.
