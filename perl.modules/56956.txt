It looks like some other things have changed in the account and
everything is happy now, except that Tk-800.024 and Tk-800.025 aren't
listed in search.cpan.org anymore. Those failed indexing horribly
because they live in Nick's account, and Nick doesn't have permission
for them anymore.

I'm sorry that this turned into such a mess. Jan Dubois reported a
problem that apparently had no owner so needed a PAUSE maintainer's
attention. I fixed a couple of module permissions problems for Tk,
re-ran the indexer on the old Tk distros, which caused even more
problems. NI-S still should have permissions on anything he previously
uploaded, in my opinion. There's no reason to *not* have him in TKML.
The problem was that I assumed he'd still be in there.

Also, Andy can still play with these accounts. I didn't change any
passwords. There was nothing in Nick's account information to note that
someone was handling it and it pointed at Nick's old personal email
address.

Here's possible courses of action for Tk right now:

* I can fix the indexing on the older Tk distros if NI-S is in TKML.
This is what I'd like to do.

* If we afirmatively don't want to fix them, we can remove them and let
them live on BackPAN. This would be especially nice with all of the
beta distros regardless of the decision.

*  We can do nothing more with the older Tk stuff, which means I left
things worse than when I found them. I'll get over that, though.
