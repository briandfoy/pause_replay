Hi Friend,

Got a question for you...well, maybe a riddle actually.

I got a couple emails from two totally different subcribers and I wanted to know if you can figure out an answer for both of them.

Ready? Here goes...

The first email was from a subscriber asking me if it was really possible to get into realestate with just about no money and terrible credit.

And the next one wanted to know if it was possible to invest when he had only twenty minutes to spare for it every other day; now, this guy actually had great credit and the ability to buy...just no time.

OK...so can you guess my replies to each of them?

BZZZZT! Time's up...

My answer to both of them was YES. 

And dig this, Friend]...they both can do the exact same technique to achieve the same goals. 

Now, I won't take credit for inventing this. In fact, I will be the first to happliy thank the goverment for making this secret loophole available to the public.

To learn more about exactly what this is all about, head over to http://www.taxliensdirect.com

You've got to see this one for yourself!

But you also gotta hop to it, because I'm not going to keep spilling secrets like this forever...I don't want everyone to know this stuff!

Lou
