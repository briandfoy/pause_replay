Please don't use "ProgressMonitor" as a root namespace. It's a generic
noun that describes several other modules.

Your message mentioned that I suggested that, but I didn't see my reply
there. I think I must have been mistaken. I probably was commenting on
the Misc::* part of the namespace.

Is there anywhere else in CPAN that this might fit?
