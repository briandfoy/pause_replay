The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::ADS
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Interface to the Astrophysics Data System
  userid:      AALLAN (Alasdair Allan)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Astro::ADS module is a module for access to the Astrophysical
    Data System (ADS) abstract service. While a simple Perl 4 script
    interface already exists, it isn't object orientated and hasn't been
    updated in some time. See
    http://ads.harvard.edu/www/adswww-lib/adswww-0.8.1.html for details
    of this package.

    The Astro::ADS module was written for the eSTAR project which
    requires a modern OO interface from Perl to the abstract service.

    The module was written in collaboration with Tim Jenness at the
    Joint Astronomy Centre in Hawaii and with advise from several other
    people in the Astronomy community, it is generally useful and
    suitable for distribution.
