I meant that as a compliment :)

DumpHeaders dumps the request headers - it would seem that to add
functionality outside of that at least calls for a name change.  Maybe?  I
dunno...

not much work, I suppose - I'm certainly willing to do it.  I did like the
IP feature when I saw it, and thought of adding it.  The file feature
doesn't strike me, but if folks use it then fine.

Ok...

Since Ask has seniority :) I'll defer to him on this one.  I can either add
his code or we can extend DumpHeaders together...

either way, it's been a good experience for me...
