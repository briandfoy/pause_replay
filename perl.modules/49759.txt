The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::OpenVPN::Manage
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interact with an OpenVPN management port
  userid:      MEYEAARD (Aaron Meyer)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)

  rationale:

    I feel that this module should be located in the Net:: name space
    as it interacts / supports a network daemon and would fall in line
    with the same name space reasoning as Net::Mail, Net::SNMP, etc.

    OpenVPN is a multi-platform SSL based VPN (www.openvpn.net) that
    provides a management port with raw telnet access to interact with
    the running process. This pure Perl module relyes on the Net::Telnet
    module, and is multi-platform (Linux and WinXP tested but don't
    anticipate issues with any other platform compatible with
    Net::Telnet).

    Further OpenVPN support modules are anticipated such as
    Net::OpenVPN::Config to generate configuration files via Perl OO
    methods and Net::OpenVPN::Script making an easy interface to the
    pushed env variables to create Perl OO method based scripts called
    for interface up/down events, user authentication, etc.

    As there are no current OpenVPN Perl modules found - even on Google
    searches. I feel that the Net::OpenVPN would be the proper location
    to keep all OpenVPN modules together.
