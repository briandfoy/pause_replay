Request to register new user

fullname: Andrew Chilton
  userid: CHILTS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.chilts.org/
     why:

    I have a few modules which I think should be uploaded to CPAN.
    Also, I have received so much from CPAN over the years, I need to
    start contributing back.

    See http://github.com/andychilton for some modules (not all will be
    eventually uploaded).
