Hello,

I was wondering if I could get this added to my name space list so I 
can move along with several projects.

If there is still some concerns please let me know so I can work on it 
so I can move along.

Have I offended anyone ;p ? I believe it does what the name implies and 
addressed brian's concerns and even attached previously the first 
version so anyone can take a look at it and I believe my history on 
cpan shows I'm willing to maintain, support,  and improve my modules as 
necessary.

Please let me know something about this, thanks a bunch!

Dan

Hello, 


I was wondering if I could get this added to my name space list so I
can move along with several projects.


If there is still some concerns please let me know so I can work on it
so I can move along.


Have I offended anyone ;p ? I believe it does what the name implies
and addressed brian's concerns and even attached previously the first
version so anyone can take a look at it and I believe my history on
cpan shows I'm willing to maintain, support,  and improve my modules
as necessary.


Please let me know something about this, thanks a bunch!

Did anyone get a chance to try this out and see if it covers your
concerns?


I'm waiting to upload a module and some other things that use this
module if its installed so it'd be really nice to have it added to my
name space so I can finish it :)


Thanks - Dan
