I need some advice on names for some modules that I've had kicking around 
for a while and am now planning to upload to CPAN. some of these modules 
may well form the basis of a series of articles in PerlMonth.

In approximately decreasing order of usefulness, here are my current names 
for the modules together with brief descriptions. Obviously I can supply 
more details if required.

Array::Compare
Like it says, this object allows you two compare two arrays and tells you 
if they are identical. Also allows particular elements of the array to be 
'skipped' in the comparison.


Calendar
Produces a string which contains the calendar for one month in a format 
similar to the one produced by the Unix 'cal' utility.


HTML::Calendar
Subclass of Calendar. Produces its output as an HTML table.
(Originally I called this CGI::Calendar, but now I _think_ I think that 
HTML::Calendar is more descriptive, but should it be Calendar::HTML?)


Number::String
Basically a demonstration of 'use overload'. Objects created by this module 
act just like normal numbers most of the time, but when you come to print 
them out, they are converted to words, like 'one', 'three hundred and sixty 
two' and 'three point one four two'.
(Someone on the London.pm mailing list suggested that this might fit better 
in the Silly:: namespace.)


Any advice would be much appreciated.

Regards,

Dave...
