Hello

I've done some research around the (hot) topic regarding Marc's modules.

What Mark failed to mention is that his module is just an XS wrapper
around the 'linux-dvb' API project [1]. His module does not provide
any kind of more perlish style API above DVB. Moreover, the
'linux-dvb' project is currently linux specific.

Some inquiries were made about porting 'linux-dvb' API to FreeBSD but
nothing has been done yet. Moreover, FreeBSD will probably use
something called DVB-ASI [2]. So having 'linux-dvb' API ported to
other OSes is highly unlikely.

So Mark's module is indeed specific to Linux *and* 'linux-dvb'
project. (note the double specificity both contain 'linux'. This
smells like trouble for us module list maintainers).

As for the DVB acronym, the official name (Digital Video Broadcasting)
is misleading: the DVB standard is already evolving to provide other
services such as converging broadcast and mobile services [3]. (for
instance DVB can already convey IP data). Hence I understand Mark's
reluctance in putting his module under Video which is too narrow a
definition for DVB (even if the acronym unfortunately suggests only
video).

Moreover, what can we do with DVB and Perl ? I don't think Perl can
handle video and audio data for performance reasons. So what's left ?
Some others things like network data, front-end (control of dish and
head ?), conditional access (for scrambled programs) ... It's ironic
that Perl can only handle non video part of the DVB API.

So I agree not to force his module under Video::*.

I do not approve the name Mark suggested ("Linux::DVB") because (IMO)
it mostly gives the impression of a generic high level perl style API.
It certainly does not hint at the linux-dvb project. A name like
Linux::LinuxDVB would give a clue, but one may not like a name with
2 'Linux' in it.

So I'd like for this module a name that:
- is under Linux::*
- is not under Video
- implies that the module is just a wrapper
- implies that is a wrapper around the 'linux-dvb' project.
- does not close the door for a more perlish Linux::DVB module 

What do you all think ?
