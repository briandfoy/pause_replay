We do not reject modules.  We do give our opinions, and in my opinion, as a
module-power-that-is, I think your name is bad and should be changed.  I
suggest HTML-TreeC / HTML::TreeC or something, if you are really set on it.
While it is not the best solution, when the name contains implementation
details, at least then it is unique.

HTML::Mason is a very good name, actually.  About as good as Apache, Tk,
and others.  It is a unique label that people have come to know.

The problem is that when you pick an existing name for another purpose, it
becomes de facto meaningless.
