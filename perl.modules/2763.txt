Hi.  

A while back, I registered my namespace, DBIx::Profile.  At
least, I thought I did.  But when I look at the module list,
http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#Part2-ThePerl5M,
I don't see my module on it.

After reading over the FAQ again, I can't determine where I went
wrong:
My filename does not match the pattern to stop propagation.
The version number is in the right place.

I would really like to have DBIx::Profile in the module list.

If you would tell me what I need to do, I would appreciate it.

Thanks!

jeff
