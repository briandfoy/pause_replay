The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::Hashcash
  DSLIP:       adcOg
  description: handle http://www.hashcash.org/ tokens
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There was some talk about a Crypt::HashCash module, but I could not
    find it nor contatc the original author. So I implemented it on my
    own.

    This implementation does not use the "reference" library and thus
    has slightly different features, but should be compatible. (The
    reference library has no license and such cannot be used by others
    currently).

    As for the name: there are two choices: Digest:: and Crypt:: for
    the namespace, and Crypt::Hashcash works fine, but I think one might
    expect Hashcashes to be under the Digests namespace, as the hashcash
    tokens are quite similar to digests. So, while Crspt::Hashcash
    works, Digest::Hashcash works better (for me).

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::Hashcash        adcOg handle http://www.hashcash.org/ tokens       MLEHMANN
