     why:

    I have been working on a fork of an existing PERL module
    (App::ASCIIO), as part of a graduate seminar I am taking at my
    University (University of Waterloo). This fork would be focused on
    providing the affordances of a User Interface builder to aid UI
    designers in prototyping their designs in these ASCII
    representations. The perl module in question is licensed under the
    PERL license, and so I am allowed to create this fork. I would like
    to have a PAUSE ID so that I can submit my PERL module to CPAN under
    the namespace App::GUIIO ; The name would appear to be unique and
    should not conflict with the namespaces of existing PERL modules.
