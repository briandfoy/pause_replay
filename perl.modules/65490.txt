     why:

    The contribution is based on the module GRID::Machine proposed by
    Casiano Rodriguez and its name is GRID::Cluster. GRID::Cluster
    allows the creation of fuzzy clusters by the use of SSH connections
    for the communications among different machines. Since zero
    administation and a minimal installation are the main features of
    GRID::Machine, these ones are directly inherited by GRID::Cluster.
