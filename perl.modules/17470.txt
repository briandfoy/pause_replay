The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorith::Numerical::Sample::Weighted
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Weighted random sampling of set (perl array)
  userid:      BROWSERUK (NJS)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    PerlMonks.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    An O(n) solution to picking elements from a set according to a set
    probabilities or weights.

    Makes no attempt to ensure 'fairness' in the way
    Algorithm::Numerical::Sample does, only that elements are picked,
    their distributions will approximate to the supplied
    weights/probabilities over time.

    Trades space for time, but does it in a manner that keeps the space
    requirements to a minimum. It also allows efficient adjustment of
    individual weights/probabilities on-the-fly without needing to
    reconstruct/recalculateeverything. This is useful in systems where
    the weighting changes as the system progresses.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorith::Numerical::Sample::
::Weighted        cdpOp Weighted random sampling of set (perl array) BROWSERUK
