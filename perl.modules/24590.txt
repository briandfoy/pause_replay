For the record of the modules mailing list only:

I managed to contact Corris who responded immediately and
told us that he cannot continue to maintain the module due
to too much work.

So I added Walery as the co-maintainer of the module.


I don't pass the ownership of any of the modules originally
created by the late Ariel Brosh (SCHOP) in order to preserve
somehow the fact that that he created these modules originally.


Walery,

I'd like to thank you again for taking care of the module.

regards
   Gabor
