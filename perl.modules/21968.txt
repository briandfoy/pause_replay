As my Time::Period was only a silly example of overloading, I've queued
it for removal from CPAN. This will take a few days. Maybe I'll 
re-release it as an Acme:: module at some point.

Strange that I didn't see Patrick's module when I was looking for 
potential names for my module. That may be because his distribution
is called Period rather than the more usual Time-Period.
