It is Apache::Admin::Config thats what the url:

  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18792

was for :)

It has the module name, the bug outlined, and the tarball of the new  
version that fixes it ready to upload via pause to demonstrate what I  
was referring to.

I'll copy his email with this message (hence the ATTN lines to get  
his attention ;p), hopefully that will do it :)

rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18792, its very important !!

I imagine he still won't receive it though since he hasn't gotten the  
emails from the bug report that go to the same address (I'm assuming  
since it works that way with mine)

Yes, I'd rather him do it also, thanks!

Instead of co-maintainer could it just be uploaded by a pause master  
guru if no word in the allotted time?
