The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Wildcard
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Enhanced glob processing
  userid:      IVORW (Ivor Williams)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/Week-of-Mon-20040621/thread.html#27605

  similar:
    File::Find File::Find::Rule File::Glob

  rationale:

    Using a regexp for pattern matching a list of files is not a new
    idea. However, this is not something that the built in functionality
    of glob provides, nor existing File:: modules. File::Wildcard has
    another slant, by way of using the captures ($1, R2, etc.) from the
    pattern match to construct new filenames. See the POD and london.pm
    RFC for more on this.

    Also note that a File::Wildcard object is a native iterator. This
    is in contrast to File::Find, where the application work takes place
    in a callback. File::Find on the other hand provides a 'next'
    method, which returns the next matching file (and any derived
    filenames). It does this without unduly tying up machine resources
    or slurping whole directory tree contents.

    I believe that this module belongs in the File:: namespace
    alongside File::Find and File::Glob.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
