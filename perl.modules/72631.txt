     That's true but not an unusual situation for a short acronyms.    
Furthermore;  the top hits for the search "ftn perl" are either the  
"Perl for FTN Systems" site at SourceForge (which has been there  
since 2001) or "FTN" related hits at CPAN.

	Note also, btw, that the word "Fidonet" used to be trademarked;   
that's one of the main reasons why the acronym came in to use & is  
certainly why I went to using it for the namespace like I did, and  
presumably why the others who use the namespace did so.
