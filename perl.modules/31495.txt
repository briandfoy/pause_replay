How about the name  CGI::Session::Serialize::Dumper?  Then you could
use either Data::Dumper or YAML without worrying about the name.

You can use the web form to send a message to this list which makes
it really easy for us to register the namespace :)

[ i've seen a couple of posts like this in the past month, and I seem
to remember that somewhere in the docs it says to send this.  Maybe
we can track that down and point them to the web form ]
