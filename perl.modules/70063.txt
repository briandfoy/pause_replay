Yes.

    cpan[2]> look VERESC/FCGI-Spawn-0.15.1.tar.gz
    Working directory is /home/sand/.cpan/build/FCGI-Spawn-0.15.1-6gXHYw
    % grep VERSION Spawn.pm 
    use vars qw($VERSION);
      $VERSION = '0.15'; 

Yes, in your package 0.15.1 you did not include version 0.15.1 but 0.15.

Not automatically.

You can already now visit Utils->"Reset Version" and then immediately
schedule an indexing run.

Please consider also that decreasing version numbers are pessimal for
your users because who has 0.16 installed will never notice that there
is a newer version 0.16.1 around.
