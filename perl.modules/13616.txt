Purpose:
Creating a collection of web development modules including: 

 --Webpage form generator using templates and a database. 

 --Website traversal engine to build connectivity between CGI-generated 
webpages. 

 --A more flexible and customizable POD-to-HTML tree generator. 

 --Powerful and configurable form validation engine using a common database 
for both front- *and* back-end. 

 --Extensible, configurable, on-the-fly diagnostics, settings, and data 
logging for standalone programs, CGI interaction, and client-level or 
server-level programs. 

 --Data mining tool capable of grabbing variable data across related web 
pages (varying by parameter) and unrelated web pages (varying by URL), 
saving all the web pages retrieved, creating a concise data table suitable 
for viewing, printing, or importing into a spreadsheet, and even traversing 
cookie gateways.
