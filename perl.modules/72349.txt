This sounds like LWP::Simple. Why didn't you just use that instead of
wget? I'm curious if there was some issue that you couldn't handle with
LWP.

I think URL is the wrong namespace for this. In CPAN, the URL space is
mostly things that work with the URL string itself.

Checkout is a bit weird too, because that term is closely related to
source control systems, as you say. However, you aren't really working
with a source control system.
