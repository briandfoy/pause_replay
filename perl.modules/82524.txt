Subject: Module submission JSON::Tiny
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, davido@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JSON::Tiny
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: Minimal JSON, no dependencies.
  userid:      DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://github.com/daoswald/JSON-Tiny

  similar:
    Mojo::JSON JSON JSON::XS

  rationale:

    JSON and JSON::XS are the heavy-weights. Mojo::JSON is
    light-weight, but only comes as part of the Mojolicious
    distribution. JSON::Tiny is an adaptation of Mojo::JSON that can
    stand alone as a single-package/single-module, pure Perl, with no
    dependencies other than core Perl (5.10+). JSON::Tiny consumes less
    memory than JSON::PP, is faster, a smaller distribution, fewer lines
    of code, a single module versus several within the distribution, and
    a more minimal user interface (with sane defaults, and zero
    configuration).

    Moritz has a dev release of a version of JSON::Tiny on CPAN as
    "first come", but it's Perl6, and in a personal conversation on
    PerlMonks he said he's fine with me registering JSON::Tiny in the
    Perl5 world. Corion provided some suggestions as well.

    The inspiration was when Merlyn demonstrated his Regex JSON parser
    (see PerlMonks) at Perl Mongers Los Angeles in September, with the
    rationale that he needed a copy/pasteable JSON parser. This is
    capable of being that light weight (but more robust than regex
    only).

The resulting entry would be:

JSON::
::Tiny            bdpO2 Minimal JSON, no dependencies.               DAVIDO
