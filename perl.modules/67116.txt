I also thought about Email at first, but after thinking it over, I
thought the module is actually more general. It can generate a link to
be sent via email, but the link can be sent by other means too, and
email address verification is just one of the uses. So I propose the
following description:

Generate, check unique code for auto-login. To bring it inside the 41
character limit, the unique word can be omitted. Should I re-request the
namespace?
