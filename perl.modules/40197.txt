The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::XHTML::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Lightweight XHTML+Dublin Core meta creator
  userid:      SMIFFY (Matthew Steven Smith)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    W3C WAI Interest group, possibly Dublin Core lists and others

  similar:
    CGI.pm

  rationale:

    CGI.pm is an awesome module, but may be considered overkill for
    some applications and poses certain issues when inserting header
    metadata, especially Dublin Core content which can have more
    sub-components than legacy metadata elements.

    This module is being developed from code which I have used in a
    number of content-management applications for rapid creation of
    valid XHTML headers - with or without HTTP headers for CGI
    applications.

    For those concerned with content accessibility/quality, various
    validation options are included.

    Whilst validation is included, facilities to produce elements
    within the body part of the tree are not provided, other than the
    W3C tools footer. (Hence the 'Lite'.)

    After due consideration, I decided that, whilst this is producing
    an XML vocabulary, it really belongs under HTML, as this more
    readily itentifies it as a Web tool. As I anticipate the emergence
    of more XHTML-only tools, I nominate HTML::XHTML::Lite rather than
    just HTML::XHTML, leaving that namespace open for future
    applications.

    Features: ---------

    * To provide a simple and light-weight XHTML-only alternative to
    CGI.pm.

    * Flag to indicate whether content should be served as text/html
    (default) or application/xhtml+xml

    * This module will be used primarily to create XHTML 1.0 headers
    containing Dublin Core metadata.

    * Facilitate easy creation of alternative content links such as
    FOAF, RSS, EARL, etc.

    * Dublin Core metadata may be converted automatically into legacy
    subject/description metadata fields.

    * Facility for automatic inclusion of links (and icons) to W3C
    markup and CSS validation as a page footer.

    * Run as CGI or dump to file; file method supresses creation of
    HTTP headers.

    * Import user-provided page content and write to output/file.

    * Import user-provided page content and run through XML validating
    parser.

    * Simple GET/POST support (poor-man's version of param from
    CGI.pm).
