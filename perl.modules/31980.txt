The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Wigwam
  DSLIP:       bdpOn
  description: An extensible template parsing language.
  userid:      DJOHNSTON (Daniel Johnston)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    TEMPLATE::TOOLKIT HTML::TEMPLATE

  rationale:

    The rationale for the currently existing root namespace "Text::" is
    obvious, however, "Wigwam" was chosen as the name for the module
    because "TemplateParser" (T.P.) is not as creative.

    Wigwam differs from other template parsers in that it provides
    greater flexibility (in terms of user extensibility and access to
    complex data structures) than any other parser that we have come
    across.

  enteredon:   Mon May 17 21:17:55 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Wigwam          bdpOn An extensible template parsing language.     DJOHNSTON
