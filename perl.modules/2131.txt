I mailed to this address a few days ago indicating that we had
a templating module we wanted to release, but that our internal name
for it (Text::SimpleTemplate) was taken.  After some internal
discussion, we came up with a suggested new name:  Text::TagTemplate

We think this indicates how it works pretty clearly and it doesn't conflict
with anything out there.  As an example of the "tags" part, when you're
producing a page using the module, you combine a template with tags
included in it:

<INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="somefield" VALUE="<#SOMEFIELD HTMLESC>">

with a set of tag definitions that might look like:

+{
	somefield => 'some "value"',
	someotherfield => 'someothervalue'
}

and result in output of:

<INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="somefield" VALUE="some &quot;value&quot;">

As far as I understand, standard procedure is to post to this list with
namespace suggestions and take silence as approval, so I guess if you
don't like this, speak up!  :)  I'll be uploading with PAUSE soon otherwise...

Thanks for your time...
