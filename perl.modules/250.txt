What if the basic package is Authen::Ticket and the actual mod_perl handlers 
are then Authen::Ticket::{Server,Client}.  The package would fit in the 
two-level scheme.  The two main classes in the package are more abstract 
classes to be sub-classed anyway.  Several helper classes may also be provided 
such as Authen::Ticket::Sign for some helper routines in 
signing/encrypting/decrypting tickets.

If we go with two-level names for these, we get two or three packages out of 
it (Master, Client, Helper).  It seems to make more sense to keep everything 
together.
