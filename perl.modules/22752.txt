From: Robin.Barker@npl.co.uk (Robin Barker)

When I first uploaded my distribution File-Copy-Link
I created a module entry (including DSLIP information)
for the modules File::Copy::Link and File::Spec::Link.

I have now uploaded new versions which are on CPAN 
but C<cpan> does not show the DSLIP information.

Edit module metadata on PAUSE shows no modules for me.

Have I done something wrong?
Were the modules never registered?
