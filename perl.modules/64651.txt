you'll have to provide some more detail if you want this module
registered. It has a pragma-like namespace (lower case), you want it put
in the pragma chapter, your description doesn't really tell me what your
module is doing, and unless I missed it, there's no distribution on CPAN
yet that I could refer to.

Best regards,
Steffen
