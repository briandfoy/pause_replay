The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::FIT
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: FIT graphical test framework for Perl
  userid:      INGY (Brian Ingerson)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    FIT is a test framework developed by Ward Cunningham.

    Test::FIT is a Perl implementation of FIT. Tests are created in
    html tables, which are then colored and marked up by testing code.

    I am working to make this a serious replacement for the current
    Perl module testing institution. It will integrate seamlessly into
    the current Test::Harness 'make test' stuff. But will also produce
    graphical results on completion if you wish. These results could be
    displayed in cpan.org to show graphically what the software is
    capable of.

  enteredby:   INGY (Brian Ingerson)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 30 00:02:24 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::FIT             adpOp FIT graphical test framework for Perl        INGY
