The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::GccXml
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Read GCC-XML's C/C++ program structure XML
  userid:      MOLT (Paul Golds)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    GCC-XML (http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Index.html) is a program for
    exporting an XML representation of GCC's internal nodestructure for
    a C/C++ program.

    XML::GccXml is a collection of Perl modules for reading in the XML
    produced in a friendly OO-manner, so you can find all methods and so
    forth.

    The primary use for this is in a program I'm developing which will
    automagically generate the XS necessary to connect Perl with any
    C/C++ library, with a config file to do the over-rides for 'special
    case' methods. I thought that the XML reading part itself was useful
    enough (for C++ analysis tools, etc) that XML::GccXml should be a
    stand alone bundle.

  enteredby:   MOLT (Paul Golds)
  enteredon:   Thu Oct 21 10:02:54 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::GccXml          cdpOp Read GCC-XML's C/C++ program structure XML   MOLT
