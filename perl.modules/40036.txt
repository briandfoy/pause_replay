     why:

    I am the maintainer for ~50 Perl modules in Debian:
    http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?gpg_key=8bb527af&comaint=yes I
    have some modules I want to contribute to CPAN as well, but are not
    currently ready to be uploaded - some of them network-relatede
    (http://www.gwolf.org/seguridad/wrap), some of them (although not
    yet publicly available) regarding simple user authentication for web
    applications, handling of network data from web applications.
