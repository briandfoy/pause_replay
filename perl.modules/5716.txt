The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::DnsZone
  DSLIP:       bdpna
  description: Webbased dns-zone manager for BIND
  userid:      THOMAS (Thomas Eibner)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    discussed shortly on the mod_perl list

  similar:

  rationale:

    Apache::DnsZone is an application for mod_perl that implements a
    webbased multiuser interface for changing dns-zones with BIND.

    It uses the underlying Apache::DnsZone:: namespace for
    Authentication handlers, DB wrappers etc.

    Currently used namespace is:

    Apache::DnsZone::AuthCookie Apache::DnsZone::Config
    Apache::DnsZone::DB Apache::DnsZone::DB::MySQL
    Apache::DnsZone::DB::Oracle Apache::DnsZone::Language
    Apache::DnsZone::Resolver

    Aditionally I use DnsZone.pm (as 'DnsZone' namespace) for
    dispatching to Apache::DnsZone and for Debug'ing (Similar to AxKit's
    namespace: Axkit.pm Apache::AxKit::*) But I can if needed remove the
    top 'DnsZone' namespace.

    The reason why I would like to see this module/application on cpan
    is that I think it should be just as easy to install as any other
    perl module and the prerequisits work if you have follow
    dependencies in your CPAN shell.

    If you feel this application doesn't belong on cpan I would
    consider having a Bundle that installs the needed modules to run the
    application.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
