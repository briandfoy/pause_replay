The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Module::ParseDeps
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Parse CPAN package dependencies
  userid:      RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    PerlMonks, module-authors list

  similar:
    Module::ScanDeps, Module::Depends, Module::Dependency,
    Module::PrintUsed, others

  rationale:

    Other modules work by either attempting to run the Makefile.PL and
    Build.PL andeither hooking the installation routines to see what
    modules are requested, or watching %INC.

    Some of these modules require dependent modules to already be
    installed.

    This module parses META.yml, or if none exists, partially-parses
    Makefile.PL for the PREREQ_PM key to determine the preqrequisite
    modules (dependencies). (It makes use of Module::MakefilePL::Parse.)

    Although not as thorough as modules which hook to see which ones
    really are requested, it's fast, safer, (does not run entire
    Makefile.PL) and good enough for building a dependency tree.

    It also runs on Windows, which some modules cannot (at least not
    until their dependent modules are fixed ;)

    Originally it was going to be called something like
    CPAN::Distribution::Depends, but people suggested alternate
    namespaces.

The resulting entry would be:

Module::
::ParseDeps       adpfp Parse CPAN package dependencies              RRWO
