Nope, one of the axioms of distributing software is that no
distributed file ever modifies itself. It must be reproducable for the
innocent user what happens, what has happened so far and there should
always be a simple way to reestablish the state of all files as they
were when the distribution was unpacked (this shouldn't need another
untar).

So among the possible solutions would be that the Makefile.PL itself
runs a dialog with the user to find out the installation directory,
e.g. [untested, off the top of my head]:

use ExtUtils::MakeMaker qw(prompt);
use File::Spec;
my $default = "/usr/local/etc/webtest"; # or whatever
my $instdir = prompt "Where should your foobar files be stored permanently?", $default;

sub MY::postamble {
    sprintf qq{install :: %s\n\t\${CP} %s %s},
        File::Spec->catfile("etc", "permfile.txt"),
        File::Spec->catfile("etc", "permfile.txt"),
        File::Spec->catfile($instdir, "permfile.txt");
}


Hope that helps,
