This is indeed an error - I did upload several items to the  
AI::Categorize namespace, but deleted them all eventually.  They were  
replaced in spirit by AI::Categorizer (note the 'r'), which has  
different interfaces.

Probably you should be looking at the backpan too?

I don't plan on ever uploading any more stuff to AI::Categorize, but  
I think it would be confusing if someone else did.
