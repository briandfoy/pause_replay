Hi,

My name:  Vlado Keselj
E-mail:   vkeselj@cs.uwaterloo.ca
Homepage: http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~vkeselj/

Preferred user-ID on CPAN: vlado

A short description of what I'm planning to contribute:

Some of my Perl scripts are available at:
http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~vkeselj/srcperl/

My favorite one is Starfish.  It is yet another embedded Perl; however,
it has some important unique features.  Two of them are: by default, it
keeps the code instead of removing it, and it is relatively short
with regard to its task.

I have some modules too, mostly related to natural language processing
(e.g., handling attribute-value matrices), which I would like to make
available too.

Right now, I am not using Makefile.PL and other formalities, but I will
add it before uploading.

BTW: Perl is my favorite programming language for the last 6 years.

Best regards,

Vlado
