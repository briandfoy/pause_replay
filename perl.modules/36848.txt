The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::lcse
  DSLIP:       bdpfl
  description: Largest common sub string in string array
  userid:      EXODIST (Chad Granum)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Algorithm-LCSS-0.01.tar.gz String-LCSS-0.12.tar.gz

  rationale:

    String::LCSS will only take 2 strings at a time, then both
    String:LCSS and Algorithm::LCSS do not seem to offer a choice on
    search, My approach is to first allow the developer to strip
    characters they do not wish to count, then they can also choose to
    fivide the string however they wish, by Word or character, or even
    an alternative they create. As well whitespace can be ignored, It
    can find a common string that matches a specific percentage and/or
    length, it can also take an array of strings as apposed to 2 strings
    only.

  enteredby:   EXODIST (Chad Granum)
  enteredon:   Sun Dec  5 22:40:13 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

String::
::lcse            bdpfl Largest common sub string in string array    EXODIST
