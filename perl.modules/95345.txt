     why:

    Hi! I have been working with perl for 6+ years now and I am trying
    to learn a Modern Perl (TM) approach to doing things.

    I have been working a lot with CPAN-modules and occasionally
    modifying them. I would like to start contributing back to the
    Perl-community and start writing the modules I create in-house as
    more generic and reusable libraries.

    Currently I have MARC::Diff and Net::FTP::Brute -modules I would
    like to introduce to CPAN.
