Subject: Module submission RandomJungle

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RandomJungle
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Library to manipulate RandomJungle data
  userid:      RFREIMUTH (Robert Freimuth)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    I developed a series of modules that provide users with the ability
    to post-process and manipulate the output of the Random Jungle
    program (http://randomjungle.sourceforge.net/). I could not find any
    similar modules on CPAN.

    A new root namespace is requested because the modules are highly
    specific to the input and output formats of the RandomJungle
    software, and the type of analysis that users might want to perform
    on the data structures. The distribution, which already contains 8
    modules, is not a comprehensive library and could be extended. In
    fact, I am already working on an additional module that would
    provide additional functionality to this distribution. The
    RandomJungle namespace would encourage future developers to build
    off of a common core.

    I sent an email to module-authors@perl.org on April 14, in which I
    outlined the modules in this distribution. I requested feedback on
    the module names, but to date have not received any replies.

The resulting entry would be:

RandomJungle      RdpOp Library to manipulate RandomJungle data      RFREIMUTH
