Hi Andreas,

There seem to be a communication problem : I was never notified about 
any kind of problems (packaging or naming) and actually never got any 
mail from Brian. Was my module "silently" rejected ?

To go ahead :

   1. Can you precise the "top level namespace" problem ?
   2. Can you precise the problems related to the packaging? You were
      right, I'm not a CPAN packaging expert but I can learn if you tell
      me what needs to be changed.

Thanks for your quick answer.

I think, last time around the process was not completed because you
did not answer this email:
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2005-04/msg00445.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2005-04/msg00445.html</a>

Please re-register with the same form or try to argue with Brian about
the proper namespace.

But it's not only about registration, it's also about packaging.
Please learn how to use ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build and make
a nice .tar.gz as all the other CPAN authors do and things will
eventually fall in place nicely.
