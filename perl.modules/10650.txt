* a short description of what you're planning to contribute
    A module for fast, regexp based validation of the RFC822 email
    address grammar.  Compatible with RFC::RFC822::Address, but
    significantly faster.  Provisionally named Mail::RFC822::Address, it
    is currently available from:
        http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html

cheers,

Paul
