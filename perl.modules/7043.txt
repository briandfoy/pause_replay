Hi.

Are you certain the name of the SysConfig module is all proper and
well?  I'm afraid SysConfig is much too generic, it tells almost nothing.
Also, the module seems to be heavily specific to RedHat Linux, and as
such, it should have *something* to that effect in its name, too.
Linux::Config (if it is to be about more than RedHat), or RedHat::Config
(you might want to let Randy J. Ray to know, rjray@redhat.com, he is
a very Perl-friendly RedHat representative)

(Sorry if this has been discussed in the modules@perl.org list earlier;
I have been away for a while.)
