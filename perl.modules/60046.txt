Good morning,

I have been getting the indexer failure notice but not sure why. Seems
to suggest a permission issue, but this not making any sense to me. I
an building the tarball with GNU tar and GNU gzip on windows. I
started with h2xs but had problems with that, had to create META.yml
by hand. Any help greatly appreciated.

Brad 0adkins.
