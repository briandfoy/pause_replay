The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UML::Class::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Render simple UML class diagrams from code
  userid:      AGENT (Agent Zhang (章亦春))
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/umlclass/

  similar:

  rationale:

    UML::Class::Simple is a Perl CPAN module that generates UML class
    diagrams (PNG format, GIF format, XMI format, or dot source)
    automatically from Perl 5 source or Perl 5 runtime.

    Perl developers can use this module to obtain pretty class diagrams
    for arbitrary existing Perl class libraries (including modern perl
    OO modules based on Moose.pm), by only a single command. Companies
    can also use the resulting pictures to visualize the project
    hierarchy and embed them into their documentation.

    The users no longer need to drag a mouse on the screen so as to
    draw figures themselves or provide any specs other than the source
    code of their own libraries that they want to depict. This module
    does all the jobs for them! :)

    You know, I was really impressed by the outputs of UML::Sequence,
    so I decided to find something to (automatically) get pretty class
    diagrams too. The images from Autodia's Graphviz backend didn't
    quite fit my needs when I was making some slides for my
    presentations.

The resulting entry would be:
