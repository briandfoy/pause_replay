     why:

    Module (mainly used for preprocessing the pages of a website):
    Opens the specified input file, or 'siteDescription.txt' if none
    specified. Each line in the file is parsed. First filenames on each
    line are concatinated to the last filename on that line, in order,
    and the file is created. This is quite different from most
    preprocessing programs which use a macro language. Instead, you have
    a single file which describes how to construct every page in the
    website from smaller text files, and 'mcat.pl' which reads that file
    and creates the site. It is very useful for making pages with common
    elements like menus, headers, and footers.

    (Could also upload it as a script. See
    http://www.mbstevens.com/preprocessor/ ...it is the mcat.pl script
    from the download. At a future time I might also like to upload a
    module and/or script for the mfilt.pl component of the download.
    This mfilt.pl component does use a simple macro language.)
