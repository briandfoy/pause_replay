Well, I figure, the only people who'd ever care about this module are
those who're already familiar with calling their tibco network "the Tib"
and Rendezvous "rv".

Also, using Tib::Rv makes the C to Perl mapping very consistent and
straightforward -- for instance, the C API function:

tibrv_status
tibrvQueueGroup_Add( tibrvQueueGroup queueGroup, tibrvQueue queue );

... maps to:

package Tib::Rv::Status;
...
package Tib::Rv::Queue;
...
package Tib::Rv::QueueGroup;
sub add { my ( $self, $queue ) = @_; ... }

And another thing, "Tib::Rv" saves a lot of typing and horizontal space in
your code as opposed to "Tibco::tibrv".  An average chunk of code using
this module would look like:


use Tib::Rv;
my ( $rv ) = new Tib::Rv;
my ( $transport ) = new Tib::Rv::Transport;
$Tib::Rv::Queue::DEFAULT->createListener( $transport, 'MY.SUBJECT', sub {
   my ( $msg ) = @_;
   print "My callback received message $msg\n";
} );
while ( 1 )
{
   $Tib::Rv::Queue::DEFAULT->timedDispatch( Tib::Rv::WAIT_FOREVER );
}


... so I like the brevity of "Tib::Rv", since you end up having to type it
quite a bit.  I can totally do whatever y'all think is appropriate, but I
really like Tib::Rv.
