Seems to be a very useful module.
As name I would suggest 
DBIx::Normalize or
MySQL::Normalize.

The selection should depend on how specific is your module to MySQL.
The SQL statements shown to us seems to be basic SQL statements.
I don't have much knowledge of other databases than MySQL,
but I could imagine they also work with Oracle, mSql, Mickeysoft SQL
Server, ...

If not MySQL is a better namespace than DBD::mysql,
because DBD::mysql handles MySQL-drivers.
MySQL:: instead is for specific modules for MySQL.

Greetings,
Andrea
