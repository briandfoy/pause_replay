Hello,

Ok,  I picked 'Frame' because Class::Frame creates sort of basic class =
structure, the skeleton (
new() and accessors ). After class structure has been declared in =
subclass of Class::Frame - all basic
steps are done, only add more methods. Constructor can be overriden in =
all subclass children while preserving
its functionality - call $pkg->SUPER::new() in the first line of  child =
class.

It does pretty much the same thing as Class::Constructor, which I think =
is a great module, but much more generic.
Class::Frame is sort of lightweight approach, the thing I have been =
using actively and decided to contribute to CPAN.

Denys
