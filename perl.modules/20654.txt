The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MIME::Lite::Maintained
  DSLIP:       MdpOa
  description: Easily make MIME/SMTP emails w/attachments.
  userid:      YVES (Yves Orton)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    This is really just MIME::Lite but maintained. Its old, and has been
    discussed pretty much everywhere im sure.

  similar:
    MIME::Lite is pretty close to a standard module. It sure is used
    eveywhere. This is a bug fix, maintenance release/takeover as the
    author no longer does so.

  rationale:

    This is an old, mature, and apparently unmaintained module. I have
    patched it and rereleased it after repreated attempts to contact the
    author with patches.

    Since I cant register MIME::Lite itself, i've registered
    MIME::Lite::Maintained. There doesn't seem to be a way to register
    that modules are unsupported, and to have orphaned modules assigned
    new foster-parents. So calling the distribution ::Maintained and
    registering that seemed a logical route. The actual module installed
    however is MIME::Lite v3.0.

    Main updates are patches to the interaction with MIME::Types, added
    tests, and a slimmer distribution size.

    I don't intend to actively develop this module, but I do intend to
    convert the tests to use Test::More and enhance that aspect of
    things, and I will accept any patches and improvements people might
    have. And of course there is always the temptation...

    :-)

    If Eryq returns or objects to this "adoption" of his module (he has
    been sent advance notice and opportunity to respond in private) then
    I am perfectly happy to relinquish control.

    However the fact remains that MIME::Lite is in widespread use, (I
    think especially on Win32 given its impoverished email facilities),
    and NEEDS to be maintained. Since I use this module routinely it is
    in both my benefit and the communities to take over maintenance and
    ensure it is patched and bug free.

    I think that this is a reasonable course of action given the facts,
    especially that the code was released under the artisitc licence and
    the copyrights and attributions have been unaltered in substance.

    Hopefully the powers that be are happy with my takeover of this
    namespace and we can dispense with the MIME::Lite::Maintained
    fiction.

    Regards to all, Yves / Demerphq ps: Eryq if you read this please
    feel free to object! But please maintain the module!
