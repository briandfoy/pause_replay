> Is there anywhere else in CPAN that this might fit?

Ok, after having scrutinized http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html 
a bit more, I guess it will fit well in the Term:: top namespace; so 
Term::ProgressMonitor is my suggestion.

Now, do I need to fill out a new request for that (to get the formal issues 
right) or can you just treat this informally as a request changing from 
Misc::?

TIA,
