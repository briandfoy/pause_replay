I'd be very happy to change the name, if people think it sits uneasily 
with Geo::Postalcode, or just doesn't work. But people in the UK 
definitely say postcode, not postalcode, and would probably not look at 
(or for) a module with that name.

really it should be something like Geo::UK::Postcode, and 
Geo::US::Zipcode, no? But i think it would be very unwise of me to 
start venturing opinions about other people's namespaces :)

I'm with you on the interfaces too, though there are significant 
underlying differences in the data.

Completely open to suggestions here...
