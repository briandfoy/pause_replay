     why:

    I have a small module for converting polytonic Greek text to
    monotonic. This will go under Lingua::EL:: (it seems that no-one
    else has done any work in this area). I have also been dreaming
    about Greek numbers, Greek hyphenation, PDFs, RTFs and other things,
    but I canâ€™t say whether I will have time to realize any of those
    dreams any time soon.
