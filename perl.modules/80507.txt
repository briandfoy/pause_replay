Subject: Module submission Logfile::Tail

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Logfile::Tail
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: Read log files, resume reads, rotated files
  userid:      JANPAZ (Jan Pazdziora)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    When reading log files, you only want to process the line once,
    while also be able to find new lines that were appended since the
    last read, and while also recovering (and not losing data) if the
    log file got rotated. This is what Logfile::Tail attempts to do.

    I'm selecting chapter 23 as that's what the root Logfile module has
    but I believe 10 would be more appropriate.

    I previously tried to register Logfile::Read but brian preferred
    different name -- he was fine with Logfile::Tail.

  enteredby:   JANPAZ (Jan Pazdziora)
  enteredon:   Wed May  9 11:17:11 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Logfile::
::Tail            bdpO2 Read log files, resume reads, rotated files  JANPAZ
