Hi,

Tk::XMLTree is a module I originally uploaded to CPAN in 2008. Because it
is a subclass of Tk::Tree, I received a suggestion to change its name. This
resulted in the creation of module Tk::Tree::XML, which I maintain. On
summary, Tk::XMLTree was a shortlived wrongly named module and
Tk::Tree::XML is the correct one.

Tk::XMLTree resides in BackPAN only, but it still shows up under my
releases [1] and also under my distributions [2]. I would appreciate if you
could remove Tk::XMLTree from BackPAN.

Thank you in advance,
Jos=C3=A9.
