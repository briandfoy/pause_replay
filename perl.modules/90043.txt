     why:

    I am founder and CEO of binary.com. Our IT team intends to
    open-source onto CPAN several modules that we have developed which
    we think would be of benefit to the Perl community, such as
    interfaces to various third party systems, a Black & Scholes option
    pricing module, etc.
