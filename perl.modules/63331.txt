Hello!

I would like to request an author ID for CPAN.

Name: Tom Kirchner
Email: tk@tkirchner.net
Homepage: http://www.tkirchner.net
Preferred Author ID: KITOMER

I am now programming in Perl for about
10 years and would like to put some of my personal
modules on CPAN (in a suitable form) and see what
the community has to say about them.

If you have trouble sending an email to the
address above, you may use this one, but please
keep this secret and do not publish it:
tokirc at gmx.net

Thanks!
-Tom Kirchner
