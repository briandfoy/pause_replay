It's mostly to explain the name, which you say you did but never did.
:) What is AN? Does that have some significance?

-------

I am sorry, I thought it was to justify a new name space in general, not 
the AN::* namespace specifically. :)

AN!foo (and in my modules AN::foo), is the namespace I've long used for 
various projects. It's origin is an acronym for "Alteeve's Niche!", the 
title I've always done my work under. Going back further, "Alteeve" was 
my handle before "Digimer" back on the BBS days. I figure my work has 
always been somewhat "Niche" oriented, so that's the very root of the name.

Cheers!

Digi
