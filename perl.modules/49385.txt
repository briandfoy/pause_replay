Subject: Module submission Hardware::1Wire
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hardware::1Wire
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Dallas Semiconductors 1-Wire Bus
  userid:      DVKLEIN (Daniel V. Klein)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Websites

  similar:
    Hardware::iButton

  rationale:

    The iButton modules deal only with 1-Wire ibuttons, I will be
    handling more interfaces (bus masters) and more devices. As hardware
    vendors send me more devices (a couple have already), I will
    integrate them into the namespace.

    I am unconvinced that either iButton or 1Wire belongs in the
    Operating System Interfaces chapter, but I chose that because that's
    where "Hardware" is listed, and I am trying to play nice.

  enteredby:   DVKLEIN (Daniel V. Klein)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 13 19:35:37 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Hardware::
::1Wire           RdpOp Dallas Semiconductors 1-Wire Bus             DVKLEIN
