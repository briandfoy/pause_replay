Jos, please tell us that this isn't true:-)

Well, in general, falling version numbers are not good for programmers
who care about version numbers.

Apart from that, if you delete the old distro quickly from CPAN, the
effect is negligible.

The old stuff with the higher version number *must* go, otherwise not
only CPAN.pm will give contradictory advice: once it will suggest
upgrading to 0.12, then again to 0.13, ad libitum.
