Hi, 

This list doesn't do module support because we handle issues with
module authors distributing their code.

You might try sites such as Stackoverflow.com or PerlMonks to get
regular user Perl help.

I don't know about your issue since I'm not a Windows user so I don't
have any idea about a solution.

Good luck,
