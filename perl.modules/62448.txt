The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Camera::Edimax::IC1500
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to Edimax IC1500-series net cams
  userid:      MEH (Andy Smith)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    website

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module enables people to control Edimax IC1500-series network
    cameras through Perl, rather than the rather clunky web interface.
    As far as I am aware nobody has done this yet. It was originally
    just going to be a short perl script to change a few settings on
    demand, and to request reboots, but I thought it would be more
    future-proof if it was in module form.

    The cameras are a budget make, and the automatic Outdoor and
    auto-exposure settings aren't ideal, and I wanted a way to control
    these without having to use the web interface.

    At present it only supports a minimal number of the camera's
    functions, however this is more of a proof-of-concept than a
    fully-functional module.

    I chose the namespace because I couldn't find anything that already
    exists to manage network cameras - if there is something already I'd
    be more than happy to slot this module in there instead.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Camera::Edimax::
::IC1500          adpOp Interface to Edimax IC1500-series net cams   MEH
