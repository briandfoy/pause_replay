Hello,
  I have been working on an Apache module to provide 
some proxy services for us.  I have tried many of the variants
of reverse Proxy with apache, but they do not rewrite absolute 
links made on remote sites.  We need something that will let a
user visit
http://www.vendorsdatabase.dom as though she/he were 
coming from somewhere within louisville.edu  even though the user
is nowhere near our network.  Regular proxies do not work because 
some of the users already use proxies in their environment.  I could
find nothing that did this, so I wrote one.
I propose naming it 

Apache::RewritingProxy 

since that is basically what it is.  It does not act as a normal proxy
however, as the user requests a URL like
http://proxyserver.domain.dom/http://www.vendorsdatabase.dom/
and the proxy fetches the remote URL and rewrites all of the 
links accordingly. An example of the module in action is at:
http://vhost.louisville.edu:8000/proxy/http://www.cpan.org/

I am afraid I deserve gratuitous flaming as I already uploaded a 
tarball without asking for namespace.  I apologize sincerely as I 
had misread the docs and thought I was supposed to register after it was 
uploaded. Mea Culpa.  If there is some magic ju ju I can do to undo my 
mistake I would be glad to.

Is Apache::RewritingProxy where this belongs?
