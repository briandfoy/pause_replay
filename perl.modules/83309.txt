There is also MacOSX::* to make it even more confusing. I tend to like
that a bit more because I'm old enough to have actually have used
MacPerl. :)

For the second bit, is there a CF (or whatever) class that you're using
and from which you might steal the name? Barring that, "MouseEvent"
might work. "MouseControl" makes me think that I could control the
cursor through Perl so I could move it around the screen and confuse
the user. :)
