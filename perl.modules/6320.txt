I have uploaded Win32-ProcFarm-2.12.gz to my directory on CPAN.

This release patches a few bugs involving the wrap-around from 2^32-1 to 0
every 49 days for the Win32::GetTickCount function.  Silly me, I knew the
potential for a bug was there and thought that it wouldn't affect me.  So I
ignored it.  I mean, what are the odds of running into the problem?  Pretty
high if you have a script based on Win32::ProcFarm::PerpetualPool that runs
on a server that stays up for 6 months at a stretch:).  This _should_ fix
the problem, although I won't know for certain until August 1st (and I'll
have to have someone else test it since I'm going to be in Turkey, and it
may be later if that server gets rebooted between now and then).
