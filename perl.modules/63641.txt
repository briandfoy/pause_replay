Subject: Module submission Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, dhard@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Weighted summary statistics including ECDF
  userid:      DHARD (David H. Ardell)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Statistics::Descriptive

  rationale:

    Partial extension of Statistics::Descriptive to handle weighted
    variates. Although some functionality of the base-class is dropped,
    important functionality is added to this module (such as quantile
    and ECDF) that might make some users choose this module even for
    unweighted variates.

  enteredby:   DHARD (David H. Ardell)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 16 16:42:20 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Descriptive::
::Weighted        RdpOp Weighted summary statistics including ECDF   DHARD
