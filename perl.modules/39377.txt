The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Word::Writer
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Create Microsoft Word documents
  userid:      JOHANL (Johan Lindström)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    perl-win32-users@listserv.ActiveState.com, probably a Yahoo group

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have written a module for creating MS Word documents using the
    Win32::OLE module. It's a wrapper for getting things done a little
    more easily than using the DOM directly, and it has quite a few
    workarounds to bugs and problems with Word.

    I asked about names on the win32-users mailing list the other day:
    <http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl-win32-users/2534857>
    <http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/perl-win32-users/2534858>

    My new currently best idea (the old one was
    Win32::Word::Document::Writer, I still think it's good) is:

    Win32::Word::Writer

    Win32 - because it's windows specific.

    Word - because it's Word. The alternative MsWord is redundant. Word
    is Word in this segment.

    Writer - because it follows the tradition of RTF::Writer and a lot
    of other modules. The module is primarily used for creating Word
    documents, not so much parsing them.

    (Another soon-to-be module that should fit near this namespace is
    Win32::Word::Converter::FromHTML)

    TIA,

    /J

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::Word::
::Writer          bdpOp Create Microsoft Word documents              JOHANL
