     why:

    My first project would be to create a module to read/write files
    from the Photo Album program named PhoA, found at
    http://openpage.ru/phoa/en/. Later on I would most likely extend
    this module some. I'm thinking about naming the module PhoA::Filer,
    is that a good name?

    (I've already written the base module in php, and have started
    converting this to perl. The reason for me starting in perl, was
    that I had a web server where I wanted to view the contents of the
    PhoA-album file. )

    I'm also a main developer of a wiki, namely WikkiTikkiTavi at
    http://tavi.sourceforge.net/, and I'm thinking about releasing perl
    modules related to this php-project. Haven't decided yet if and how
    to do some maintainance on the databases involved...

    I haven't been very active in the perl community lately, but I was
    a lurker for quite some years when I was a student at the
    university. I consider my perl knowledge to be somewhat above
    normal, albeit it's been a while since I programmed in perl. And I
    would of course respect any guidelines given.
