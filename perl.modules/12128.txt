Subject: Module name question
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: majcher@majcher.com (Marc Majcher)


I am preparing a module for upload that searches for and extracts
strings of text from SWF (Macromedia Flash) files.  I had originally
thought to name it SWF::Strings, after the unix command of the same
name, but I also realize that it may be used to search for other
things in the file, such as labels, tags, image or sound data, etc.
The module is currently being developed under the name SWF::Search -
does this seem appropriate, or should I split the string extraction
and search functionality into two separate modules?
