Namespaces that start with lower-case letters are reserved for "pragmas" 
such as "use strict" and are handed out by the perl5-porters only. 
Please choose a more appropriate namespace. If you need our help in 
doing so, please supply more information about your module. I can't 
access http://my.huhoo.net/archives/2008/02/perl_ip.html from my 
machine. It times out.

Best regards,
Steffen
