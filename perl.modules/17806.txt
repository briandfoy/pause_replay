The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Application::Generator
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Dynamically build CGI::Application modules
  userid:      JERLBAUM (Jesse Erlbaum)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    CGI::Application mailing list.

  similar:
    None.

  rationale:

    CGI::Application::Generator provides a means by which a
    CGI::Application module can be created from code, as opposed to
    being written by hand.

    The goal of this module is two-fold:

    1. To ease the creation of new CGI::Application modules.

    2. To allow standardization of CGI::Application coding styles to be
    more uniformly applied.

    It is also the hope of this module that Computer Assisted Software
    Engineering (CASE) tools will eventually emerge which will allow the
    development process for web-based applications to be greatly
    improved. These CASE tools could more easily convert visual notation
    (such as UML state-transition diagrams) into method calls to this
    module, thereby creating actual code.

    What This Module Does Not Do

    CGI::Application::Generator is intended to create a shell of an
    application module based on the specification you provide. It will
    not output a completely functional application without additional
    coding. It will, however, handle the creation of all the structural
    parts of your application common to all CGI::Application-based
    modules.

    CGI::Application::Generator is not a system for HTML templates. If
    you're looking for a Perl module which will allow you to separate
    Perl from HTML then I recommend you download and install
    HTML::Template.
