The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTimeX::Calendar::TravellerRPG
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Calendars of the Third Imperium + neighbors
  userid:      METAL (Seth L. Blumberg)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    This set of modules will enable date calculations in Marc Miller's
    "Third Imperium" milieu, the official setting for the _Traveller_
    tabletop role-playing game. As this is a science-fiction RPG set in
    the far future, it is possible to convert between the game's
    fictional calendars and the proleptic Gregorian calendar. I'm aiming
    for 100% round-trip accuracy and 90% API compatibility with DateTime
    and friends, so I believe this module belongs in a namespace with an
    obvious connection to DateTime.

    The DateTime::Fiction::* namespace is designated by the DateTime
    wiki as open for new modules, but in fact seems not to have been
    used for anything since 2003, when
    DateTime::Fiction::JRRTolkien::Shire was renamed to
    Date::Tolkien::Shire. It also leads to obnoxiously long package
    names like DateTime::Fiction::RPG::Traveller::Calendar. The
    recently-created DateTimeX::* namespace for packages related to but
    not conceptually part of the DateTime distribution seems like a
    better choice.

    Although some modules exist at Games::Traveller::*, they have
    nothing to do with chronology and do not use any date/time
    representations at all. I feel the conceptual connection between my
    modules and DateTime is much stronger.

The resulting entry would be:

DateTimeX::Calendar::
::TravellerRPG    cdpOp Calendars of the Third Imperium + neighbors  METAL
