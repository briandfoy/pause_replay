The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Response::HandlerChains
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: handle many HTTP response possibilities
  userid:      LXP (Alex Peters)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    GitHub repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    A distribution to allow module authors to throw an HTTP::Response
    at it, and have it run through a chain of "handlers" to find one
    that can do something with it.

    This is necessary when a request for some data could result in any
    of (i) that data, or (ii) a form with errors, or (iii) a "logged out
    due to inactivity" message, or (iv) an internal server error, or (v)
    something else being returned.

    I intend to make this module a dependency for a future version of
    an already-published distribution (Finance::Bank::Bankwest), and
    another similar distribution which I intend to initially release in
    the near future (Finance::Bank::Melbourne, pending namespace
    approval).

    I'm not hugely fond of the name I'm proposing, but I can't think of
    anything better (and something like Finance::Bank::LXP::CommonBits
    would surely be worse). "HTTP::Response" is part of the name purely
    because it deals with HTTP::Response objects.

    Elected chapter "Development Support" rather than
    "WWW/HTML/HTTP/CGI" because it's a set of (two) abstract
    superclasses, and doesn't directly perform any WWW-related work.

The resulting entry would be:
