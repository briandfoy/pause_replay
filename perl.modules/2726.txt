I've just gone an written a module which I've called...

	Net::SMTP::Receive

All it does is listen on port 25 and receive emails.  You must
subclass it and provide a deliver() method to get it to do anything.

I'm not ready to release it yet...  Needs documentation, testing, etc.

I'm writing to reserve the name.  It's not a full mail daemon, so
don't think it should be Server::Mail or Server::SMTP.  It could
be Mail::Receive I suppose, but it can't actually deliver mail.

Why did I write it???   Well, I have a program that reliably needs
to receive mail including the full envelope.  The program is under
development and thus may be up or down at any given time.  I like the
automatic retry that SMTP provides.

Code: cdpO 
description: SMTP mail receiver, does not handle delivery



You can change the code of 

	Net::Netmask to RdpO
	File::Flock to Rdpf
	File::Slurp to Rdpf

Thanks,
