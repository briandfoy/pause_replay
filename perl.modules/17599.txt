Greetings,

the Archive::Tar module has been unmaintained for the last 3 years now, 
and seeing that it's one of the modules CPANPLUS (of which I am the 
author) relies upon in a non-Unix environment, it's very unhelpfull that 
it's broken on exactly those platforms =/

I've sent the author patches to fix this but he's been unresponsive. 
I've taken the liberty to upload a 0.23 version to the CPAN which falls 
back to an older version of A::T when not on unix platforms to 
circumvent the problem, but I'd like to get a /proper/ fix in.

So, hereby I so formally request to be given ownership of the 
Archive::Tar namespace, in the hopes to fix things so they May Work Again.

regards,
Jos
