Hello brian d foy and everyone else:

    I have a new module which does two things, one serious and one
silly.  The first thing it does is to assign strings to constants
(either sigil-less constants like 'use constant' or $-prefixed
constants like 'use Readonly'):

    use ThisNewModule '$msg' => 'This is a simple message';
    print "$msg\n";

    This is no big shakes, there are modules to do that already.  It
does add a little bit of nicety in that you can specify the strings in
multiple natural languages simultaneously:

    use ThisNewModule PENCIL => {fr => 'Mon crayon est large',
                                 en => 'My pencil is big'      };
    print PENCIL, "\n";

    At compile-time, the module examines the current locale, and binds
the appropriate string to the constant.  Thereafter, the string can be
used with no performance penalty.

    Now for the silly part.  The programmer has the option of
specifying an additional variant of any of the strings.  On September
19 (International Talk Like A Pirate Day), and only on that day, the
alternate string is bound to the constant instead of the regular one.
This allows your programs to magically issue messages in pirate-speak
on the ITLAPD:

    use ThisNewModule '$ERR' => ['Unrecoverable error',
                             'Arr!  Ye'll walk the plank for that, matey!'];
    print "$ERR\n";

    So.  Here's a module that has a serious side, that of internationalization
and centralization of output strings, and adds once-a-year piratespeak as
an add-on bonus.  So is this an Acme:: module? Or a Text:: module?

Possible name choices:

    Acme::Pirate
        Obvious, but what if someone is using it for the non-pirate features?

    Text::Pirate
        Ditto

    Text::TLAP
        Hides the "pirate" aspect, somewhat, but doesn't give any clue
        to the "text" aspect.

    Text::Define
        This name focuses entirely on the useful string-binding part, and
        ignores the cutesy pirate-speak part.  This might be the best choice.

I am open to suggestions and advice.

Eric
