Greetings,

I would like to register myself as a developer for CPAN.  I am a
graduate student in the Department of Computer Sciences -- Indiana
University.  

There are a couple of modules I'm currently working on and I believe
they would be useful to other Perl developers.  One facilitates easy
access to TTF metrics, which the other builds upon Text::PDF to allow
higher-level, easier to use functionality.

Thank you very much.

Aziz,,,
