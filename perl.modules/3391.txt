Sorry for the oversight, you're registered now.

Is this the same thing as Heikki Levanto (CC'd) describes in

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-08/msg00132.html

? If not, it would be a good idea if the united Yaz hackers could come
up with namespace suggestions. We, the module list maintainers, would
then register these namespaces so that overlap and confusion is
avoided and all that.

How does that sound?
