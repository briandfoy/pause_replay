The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::Networksort
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Create inline comparisons for sorting.
  userid:      JGAMBLE (John Gamble)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The "Algorithms" namespace seemed appropriate because network sorts
    can be developed in different ways (as shown by the algorithm
    choices in the nw_comparators() function). In addition, this is is
    also a module to be studied for the different implementations of
    network sort generators.

    As for the module itself, it seems to be unique, and covers a
    subject that gets discussed on various web sites. Its output is
    useful for insertion in other programs, or it can be used to
    illustrate the results of different algorithms.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::Networksort     Rdpfp Create inline comparisons for sorting.       JGAMBLE
