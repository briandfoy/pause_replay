     why:

    Ive written an object oriented multiprocessing framework. Its is at
    its most basic level a factory class returning an implentation
    class. The name is MultiProcFactory. An class I wrote is
    MultiProc::Generic. This is the most basic of implementations. There
    are many useful features and options like support for shared memory
    between parent and child processes, capping the max number of
    processes running at any one time, logging functionality. Its
    particularly useful to my company where Ive written many classes for
    multi database/schema database crawling scripts.
