I've uploaded Text::TabTable, version 1.02

This module performs fast, database-like (SELECT with JOIN) operations on
tab-delimited files, using the standard unix text processing utilities
sort(1), join(1), cut(1), and others.  It is often faster to dump out
tables as tab-delimited files and manipulate them with this module than
to do the manipulations inside a database.  It is almost always faster
and simpler than doing similar operations in raw perl using hash tables
or the like.  Especially significant is that it mostly relies on disk
space for temporary files rather than large amounts of memory.
