Subject: Module submission File::KeePass::Agent

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::KeePass::Agent
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Application utility support for File::KeePas
  userid:      RHANDOM (Paul Seamons)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Internal work discussions

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    This module builds on the functionality provided by KeyPass, and
    adds hooks to the OS to provide KeePass auto type functionality.
    While File::KeyPass is portable, File::KeyPass::Agent has reliance
    on many OS modules. It has initial support for linux/unix but with
    hopes to add other major os variants. Eash OS receives its own
    module extension (ie File::KeyPass::Agent::unix).

The resulting entry would be:

File::KeePass::
::Agent           adpOp Application utility support for File::KeePas RHANDOM
