Subject: Module submission CPAN::Search::Tester
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CPAN::Search::Tester
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to search CPAN Tester.
  userid:      MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have the two namespace (CPAN::AuthorsSearch and
    CPAN::Testers::Search) registered in my name which I think is
    inappropriate and therefore I would like correct it. I am proposing
    the following:

    CPAN::Search::Author CPAN::Search::Tester

    Could you please register the namespace? I will then start moving
    the code over to new namespace.

    Many Thanks.

    Best Regards, Mohammad S Anwar

::Tester          bdpOp Interface to search CPAN Tester.             MANWAR
