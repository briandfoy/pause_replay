The name sounds a lot like what Encode already does, although your
module doesn't do what Encode does. Encode::FixLatin might already do
what you're after too.

Looking at the module, I think the guessing is the least interesting
part of it. That is, you don't really care to report the encoding to
the programmer. Not only that, it looks like you only handle a couple
of encodings ("the 'european' point of view"). I think you've
reimplemented Encode's from_to, but with less flexibility.

I think, based on the documentation, that the name needs to be
something about converting to UTF8.
