The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Headerinfo
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: pulls header information from media files
  userid:      WROSS (William Ross)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    Video::Info Image::Size

  rationale:

    All this module does is assemble a bunch of file readers behind a
    simple, consistent interface, but it's very useful to be able to
    throw any kind of file at it and get back dimensions, duration,
    framerate, metadata and whatever else can be discovered.

    it can read these file types, so far: gif, jpeg, png, mng, xbm,
    xpm, tiff, psd, ppm, mp3, wav, swf, mov, aiff, mpeg, asf, avi, divx

    The architecture of it is factory-based with a subclass for each
    reader type and a dispatch table mapping file types onto subclasses.
    It is meant to be very easy to extend.

    the only file reader I've actually had to write is SWF::Header,
    which is anyway based heavily on YSAS's other SWF:: modules.

    Changes to the name would be very welcome: I can't think of a good
    one.

The resulting entry would be:
