Putting Informix in the name will mean most non-Informix users
will ignore the module.

I didn't see that discussion (sadly have have little time to read
modules@perl.org these days).

I believe there is no need to "clarify" trademark issues in module
names. (In the same way that domain names that include a tradename
don't have to include the owner of the trademark.)  All that's
needed is for the module *documentation* to clarify this (README + pod).
