This line was not directed at you specifically, but rather to the wider 
set of folks who might be replying to this email.

This is correct, and happened 6 years ago. At that time both me and Matt 
were completely different people, and what's more important - the 
project was something completely different ( i.e. a rather crude proof 
of concept, compared to what it s today )

The administrative transfer *combined* with the amount of work put in by 
myself, and the utter disinterest of all other maintainers, places me 
practically, procedurally and morally in the position to unilaterally 
decide what to do with said project.

I again must stress that there has been a huge 9+ months "discussion 
period" during which nobody (besides mst) came forward expressing 
concerns regarding my plans. And I have stated unambiguously on the 
record that I am done pretending Matt has the user community interest at 
heart, nor am I longer interested what views does Matt hold, or what he 
believes. Enough is enough.

Given there has been a single complaint, by a problematic figure, not 
backed up by anyone else: Yes, I truly do not understand what you are 
saying.

I refuse to engage with Matt because he does not represent the community 
you are so valiantly trying to protect. This has little to do with 
desires, but rather has to do with being honest at this stage.

I again plead to any of: either a recent (or not so recent, but consider 
adding why you quit) committer, or heavy users who do in fact represent 
"the community" to add their voice to this thread.

Lacking the above: this entire exchange is Matt continuing to harass me 
( this time with the help of PAUSE admins ) and me continuing to not 
cave in to his bullying.

I do not share this view ( that #4 is worse ), otherwise I would not 
have gone down this path. #4 is not an ideal, but a viable chance for 
the user community to come together and take responsibility for steering 
things further.

Above you say "refuse to engage with Matt and others": again - there 
have been no "others" to date. No user or former committer has come 
forward with anything even resembling dissatisfaction since I announced 
my plans last December. Once again - the word "community" is being 
thrown rather liberally here. So far this entire conversation is based 
around a single person's delusion repeated over and over again among the 
lines of [1]:

> ...and having asked around, none of frew, ilmari or castaway, who along with

This "steering cabal" that he speaks of self-disbanded in mid 2013 and 
has not existed in any shape way or form that anyone could possibly 
interact with.

I state again that if there are actual complaints from people involved: 
I would like to hear them / about them, and I pledge to address them 
constructively. Otherwise I plan to keep the present course, time 
permitting.
