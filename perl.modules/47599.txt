The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Interval
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Interval number data type
  userid:      HOLLYKING (Brendan Leber)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org; http://www.perlmonks.org/;

  rationale:

    An interval is a new type of number like a complex number.
    Intervals are used to represent values in calculations where the
    answer can not be exactly represented. For example, the quantity 1/3
    does not have an exact binary representation so you must round the
    answer to the nearest representable value. When evaluating
    calculations with an interval the results are "rounded out" so that
    the real answer is somewhere between a lower and upper bound.
    (Roounding out is defined as rounding the lower bound down toward
    negative infinity and rounding the upper bound up to positive
    infinity.) So dividing 1 by 3 could result in the interval [0.333;
    0.334].

    Another way to view intervals is the result of performing
    calculations where the amount of error is known at the end of the
    evaluation. Taking the 1/3 example from above we know that the true
    answer lies somewhere between 0.333 and 0.334.
