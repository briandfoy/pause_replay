Hello,

I'm writing to ask for the permission to take over the maintenance of  
the MIME::Lite::HTML Perl CPAN module. I have a keen interest  
currently in keeping it up to date, relatively bug free, full of tests  
and extensible.

I've contacted the currently maintainer and CPAN author about a week  
ago, but haven't gotten a reply back for their permission to take over  
the maintenance.

my CPAN PAUSE ID is: JJSIMONI

Thanks!

Justin
