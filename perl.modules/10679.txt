Hi,

I am inquiring about registering with PAUSE to start submitting some Perl
modules I have been working on. Here is my info:

Name: John Von Essen
Email: john@essenz.com
Homepage: www.essenz.com
Preferred User-ID on CPAN: ESSENZ
Short description of what you're planning to contribute:

The first module I would like to contribute is a date conversion module I
wrote. Basically, you enter MM/DD/YYYY, and it tells you what day of the
week that date lies on. Something similar may already exist, but my module
does this in only 10 or so lines. So its to the point! I have been using
this for myself in parsing web logs, very useful.

The second (and third and so on) are Math modules for doing solving and
approximation that currently is not in CPAN. The first is a SIMPLEX Solver.
Matlab and Mathematica programs have something similar, but basically, my
simplex module will solve a MxN matrix-form linear program. (Linear Program
is a math term referring to a multi-variable, multi-constraint optimization
problem. Usually it has application in game theory and decision making
models that require a max or min solution across a variety of choices.) The
other modules have to do with approximation methods such as Bisection and
Newton methods for finding roots. A module for Gaussian Elimination. And I
would also like to makeup a module that can interface with MATLAB on UNIX.

Thats about it.
