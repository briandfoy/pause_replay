Class::WhiteHole        adpO    Blocks autoloader inheritance   MSCHWERN


So, this module might be a little silly, but I had a need.  This does
the reverse of Class::BlackHole, all unhandled methods become normal
errors as if no autoloader existed.  Useful if you've accidentally
inherited an autoloader and its making your class's error messages
look funny.  Class::DBI and Ima::DBI have such a problem.

This is obviously a module that has to be used with care.  The docs
cover the issues a bit.


NAME
       Class::WhiteHole - base class to treat unhandled method
       calls as errors

SYNOPSIS
         package Bar;

         # DBI inherits from DynaLoader which inherits from AutoLoader
         # Bar wants to avoid this accidental inheritance of AutoLoader.
         use base qw(Class::WhiteHole DBI);

DESCRIPTION
       Its possible to accidentally inherit an AUTOLOAD method.
       Often this will happen if a class somewhere in the chain
       uses AutoLoader or defines one of their own.  This can
       lead to confusing error messages when method lookups fail.

       Sometimes you want to avoid this accidental inheritance.
       In that case, inherit from Class::WhiteHole.  All
       unhandled methods will produce normal Perl error messages.

CAVEATS
       Be sure to have Class::WhiteHole before the class from
       which you're inheriting AUTOLOAD in the ISA.  Usually
       you'll want Class::WhiteHole to come first.

       If your class inherits autoloaded routines this class may
       cause them to stop working.  Choose wisely before using.
