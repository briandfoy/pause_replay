Hi Dick,

Sorry to take so long to reply. This has been sitting in my inbox, =
because I didn=E2=80=99t want to just fire off a quick reply. But then I =
did reply at all :-(

> The author of Net-FullAuto-1.0000327 has continued, for two years, to =
upload an inexorable stream of incomprehensible drivel.
>=20
> CPAN is being abused here; there is no meaningful attempt to create =
anything useful.

It seems like Brian is creating something that=E2=80=99s useful for him.

Most things on CPAN started life as something that was useful for the =
author, and they shared it in the hope that others might as well.

Many of us looking at Net::FullAuto wouldn=E2=80=99t consider using it. =
Some people have tried to point out some of the problems, and different =
approaches he should be taking:

    https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D100658

Part of the =E2=80=9CCPAN philosophy=E2=80=9D is a low barrier to entry. =
As a result there are a lot of questionable things on CPAN, but =
sometimes they evolve into something good. Either by being adopted by =
someone else, or by the original author being nudged and learning a lot =
as they work on it.

> CPAN guidelines for authors are not being followed.

There are a lot of guidelines related to CPAN, but very few rules. Even =
though Net::FullAuto avoids or breaks many conventions, that=E2=80=99s =
still not grounds for removing it from CPAN. We just choose not to use =
it.

> The Makefile.PL can only be characterised as malicious.

I=E2=80=99d probably classify it as =E2=80=9Cmisguided=E2=80=9D rather =
than malicious, but I know what you mean. I really wouldn=E2=80=99t want =
anyone to run that!

> IMHO, this is one of those rare occasions where robust action by CPAN =
librarians would be fully justified.
> As a minimum, authors maintainer rights over Net-FullAuto should be =
removed to prevent further uploads, and existing versions deleted.

Some of the other PAUSE admins will tell you that there are times when I =
wish there were a firmer hand on the tiller of CPAN. But they always =
remind me that that=E2=80=99s not our way. And they=E2=80=99re right.

A better approach would be to write one or more blog posts about what =
behaviour is appropriate in Makefile.PL and other parts of a =
distribution. And how to decompose applications, and what sort of things =
should go in CPAN modules, and what things should stay private. I=E2=80=99=
m not saying *you* should write such posts, but I think they=E2=80=99d =
be useful and of general interest.

Such blog posts could use Net::FullAuto as examples of what not to do, =
both in an attempt to educate/help Brian, and also to ensure people know =
to avoid it.

I completely understand your frustration with Net::FullAuto, and desire =
to protect CPAN users from it. But we can=E2=80=99t start putting fences =
around CPAN, to stop people uploading because we don=E2=80=99t like the =
way they write software.

Cheers,
Neil
