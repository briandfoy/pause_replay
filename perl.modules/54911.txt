The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Regexp::Wildcards
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Converts wildcards expressions to regexps
  userid:      VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    You can contact me on #perl @ FreeNode (Prof_Vince)

  similar:
    Similar but incomplete tools are provided as boni of Net::FTPServer,
    File::Find::Match::Util, Text::Buffer

  rationale:

    There is no real module for such a common feature, which leads to
    each module providing its own helper function. I tried to make it as
    complete as possible, with complete escaping and handling of
    brackets. Regexp::Wildcards is a name that describes well the link
    between those two sets of matching rules.

  enteredby:   VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 15 22:26:08 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Regexp::
::Wildcards       Rdpfp Converts wildcards expressions to regexps    VPIT
