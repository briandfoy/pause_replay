No, he is using a version object from the version module.

  use version; $VERSION = qv('1.0.1');

But the issue, at least with cpansearch, is that this line is
eval'd inside a Safe compartment. So it fails with the use because
we don't want to allow people to do that.

I have a potential fix for cpansearch, but I do not know what PAUSE
does. I suspect it will have knock on effect to the CPAN/CPANPLUS
modules too and any other application that uses the metadata created
by pause and is expecting a number.
