Your submission format looks fine to me. However, most people produce it
by filling in a form (which also makes it easier to produce "Rpdfa"
style DSLIP strings by giving you radio buttons with verbose
descriptions): go to https://pause.perl.org/ (you may have to accept the
SSL certificate first), login with your PAUSE ID, then select "Register
Namespace". Then fill out the form; by submitting it, you will cause
email to be sent to modules@perl.org automatically. That email will also
contain URLs at the bottom which enable PAUSE admins to accept a module
proposal quickly. Just something to consider for the future ;)

Cheers,
Philip
