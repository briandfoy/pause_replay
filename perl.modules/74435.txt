The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::ContinuedFraction
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Create and Manipulate Continued Fractions
  userid:      JGAMBLE (John Gamble)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Name change from Math::Continuedfraction after discussion with
    brian d foy. The former name has been scheduled for deletion. The
    next version of the module will be uploaded once the change becomes
    official.

  enteredby:   JGAMBLE (John Gamble)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 20 01:27:49 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::ContinuedFraction bdpOp Create and Manipulate Continued Fractions    JGAMBLE
