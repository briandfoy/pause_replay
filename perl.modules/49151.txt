Hi Olivier,

Daniel Muey reported to us that he is offering to upload a
maintainance release of Apache::Admin::Config. Shall we make him
co-maintainer or even pass maintainership completely to him?

Daniel says that there is a serious bug in the package and he has
already reported it via RT (see below).

Because this bug report is now already 6 weeks old, and Daniel's offer
seems decent and unintrusive, I'm intending to give him
co-maintainership status if you do not answer this mail until next
Friday. I hope this is OK for you.

Thanks,
--
