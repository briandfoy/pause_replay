I think it is possible.
But I think the first we need, is to make XML::RPC modular, with ability to 
replace xml-parser and xml-composer. I think the ability to use pure-perl 
implementation is not less important, then speed.
I can do XML::RPC modular and add 2 implementations in box: default and my.
