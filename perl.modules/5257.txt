	CGI::Portable is an excellent choice I think.  Everyone who has any
experience developing with perl on an enterprise level has been waiting a
long time for something which helps serve as a layer between their perl
scripts and their platform  (unless they've already made their own).  Perl
should be more polymorphic in the way it handles pathnames and operating
system calls.  Python does much better, but if someone could help us all out
by creating an emulation environment for scripts to run in -- such as the
functionality you describe in your RFC, we could create an OS object, or an
ENV object first and feed it a CGI object reference as one of the parameters
to its constructor, using the ENV object to receive all method calls for the
CGI class and polymorphically act as the go between for the CGI object and
the operating system your scripts are running on.  Kudos Darren.  Very
insightful.  Should have been done long ago imho.
