The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Coro
  DSLIP:       adchp
  description: create an manage coroutines
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Thread

  rationale:

    This module implements very simple coroutines (very similar to the
    modula-2 NEWPROCESS/TRANSFER model). Additional modules
    (Coro::Process, Coro::Signal, Coro::Semaphore) provide more useful
    abstractions and server as example implementations of process
    synchroinzation techniques.

    Unlike the thread module this module does not require a special
    perl executable, not even -DMULTIPLICITY. It is very simple (as you
    can tell by it's size) and can, due to it's low-level API, be used
    to build very different things. Maybe someday it works together with
    Event to get rid of Event's callbacks.

    It's still in an early stage of development (just 4 hours old) but
    is already used in a complex program where it linearizes the
    aio-callbacks.

The resulting entry would be:
