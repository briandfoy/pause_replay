I figure it's about time I put something back in.  Could you please
register me as a CPAN contributor.  Here's the details requested in
http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/04pause.html


Name: Andrew McNaughton
email: andrew@squiz.co.nz
home page: no personal page, but http://www.scoop.co.nz/ is my main 
           project
preferred ID: AMcN
planned contributions: Info-Retrieval tools, assorted other stuff
                

I'm close to having employer approval for releasing a Metadata storage and
search architecture written in perl.  It's written such that the guts of
it will be applicable to a great many projects.
