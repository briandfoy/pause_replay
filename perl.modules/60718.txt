Hi Steffen,

Malcom was reachable, and he wanted to do by himself today.
Now you have beaten him.

Thanks!

Hi Andreas,
Nice to meet you Reini,
Sorry for the delay: I'm afraid I don't really follow Perl
development these days so personal email about Perl stuff sort of
batches up for a while. I'll go through the PAUSE web app tomorrow
and figure out how to do the necessary transfers. I did one such
transfer a month or two ago so I think I can get it to work.

Regards,
--Malcolm
