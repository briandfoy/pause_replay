And so it should be; I just confirmed this by creating a test distro 
(using Module::Starter::PBP).

Upgrading YAML or switching to YAML::Syck won't change the behavior 
(which would have to happen in Module::Build or EU::MM), since the 
$VERSION is explicitly created as a version object.

The PAUSE indexer should really be using version objects to perform the 
$VERSION comparisons.  What we did in Module::Build was to create a 
subclass of version that uses the original string representation when 
stringifying, but uses the default version object handling for 
comparison purposes (this prevents the "trailing zeros" problem in 
floating point versions).

My machine at home has gone AWOL (I better not have lost another HD!), 
so I can't do much from here (besides, I'm technically at $WORK).  I'll 
download the PAUSE indexer source tonight and propose a patch...
