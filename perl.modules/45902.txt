The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Download::Queue
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Download files with one or more workers.
  userid:      JOHANL (Johan Lindström)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    PerlMonks, maybe a mailing list

  similar:
    LWP etc, WWW:URLToys, maybe some spidering and link checking modules

  rationale:

    Download files asynchronously in a queued fashion.

    Your application (or a CLI script) can add files to the queue, and
    other workes will process the queue and actually download the files.

    The original name was WWW::Download::Queue, but I changed my mind
    to Net::Download::Queue since it's not inherently limited to the Web
    (whatever that means in terms of protocols etc, it uses the LWP for
    the actual downloads).

    /J

  enteredon:   Sun Nov 13 21:09:27 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Download::
::Queue           bdpOp Download files with one or more workers.     JOHANL
