Sorry, I should have given the example in the rationale.

I use HTML::Mason a lot and I often find myself doing this a lot:

if ( @list )
{
    foreach ( @list )
    {
        _do_something();
    }
}
else
{
    _error();
}

I think the frustration was enough to build this module... scratching an
itch you might say :)
