The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::FSM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Deterministic top-down parser based on a FSM
  userid:      PSCUST (Paulo Custodio)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parse::RecDescent Parse::Eyapp

  rationale:

    Spin-off of the deterministic top-down parser based on a
    pre-computed finite state machine that was developped for the
    CPU::Z80::Assembler module.

    Uses a different approach to lexing than Parse::RecDescent - input
    is read incrementally one line at a time and the tokens are pairs of
    [type, value], similar to the usage in Parse::Eyapp.

    Does not do back-tracking - the parser is quicker and the assembly
    language is deterministic; each token determines the sentence that
    can be recognized from that point in the input.

    The provided lexer uses Perl 5.10 regexp features to match the next
    token in one big regexp - quicker than the usual Perl loop checking
    for each token type. It can be easily sub-classed to recognize a
    different set of tokens.

    The lexer supports recursive file includes and keeps track of the
    current file name and line number.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
::FSM             bdpOp Deterministic top-down parser based on a FSM PSCUST
