The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Coordinates::VandH
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Convert and Manipulate telco V&H coordinates
  userid:      PTIMMINS (Paul Timmins)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    #mi2600 on IIP (http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/)

  similar:

  rationale:

    V and H stand for Vertical and Horizontal. It's a weird geographic
    coordinate system used by phone companies rather than latitude and
    longitude. I don't know why they use it, but they do. (I think it
    had something to do with mileage calculations being easier) To quote
    a few definitions of what V+H is: V & H MILEAGE: A representation of
    the vertical and horizontal mileage between two points based on a
    geometrically computed approximation of the actual airline miles
    between two points. Carriers (Telephone Companies) normally keep a
    set of V & H coordinates in the local offices. V & H COORDINATES:
    The Vertical and horizontal grid points used to determine
    straight-line mileage between locations. And this information is
    normally used for mileage-sensitive product pricing.

    Explains how the system works graphically.
