The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Prospect
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Interface to Prospect protein threading pkg
  userid:      REECE (Reece Hart)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/prospect-if

  similar:
    Bio::

  rationale:

    Tim- I ran this by the bioperl community and developers' list and
    no one seemed to care about calling it Bio::Prospect. I believe this
    choice is the best comopromise among many factors that we've already
    discussed. I'll elaborate if you need more detail.

    Bio::Prospect is uses other Bio:: modules (from bioperl) and is in
    that sense related to them. There are no other modules with similar
    functionality (i.e., execution, manipulation, and visualization of
    protein threading alignments generated by Prospect).

    Thanks, Reece
