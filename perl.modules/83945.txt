The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Message::JSON
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: structured messages that stringify to JSON
  userid:      DOZZIE (Stanisław Klekot)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Log::Message::Structured

  rationale:

    Log::Message::JSON is a container that used in string context
    instantly converts itself to JSON document, while can be used as
    normal hash(ref) at the same time.

    Main use for such a container is to feed with a single log message
    (the message contains an internal structure, i.e. fields with
    values) different appenders in Log::Log4perl framework: ones that
    operate on strings (e.g. flat file output) and ones that operate on
    a structured message (e.g. Fluentd, logstash or GELF/Graylog2
    output).

    As an additional profit, flat-string logs get better parseability
    when events were created with this module.

    Compared to Log::Message::Structured, this module has much less
    dependencies and requires no preparation (like creating own
    subclass) before using.

  enteredon:   Sat Dec 29 00:51:40 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Log::Message::
::JSON            Rdphp structured messages that stringify to JSON   DOZZIE
