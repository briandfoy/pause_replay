The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBI::Safe
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Handles all DB disconnections transparently
  userid:      SYBER (Pronin Oleg)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have not seen any DBI module that allows you not to think about
    database connections lost in any cases. There are modules that just
    checks database connection before any query. This module handles
    'prepare' and 'execute' stages and it is 100% guaranteed that your
    request will be executed and result from DB will be returned. Even
    if your application lost connection between 'prepare' and 'execute'
    calls. In case of transaction it simply reconnects and allow you to
    know if the transaction can be safely restarted. Module can be used
    as DBI.

The resulting entry would be:

DBI::
::Safe            bdpOp Handles all DB disconnections transparently  SYBER
