Hello!

I received ownership of XML::Dumper from Jon Eizenzopf a few months ago,
however that module has not been registered in my name. I'd like to
modify the meta data for that module, but received the following error:

  Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to MIKEWONG. 
  Please note, only modules that are already registered in the 
  module list can be edited here. If you believe, this is a bug, 
  please contact modules@perl.org.

I would be grateful if you could arrange the transfer of ownership of
the module to be reflected in PAUSE so I can make the metadata changes.
Thanks!

- m.
