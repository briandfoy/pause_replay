The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::Table
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Utility to create table layouts in PDF::API2
  userid:      RHYTHMAN (Daemmon Hughes)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    PDF::Template

  rationale:

    The impetus for this module was the need to output database reports
    in pdf format. I needed to take results of an sql select and
    automatically create a multipage pdf document which presented the
    data in a table format. I did not find any cpan modules that could
    automatically format the data, especially taking care of tedious
    things like figuring out column widths and adding as many pages as
    required based on the content.

    This module uses the approach of automating multipage layouts,
    similar to a word processor, rather than requiring the user figure
    out how many pages are needed and laying out each one maually. For
    formatting it uses a programmtic approach (passing css-like
    parameters to a method) rather than the template-based approach of
    PDF::Template.

    Lastly, this module uses PDF:API2 rather than the commercial
    library PDFLib which requires a license fee for commercial use.
