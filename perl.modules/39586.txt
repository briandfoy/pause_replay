(apologies if this isn't threaded correctly - my cpan.org email address 
wasn't set to forward anywhere, and if there's a way to read it directly, I 
couldn't figure it out.)

Hmm, perhaps, but Geo:: is under Miscellaneous, not I18N (which is 
probably why I didn't find it when I looked for suitable namespaces). I'm 
concerned that others won't find mine either if I put it there. If neither 
Locale:: nor I18N:: look good to you, perhaps Geography:: would? (again, I 
have nothing against Geo:: per se, I just don't feel Miscellaneous is the 
right toplevel category.)

Having said that, I'll go with whatever you decide. I would still like 
::PostalAddress:: in addition to ::PostalAddress.pm (in whichever toplevel 
you give me) however.

Thanks. Right now, I'm working on a test suite. (Or would, if the UPU web 
site wasn't 503ing at me.)
