It's indeed not trivial how to do it. Some would call it convoluted:-(

1. use "View Permissions" to find out who owns it with which kind of
   permission. In this case it was TIMB with "first-come" permission.

2. Use "Select User/Action" to switch as TIMB to the "share_perms"
   action.

3. There you can, e.g. select the "Pass maintainership status to
   somebody else" button which I did.

4. The menu then lets you select the module to pass, and also lets you
   type in the new maintainer. I chose "base" and typed MSCHWERN.

5. Use again "Select User/Action" to switch as MSCHWERN to "reindex"

6. Select Class-Fields-0.14.tar.gz to be reindexed.
