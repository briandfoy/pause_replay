The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Wire10
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: Pure Perl driver for MySQL, Sphinx & Drizzle
  userid:      DUBEX (Dubex A/S)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a driver for connecting to a mysql server.

    It is not very sensitive to server details, and can therefore also
    be used to connect to other daemons that speak mysql wire protocol
    version 10.

    It is used as the core driver for DBD::Wire10, but is also
    perfectly usable stand-alone if you want a simpler setup without the
    DBD layer.

    It differs from existing CPAN mysql drivers in that this is a
    completely working driver written entirely in Perl.

    Please add to the modules list.

    Ideas, test results, performance measurements etc are very welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
