That's a new one. Usually, the original author doesn't come back to sort 
things out. Much appreciated :)

I'm sending a copy of this to the GMGRD mail address on CPAN

I will transfer primary maintainer status back to you so you can manage 
things (since you're the original author and copyright holder).

This means that GMGRD retains co-maintenance permissions. I'll also 
assign co-maint permissions to LLAP.

Best regards,
Steffen
