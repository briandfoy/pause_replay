The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Roma
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Helps handle differences in SQL dialects.
  userid:      DSNOPEK (David Snopek)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailing list, GNU Arch repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    A root level namespace was choosen mostly to match the Python API,
    of which this code is originally a port. The name itself was choosen
    because this was my response to a similar library written in PHP
    called Creole.

    It is my opinion that it should have a top-level namespace for
    these reasons:

    * I intend to port this to as many programming languages as
    possible and match the interfaces as closely as possible.

    * There are 40 *.pm's in Roma, some of them 4 levels deep. Using a
    root namespace is simply much easier on the programmer who has to
    type it.

The resulting entry would be:

Roma              bdpOg Helps handle differences in SQL dialects.    DSNOPEK
