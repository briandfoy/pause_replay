The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Env::ElaborateDump
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: emit snapshot of %ENV in a consistent format
  userid:      OSMUNDOHW (Osmundo Hackworthy)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/osmundohw/deed

  similar:

  rationale:

    Devel::Env::ElaborateDump

    (in namespace Devel::Env, which has not yet ever been used on CPAN,
    as far as the author could discover).

    This package would be used to create a snapshot of the process
    environment (perl's %ENV) for any reason that this would be
    desirable. Several scenarios the author has thought of include:

    - submitting reports of problems building, installing, or using
    software packages;

    - re-recreating a build or testing environment that was used
    previously;

    - asking for help on mailing lists or on similar venues, where
    detailed information about many aspects of your environment / system
    are often needed, and it is not always known by you in advance, what
    to mention in your submitted requests for support.

    Using YAML or JSON is an attractive approach in order to create a
    text record snapshot of the environment that is a consistent and
    (readily) program-parsable format while still allowing easy human
    readability.

    The package to be uploaded will implement such an Env Dump using
    YAML.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::Env::
