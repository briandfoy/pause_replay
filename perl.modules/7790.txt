Hi,

I am working on RCS file parsing. I had to do it cause I have 3,000
files with about 1 million revisions and I have to check them out one by
one and collect information. Using existing Rcs module is very slow due
to system calls to co for every revision. There is VCS::Rcs
which I haven't tested but looks like it makes syscalls to 'co' too.

Any way, what i do is to parse all the revisions into core and process
them there. Which is about 10 times faster then using standart 'co' (or
Rcs.pm). Ofcourse if you are talking about checking out atleast 20-25 
revisions from the same revision file.

The modules I wrote -for my own usage- are:
XXX::Parser           # this the main interface
XXX::YappRcsParser    # produced from a Yapp grammar (Yapp::Parse)
XXX::Deltatext        # impliments RCS deltatext algorithms

Would you please suggest;

1- Shall I post them to CPAN, do you think others might use it?
2- If so, do you think RCS::Parser is a good name to use or not?

Thank you,

Ziya Suzen
