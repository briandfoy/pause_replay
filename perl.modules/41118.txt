If you love horses, show support for the horses in your state. $5 goes a long way for your local horse rescue. We are located in Mississippi.

We currently have horses ready for placement, as well as needing foster homes for some of them. 

There are many ways you can help from sponsorships, shopping for any product online as well as helping by volunteering. Please check our website at http://www.perfectharmony-ms.org.

It takes a community!
