The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::TimeTick
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Output timing information
  userid:      PJS (Peter Scott)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Benchmark::Timer

  rationale:

    A souped-up version of a module published in my book "Perl Medic",
    wherein it was called Benchmark::TimeTick. I don't think that's the
    best name; in fact it is not for benchmarking so much as providing a
    schedule of when a program reaches various locations you've marked.
    The timing information is not therefore trustworthy for benchmarking
    in that it is the product of only one iteration, but it is helpful
    in figuring out how long the program takes to reach various points
    and is a simpler and more succinct interface than Benchmark::Timer.
    Can also be disabled easily so that timing calls can be left in.

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
