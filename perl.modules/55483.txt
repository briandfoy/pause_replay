The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::MuldisD
  DSLIP:       cmong
  description: Formal spec of Muldis D relational DBMS lang
  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    #perl6@freenode, anywhere Muldis::DB is discussed

  similar:
    Muldis::DB

  rationale:

    My DBMS written in twin Perl 5 and Perl 6 versions, Muldis::DB, has
    a large redundant component of the 2 versions which is pure
    documentation. That documentation is the specification of the new
    programming language Muldis D, which Muldis::DB implements, and
    which I also anticipate turning into a Parrot-hosted language and/or
    analagous Perl array-ref based AST representation or whatever.

    I would like to split off the language spec into its own namespace
    and distribution, so there is just one copy of the spec that all the
    various language implementations can refer to externally. The
    language spec is analagous to the Perl 6 Synopsis docs, and the
    ANSI/ISO SQL spec, or whatever, while Muldis::DB itself is simply an
    implementation, as per Pugs or Oracle or whatever.

    Note that my requested "Language::MuldisD" is a pure documentation
    distro, which is written in Pod, and the pod files are named into
    the requested namespace.

    The module name should include "Muldis D" in it, since that is the
    language name, but otherwise can vary if reasonable. I figured that
    "Language::MuldisD" is a nice terse description of what the
    namespace is being used for, something to do with that language
    specifically and not just an implementation. I considered but would
    like to reject "Muldis::D" as it is too similar to "Muldis::DB",
    unless I decide afterwards to drop the other name and call that
    something else.

    Note that I recognize that other existing "Language::*" distros
    tend to contain implementations of Perl bindings to the other
    language, which mine does not, though it does help to spec such. But
    I still don't think there is a better name for me.

    I certainly don't want a name that is subservient to the namespace
    of an implementation. Staying with eg "Muldis::DB::Language" makes
    as much sense as using "Perl6::Pugs::Synopsis3" or whatever for the
    Perl 6 spec.

    That said, for category, while I picked "Database Interfaces" for
    now, I'm willing to live with a different category if you think
    better. (If that's the only issue you have, you could approve this
    and I can the category after.)

    Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
