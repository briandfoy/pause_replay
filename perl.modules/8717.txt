Subject: Module submission Tie::Hash::TwoWay

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Hash::TwoWay
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Two-way associative mapping hash
  userid:      TEODOR (Teodor Zlatanov)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    The Tie::Hash::TwoWay module will allow two-way mapping between two
    disjoint sets, e.g. mapping "Asimov" to "scientist" and "novelist"
    will automatically create the reverse mappings of "scientist" and
    "novelist" pointing to "Asimov". Furthermore, deleting a mapping
    will delete the reverse mappings as well, including any keys without
    mappings.

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::Hash::
::TwoWay          bdprp Two-way associative mapping hash             TEODOR
