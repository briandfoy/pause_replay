I've written a module to filter output on a filehandle. I think it would be
a nice addition to CPAN.

Here's my information:

    The module I've written is (tentatively) called Filter::Handle,
    and it allows users to install an output handler to filter
    output on a particular filehandle. For example, you could
    install a handler to prepend every statement sent to print
    with the line number of the calling script where it was
    invoked.

    DSLI: cdpr
    Description: Filter output filehandles

    I've been discussing issues of interface and implementation
    on PerlMonks. I've received some contributions/comments from
    merlyn and chromatic. chromatic, in particular, expressed
    interest in such a module. So did Adam. (These are PerlMonks
    uses, btw).

bye,
Ben
