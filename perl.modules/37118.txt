Also, re a previous post, the module this one builds on:

A new top level namespace works for me. Then I could group the two
parsers together. Either iCal or iCalendar is fine.

In that case, the two modules could be

   iCal:Parser:asData [or iCal::asData, or iCal::Parser ?]
and
   iCal::Parser:SAX

I am not tied to either/any name, so I would certainly accept any
suggestions.

Basically the modules are iCalendar -> hash parser and a hash -> SAX
generator (with an XML->html calendar generator to follow), so whatever
is the best namespacing is ok w/ me.
