Hi,

assertions and assertions::activate modules are included on core 
perl from version 5.9.0.

Now, I have released them as an standalone package on CPAN but 
they are not going indexed because the namespaces were assigned 
to the perl pumpking (HVDS) that first uploaded them as part of 
perl 5.9.0.

So, could I have the namespaces transferred to me (SALVA)?

Cheers,

    - Salvador
