     why:

    Long time watcher/tester feeling the urge to finally contribute.
    I've taught myself Perl over the last five years by following the
    development of several applications, most notably Movable Type. What
    first got me turned on to the magic of CPAN was learning to program
    plugins which utilized existing code, most notably
    Data::ObjectDriver. I work for a telephone/internet company in the
    mid-Atlantic region of the USA and do a lot of on the job developing
    of Network monitoring and troubleshooting tools. Many of these tools
    use and improve on the existing Net::* framework. While this
    framework is well established, my main interest lies in coding
    modules specifically to be used in untrusted (or say minimally
    trusted) environments -- Places where powerful access to the full
    suite of network diagnostics is needed but also needs to be
    carefully provisioned.
