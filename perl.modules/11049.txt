The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::EZForm
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: easy to use form creation and processing
  userid:      STHOMAS (Steve Thomas)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.*

  similar:
    CGI.pm

  rationale:

    This is intended as a light-weight, east-to-use alternative to the
    commonly used CGI.pm. It doesn't do half of what that module does,
    but what it does do is provide just the functions needed for drawing
    and processing forms, which makes it light-weight compared to
    CGI.pm. It also provides for reasonable defaults for many field
    attributes, meaning less typing. And it also (optionally) draws your
    form in a nice table format, making for a more readable layout.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::EZForm          RdpOp easy to use form creation and processing     STHOMAS
