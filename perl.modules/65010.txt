Hi,

I've been trying to get into contact with the maintainer of this module 
for a long, long time but without success.

I have a small patch for it (specifically, to make it buildable by 
mingw) that would probably make sense to get put into a new version, say 
a 0.21 or so...

I'm unclear on how to go about it since the maintainer is 
non-responsive...please advise?

TIA,
