This is the third time I have submitted this module for registration, yet
still:
"Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to DANB"

I have waited three weeks, yet no responses were posted to either of my last
messages.

New Module:
Proposed name Simulate::ConwayLife
(this would require a new Simulate::  category)

Otherwise it could also be put under
Statistics::ConwayLife
or Games::ConwayLife (though I hesitate to call it a game...)
(or maybe another idea?)

It simulates life using John Conway's simple cell growth algorithm.

Module list format description:
Simulate::ConwayLife | aDPr | Simulates life using Conway's algorithm. |
