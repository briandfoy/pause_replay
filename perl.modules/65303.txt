Both of these modules are broken as described in a previous email
(attached.)

I've also attached some documentation for my request (emails sent to the
 authors, without action being taken.)

My CPAN id is RKITOVER.

Thank you.

Hello, my CPAN id is RKITOVER.

Net::SSH2 is broken in perl 5.10, and I've patched this:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36614

9 months ago. The author (czth) promised to look at it but nothing
transpired.

I'd like a comaint bit for this module so I can release a fixed version,
and take care of some other outstanding issues as well.

POE::Session::YieldCC has been broken for a very long time due to API
changes in Coro and POE. I've made some very simple changes to get it to
work again:
https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43100

but got no response from the author, the module is abandoned and I'd like
to take over maintenance of it.

Hi David,

I'm wondering how I can help with getting the patch in RT bug #36614
applied. This fixes the channel problem in 5.10.I have Mac OS X and
Linux machines available for testing and can run anything Free in
VirtualBox. I've tested the patch on my machines and it fixes the
problem.

Hi Ben,

I made a patch to get things working again with newer Coro and POE.

Posted to rt:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43100

If you don't want to maintain anymore, can you give me a comaint bit?

My CPAN ID is RKITOVER.

Cheers.
