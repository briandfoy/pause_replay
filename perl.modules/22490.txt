The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IANA::PortNumbers
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: translate ports to services and vice versa
  userid:      FOX (Adam J. Foxson)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    #perl, modules@perl.org, Kurt Starsinic

  similar:
    Net::servent

  rationale:

    Net::IANA::PortNumbers uses the official IANA port number registry
    at the protocol/number assignments directory. It translates port
    numbers to services and descriptions, and services to port numbers
    and descriptions, among other things.

    Net::servent offers similar functionality but is less portable,
    less flexible, and relies on usually archaic and less comprehensive
    data in /etc/services

    Many improvements have been made after the initial release, based
    upon feedback from Kurt Starsinic, and others.

  enteredby:   FOX (Adam J. Foxson)
  enteredon:   Wed Jul 23 16:19:26 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::IANA::
::PortNumbers     bdpOg translate ports to services and vice versa   FOX
