The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::Any
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: web-oriented data encoding/hashing functions
  userid:      PCSJJ (Paul Craig)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    I'm offering a place to organize a few things. The only original
    stuff intellectually is the double url encoding. But this is about
    organization not intellectual property.

  rationale:

    The most succinct suggestion I received from a PAUSE admin was
    Encode::Any.

    I think Encode::Any should be listed because it will create a
    common way to encode/hash data commonly used by web applications.

    These are some of the current modules that are being used.

    use Encode; use URI::Escape; use MIME::Base32; use Math::Base36;
    use MIME::Base64; use HTML::Entities; use HTML::Entities::Numbered;
    use Digest::MD5; use Digest::SHA1;

    I'm adding more functions as I need them by standardizing the use
    of another module. This has primarily been made in an attempt to
    organize my code and achieve maintainability.

    Thank you for your consideration.
