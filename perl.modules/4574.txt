module:	netfilter
desc:		netfilter	adpO	Netfilter Interface for Perl	

Module port of id/J/JESSICAQ/IPChains-0.5.tar.gz
Providing an interface to the iptables() binary.
Does not support/require a C module at this time,
however it is being considered as an alternative
to the direct binary interface.

All options standard to netfilter/iptables-1.2 are
included; as are all "default" modules. (LOG, REJECT,
etc).

Support for ipv6 not included in this release.  The 
module is now 100% complete, and in testing.  If you
would like a copy to review; you're welcome to it; as
long as you'll give me feedback/suggestions...  :)

Question: Module is currently named as "netfilter".
If you believe it best to use Net::netfilter, please
advise.


I'm also in the Early stages of a Net::firewall module
which will incorporate the netfilter module.  This uses
an MLDBM (currently) database to store structures for
rules to implement.  A user interface (via webmin) is
planned for configuration.

note: Web site not currently up; these modules are taking
up all my time atm.  That will be the address used.
