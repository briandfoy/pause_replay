quotes[6] = "Each time you are honest and conduct yourself with honesty, a success force will drive you toward greater success.  Each time you lie, even with a little white lie, there are strong forces pushing you toward failure. (Joseph Sugarman)";

</B><B><FONT SIZE="2"><I>Once upon a time, the Swiss produced over 90 percent of the world's watches. So the inventor of the digital watch first went to them with his proposal. The Swiss didn't bother looking at it because they knew that such a different idea would never catch on. The Swiss lost over 50 percent market share and millions of dollars to the Japanese, who did take the time to look.

<P><B><FONT SIZE="2"><I>       Here are three reasons parents, City officials, religious leaders, and children should take the time to look at what Lee has to say:
</I></FONT></B></P>

</I></B></P>
