I'm looking at contributing a Dice module for simulating dice rolls.
I know there is one already with Games::Dice, but mine is better, and
will be public domain.

It's already written and tested.  I'm planning to post to c.l.p.modules
to get some feedback on a proper spot in the namespace for it.  I'll
also be mailing the author of Games::Dice for his thoughts on the
namespace and licensing of his module.
