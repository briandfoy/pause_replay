The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Shoehorn
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Massage the dimensions and type of an image
  userid:      ASCOPE (Aaron Straup Cope)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Image::Magick Image::Magick::Thumbnail

  rationale:

    Description :

    Image::Shoehorn will massage the dimensions and filetype of an
    image, optionally creating one or more "scaled" images.

    It uses Image::Magick to do the heavy lifting and provides a single
    "import" objet method to hide a number of tasks from the user.

    Rationale :

    Just before I decided to send this message, I noticed that Lee
    Goddard had just released Image::Magick::Thumbnail. Although there
    is a certain amount of overlap, creating thumbnails is only a part
    of the functionality of Image::Shoehorn.

    Image::Shoehorn is designed for taking a single image, optionally
    converting it's file type and resizing it, and then creating one or
    more "scaled" versions of the (modified) image.

    One example would be a photo-gallery application where the gallery
    may define (n) number of scaled versions. In a mod_perl context, if
    the scaled image had not already been created, the application might
    create the requested image for the request and then register a
    cleanup handler to create the remaining "scaled" versions.
    Additionally, scaled images may be defined as "25%", "x50", "200x"
    or "25x75" (Apache::Image::Shoehorn is next...)

    Shoehorn?! :

    This package started life as internal library named Image::Import;
    designed to slurp and munge images into a database. It's not a very
    exciting name and, further, is a bit ambiguous.

    So, I started fishing around for a better name and for a while I
    was thinking about Image::Tailor - a module for taking in the "hem"
    of an image, of fussing and making an image fit properly.

    When I asked the Dict servers for a definition of "tailor", it
    returned a WordNet entry "make fit for a specific purpose [syn:
    {shoehorn}]" and that was that.

  enteredby:   ASCOPE (Aaron Straup Cope)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun  7 12:34:37 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::Shoehorn        bdpOp Massage the dimensions and type of an image  ASCOPE
