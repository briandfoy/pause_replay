     why:

    I am close to being ready to submit a module that implements the
    Dashrep language, which is a descriptive programming language that
    expands hyphenated phrases, such as
    "rectangle-outline-attention-begin", into any kind of text or code,
    such as HTML, XML, JavaScript, C, bytecode, etc. The hyphenated
    phrases can appear anywhere within any kind of text. (The phrase
    "hyphen-here" provides a hyphen within non-replaced phrases.) Text
    that does not look like a hyphenated phrase is retained as-is.

    For a description of the Dashrep language, please visit
    www.Dashrep.org.

    I, Richard Fobes, created this language over many years. I now use
    it at www.VoteFair.org and www.NegotiationTool.com to dynamically
    generate interactive web pages. Perl code, without using any CPAN
    modules, provides all the executable functionality.

    I used early versions of the Dashrep language to generate
    formatting code for my two books, "The Creative Problem Solver's
    Toolbox" and "Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections." I've
    also used the language for other purposes, and many further uses are
    possible.

    Eric Wilhelm, who leads the local Portand, Oregon Perl Mongers
    group, has given me verbal advice about getting the module into
    CPAN, including suggesting that I get a CPAN account.

    FYI, I've been programming in Perl for about 15 years, and
    currently it's my favorite language.
