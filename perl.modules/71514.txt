Hi Todd,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner, you caught me just before I =
left for a short vacation, and your mail got stuck in the pile.

What you're suggesting is actually a very good idea. I keep planning to =
do something about Net::Ident, but I never seem to get around to =
actually doing it. I have a repository somewhere that I was editing a =
while ago, but I never got around to get very far, and besides, it's =
probably only on some old backup disk right now... I'd have to dig up my =
old desktop machine.

I've just added you as co-maintainer in PAUSE. Thanks a lot for anything =
you can do!
