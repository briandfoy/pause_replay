Hello list,

Apologies if you've already seen this message -- it was previously
sent to the module-authors list.

Hopefully a PAUSE admin is listening. I would like to have Florent
Angly added as comaint to Statistics::R (and Statistics::R::Bridge). I
had taken over the module from GMPASSOS a while back, but have been
unable to do any work on it of late. Florent Angly (CPAN ID: FANGLY)
has agreed to step in and continue the work.

Unfortunately, I am unable to grant him comaint as GMPASSOS retains
the primary maintainer-ship.

Thanks in advance,

--
