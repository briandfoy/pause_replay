Description:
     A dynamic search and retrieve module intially
called lookfor. Basically, the module looks for some
sort of patern, finds it, optionally stores
information about it and then jumps to the next thing
to look for. It promotes one to think about extracting
data in this manner:
          /->Lookfor B-->END
Lookfor A-                    /-->END
^         \->Lookfor C------>-
|                             \
|------------------------------

Which means: Let's look for A, When we find A then we
look for B and C. If we find B then we look for the
END. If we find C, then we look for A or END. 

The module is already written so that you can define
this sort of algorithm like this:

A->nextlookfor(B,C);
B->nextlookfor(END);
C->nextlookfor(A,END);

It can theoretically work on an open file handle, a
bit stream, or anything you throw it's way since the
user can overide the default seek method ($_=<$file>).

This module is fairly usefull to me. I hope it will be
usefull to perl computing group at large.
