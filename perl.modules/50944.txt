The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Pagination
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: paginal navigation on a site
  userid:      ONDR (Andrian Zubko)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Paging::SQL Data::SpreadPagination
    Template::Plugin::Pagination HTML::Paginator Apache::Voodoo::Pager
    Data::Paginate ...

  rationale:

    WWW - this module needed only on Web sites ::Pagination - this word
    mean, what this module do

    Interface so simple, how it's possible, and in the same time having
    all popular feauters, what web programmers usualy used for paginal
    navigation build

    All results are in numbers, and web programers can build paginal
    navigation menu with any design and can use templates processors (as
    TT and others) for that

    Difference between this module and many others: only few modules
    have enough popular features, but they have hard interface. other
    modules have hard-coded html output.. I searched much, but don't
    found no one module with enough simple interface and with an
    opportunity to add popular features. for this reason i have taken my
    old module, what i used more then 5 years in many many different
    projects, made new interface and has put here.

  enteredby:   ONDR (Andrian Zubko)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep 19 16:59:46 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Pagination      RdpOp paginal navigation on a site                 ONDR
