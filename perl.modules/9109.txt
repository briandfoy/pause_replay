Crypt::Tea.pm implements the Tiny Encryption Algorithm in Perl and
Javascript.

CGI::Htui.pm implements a high-level user interface in HTML, handling all
FORM variables and negotiating valid data with the user.

CGI::Htauth.pm implements various authentication techniques in HTML,
offering IP authentication, username/password and challenge-response;
and if the browser is running JavaScript it uses Tea.pm to encrypt
network traffic, including passwords.

and more later ...
