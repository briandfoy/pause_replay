Hey there, CPAN folks,

it looks like development of DNS-ZoneParse has stalled, last update was
in 2004. I've contacted the author, Simon Flack (SIMONFLK), but got no
response and other folks have reported the same.

There's an important patch on rt:

     http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=24402

which several people have expressed interest in, but there seems to be
no way to contact the author.

It's too bad that this useful module isn't maintained anymore.

If the author cannot be contacted, is there a way to continue
maintenance of the module?

In a pinch, I'd be happy to take over maintenance -- any idea on how we
can accomplish that?

-- Mike
