The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::PlainLayout
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Package providing simple PDF layout elements
  userid:      STRAITJAC (Dennis Schmeller)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The package is intendet to provide simple and not too complicated
    layout elements for creating PDF documents with PDF::API2 by Alfred
    Reibenschuh. All PDF generating packages I found on CPAN provide
    basic elements to create PDF files, lacking of components of a
    higher level of abstraction (tables, layout managers, advanced text
    formatting), so I actually decided to call my package PDF::Layout.
    But this sounds rather like the ultimate collection of layout
    classes, covering all kinds of subjects, which is not what
    PDF::PlainLayout was intended to do. PDF::Layout::Lite requires the
    PDF::Layout name space already to exist, which is also not the case.

The resulting entry would be:

PDF::
::PlainLayout     bdpOg Package providing simple PDF layout elements STRAITJAC
