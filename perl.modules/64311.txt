You can use the Collections (or any other namespace), but in general
you can't plant your flag in it to prevent other people from using it.

For some namespaces we defer to the big projects that createed it, such
as DBI, DateTime, BioPerl, and so on. However, as PAUSE admins we don't
enforce any of it. We ask that people work with the existing projects
to avoid possible overlaps in names and so on.

That said, I'd adjust the names a bit to reduce repeated information:

Collections::OrderedCollection      Collections::Ordered
Collections::Set                             Collections::Set
Collections::Colection                    Collections::Abstract #???
Collections::SortedCollection       Collections::Sorted
Collections::Bag                             Collections::Bag


Good luck :)
