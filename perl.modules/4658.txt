I would like to know what the if the modules PerlQt and PerlKDE by
Ashley Winters are still being maintained.  Their last update lies quite
a while back, and there have been significant updates of the code they
are interfacing.  For example, KDE2 is out since quite a while, but
PerlKDE still interfaces KDE1.  Since I couldn't get in touch with the
author, Ashley Winters, I hope to find help here.

If the modules are not maintained, I would like to offer my
contribution.

Regards,

Jörg
