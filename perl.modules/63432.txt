Hi,

A while back I registered with PAUSE, and am thinking of contributing  
2 modules to CPAN.  My working names for them are IPC::MM::Array and  
Apache2::CloseKeepAlive.  The latter uses the the former.  Some  
questions regarding this:

1. Do I need permission from anyone to use the name IPC::MM::Array?   
Arthur Choung contributed an IPC::MM module back in 2000 but has not  
updated it since.  Ralf Engelschall wrote the MM library that  
underlies both Perl modules.

I started from IPC::MM but there is almost no code left from it in  
IPC::MM::Array.  IPC::MM has mutual-exclusion problems.  I suppose I  
should email Mr. Choung a description of these problems, but they're  
prettty obvious and he hasn't done anything about such things in 8+  
years.

2. Do I need permission from anyone to use the name  
Apache2::CloseKeepAlive?  It runs under mod_perl2 but there doesn't  
seem to be a top-level CPAN namespace for mod_perl2.

3. Two command-line apps are associated with Apache2::CloseKeepAlive.   
One scans a web site and builds a database that CloseKeepAlive uses.   
The other generates web traffic for testing CloseKeepAlive.  Can I  
simply integrate them with the Apache2::CloseKeepAlive package (using  
package in a more global sense than "Perl package")?  Or do I have to  
upload them separately to the "scripts" part of CPAN?

FYI, CloseKeepAlive runs as a mod_perl2 fixup handler and will post a  
"Connection: Close" header if it looks like this is a good idea.  Thus  
one can run Apache2 with KeepAlive on, without having many child  
processes hanging around waiting for KeepAlive timeouts.  Without  
something like this, the tendency of recent Mozilla and MS browsers to  
open like 6 parallel connections seems like the death knell for the  
HTTP KeepAlive feature.
