The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UUID::Tiny
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Pure Perl UUID functions
  userid:      CAUGUSTIN (Christian Augustin)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::UUID Data::GUID UUID::Generator UUID::Generator::PurePerl

  rationale:

    UUID::Tiny was chosen because:

    a) It is a "tiny", single-file, Pure Perl module without
    non-standard dependencies. b) UUID creation and comparison is the
    main focus. c) It has a "tiny" interface. d) Its memory load should
    be small.

    The main goal for UUID::Tiny was to create a UUID generator that
    can be used without installation and that has a simple,
    straightforward interface.

    I need a Pure Perl, installation free UUID module. The only Pure
    Perl UUID generator implementation I found on CPAN was
    UUID::Generator with UUID::Generator::PurePerl, but the author
    writes that this module will be marked as "deprecated" in the
    future, so it is not usable for a new development.

    Furthermore does UUID::Generator consist of 2 (!) modules (and many
    files in UUID::Generator::PurePerl), and the extensive OO interface
    looks overdone to me (or has at least a rather large code overhead).
    The code of UUID::Tiny is easier to inspect than the code of
    UUID::Generator, because it is in one file, clearly located in few
    functions and concentrates on the main goal of UUID creation with
    the necessary algorithms.

    (I had a hard time to understand UUID::Generator following all the
    hoops it is jumping through. But I have to give credit to this
    module, because the functions in UUID::Tiny are "borrowed" from
    UUID::Generator::PurePerl or at least based on it. UUID::Generator
    helped me to understand the RFC and how to construct UUIDs.)

    Many other UUID modules seem to be wrappers around other UUID
    modules or around UUID generators integrated in other software.
    Dependencies are often not clear, most modules seem to depend on XS
    or other XS based modules.

    So there's a niche for UUID::Tiny ...

    (If raw performance is needed, or the real MAC address in UUIDs,
    and if one can afford module installation and compilation,
    Data::UUID would be a better choice than UUID::Tiny! This is also
    clearly stated in the documentation.)

The resulting entry would be:

UUID::
::Tiny            Rdpfp Pure Perl UUID functions                     CAUGUSTIN
