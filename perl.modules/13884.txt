 ATTENTION PLERASE=3A
 First=2C I must solicit your confidence in this transaction=2C this is by 
 virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET=2E

worried=2C

a 
 closing balance of USD$40=2EM =28Forty Million=2CUnited States Dollars=29 
which the bank 
 now unquestionably expects to  be claimed by any of his available 
foreign next 
 of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for 
alms and
 ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria=2E
 
 Fervent valuable efforts has been  made by the SOCIETE GENERAL BANK to 
get in
 touch with any of the CLARKE family or relatives but all have proved

 avail=2E It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be 
able

wife 
 and children=29 that the management under the influence of our Chairman=2C

be
 declared=22UNCLAIMABLE=22 and then be subsequently donated to the Trust 
Fund 
 for Alms and War in Africa and the world in general=2E
 
 In order to avert this negative development=2C myself and some of my 
trusted
 colleagues here at the bank now seek for your permission to have you 
stand 
 as late Engr=2E SANN CLARKE's next of kin so that the fund=2C USD$40=2EM USD 
would 
 be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the 
beneficiary 
 next  of kin=2EAll documents and proves to enable you get this fund have 
been 
 carefully  worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free 
involvement=2E For your
 assistance=2C your commission would be 20%=2E 80%be for myself and my 
 colleagues for investment purposes in your country=2E

 trust we hope to bestow on you and your company=2C then kindly get to me
 immediately via my e-mail furnishing me with your most confidential 
 telephone=2C fax number and exclusive e-mail so that I can forward to
