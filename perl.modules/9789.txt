From: mark@sporkstorms.org (Mark Stratman)

Hi, and thanks for your time.

I would like to register as a CPAN contributor (namely, modules).

Name: Mark A. Stratman
Email: mark@sporkstorms.org
Homepage: http://sporkstorms.org
Prefered ID: MSTRAT
Description:  I would like to initially upload vector modules
(math/physics related, not bit vectors ;).  Most likely will be under
the Math:: namespace (Math::Vector, Math::Vector::Vector3D).  More
modules will surely follow.

Thanks a lot,
Mark A. Stratman
