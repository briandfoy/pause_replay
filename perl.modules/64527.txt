Subject: Module submission CGI::Mungo
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Mungo
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Very simple CGI web framework
  userid:      DUMB (MacGyveR)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    CGI::Framework

  rationale:

    The namespace was chosen as the root level "CGI" node was the best
    choice as existing modules are located there, which have similar
    functionality.

    The name "mungo" was used to as the most relevant name "framework"
    has already been taken, the mungo name refers to a English
    children's cartoon character bearing limited intelligence.

    Thanks
