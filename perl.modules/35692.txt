The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::SimpleQuery
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Query a SQL database with very little code
  userid:      SSIMMS (Steve Simms)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Not yet. Suggestions welcome.

  similar:
    DBIx::DWIW

  rationale:

    This module is similar in concept to DBIx::DWIW, but differs
    significantly in implementation, especially in how values are
    returned.

    The rationale is to get rid of as much of the work involved with
    querying databases as possible. It was inspired by Damian Conway's
    "Sufficiently Advanced Technologies" talk at OSCON 2004.

    The result is that I can do queries like the following:

    use DBIx::SimpleQuery; # Fetch a scalar my $name = query "SELECT
    name FROM users WHERE user_id = $user_id";

    # Fetch an array of scalars my @user_ids = query "SELECT user_id
    FROM users";

    # Fetch an array of hashrefs foreach my $row (query "SELECT * FROM
    users") { ... }

    # Returns true or false in boolean context if (query "SELECT * FROM
    users WHERE user_id = $user_id") { ... }

    # As well as others, always using just the one function (or
    method).

    The query function generally returns an object with overloaded
    stringify and other operators, so that you don't have to explicitly
    cast as an array or shift to get the first value, for example.

    The database setup can be done in a number of ways: using
    environment variables, a set_defaults() call, arguments to new()
    (resulting in an object than can then be queried), or arguments to
    the query() function itself. When developing in mod_perl, I just set
    the environment variables once in httpd.conf and never have to worry
    about it again.

    The code for the first release is finished, but the documentation
    and tests are not yet.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
