source and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself=2C I am 
John Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President 
Laurent 
Desire Kabila of the blessed memory=2E =3BI know this letter might come to 
you 
as a surprise but I honestly have to solicit your attention to this 
assistance 
and foreingn investment=2E I write this letter in respect of my intention 
to invest the sum of US$10 
000=2C000=2E00 with you=2E I inherited this funds from my mother=2E This funds 
was 
generated through the sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the 
head 
of state=2E My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege 
position to engage in the business of Diamond and timber since she knows
 
that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the 
privilege 
situation=2E

When my father was assassinated on 16th January 01 by one of his 
bodyguards Lt=2E Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army 
officers that wanted to topple his government=2C I escaped to london
because of the 
fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt=2E General Joseph 
Kabila the present head of state=2E Actually his mother and my mother are 
not in the best of relationship because of tussle for who among them 
will be the 
first lady and this ultimately affected us their children=2E

Considering the relationship between South Africa and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo new government=2C my mother advised me to leave for 
london
for security reason=2C while the funds were deposited with a 
security Company=2E

On getting to london where I have been living since then 
 I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me 
in moving this funds out for safe banking and profitable foreighn 
investment=2E 
Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this funds in 
Cameroon nor Africa due to my status in my country as a result of my 
fathers death
=2E And moreover 
I wouldn't want to take risk because this funds is all that I and my 
mother is depending on because my half brother has seized all my father's
 
assets and funds and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing 
that 
this funds was deposited at the security company=2E so this is why I 
decided that investing this funds abroad should be the best safest typy 
of 
adventure for me=2E I will be honoured if I can be given the privilege of 
investing this fund through your help=2E

In view of this plight=2C I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough 
to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a 
hopeless future=2E And if you agree=2C I hereby agree to compensate your

during this transaction=2C fax and phone bills inclusive=2CWhen the fund 
=28$10=2C000=2C000=2E00=29 is moved into your discrete account=2C you will be 
allowed 
to draw 20% your favor=2C while the remaining 75% will be invested 
meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and 
deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends 
yeilding=2E
