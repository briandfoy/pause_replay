Hi all

I just requested a PAUSE ID because I wrote a module that implements a
library for writing redirectors for the popular Squid web proxy. It's my
first module, so I'm asking for comments before uploading anything.
It was inspired by the popular squidGuard redirector, but aims to =
provide
more flexibility.=20
I was also inspired by Email::Filter, which I found great to get rid of =
the
procmail mail filter, just as I would like to get rid of squidGuard with =
my
module; not that I don't like squidGuard, I was happy with it for years.
Simply, now I'm looking to some extra features which a perl script can
easily provide.

I gave the module the name of Net::Squid::Guard , from the resemblance =
to
squidGuard.=20
I read the warning about not using the Net namespace in
http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=3Dpause_namingmodules. But I =
found
that anything related to Squid in Cpan is under Net::Squid, so I think I
should continue this tradition. I can anyway change te name to =
Squid::Guard,
if you think it's necessary.
I could also give the module the name Net::Squid::Redir , which tells =
more
about its function. I think that for a Squid admin, xxx::Squid::Guard =
tells
all there is to tell, but comments are welcome.

Thank you.
Luigi
