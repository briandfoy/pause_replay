I think you miss my intent.

The point of having a new namespace away from Bundle where you avoid the 
magic is so that you DON'T have to have any magic at all.

You just write your Makefile.PL using MakeMaker or Module::Install or 
Module::Build as your normally would.

Then you do the following as normal...

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The dependencies get installed as they normally would, and everything is 
just fine.

No magic anywhere. It would work with every installation system in 
existance today, with no need to add support to any of them or otherwise 
do anything.

Having them under a new namespace merely serves to help identify them 
and acts as a convention.
