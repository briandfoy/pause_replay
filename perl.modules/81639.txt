The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BIE
  DSLIP:       cdhhp
  description: Biological Integrated Environments
  userid:      XINZHENG (郑 鑫)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    BioPerl

  rationale:

    BIE means "Biological Integrated Environments". The modules in this
    namespace would focus on integrating utilities for biological data
    manipulation and data digging. BIE would provide functions of data
    query and storage, knowledge exploration, machine learning,
    statistics and so on, which will be in simple ways for biologists to
    concentrate on thinking about kinds of biology fields with a little
    effort on computer skills.

    It's obvious that some of the functions mentioned above already are
    provided in CPAN. But BIE is unique in that its components are
    customized particularly for biologists' researches. BIE is to
    integrate pieces of technologies into comfortable environments and
    to provide plain syntaxes and interfaces for biology scientists.

    BioPerl is an excellent and very famous toolkit in building
    bioinformatics solutions
    (http://bioperl.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_BioPerl.3F). It mainly works on
    sequence data (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioPerl#Features). BIE
    absolutely will utilize BioPerl as an importance base to create
    environment for sequence analysis.

The resulting entry would be:

BIE               cdhhp Biological Integrated Environments           XINZHENG
