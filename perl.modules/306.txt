Did Ken and I ever resolve what was going to happen with Ioctl?  I've
made a bunch of changes to his Ioctl 0.7.  I'm going to upload mine as
Ioctl 0.8 unless I am contacted by 3pm EST tomorrow.

This is an ultimatum!

The world will not tolarate bad code and I will not pause long for the
sloathful.

(It's only been months since our initial exchange... ;-)
