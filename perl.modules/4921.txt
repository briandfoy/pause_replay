I have a package called Morse
It consists of 3(so far) modules.
Only Morse::Code is currently finished.

 Morse::Code
  - translates to/from morse
  - has option to define custom morse character set
  - has function morsify, which decides whether you passed it text or morse
  - the default built in character set is the international one

 Morse::Fancy
  - generates fancy html morse/text translations based upon what
    Morse::Code does.  Has the ability to translate -. into dit's and dah's.
    Also has a bunch of fancy images it embeds, and it also allows the user
    to specify custom ones.

 Morse::Sound
  - generates midi's or wave's based up what Morse::Code does, with optional
    zlib compression.  Also comes with default set of 'dit' 'daw' waves for
    sound equivalent of Morse::Fancy phonetic morse
