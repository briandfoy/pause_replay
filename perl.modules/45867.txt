The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler
  DSLIP:       RdhOp
  description: Compile Math::Symbolic trees to C
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Symbolic Math::Symbolic::Compiler Math::Symbolic::Custom
    Inline

  rationale:

    The Math::Symbolic distribution allows the user to compile trees
    (the internal representation of algebraic expressions) to Perl
    subroutines for much faster evaluation. This is implemented in the
    Math::Symbolic::Compiler module in the M::S distribution.

    This distribution/module allows the user to compile Math::Symbolic
    trees to C code and link it into the currently running program using
    Inline::C. (Or, alternatively to just generate the C code. I used
    this for generating fast code for evaluation of a set of orthogonal
    polynomials.)

    The module name was chosen in the Math::Symbolic::Custom hierarchy
    because Math::Symbolic::Custom offers a mechanism for method
    delegation. That means you can use the M::S::C::CCompiler module and
    then call the "to_c()" method on any Math::Symbolic tree to get the
    C code. For details, please have a look at Math::Symbolic::Custom.

    I admit that the choice of "CCompiler" as the significant portion
    of the name is not optimal. But it is analogous to the
    Math::Symbolic::Compiler module which does the same for Perl.
    Furthermore, the module has been on CPAN for two years now, so
    changing the name shouldn't be done unless there are strong
    objections.

    Sorry for the long text. :)

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Symbolic::Custom::
