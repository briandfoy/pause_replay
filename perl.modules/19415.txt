Hi

Could you please pass this onto whoever is responsible for this -----------

I personally not interested in the DBI modules but I have been installing
them for developers.
The installation process doesn't work for the latest incarnation of DBI

OS = AIX 5.1 ML 3  Perl version 5.6.0

Problem:
DBI-1.34 & DBI-1.35 will not install with using a prefix

 perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<whatever>

I  tested it on another machine of same specs - first time it worked, the
second time same as the result.
Also tested an older  DBI-1.32  ---  ALL WORKED OK

---------------- error messages (real home name altered)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
/home/myhome/DBI-1.35
$ perl Makefile.PL prefix=/home/myhome/DBI135

**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
  Version 5.006 of perl will NOT BE SUPPORTED by future DBI releases.
  You will have to upgrade your perl or stop upgrading DBI.
  Perl version 5.6.1 will be the lowest version supported.
  Press return to continue...
**************************************************************************
**************************************************************************
Can't open prefix=/home/myhome/DBI135: A file or directory in the path name
does not exist. at Makefile.PL line 26.
