Subject: Module submission Test::Copyright

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Copyright
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Test taht a module is has good license info
  userid:      SILASMONK (Nicholas Bamber)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #debian-perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    (09:54:57) periapt: What I propose is Test::Copyright. It should
    start by checking that the README has the right statements, has
    copyright years, an open source license. Then it needs to check that
    every file has a statement consistent with the README.

    If we could persuade most CPAN modules to provides consistent
    copyright and license information, life would be easier for the perl
    packaging teams of distributions.

  enteredby:   SILASMONK (Nicholas Bamber)
  enteredon:   Fri May 20 19:32:45 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Copyright       idpfp Test taht a module is has good license info  SILASMONK
