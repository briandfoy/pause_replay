The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::CheckDigits
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generating and testing check digits.
  userid:      SONGMU (Masayuki Matsuki)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Algorithm::CheckDigits

  rationale:

    This module provides a number of methods to test and generate check
    digits, by not using format name but using Modulus and Weight.

    There are many format of check digits. ex. JAN, EAN, ISBN... Most
    of them can be generated almost same way by using two arguments,
    Modulus and Weight.

    This module can test and generate check digits by not using format
    name, but using Modulus and Weight.

    Algorithm::CheckDigits module is aleady exist. That's very good
    module, covering many formats. But for using that module, we should
    use each format name of check digit. I can't remember such a many
    formats and often use some formats that's uncommon or original what
    Algorithm::CheckDigits don't support (of course!).

    Use this module and pass two arguments ( Modulus and Weight ) to
    constuructor, we can test and genarate check digits.

    This module is effective to any check digits format using Modulus
    and Weight, and can't support the format that are generated from
    complicated algorithm.

The resulting entry would be:
