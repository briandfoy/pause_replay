DEAR SIR/MADAM,

I regret any initial embarrassment my letter might
Cause you, as we have not had any previous correspondence before this time. I am the Director of Projects / Supplies, in Pipeline and petroleum Marketing Company (PPMC),a Federal Government of Nigerian-owned parastatal.

I got your contact in my desperate search for a reliable and trust-worthy person who can assist me in the actualization of a project ,this I did through going through companies Websites.
This project is economically viable as well as financially profitable, From the Deed of Assignment the project was structured in such a way that a Foreigner and/or a foreign firm needs to play a pivotal role in its actualization.

In the light of the above I crave your indulgence.
Derails/modalities will be discussed as soon as you indicate your willingness/readiness. Your response should be sent to : ppmc@presidency.com

Thanks,
Your's Truly.
