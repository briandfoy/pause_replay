The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Series
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perl module dealing with mathematic series
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Sequence Math::Symbolic

  rationale:

    Math::Series defines a class for simple mathematic series with a
    recursive definition such as C<x_(n+1) = 1 / (x_n + 1)>. Such a
    recursive definition is treated as a sequence whose elements will be
    added to form a series. You can refer to the previous sequence
    element as well as to the current index in the series.

    Each Math::Series object is an iterator to iterate over the
    elements of the sequence starting at the first element (which was
    specified by the starting element, the second argument to the new()
    constructor). It offers facilities to cache all calculated elements
    and access any element directly, though unless the element has been
    cached in a previous calculation, this is just a shortcut for
    repeated use of the iterator.

    The namespace choice seemed obvious to me. I could not find any
    modules with similar functionality on CPAN. It is derived from
    Math::Sequence, but doesn't fit in Math::Sequence::* because it's
    more of a use-relationship than an isa-relationship.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
