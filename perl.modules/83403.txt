I don't think so.
Technology grouped under the topic DVB cannot be just limited to video.

DVB Standards and Specifications (www.dvb.org) cover the whole transmitting
chain from source encoding up to channel encoding and receiver 
specification.

Probably it is more related to MPEG but again DVB standards and 
specifications
are an extension of MPEG specs.
