The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IOC::Lite
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: An Inversion of Control Impl.
  userid:      RAPTNOR (john fraser)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://radio.weblogs.com/0133680/ for now.

  similar:
    None that I found.

  rationale:

    This is the first step in creating a light weight, configurable,
    easy to use application server foundation. More modules will be
    collected in this namespace including configuration loading IOC
    decorators and other like support utilities. Interfaces and support
    libraries will be added to support enterprise computing concepts and
    other ideas as they rise. Many of these ideas will come from the
    Spring framework that was developed for Java and is currently being
    ported to .NET.

    This namespace is the logical collection point for these add-ons.
    Currently only picocontainer-like functionality is provided. But
    this is just the foundation for more and more layers.

The resulting entry would be:

IOC::
::Lite            idpOp An Inversion of Control Impl.                RAPTNOR
