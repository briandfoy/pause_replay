Subject: Module submission Business::DataDog

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::DataDog
  DSLIP:       cnpOa
  description: Interface to DataDog REST API
  userid:      JPINKHAM (Jennifer Pinkham)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    I think "Business" is the right top level namespace, as it is
    currently used for other commercial services APIs. There is
    currently no Perl module to easily interact with the DataDog metrics
    service. I have created a Perl dogstatsd client for my company, that
    I intend to release as open source soon (for posting metrics), as
    well as a full wrapper around the entire DataDog REST API:
    http://docs.datadoghq.com/api/. I believe this will be quite
    valuable to any Perl developers who need to regularly and easily
    interact with the DataDog service.

  enteredby:   JPINKHAM (Jennifer Pinkham)
  enteredon:   Sat Dec  8 23:20:56 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::DataDog         cnpOa Interface to DataDog REST API                JPINKHAM
