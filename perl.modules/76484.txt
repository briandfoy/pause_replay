I'll transfer the missing permissions.

That is because developer versions (with underscore) do not get indexed 
at all.

Try "examples/". That should normally not be indexed. Otherwise, adding 
them to META.yml/json's no_index section works.

I will transfer permissions for this as well and trigger another reindexing.

I think you're fine. It's been around under that name for a long time.
