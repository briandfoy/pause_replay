From: andreas.koenig@anima.de ((Andreas J. Koenig))

Many suggestions have come over the years that we should somehow flag
abandoned modules as such. Finally I came up with the simplest
possible idea:

We have already the flags

  S - Support Level:
    m   - Mailing-list
    d   - Developer
    u   - Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.perl.modules
    n   - None known, try comp.lang.perl.modules

I think we should add a flag "0" (zero) or "-" (minus), that has the
explicit meaning: abandoned, volunteers welcome to take over maintainance.

What do you think?

Background: we apparently have already users who redirect mail to
their secret and public addresses to /dev/null. I'd like to give these
people a way to abandon their modules without deleting them and
without having to talk with anybody ever again.
