The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VIC
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Language for coding PIC microcontrollers
  userid:      VIKAS (Vikas Naresh Kumar)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    #pegex on irc.freenode.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    VIC is a high level language for generating PIC assembly that can
    be compiled and run on PIC microcontrollers of Microchip. VIC is
    designed to be compatible with any Microchip PIC microcontroller and
    the same code can be used to generate specific assembly for a
    specific microcontroller. It enables the user to quickly prototype
    code for the microcontroller without making errors or even knowing
    assembly programming and also enables a power user to edit the
    assembly that is generated for further optimization.

    VIC allows the user to do event based programming due to its
    support for closures. This makes it easier for the user to read VIC
    code and understand what the chip is supposed to do.

    VIC internally uses Pegex to handle grammar and parsing.

The resulting entry would be:

VIC               adpOp Language for coding PIC microcontrollers     VIKAS
