Dear PAUSE admins.

I want to contact Geoff Richards (Font-FreeType maintainer).
I sent an email to his e-mail address, but returned by an error.
(geoff@laxan.com)

I want to update Font-FreeType[0]. Because my project need this libarary and
function is not enough in the current library.

I can perform it without getting contacting him when Maintainer is necessary.
I participate in the perl team of Debian and can maintain this package for
Debian and personally.[1]

;; I do not understand whether this becomes the "Post a public message".

Best regards,
 Nobuhiro
