From: fxn@hashref.com (Francesc Xavier Noria)

Hello! I am the author of a wrapper of Advogato.org called MyAdvogato:

    http://www.advogato.org/proj/MyAdvogato/

I would like to contribute to CPAN.

My data is

   Name:  Francesc Xavier Noria
   Email: fxn@hashref.com
   Home:  http://advogato.org/person/fxn/
   ID:    FXN

In the instructions for registration you ask for an ID 4-9 chars long,
but I am known everywhere as fxn and try hard always being consistent
with that. I have seen some authors with and ID three letters long and
would be very grateful if you could do an exception with that. If there
is no way to allow FXN (which I'd undertand) then, I don't know, maybe
we could register FX-N (ugh).

Thank you very much for maintaining such a useful service!
