Hello,

I recently took over active maintainer-ship of the MITREHC account on
pause.mitre.org.

I had also changed the Full Name field for this account from:

'Fotios Lindiakos'

To:

'MITRE Honeyclient Project'

However, after performing this, and then I submitted the HoneyClient::*
modules, it appears as though the old name of 'Fotios Lindiakos' is
still listed in the cpan.org queries.  See here, for example:

http://search.cpan.org/search?query=3DHoneyClient&mode=3Dall

Furthermore, I had changed the public email address from
'flindiakos@mitre.org' to 'honeyclient@mitre.org'.
However, this information has not been updated, as shown on this page:

http://search.cpan.org/~mitrehc/

Could you please let me know if you can correct this information?  Do I
need to delete my uploaded packages, in order for this information to
be updated?

Incidentally, I need to submit new v0.98 packages to pause; if you can
manually force the deletion of those files ahead of time, I'd greatly
appreciate (instead of waiting until Sunday).

Thanks for your help,
