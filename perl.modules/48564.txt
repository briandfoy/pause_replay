Subject: Module submission Class::CGI::CreditCard

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::CGI::CreditCard
  DSLIP:       impOp
  description: CGI::Class handler for Business::CreditCard
  userid:      HOLLYKING (Brendan Leber)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/class_cgi/

  similar:

  rationale:

    Class::CGI::CreditCard will provide a handler for Class::CGI to
    validate and return Business::CreditCard::Object objects. It is not
    bundled in the Class::CGI distribution so users are not forced to
    download and install handlers that they do not need.

  enteredby:   HOLLYKING (Brendan Leber)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 27 20:33:45 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::CGI::
::CreditCard      impOp CGI::Class handler for Business::CreditCard  HOLLYKING
