                     ====================================
               BETA    Package "Date::Calc" Version 4.4    BETA
                     ====================================

        This package is available for download from my web site at

                  http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/

            only, for the time being, because of its BETA status.


Prerequisites:
--------------

    Perl version 5.000 or higher, and an ANSI C compiler (!)
                                         ^^^^^^

What's new in version 4.4 BETA:
-------------------------------

 +  Added the module Date::Object, an object-oriented
    frontend to Date::Calc with overloaded operators.
 +  Added the module Date::Carp (used by Date::Object).
 +  Added support for Norwegian.
 +  Added support for Swedish.
 +  Fixed the broken parsing of special ISO-Latin-1 characters
    in Date::Calc (replacing <ctype.h> with a better solution).
 -  Locales wouldn't help here, because "Decode_Language()" must
    work with any locale setting. Moreover, setting a language in
    Date::Calc would also require to set the proper corresponding
    locale in the current environment, which may not be available
    on the current system. The new solution works independently
    of any locale and with ALL languages.
 +  Fixed the misspelled word "whether" in the documentation.


Abstract:
---------

    The Date::Calc package consists of a C library and a Perl module
    (which uses the C library, internally) for all kinds of date
    calculations based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in
    all western countries today), thereby complying with all relevant
    norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971, DIN 1355 and, to some extent,
    ISO 8601 (where applicable). The package is designed as an efficient
    toolbox, not a bulky ready-made application. It provides extensive
    documentation and examples of use, multi-language support and
    special functions for business needs.

    The C library is specifically designed so that it can be used
    stand-alone, without Perl.

Author's note:
--------------

    I am calling this new version BETA because the new module Date::Object
    is still lacking some of the planned functionality, which will also
    require some additional new functions in Date::Calc.

    The module Date::Object is complete as far as "short" date objects
    (i.e., without a time part, that is, hours, minutes and seconds) in
    "accurate mode" are concerned (accurate mode, as opposed to YMD mode,
    returns differences between dates as a number of days, instead of a
    year-month-day offset, the latter of which may lead to subsequent
    rounding-off errors).
    
    The module Date::Calc is in a normal release state and fully working.

    I will not be able to continue working on this package for at least
    the next month (due to holidays and lots of other work), therefore
    I am releasing what I have got right now. I will also be away from
    my mail during this time and unable to answer any questions.

    Nevertheless, please do send feedback and problem reports, I will
    attend to them as soon as I return.

    In any case, I hope you will find this new version beneficial!


Yours sincerely,
