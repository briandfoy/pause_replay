It does not.  And I certainly didn't duplicate any effort, because I
looked carefully at Tex::Hyphenate before I started.

But then it would have nothing to do with wrapping, and it would have
no relation at all to Text::Wrap, which does wrapping and formatting.
I do not understand why you would expect a module named
``Text::Wrap::Hyphenate' to perform a function totally different from
the function performed by `Text::Wrap'.

The two modules do the same thing.  Should they not have similar names?
