For the most part I was just trying to be a part of the Perl community and
offer another choice in logging. I'm pretty hard on my developers when they
reinvent the wheel instead of using an existing CPAN module, but at the
moment it's the only little piece of perl code I'm playing with that isn't
proprietary.

That's all.
