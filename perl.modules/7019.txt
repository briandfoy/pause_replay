The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::ParseBrowser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO User Agent string parser
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTTP::BrowserDetect

  rationale:

    I feel that HTML is a better root namespace, as this is where its
    functionality will be used the most. While the sending of the
    UserAgent string _is_ a part of the HTTP specification, it is most
    often consulted for the purpose of determine what HTML capabilities
    are supported, and is thus used to determine what HTML to send to a
    browser.

    This module is also very useful for parsing apache/httpd access
    logs.

    HTTP::BrowserDetect (the 'leading brand') works in the opposite
    direction, testing the User Agent string for various properties and
    then allowing access to these properties on a true/false basis. I
    feel that approach is less useful for everyday use, as one must
    effectively ask the object 'Is this browser Netscape' for instance.

    My approach actually parses the rather psychotic User Agent string
    to determine and interpret as many properties as possible and allow
    the user to effectively ask the object 'What kind of browser is
    this?' and get an intelligible response.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
