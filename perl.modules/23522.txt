The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Zinc
  DSLIP:       MmcOl
  description: canvas with group transfo clipping openGL
  userid:      ZINCDEV (zinc-dev)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    www.openatc.org/zinc

  similar:

  rationale:

    As TkZinc is like the Tk::Canvas, the name is obvious

    TkZinc widget is similar to Tk::Canvas in that they both support
    semi-structured 2D graphics. Like the Tk::Canvas, TkZinc implements
    items used to display graphical entities. Those items can be
    manipulated and bindings can be associated with them to implement
    interaction behaviours. The following features can be viewed as
    extensions to the Tk::Canvas: - TkZinc can strongly structure the
    items in a hierarchy with the use of group items), - TkZinc has
    support for affine 2D transforms (i.e. translation, scaling, and
    rotation), - TkZinc can clip sub-trees of the items hierarchy, - the
    item set is quite more powerful including field specific items for
    Air Traffic systems - TkZinc offers the support of openGL rendering
    techniques such as anti-aliasing, transparency, colour gradients as
    well as the support of an openGL oriented item triangles

    TkZinc makes it easy to use some OpenGL features for 2D Human
    Computer Interaction (HCI).

    It has been freely available on www.openatc.org/zinc since Jan
    2001.
