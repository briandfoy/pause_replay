How about HTML::Navigation::Tabs?  Since it could presumably be used
just as easily under mod_perl, using the CGI prefix would not be a
good idea.  You should only use the CGI prefix when the CGI interface
is directly used; for example, if it read the CGI environment
variables directly.  But I think that the main purpose of your module
is to generate HTML, rather than to be used in CGI applications.  But
since "Tabs" is so vague, I would suggest adding an intermediate
"Navigation" level to make it more clear.

AMAZING BUT TRUE: There is so much sand in northern Africa that if it were
                  spread out it would completely cover the Sahara Desert!
