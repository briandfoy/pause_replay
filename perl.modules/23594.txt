The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Arary::Heap2
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: functions treating perl arrays as heaps
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Heap::* Array::Heap List::Priority

  rationale:

    Here is the rationale for choosing Array::Heap*

    There are already a lot of heap and priority-queue modules on CPAN.

    All of them build more or less elaborate data structures (which is
    fine for many uses).

    Array::Heap is different in that it is a simple module exporting
    functions that work on normal perl arrays.

    That is, similar to perl's builtin functions C<push>, C<sort>, etc.
    there are push_heap, pop_heap and make_heap functions, used like
    this:

    @h = (1,2,3,74,6,4); make_heap @h; push_heap @h, 5,3,2; my $x =
    pop_heap @h;

    (there are also functions taking a comparison fucntion similar to
    sort).

    This is the reason why I chose to name it Array::Heap, since it
    treats an array as a heap, but does not implement a data structure
    itself.

    And here is the rationale for choosing Array::Heap2:

    Well, there is no good rationale, but while registering, I found
    that Array::Heap has been registered in what seems 1998 already,
    however, a module hasn't been uploaded in the last 5 years. (I
    didn'T see this at first because my searches were for existing
    modules only :)

    I've contacted the author, but haven't received a reply yet (but
    it's not been a long time).

    Anyways, I thougth I could already ask for advice on the namespace
    issue :)

The resulting entry would be:

Arary::
