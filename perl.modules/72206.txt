Subject: Module submission Devel::Comments
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, xiong@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Comments
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Debug with executable smart comments to logs
  userid:      XIONG (Xiong Changnian)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org modules@perl.org comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Smart::Comments

  rationale:

    Devel::Comments is a development tool, a fork of Smart::Comments,
    which filters specially-formatted comments into executable code.
    Immediately, it extends its parent's abilities by permitting smart
    output to be directed to a filehandle other than STDERR. Next
    release also accepts a filename for output.

    Potential users of this tool have requested other features: ability
    to invoke an object's own method to dump; execution of arbitrary
    code; numerical level enabling; and invocation as a debugging module
    from the command line using 'perl -d:Comments', with additional
    options. These features exceed theoriginal Smart::Comments concept
    and comprise a significant departure.

    RT bugs against the original will be fixed in Devel::Comments. Now,
    this module is a drop-in replacement for Smart::Comments; but this
    may eventually change as the cost of maintaining compatibility
    escalates.

    Consensus on PerlMonks favors 'Devel::Comments'. Discussion at
    modules@cpan.org favors release as a new version of Smart::Comments
    but 'Devel::Comments', the name, is recommended by primary
    maintainer and author DCONWAY. Current maintainer, CHORNY, does not
    respond. Therefore this approach is closed short of hostile
    takeover. No particular name of the form 'Smart::Comments::*' meets
    with general approval.

    Devel::Comments draws a clear, unambiguous line between production
    code and debugging code. This may be dull to the developer who
    favors an interactive debugger; but it appeals to the developer who
    prefers to scatter print() statements around places of interest. All
    smart comments are disabled at once by commenting out the 'use
    Devel::Comments' line; the disabling is guaranteed as all such
    debugging code reverts to ordinary dumb comments. These can be left
    in production and re-enabled in the next development cycle; or
    permanently removed with any comment stripper.

The resulting entry would be:
