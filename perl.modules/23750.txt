Now, if modules@perl.org isn't the correct place to write about this issue (as it is in the 'reply-to' header of PAUSE's delete confirmation email), then please suggest who I should write directly.

I just discovered that something seems to be wrong with Backpan.  While it had been faithfully archiving all versions of my distros up until mid-July, anything uploaded afterwards has not been archived.

I had been using Backpan as a public backup for older versions, while I faithfully deleted older versions from the main CPAN directory when newer versions are uploaded, so to "keep it CDROMable".

I suspect that this lack of new file archiving may be a bug in recently updated PAUSE/CPAN code that wasn't discovered because Backpan is a lower priority, in which case, I hope to draw attention to it now before the problem of lost files worsens with age.

For reference, this is my Backpan directory:
http://history.perl.org/backpan/modules/by-authors/id/D/DU/DUNCAND/

The newest file that appears there is Rosetta-0.152, but since then I released 0.16 (Sep 11), 0.17 (Sep 16), and 0.18 (Sep 26); none of those latter ones appear.

(Now, before anyone asks about it, I do keep my own archives at home, so private copies still exist, but the public ones are still important.)

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
