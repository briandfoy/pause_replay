You mean an exact new "Math::Fraction"?

Actually, I have a Math::BigFraction, which should do the same. Kevin's
module suffers from the fact that he tried (successfully?) to mix normal
math and Bigint math. This is not only very complciated, but also will
sometimes, when we have transparent bignum support, be useless.

Anyway, I just did not want to re-invent the wheel with Math::BigFraction
while leaving the broken Math::Fraction lying in the dust. ;)

Ok, I wait a few week. *schedules date*

Best wishes,

Tels
