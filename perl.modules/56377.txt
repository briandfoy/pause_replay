According to my paper trail, I have uploaded this module back in
1999. This file does no longer show up in my files. 

Anyway, I have not worked on these Puppet modules for several years
ans I do not plan to. Nobody has asked questions, so I guess that
nobody is using them.

I still can upload these files if you want, or you can scrap the
Puppet::VcsTools::File namespace.

Cheers
