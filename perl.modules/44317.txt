The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Module::Optional
  DSLIP:       Rdppp
  description: Breaking dependency chains
  userid:      IVORW (Ivor Williams)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=411225 #London.pm

  similar:
    Module::Pluggable

  rationale:

    This is a pragmatic module which allows an "optional use", of
    another module, i.e. the requested module may or may not be
    installed on the target machine.

    The approach is similar to Module::Pluggable, but M::P is for
    instances where the plug-ins were specifically coded to work with
    M::P, and the pluggability is designed in to the naming convention
    in the first place. Module::Optional is more for stubbing a
    pre-existing module, and comes with an example by way of
    Params::Validate::Dummy.

The resulting entry would be:

Module::
::Optional        Rdppp Breaking dependency chains                   IVORW
