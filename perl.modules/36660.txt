I don't know the intricacies of how CPAN indexes things other than Perl modules. 
I am not sure which other directories would be indexed and I am not sure what 
file extensions need to be used. That's why I stuck with what I know works of a 
CPAN author of modules.

Speaking of which, I wonder if I should take out a separate CPAN id just for 
this project? Probably not, but I am thinking out loud now...

That worked out locally for installing. I'm not sure about CPAN though. I should 
hope anything that matches \w would be OK.

I wanted to work from general to specific, i.e., Software::Design::GUI::harmful
And for some reason I like taking the final adjective and titling it pragma 
style :) There must be a subconscious linguistic urge unsurfacing there.

And you are right, the date should not be a part of the path it gets installed 
to... perhaps $VERSION for the module would be a number indicating the date of 
the issue.

We had thought about that. What we are trying to avoid is a huge monolithic 
upload like the original CPAN publication:

	http://search.cpan.org/~swalters/Object-PerlDesignPatterns-0.03/

Breaking it into editions works fine on a full-fledged CPAN like search.cpan.org 
but kobesearch.cpan.org only keeps the latest version of all distributions.

Here are the options I can think of:

1/ Create a distro per year. E.g. for this year we would have
Software::Design::2004. Then, once a month, keep adding articles to this distro
until a year is up.

2/ Create a distro per year again. However, this time each new version only has
new issues. The major con of trying to use one distro for an entire year is that
some places use Randy Kobes' CPAN lite which only keeps the latest version of
each distribution.

3/ Create a distro per month: Software::Design::12_04 would be a completely new
CPAN release.

So with method one the version number would keep going up and new versions would
supercede the old ones.

With method two, the version number would go up and each new version is
completely different from the old version.

With method three, each issue would probably just have one version unless we had
to make a small fix or something.
