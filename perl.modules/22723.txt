I own the Filesys::Df and Filesys::Statvfs modules. I would also like to be 
able to include a Filesys::statfs module and change Filesys::Df to use it when 
its appropriate. For example OSX only supports statfs().

Currently Tom Christiansen owns this namespace. There hasnt been a published 
module for it for at least 4 years though. I made a request back in 99 to see 
if I could use the namespace. I have sent several emails to him but never got 
a reply. Im guessing he isnt doing anything with the Filesys::statfs 
namespace. Is there anyway to get access to use this?


Thanks,
Ian Guthrie
