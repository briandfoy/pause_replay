Actually the P4:: namespace is also not entirely new as P4::Client already 
exists.

VCS:: is a generic interface to SCM systems in the same way as DBD:: is a 
generic interface to SQL databases. P4:: is a module specific to Perforce. 
I will produce a VCS::P4 at some point too.

Aarrgh! Stop - it hurts! ;-). No it isn't - PCVS is a lame duck whilst 
Perforce is a soaring eagle!
