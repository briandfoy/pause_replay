Subject: my email has a typo in PAUSE
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: mark@aufflick.com ("Mark Aufflick")

And so I cannot retrieve my password. I'm sure it's all my fault, but
I can't fix it!

As shown on http://search.cpan.org/~aufflick/ PAUSE thinks my name in
my email has two Ls:

mark@auffllick.com instead of mark@aufflick.com

The id is correct, as is the website url.

The PAUSE "forgot password" page says "Should the mail not arrive,
please tell us." - is this list the mysterious "us"? :)

Thanks, and sorry to be a bother.

Mark.
