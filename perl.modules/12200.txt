The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Taxi
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Taint-aware, XML-ish data serialization
  userid:      MIKO (Miko O'Sullivan)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    many

  rationale:

    Taxi (Taint-Aware XML-Ish) is a data serializer with several handy
    features:

    - Taint aware: Taxi does not force you to trust the data you are
    serializing. None of the input data is executed.

    - Human readable: Taxi produces a human-readable string that
    simplifies checking the output of your objects.

    - XML-ish: While I don't (currently) promise full XML compliance,
    Taxi produces a block of XML-ish data that could probably be read in
    by other XML parsers.

  enteredby:   MIKO (Miko O'Sullivan)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun 15 23:57:05 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Taxi            bdpfp Taint-aware, XML-ish data serialization      MIKO
