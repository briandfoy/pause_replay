The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Conjugate Kebreni verbs
  userid:      PNE (Philip Newton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  rationale:

    Hi, I'm in the process of writing a number of modules to work with
    languages spoken on the fictional planet of Almea. This world, as
    well as the languages spoken on it, is a creation of Mark
    Rosenfelder; more information is at
    http://www.zompist.com/virtuver.htm .

    I asked him whether he had an preference as to the second-level
    module name element (after Lingua::, which I think is most
    appropriate, since these are "natural" languages, at least as
    distinguished from programming languages), and he suggested
    "Zompist". So I'm putting this and the other modules beneath
    Lingua::Zompist. In my opinion, the correct place on
    00modlist.long.html is under section 11 and there under "Specific
    Natural Languages", even though it's a conlang or constructed
    language.

    Perhaps you could also register me as the contact person for the
    second-level designator Lingua::Zompist to me (similar to how
    Lingua::EN and Lingua::PT are listed separately in
    00modlist.long.html); you can probably use something like cdph? for
    the DSLIP.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::Zompist::
::Kebreni         cdpOp Conjugate Kebreni verbs                      PNE
