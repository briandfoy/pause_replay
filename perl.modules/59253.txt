Subject: Module submission Data::Validation

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Validation
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Check data values form conformance with cons
  userid:      PJFL (Peter Flanigan)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::FormValidator

  rationale:

    The API to Data::FormValidator is ugly and heavy. It seemed to be
    trying to force me to write the constraints as subroutines when I
    think of them as data. Also the actual tests implemented in D::FV
    didn't seem to be that useful

  enteredby:   PJFL (Peter Flanigan)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb 28 16:19:02 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Validation      bdpOa Check data values form conformance with cons PJFL
