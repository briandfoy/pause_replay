My apologies to the good folks at the CPAN - I'd forgotten I'd 
registered that namespace.

I'm afraid I really don't have a good use for that namespace right now - 
most of my development is in ERP/MRP/Telnet related areas. Not much 
chance I'll be back in the Neural Net programming area anytime soon.

Sorry for the trouble, gents. I apologize for any inconvenience - let me 
know if there's anything I can do to help.

Regards,
-josiah
