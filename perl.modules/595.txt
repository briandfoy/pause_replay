Subject: Extending the LockFile::Simple namespace

I already have a module named LockFile::Simple.

However, I'd like to make the module more OO, and in particular,
have locks be returned as LockFile::Lock objects.

I don't wish to make it LockFile::Simple::Lock, because other locking
schemes like LockFile::XXX might also wish to return LockFile::Lock
objects (which have an attribute that points back to the lock scheme).

To be able to also write LockFile::Lock in a general way, I need to
introduce the LockFile::Scheme from which LockFile::Simple will inherit.

The LockFile::Scheme will be a purely deferred class, i.e. all its
routines will be deferred. But it will define the interface on which
LockFile::Lock will be able to base its processing.

When someone else implements LockFile::XXX, he might want to
inherit from LockFile::Scheme, and hop! Everything else works.

I can't break the LockFile::Simple name for backward compatibility
reasons. Although, if I were to do it today, it would be named
LockFile::Scheme::Simple.

How can I advertise that LockFile::Simple uses the names LockFile::Manager
and LockFile::Lock?
