Hello all, Graham is correct in stating that all of the names that Andreas
turned up refer to the same format. Actually there is GDSIII and GDSIV as
well. Throughout the industry however everyone says "G D S two" when refering
to these files. One name for the module that would make sense if you want
a higher level name would be:

Stream::GDS2

since many vendors refer to the format as "GDS stream" or sometimes 
just "stream" files.

I would prefer to use "GDS2" in the name over "GDSII" not only because
most users of the format say "G D S two" rather than "G D S eye eye" but 
also because "GDSII" is a registered trademark of CALMA/GE.
Thanks for your time,
Ken
