Hi;
I notice that the page
<http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html> has not been updated
for two years.  I use this page to investigate the characteristics of
modules in more detail than is possible from a one-line description,
usually by browsing the module itself.  Unfortunately, because it is
so out of date the utility is quite impaired.

Many links are broken. =20

The DSLIP field is, at best, misleading; PDL, for example, is noted as
being in alpha test.

It is often difficult or impossible to find out who, if anyone, is
maintaining a module.  For example, Term::Complete, included in the
standard distribution, is broken, as I found out when I wanted to use
it.  After debugging it and improving it to make it more rational, I
was unable to communicate with the person listed as the maintainer,
Wayne Thompson.  And I don't know how to communicate my findings back
to the community.

Often one cannot browse a module to find out if it is suitable to a
particular purpose without downloading and decompressing it.

You say most, but not all modules are archived at CPAN.  Where are the
others?  I found pdl.perl.org by chance.  How about links to other
sites?

Yours,


Mike Donn
