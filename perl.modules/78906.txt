Subject: Module submission Lingua::Orthon
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Orthon
  DSLIP:       aupOp
  description: Identify/describe orthographic neighbors
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Levenshtein, Text::WagnerFischer

  rationale:

    A word, and one of its orthographic neighbors: TAP, LAP

    Studying these relationships: involved in building models of visual
    word recognition (basic processes in reading), and computer science
    re word-recognition and -translation software, web
    scraping/searching, cryptography.

    Main impetus: partial out some of the meths re orthography in
    Lingua::Norms::USF model (name approved; being developed) to a
    separate module that has more application potential - and not
    specifically to English but any character strings (hence
    Lingua::Orthon not Lingua::EN::Orthon). This includes some mere
    wrapping about other Perl-modules (esp. Text::Levenshtein,
    Text::WagnerFischer), and options to expand them to include weights
    of one kind or another on a per-letter basis - as well as
    integration with the semantic information supplied by
    Lingua:Norms::USF.

  enteredby:   RGARTON (roderick garton)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 20 13:50:39 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
::Orthon          aupOp Identify/describe orthographic neighbors     RGARTON
