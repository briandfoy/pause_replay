G'day fabulous modules list folks,

I've been spending a lot of time writing my Exobrain software¹ recently,
which one can think of as being an open source framework for managing If
This Then That² style interactions, but without giving third parties access
to your data and accounts. Right now I'm giving it some serious reworking
and clean-up.

At some point I'd like to push this to the CPAN for others to potentially
use, but I'm trying to figure out what to do about the name. Right now
everything is in the 'App::Exobrain' namespace, except the gotcha is that
the 'App::Exobrain' module (and most of its related modules) aren't apps at
all, they're frameworks, transport modules, and magic glue that normalise
diverse data sources into consistent classes.

Right now there's about 50 files with separate roles, classes, ubic
services, endpoints, classifiers, and related bits of infrastructure. That's
likely to double by the time we reach mid-Feb, which is my Conference Driven
Development deadline for getting this into a presentable and widely usable
form. I'm currently using it on my own systems to manage various chunks of
my life.

Since this is designed so that third-party developers will be able to plug
in their own services, it feels weird to ask them to write code like `with
App::Exobrain::Measurement` in their class (which isn't an app).

I would like to pop everything into the 'Exobrain' namespace, but that's a
top-level namespace; I definitely don't want to take that without
discussion. The name 'Exobrain' is relatively fixed, as it's been discussed
at YAPC::Asia, as well as extensively with my friends and colleagues.

Many thanks,

	Paul
