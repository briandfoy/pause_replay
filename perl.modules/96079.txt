These are classes defined in Class::PObject::Template, just as subclasses of the relevant Class::PObject::Type::<type> class. In general, a distribution should keep package names within its own namespace. But beyond that, your permissions on the TEXT package clashes with AKHOBOV’s ownership of the “Text” package.

The easy way to do 2:

  use aliased 'Class::Object::Type::VARCHAR';
  use aliased 'Class::Object::Type::CHAR';
  ...

which will export constants for VARCHAR(), CHAR() etc. (this is how
JSON::MaybeXS provides JSON->new btw).

Or you could automate generation of said constants with 'use constant'.

Or whatever.
