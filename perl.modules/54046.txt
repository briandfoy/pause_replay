The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::PlotDataset
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: Tk widget to plot zoomable 2D line graphs
  userid:      ITDEV (Bruce Mitchell)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, comp.lang.perl.announce, comp.lang.perl.tk

  similar:
    Tk::LineGraph Tk::Chart

  rationale:

    Our module is based on the existing CPAN module - Tk::LineGraph.
    The Tk::LineGraph module can draw multiple 2D line graphs with an
    optional second y-axis. The graphs it produces are zoomable and
    contain a legend. Whilst our new module maintains much of the
    functionality of Tk::LineGraph, certain changes have been made that
    we feel makes it a module in it's own right.

    The main difference between our Tk::PlotDataset module and the
    original Tk::LineGraph is that our's creates the graph as a widget
    and not in a separate window. It therefore does not have the drop
    down menus used to configure the graph in the original.

    Other additions/alterations we have made are:

    * Used Tk::Balloon to add coordinate pop-ups to data points. *
    Running the cursor over a line name in the legend will highlight the
    curve on the graph. * Added a clearDatasets method for removing all
    datasets from a plot. * Added support for a -noLine boolean
    attribute of datasets. * Added support for a -noLegend option for
    datasets, allowing them to be excluded from the legend. * Added
    -redraw option to allow a callback to be added to draw additional
    items onto the canvas when it is redrawn. * Option for a logarithmic
    scale on the x-axis (previously this was only available on the
    y-axis).

    We have also found and fixed a number of bugs in the original code.

    The only other Tk graphing module on CPAN we could find is
    Tk::Graph. Tk::Graph is based on a Canvas widget like our module and
    can draw bar and pie charts, as well as line charts. However it
    lacks the zooming capabilities and a number of other features of our
    module.

    The module is written entirely in Perl/Tk and therefore logically
    fits into the Tk namespace. Like Tk::LineGraph, the module plots
    Tk::LineGraphDataset objects. We wanted to convey this in the name,
    but also that it is distinctly different to the Tk::LineGraph
    module. I feel the name we have chosen does this.
