Following bad examples doesn't make it right. I'd like to see you come
up with good, descriptive names that help people find your modules and
know what they do. 

I think all of your modules probably already fit into an existing
top-level namespace. Don't think they all have to live in the same
namespace. Now it's just a matter of finding the right second-level
namespace that accurately distinguishes your module from others. Our
thoughts on modules names are at:

Good luck :)
