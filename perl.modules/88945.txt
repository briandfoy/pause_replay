This is my second posting to the list (and module owner) to request
(co)maintainer status of the AnyEvent::STOMP module. The current owner
(PAUSE ID: OTTERLEY <https://metacpan.org/author/OTTERLEY>) has already
indicated his willingness to transfer
responsibility (see below) to me (PAUSE ID: fhew).

I am ready and prepared to be either the maintainer or a
co-maintainer of AnyEvent::STOMP.  If (on PAUSE) you can
transfer or abandon maintainer-ship of the module,
or add me as a co-maintainer, I would appreciate it.
