Subject: Module submission Games::Maze

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Maze
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Create Mazes as Objects
  userid:      JGAMBLE (John Gamble)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    It's been mentioned on comp.lang.perl.modules.

  similar:
    None that I know of.

  rationale:

    The module has been up on CPAN for years. I've just been remiss in
    registering it. No new rootlevel namespace created. I've finally
    gotten around to registering it after reading on the modules mailing
    list about the number of unregistered modules, and I didn't want to
    be part of the problem.

  enteredby:   JGAMBLE (John Gamble)
  enteredon:   Sun Oct 24 01:20:52 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Maze            MdpOp Create Mazes as Objects                      JGAMBLE
