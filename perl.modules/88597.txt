Thanks, Brian.
I agree about the names...

how about...

- instead of Tk::MDText...
Tk::Markdown - to display markdown (subset: I'm not going to try to support 
inline html!)
Tk::MarkdownTk - a Tk::Markdown that also has the Tk tags functionality... 
eg <Tk::Button -text="whatever">

- and instead of MDTextBook...
Tk::MIMEApp - uses MIME multipart to construct an app.
