The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::IRAF::CL
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: Perl interface to IRAF CL session
  userid:      SJQUINNEY (Stephen John Quinney)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    This is a Perl module that provides an object-orientated interface
    to the IRAF CL interactive session, it is built on top of the Perl
    Expect module. You can script almost anything through this module
    that you can do in a normal interactive CL session.

    This module provides several improved, and more Perl-like,
    interfaces to various IRAF systems, such as session variables, the
    management of loading/unloading IRAF packages and the session
    history. It also provides the ability to specify maximum run times
    for commands, and the clean handling of these time outs and other
    types of errors and exceptions. All functions are called in an
    object-orientated fashion allowing several concurrent interpreter
    sessions if desired.

    I am proposing to create the IRAF sub-section within the Astro
    namespace as with such an extensive system as IRAF i can foresee
    other people wanting to upload their own IRAF modules in the future,
    possibly built on top of this generic module.

    IRAF is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, a general
    purpose software system for the reduction and analysis of
    astronomical data. See http://iraf.noao.edu for more details
