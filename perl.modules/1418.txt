Why limit it to Date ? It should be more general but I cannot think
of a name. Carp::Package Carp::SkipHier ...

I was expecting something like

sub carp {
  my $pkg = caller;
  $pkg =~ s/::.*//;
  my $level = $Carp::CarpLevel;
  local $Carp::CarpLevel = 1;
  1 while caller($Carp::CarpLevel++) =~ /^$pkg(::|$)/;
  $Carp::CarpLevel += $level;
  Carp::carp @_;
}

And likewise for the other subs in Carp too.
