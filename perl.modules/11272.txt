Subject: Module submission Authen::Krb5::Easy
To: modules@perl.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::Krb5::Easy
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: Easy krb5 client interface using krb libs.
  userid:      SCHALLEE (Ed Schaller)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    kerberos@mit.byu.edu, Author of Authen::Krb5 (bounced)

  similar:
    Authen::Krb5

  rationale:

    This is a library to easily get client authentication for kerberos
    connections. It is different than Authen::Krb5 in that it is heigher
    level and that Authen::Krb5 does not support client authentication.

    The extension Easy was chosen because it closely mimics the
    kerberos command line utilities, but interfaces directly with the
    kerberos c libraries for speed.

    I see this module being especially useful for automated and cgi
    scripts that need to authenticate using kerberos to service such as
    a database.

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::Krb5::
::Easy            bdcfp Easy krb5 client interface using krb libs.   SCHALLEE
