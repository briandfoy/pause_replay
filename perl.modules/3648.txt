To create a simple shopping basket object which allows the

I would appreciate any comments on where this module should be
located. I see it as a Business module, but you may have other
ideas, please let me know.

This module has been discussed on the London.pm mailing list
and will be reviewed by this list before being published.

If there is any more information you need please let me know.

Thanks

Yours

Leo Lapworth
