The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JMX::Jmx4Perl
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: Remote JMX access to Java Applications
  userid:      ROLAND (Roland Huﬂ)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    SNMP Net::SNMP

  rationale:

    I'm about to finish a module for accessing Java JEE Server's JMX
    MBeanServer remotely by transfering JSON entities. This contains a
    Java agent part, which gets deployed as a WAR on the JEE Server and
    which exposes JMX information via HTTP.

    The perl side encapsulates the HTTP request and JSON parsing. It
    provides an OO style programming model which can be used for Nagios
    checks to monitor JEE Servers. The question is, which is the
    appropriate namespace.

    The closest toplevel existing namespaces are "Nagios" and "SNMP",
    but evidently JMX is something quite different. In a perfect world,
    they would be all below a top level namespace like "Management".

    My suggestions for a module name are:

    JMX::Jmx4Perl - Top-Level "JMX" Management::JMX::Agent - Top Level
    "Management", but this seems to be overkill for a single module, or
    ? Nagios::JMX::Agent - Since the module is probably most valuable
    for nagios checks, but it is not related

    My prefered name for now is 'JMX::Jmx4Perl', where I might consider
    to provider alternativemodules for accessing JMX information via
    perl modules (e.g. one based on GCJ::Cni or Java::Import)

  enteredby:   ROLAND (Roland Huﬂ)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 25 09:14:51 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

JMX::
::Jmx4Perl        adhOg Remote JMX access to Java Applications       ROLAND
