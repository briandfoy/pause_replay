Steffen,

Thank you for your message and your efforts. 

You, the PAUSE administrators, have made no error. I did register the namespace "Mac::Serial" some time ago (when Macs did have serial ports) but because the associated module became "out-moded" due to hardware changes I never when forward with an upload to PAUSE.

I would like to retain the Mac::Serial namespace registration for those few users of old (perhaps ancient) hardware.

Best regards,
Joseph
