This is an attempt to reach fellow authors/maintainers of modules on 
cpan.org in order to prevent the same email-preventing mistake I made.  
If your emails from cpan.org are still okay, you may still want to be 
aware of this issue.

When I get spam, I typically forward it as an attachment to 
missed-spam@comcast.net and, voila, no more spam from that address.  I 
then delete the email message.

Just out of curiousity, I looked at the latest email spam that I sent to 
the stated missed-spam address.  Ouch!  It came from cpan.org.  That 
means two things. 1) cpan addresses are being spammed, and, 2) I will no 
longer get myName@cpan.org emails routed to me.  I deleted it before I 
could discern whether it originated from cpan.org, or whether cpan.or 
was just being spammed, with the spams being dutifully forwarded.

I will have to contact Comcast now to once again get cpan.org email.  If 
you have had problems getting the automated emails from cpan, perhaps 
you have made the same mistake.

No need to reply.  Besides, you probably cannot from cpan.org anyway.  
Sorry for the spam about spam.
