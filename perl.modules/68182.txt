The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hash::AutoHash
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Object-oriented access to real and tied hash
  userid:      NATG (Nathan Goodman)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Hash::AsObject Hash::Inflator Data::OpenStruct::Deep
    Object::AutoAccessor

  rationale:

    This is yet another module that provide object-oriented access to a
    hash using methods with the same name as the element's key. The main
    difference between this module and its forebears is that it supports
    tied hashes, in addition to regular hashes. This allows a modular
    division of labor: this class is generic and treats all hashes the
    same; any special semantics come from the tied hash.The class
    provides a clean namespace: any method invoked on an object of this
    class is interpreted as a request to access an element of the
    underlying hash. The class is designed for easy sub-classing: a
    common use-case is a subclass that provides an object interface to a
    specific tied hash class. I have in hand five such subclasses that I
    hope to submit as soon as I can get them packaged.

The resulting entry would be:

Hash::
