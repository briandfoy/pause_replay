The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::StatCache
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: Caching wrapper around the stat() function
  userid:      PEVANS (Paul Evans)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::stat

  rationale:

    This module implements a global cache of the results of the stat()
    syscall, and implements a timeout on queries. A real stat() syscall
    will not be made if the requested file was last checked within a
    number of seconds ago. This helps ensure the filesystem does not get
    overloaded for large numbers of requests of the same item.

    Possible future extension might be to optionally use the
    Linux::Inotify module, to allow the cache for particular files to be
    invalidated immediately if the kernel informs that something has
    changed. If so, the timeout could be put at a much larger value,
    further lightening the load on the real filesystem.

    This module was orignally designed and intended for use in
    high-traffic website generation scripts, to check such files as the
    page template or configuration files. We don't care in these cases
    if a change in the underlying file is not noticed immediately, or a
    small delay of say 60 seconds occurs.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
