Personally, I think the toll trying to maintain DBIC effectively single handed
has clearly taken is good evidence that trying to replace riba's work with a
single person would be a terrible idea for them, if not for the project, and
that a return to the team development model of the olden days is probably
the only viable approach, though building additional caution into it since
we're now even bigger and more crucial than we were then would be wise.

Entirely possible, though I suspect if we managed to get all of the branches
people had planned that were delayed because riba's response to the proposed
features was "yes, but please wait for me to finish X first" done then that
work in itself might be a major release's worth.

That will, however, be a question to be addressed by whatever the project's
governance is once the current dust settles, so I guess defer it for now.
