The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Search::Kinosearch
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Search::Kinosearch - search engine library
  userid:      CREAMYG (Marvin Humphrey)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    kinosearch@rectangular.com http://www.rectangular.com/kinosearch

  similar:
    Plucene Search::Xapian

  rationale:

    Kinosearch is a search engine library, optimized for search-time
    performance with large datasets. It supports phrase matching,
    boolean queries of arbitrary depth, stemming, excerpting, sorting by
    either date or relevance, and more. The core functions are
    language-independent and agnostic with regards to encoding;
    provisions have been made to facilitate extension to an arbitrary
    number of languages. The ranking algorithm uses the classic Term
    Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF).

The resulting entry would be:

Search::
::Kinosearch      ampOp Search::Kinosearch - search engine library   CREAMYG
