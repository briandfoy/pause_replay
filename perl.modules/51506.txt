The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weather::Underground::StationHistory
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Historical data from http://wunderground.com
  userid:      ELLIOTJS (Elliot Shank)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Weather::Underground

  rationale:

    The existing Weather::Underground module gets current conditions by
    scraping the HTML for a location.

    Weather Underground also provides access to historical data. This
    module provides access to that data in a clean format.

    Nominally, the history is in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.
    If you view this data a web browser, the data does appear to be in
    that format. However, the MIME type given for the data by the web
    server is "text/html" and the data contains <br> tags and HTML
    comments (though no <html>, <head>, or <body> tags that you would
    expect for an HTML document). Thus, if a user copies and pastes the
    data from the web browser, the application receiving the data will
    get correct CSV, but anything trying to directly parse the page
    content as CSV will encounter problems.

The resulting entry would be:

Weather::Underground::
