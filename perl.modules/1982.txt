Great. The document on PAUSE, CPAN/modules/04pause.html recently got a
paragraph added containing the sentence:

    Generally a lack of response can be taken as acceptance of the
    module name being proposed.

It was always CPAN's policy to accept per default rather than deny,
but it was not announced properly. Sorry for that.
