The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Glib
  DSLIP:       bmcOl
  description: Interface GLib utility and Object librarys
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    gtk-perl-list@gnome.org

  similar:
    Gtk, for version 1, Event, Class::*

  rationale:

    In version 1, this was part of the Gtk module. However, glib-2 is a
    very useful library on it's own, as it offers an event model similar
    to event, cross-platform-utility functions, an object and type
    system more.

    Thus it's only reasonable to unbundle it so users can take
    advantage of it without having to install and use Gtk2.

    The new toplevel namespace makes sense because the module name is
    sufficiently unique, and doesn't fit into any existing "category"
    (also, I think that categories and namespaces are distinct
    things...).

  enteredon:   Thu Jun 19 15:47:10 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Glib              bmcOl Interface GLib utility and Object librarys   MLEHMANN
