The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       I18N::AcceptLanguage
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Matches lang preference to available langs
  userid:      CGILMORE (Christian Gilmore)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wrote this module as part of a product internationalization
    effort. I needed to determine what language bundle I should use in
    specific situations and decided that writing a perl module that
    implemented the functionality described in the HTTP/1.1
    specification section 14.4 (RFC 2616) in a protocol agnostic fashion
    would be ideal.

    When taken out of the HTTP context, the most ideal place for this
    module in my mind is under I18N for its applicability to
    internationalized software.

The resulting entry would be:

I18N::
::AcceptLanguage  RdpOo Matches lang preference to available langs   CGILMORE
