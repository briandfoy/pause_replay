What you are proposing falls into the "framework" class of modules.

It's generally considered impossible to create a framework that can 
cover ALL classes of applications.

For example, does your ORM layer block on database calls, by using DBI 
for example? If so, it's entirely useless for asynchronous programming 
of the type that the POE module provides.

Unlike modules that are built up as single components (bottom up style) 
the frameworks define the scope of applications. In that sense, they 
limit the applications and work top down.

Because there are so many potential variations of these (tieing together 
lots of components) often it's preferable that the module go into the 
CPAN as a "branded" module.

For example, Jifty, Catalyst et al for web frameworks.

There's just so many different potential ways to make web apps, you 
can't get a module name such as Web::Application etc.
