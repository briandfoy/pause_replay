     why:

    A DBI subclass that retries database connections and query
    executions when certain errors occur. Similar to DBIx::DWIW, but
    it's a dropin replacement for DBI. Tentatively called DBIx::Retry,
    but I'd like to hear suggestions. It's also currently
    MySQL-specific, but it doesn't have to be (I don't know how many
    other drivers allow reexecuting a query after the database
    connection is lost, though).
