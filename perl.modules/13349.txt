I am working on finishing up a module, Config::Locator, that locates the
correct configuration files for modules that use Config::Locator. It
allows developers and build managers to manage hard-coded (or default)
configuration paths at build time. The modules in question need not know
anything about where the configuration is located (on disk, ftp, http,
DBI, etc.). This would allow, for example, several developers to work
simultaneously on the same set of modules using their own configuration
libraries. Config::Locator is best suited to environments that require a
build process prior to using the module needing its configuration.
