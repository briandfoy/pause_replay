Hi all,

David J. GÃ¶hrig, the maintainer of SDL, took a leave of absence several
months ago, offering maintainership of the modules to whoever wanted to
take up the torch.  I have done so:

	http://sdl.perl.org/

I'd like to have maintainership of the module so I can upload a new
version to PAUSE in the next few weeks.  It's difficult to contact Dave
now, but it's possible if you need confirmation.

Best,
-- c
