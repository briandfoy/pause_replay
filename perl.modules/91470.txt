     why:

    I've written a memory profiler for Perl (something which currently
    seems to be missing from CPAN), and CPAN appeared to be an
    appropriate place to host it. Currently the backend is close to a
    CPAN-uploadable state (and currently online at
    <https://gitorious.org/perl-devel-trackallocations/perl-devel-trackallocations/>);
    the frontend is usable but unfinished and not ready yet (e.g. it's
    missing tests).

    I'm also experimenting with various other tools for looking inside
    Perl internals, but am far from sure whether they're useful/sensible
    enough to appear on CPAN, so I most likely won't submit those.
