The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SemanticDebugger
  DSLIP:       idpfn
  description: It is on a making of semantic debugger
  userid:      HCKKID (Satyender Yadav)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Everywhere

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is to make a semantics based debugger in perl language . Which
    will operate on sample language made in perl too . The aim is to
    make a debugger which can trace logical errors and correct them .
    This is an unsolvable problem still there are some cases in which
    this debugger will work . So this module will only handle those
    cases . Later I may try to make a debugger for perl too .

The resulting entry would be:

SemanticDebugger  idpfn It is on a making of semantic debugger       HCKKID
