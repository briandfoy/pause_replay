Subject: Module submission Test::CPANpm

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::CPANpm
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Test CPAN.pm's interaction with your module
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    cpan-discuss@perl.org

  similar:
    Test::Prereqs

  rationale:

    brian d foy <brian.d.foy@gmail.com> was not happy with the name
    "Test::CPAN". I asked him what he would prefer, and "Andreas J.
    Koenig" <andreas.koenig.gmwojprw@franz.ak.mind.de> replied
    suggesting Test::CPANpm. It's all the same to me, so long as I have
    *somewhere* to put this module. :)

    This module tests how CPAN.pm will interact when it unpacks your
    distribution, so you can make sure that it's dependancies get
    recognized and it is built/tested/installed from within a CPAN
    session before you upload it to PAUSE.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::CPANpm          adpfp Test CPAN.pm's interaction with your module  CRAKRJACK
