    This brought back some frustrated memories. I tried to take over
    Math::Brent, for the purpose of upgrading the package and fixing an
    error. I managed to locate John Williams, who was fine with it --
    but who then couldn&#39;t grant me co-maintenance because PAUSE didn&#3=
9;t
    have him as the owner (I checked, and all of his modules at that
    time were co-owned by another user, although only one had been
    worked on).<br>
    <br>
    At that point he didn&#39;t feel like proceeding further, and I didn&#3=
9;t
    feel like making an issue of it, especially if the other user was
    going to make the fixes anyway.<br>
    <br>
    It&#39;s now two years later. The other user doesn&#39;t seem to have
    ownership anymore, but Math::Brent is still has an outstanding bug.<br>
    <br>
    I&#39;m still interested in being a co-maintainer. For that matter, I&#=
39;d
    be interested in co-maintaining Math::Fortran and Math::Derivative,
    although I would probably retire the Math::Fortran name for
    something like Math::Util.<span class=3D"HOEnZb"><font color=3D"#888888=
