The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Norms::USF
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: search U Sth Florida word association norms
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lingua-EN-AffectiveNorms

  rationale:

    There are many psychological word norms available, some from
    published articles, others from psychology departments or research
    sites online. These concern language (rather than just String or
    Text) - hence including under Lingua family. The language itself is
    not as relevant as the fact that these are norms we are searching,
    hence creating a sub-family of "Norms" under which norms of any
    language can be housed. The simply acronym "USF" sufficiently
    identifies the particular source of this database - although there
    are a couple other "USF norms" (for rhyming words and "word
    fragments"), this is definitely the main one, others might later be
    further specified.

  enteredby:   RGARTON (roderick garton)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov 11 01:16:52 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::Norms::
