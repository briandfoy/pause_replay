Hi,

I need a pause ID. Here is the information you require:

user name                     : Ramki Balasubramanian
user email address            : ramki@netcom.com
user homepage if you have one : http://209.233.26.40/ (dns name is too long)
user preferred user-ID on CPAN: ramki 
description of contribution   : documentation 
(DSLI) for modules            : not yet
scripts, ports, documentation : 'perl basics for sysadmins'

document history:

  I have created a small (30 page) document on perl. I have used it
  for a course at my company (Taos Mountain, taos.com). I received 
  good feedback from my peers, so I wanted to contribute it to CPAN
  so that everybody can use it as they need. I sent an email to 
  perlfaq-suggestions@perl.com and Nat responded with a request
  to use PAUSE to upload it.

  I have the document available at:

	http://209.233.26.40/courses/perlbasix/basix.pod
	http://209.233.26.40/courses/perlbasix/basix.html

I would like to also use the PAUSE id to contribute to
the scripts area in the future.

cheers,
Ramki
