I'm fairly frustrated with Perl at this moment.  I've been working with it
for over 2 years and the biggest problem is getting from this list

http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html

to the actual module.  The search takes minutes upon minutes to find the
module.  Sometimes you are just browsing trying to find the right module for
the task and that 'browsing' takes hours at a time.

Is there anyway to speed up the search system?  It shouldn't take THAT long
to look for a name in a list and return a web page.  Should it?

Any help would be appreciated.  This is a problem that has been the most
frustrating part of working with Perl.  Perl itself it great but getting to
the modules is a royal pain.

HELP!

Thanks,

R.B. Woods
Wichita, KS
