and the use of 'undef' (vs. 'null') suggests Perlish semantics to me. YMMV.

I don't see any reason to give the module(s) a version except for the 
Module::Build+CPAN-Indexer toolchain issues.

It's not really something that can be reused independently from the rest 
of the distribution, so I don't see the pint.

I'm also worried that if I give the rest of the modules in the 
distribution separate versions, then I'll forget to maintain them, and 
out-of-date version information is worse than none at all, IMHO.

Cheers,
Moritz
