Thanks, I'll keep that in mind when I come close to this code again.

I don't know either, I'm not familiar with Module::Build.

I fear I cannot predict the exact outcome. I'm still a bit puzzled as
to what exactly prevented you to become first-come. So a new upload
would be interesting but no need to rush. Do it as you see fit. And
yes, please remind me of the upload when it happens.

I see no urgent need to worry about namespaces of this deep level.
Somehow so far we have not seen many namespace troubles even with much
shorter module names. I also do not expect that users will trip over
it, so I'd let it rest until a new release is due for other reassons.
