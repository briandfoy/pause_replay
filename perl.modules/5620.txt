Folks,

I just registered for the module list the namespaces

Festival::Client
Festival::Client::Async
Speech::Festival
Speech::Festival::Synthesiser

I'm not quite happy that we now have Festival in two different places
and would welcome a great unification. Basically we can go either way.
Speech is a good toplevel name but Festival is a famous library in its
own right.

I'm not intending to push anything here, I just discovered that all of
you were unregistered all the years and I'd like to apologize for that.

Please make up your mind who could rename what so that we get them
closer to each other, namespacewise.

Thanks for your time, your modules, and your considerations!
