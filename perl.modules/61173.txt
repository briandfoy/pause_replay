Hi Paul, hi p5p, hi modules list,

I'll just answer to both lists. modules@perl.org can transfer ownership
and give co-maintenance permissions. That's what you'd need to get rid
of the unauthorized-release tag. However, since Fatal is in core, we
would need the permissions from the pumpking first.

Best regards,
Steffen

P.S.: I'll be away for a week starting Saturday, so I can't just monitor
p5p for an okay from Rafael unless it's today.
