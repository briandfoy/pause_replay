My guess is that the indexer doesn't know what to do with
MooseX::Declare syntax. It appears to the indexer that there are no
"package" statements, just as the error message said.

There is no 'provides' sections in your META.yml to say which
namespaces you're providing.

The indexer's job is really to discover which packages in your
distributions it should put into 02packages.details so CPAN clients can
find it. That includes not indexing those packages when they show up in
other people's distributions.

The question really gets down to how much PAUSE should chase syntax
mutators to discover this stuff when you don't declare it yourself. You
might ask on the Moose list what other people are doing since this is
the first time I've seen anyone complain about this problem.
