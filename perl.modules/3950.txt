Why are you afraid that people will do this? I assume that when someone
writes a Inline::WhatEver she will be eager to cooperate with the Inline

<personal reply> I don't think that is realistic. Namespaces are not owned
by anyone, and it is impossible for us, a small team of volunteers, to keep
track of the details of each submission and verify if it fullfils certain
requirements. Sorry. </personal reply>
