Hi. This is the qmail-send program at vipe.technion.ac.il.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<descartes@symbolstone.org>:
Sorry, I wasn't able to establish an SMTP connection. (#4.4.1)
I'm not going to try again; this message has been in the queue too long.

Installing Pod::DocBook from CPAN installs P-DB-0.05 instead of the more up
to date 0.06 by Jan Iven. I have an even more up-to-date 0.07 version on
my hard disk, but uploading it will not get it installed by default
either.

Can I become the owner of the Pod::DocBook namespace instead of Alligator
Descartes who no longer maintains this package, and who was unresponsive
last time I tried to contact him?

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
