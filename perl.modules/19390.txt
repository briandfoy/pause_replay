Well this is my first go and getting something into CPAN and I'd like to
submit the following modules for consideration

    POE::Component::RSSAggregator
    RSS::Feed
    RSS::Feed::Headline

This is how POE::Component::RSSAggregator works:

    1.  init the component with
	a. an array of hashs that represent rss urls you want to watch
	b. a callback to handle new headlines when they show appear

    2.  the states for the component are as followes

        _start    takes the hashes and create RSS::Feed objects with them 
	          the posts each one to the kernel to the 'check' state
	check     attempts to fetch the url via PoCo::Client::HTTP and passes 
		  control to 'response', check also posts back to itself
		  with a delay set by the RSS::Feed object
	response  response check for a valid page then attempts to parse
	          the page with with XML::RSS and if it parses, passes
		  control to 'parsed'
	parsed    takes the structure returned by XML::RSS and set it
	          in the current RSS::Feed object (which creates an 
		  RSS::Feed::Headline object for each title
		  It then does a test to see if there are any new
		  headlines and if there are hands control to announce
	announce  just calls callback with the new headlines it finds
	          right now it just returns an array ref, but will 
		  probably end up returning RSS::Headline objects

I'm not sure where RSS::Feed and RSS::Feed::Headline should be
XML::RSS::Feed and XML::RSS::Feed::Headline so that may be a
consideration as well.
