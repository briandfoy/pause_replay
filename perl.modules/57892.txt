Hello,


	I have completed a unique date module named Date::Components.  I was
motivated to create it to support financial planning software I am
writing and the current modules did not quite meet my needs.  It is a
set of subroutines, NOT OPP, which perform a variety of tasks and
analysis on dates AND date components.  It is independent of time and
thus is compact, simple and is applicable for years into the future -
the integer limit of the system.  On the front end is a general purpose
parser and on the back end is a corresponding formatter.  It comes with
a comes with a comprehensive set of tests which provide 100% code coverage.


	Any feedback would be appreciated.  Specifically, is the name I chose
acceptable?  I am ready to upload it.


	Thanks,

	David McAllister
