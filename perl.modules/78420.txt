(I'm having to remove cc-ing perl.modules, because my mailer can't 
handle that.  Please forward as you like.)

I'd like to give away most of the modules that still remain to me.
But I'm hanging on to these, because they're things I use in work and 
so actually have vital reason to keep in perfect shape:
   Text::Unidecode,
   RTF::Writer,
   Sort::ArbBiLex,

Now, as to history of why I held onto a lot of other things-- it has 
been because either:

* The given module is so simple (Array::Autojoin, IO::Null, 
Class::BlackHole) that it didn't look even worth the bother of chasing 
anybody down for-- and it had taken plenty of effort to give away 
modules so far.  (BUT since you're taking things unconditionally, why 
/not/ pass them off?...)

Or:
* I estimated that the given module might /conceivably/ need bugfixes, 
BUT where a greater risk was of a next-maintainer becoming... eager... 
and turning the module from a tack-hammer into a nuclear sledgehammer, 
with seventy dials on the side).  The one case where I thought I was 
safe but which sorta went all radioactive like that is File::HomeDir. 
  But I haven't heard of any other trouble yet (and I stumbled on the 
File::HomeDir laugh-tastrophe only by accident); and in short, the 
world does me a favor when it leaves me ignorant of unpleasant things 
that I can't do anything about.

Or:
* There's other modules I remembered only as an unpleasant haze, but 
not being sure why-- a bug? an irrelevancy? a basically flawed 
concept? the module addressing a problem that no longer exists?-- And 
to clear that up would require me looking at docs and code which, 
well, I remember only as something I don't want to look at.


But now that we're no longer in the model of me having to sell people 
on things, but instead "HEY HAVE MY FREE KITTENS, EVEN THOUGH ONE 
MIGHT BE FERAL, WHICH ONE, NOT SURE.", yeah, I'll pass them to ya...

~But First~
First I'll do a quick census of the modules that PAUSE still lists me 
as maintainer of, and I'll send some email around about who might like 
first or zeroeth dibs on maintaining each one (like: right now I'll 
email Damian about Class::Classless), I'll wait a few days for 
responses from those guys to come in (once there's been an iteration 
of "ohgodno!!, but I'll forward to someone who would want/tolerate 
that module a lot!"), and I'll report back on which kittens (=most!) 
are still available.
And anyway, if anyone misses their chance at their dream of 
maintaining... Class::Blackhole!, then they can always ask for it from 
you guys.

I'll report back during/in a few days-- and thank you very much for 
this.  I spend enough time feeling SHAME merely about needing to 
rewrite Text::Unidecode's data tables, without my fretting about how 
there's OTHER modules that I'm responsible for, and which every month 
or two I'll occasionally get a bug report about, via the Baffling Bug 
Tracking System Du Jour, and ow my brain Calgon take me away!
