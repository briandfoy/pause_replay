hi,

I think our mail system must have eaten your reply because I only found
your reply using google. Anyway, not to worry:

Yes, my employers simply don't want me uploading "work" using my
personal account. Now they did originally set up the BBCIFL account but
were told (apparently) that CPAN/PAUSE frowns upon accounts that are for
a whole group of people. They were told (apparently, again) to set up an
account for each person who would be uploading. Given that I already
have an account they wanted a new account specific to my job.
You'll see that a colleague of mine has set up BBCSIMONF and SIMONFLK -
I was just copying what he'd done.

best regards
