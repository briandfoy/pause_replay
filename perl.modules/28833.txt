     why:

    I've got a modest collection of interesting modules that I'd like
    to share with people. The more interesting ones are those that play
    with the Linux kernel. The only one I've put for public release is
    SCSI.pm <http://www.cabal.org.uk/freeware/scsi-perl.html> along with
    a sample application that rips CDs.

    Sat in the wings is an inteface for tun0, so one can write tunnels
    in pure Perl. Again, I have a proof-of-concept that does tunneling
    via DNS servers using Net::DNS.

    Unsurprisingly, I've also got YA HTML templating system, lovingly
    hand-crufted. It does the page rendering for my website and has a
    few features (the main one being that embedded code markup doesn't
    stop the document from being validating SGML) that I couldn't find
    in other such things at the time.
