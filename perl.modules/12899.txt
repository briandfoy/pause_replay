The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::PidStat
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Pid existance across a network
  userid:      WSNYDER (Wilson Snyder)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The IPC::Locker requires a network method to determine what PIDs
    are active on a remote host, and potentially other PID information
    in the future. Unlike my Schedule::Load, this uses UDP and is very
    fast.

    It's not under Locker's namespace, as this function isn't useful
    only for it, for example I'm also using it to determine on a remote
    host that someone who rsh'ed in has died.

  enteredby:   WSNYDER (Wilson Snyder)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul 28 20:31:52 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::PidStat         adpOp Pid existance across a network               WSNYDER
