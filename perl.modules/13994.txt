After designing my first module, I've run into some questions walking 
through the submission process.  I've been actively discussing these on 
the Beginning Perl mailing list and comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup, 
but I'm not sure I've found my answers, so I thought I would bring the 
questions here.

First, a little background.  I've built a module that helps rapidly 
construct Multiplexed Non-Blocking I/O Telnet servers.  The module was 
designed with an eye towards MUDs, MUSHes, or other similar game 
servers, since that what I intend to use it for, but isn't limited to 
that.  Just for summary purposes, I can implement an echo server with 
about 5 lines of code, using my module.

Now for my two questions.  First, should I submit this module to the 
CPAN?

I began this module for my own use and to learn, so I did not check for 
existing modules from the start.  Having now checked, there are similar 
creations.  IO::NonBlocking, is pretty much what I have created, with a 
pretty different interface.  Event, POE, and Stem are all at least 
capable of doing the work mine does as well, though I was aiming for 
something simpler and more focused.  There may be others.

Most of the messages on the mailing list and newsgroup seem to favor a 
submission, with two pretty strong exceptions.  My opinion is that it 
is worth submitting, but that I should channel the module's development 
to a more specialized MUD/game server in the future, filling my own 
problem domain on the CPAN.  Of course, I've never submitted a Perl 
module before and simply don't know.  I'm open to other opinions.

I do realize that I can submit it in my home directory, but I'm more 
interested in knowing if my module has a place on the list.

My other question is, what do I call it?

I was using Server::MUServer which is pretty obviously bad after 
reading the CPAN documents.  Rethinking it, I had almost settled on 
Net::MUDServer, when a newsgroup post mentioned the Net category is a 
little restrictive of entries these days.  Any advice/guidance here is 
very appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

James Gray
