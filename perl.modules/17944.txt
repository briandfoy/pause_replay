The DBI namespace is reserved for the DBI itself, the DBIx namespace is 
intended for extensions to the DBI.
I suggest that you find an appropiate name in the DBIx namespace, that will 
aid your intended users in finding your module.
I have always felt that DBIx::Simple isn't so simple (one mans simple is 
anothers complicated), so could you find something more descriptive.

Discussions of DBI related matters ought to take place on the dbi-users 
mail-list (you can find it on http://lists.perl.org).
