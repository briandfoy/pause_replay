The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sendmail::M4::test_cgi
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: HTML testing methods for Sendmail::M4::Mail8
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Sendmail::M4::Mail8 Sendmail::M4::Utils

  rationale:

    Mail8 uses a command line test mode, which is good for general
    development. But of no use to users who have attempted to send to
    the system and have been refused. This new module will provide a
    simple HTML interface, that can be used by standard Perl driven CGI
    web pages, various methods as yet to be decided. However as
    Sendmail::M4::Utils is now quite large and so important to
    celmorlauren (our e-mail server now uses the CPAN version), that I
    do not want to hack it about to put in the promised HTML support.

  enteredby:   CML (celmorlauren limited)
  enteredon:   Sun Sep 23 16:54:24 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sendmail::M4::
::test_cgi        cdpfp HTML testing methods for Sendmail::M4::Mail8 CML
