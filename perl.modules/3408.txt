Good!

CPAN infrastructure is built upon trust, so sharing namespace between
users is OK. (Heikki, when you want to be registered as CPAN author
too, please drop a line)

Yes, but you need to tell me in advance which users share what. You
have no interactive page on PAUSE that lets you handle that.

I'll do so for now and you inform me please who else should be
regarded as co-owner for which namespace.

Typically you decide what you prefer here. I think, it's natural to
actually use the top level (Net::Z3950), but if you see better fit to
keep it unused, that is your decision. I've now registered Net::Z3950
for you. You need not register all namepaces you use below that, we
trust that there won't be a conflict there.
