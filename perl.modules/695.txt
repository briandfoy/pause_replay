From: cdawson@real.com ("Chris Dawson")

I have written a set of perl classes that allow a programmer to generate
SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) documents.  The module
is located here:

http://moothra.prognet.com/perlysmil/

I would like to register the namespace SYMM::Smil for this module.  SYMM is
the Symmetric Multimedia working group within the W3C and it seemed like the
appropriate place to put an object library for a multimedia language.  When
the SYMM group finalizes new versions of SMIL they can all fit within SYMM.
Scalable vector graphics are also under development by the same group and
would fit here.  I have also stubbed out some modules for RealNetworks
datatypes, such as RealText and RealPix, and they would fit under SYMM as
well.

Currently the index generator is ignoring my namespace, or so I assume,
since I haven't seen my module listed within CPAN.  I uploaded to PAUSE
several weeks ago.  If anyone has any idea why, and/or what I should do to
fix this, please advise.

Thank you,
Chris
