     why:

    An interface to the SecPay SOAP API for processing online, credit
    card transactions, that performs a degree of pre-validation and
    simplifies the various different combination of card validation
    options into different methods (rather than the parameter based
    switching of the API).

    Module currently uses SOAP::Lite and XML::Simple and masks the need
    for any understanding of SOAP or XML from the user.

    Also, a whole variety of, largely WWW/CGI, tools built up in our
    company code-base over the last ten years, subject to both company
    approval for release to CPAN (essentially assured other than for a
    few core modules) and the approval of the withering gaze of
    comp.lang.perl.modules!
