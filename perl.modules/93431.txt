Hi Trey,

> I=E2=80=99d like to patch the HTML::WikiConverter module.  David =
Iberri the author is no longer involved.  I reached him via email (see =
below) he asked me to request the CPAN/PAUSE folks (you hopefully) to =
assign me permissions to help maintain the HTML::WikiConverter set of =
modules please.

Can you be explicit about which distributions you want to adopt please?

David has the HTML-WikiCoverter distribution on CPAN, but also has 13 =
HTML-WikiConverter-* distributions:

	https://metacpan.org/author/DIBERRI =
<https://metacpan.org/author/DIBERRI>

You said that you want to patch HTML::WikiConverter, which is in =
HTML-WikiCoverter, but then you also said you want to help maintain "the =
HTML::WikiConverter set of modules=E2=80=9D, which is why I=E2=80=99m =
asking for clarification: I want to be sure on what you=E2=80=99re =
asking to maintain, and what David thought he was granting :-)

David, having read your email it sounds like you=E2=80=99d be happy for =
me to transfer ownership of the relevant modules to Trey, and not even =
retain co-maint yourself, is that right?

Thanks,
Neil
