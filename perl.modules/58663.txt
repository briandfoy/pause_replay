IO::Socket::INET is now a core module, but IO::Socket::INET6 (note the "6") 
which was forked from it, is not. The changes I've made to the core ::INET6 
code are not relevant to I-S-INET. Perhaps p5p would be interested in 
back-ported changes to the test, but this is another issue altogether.

original message and this one (but not on yours from some reason).
