Yes, everything is an API, but in a sense, everything is a library as =20=

well, depending on how you define that term. :-)

I was proposing a name ending with API to follow the Win32 / Win23API =20=

scheme, the same way many modules now follow the "name ending with X" =20=

scheme for "extension" modules. It's not meaningful, but it seems to =20
be the current convention.

There is (currently) no Lib:: module, while there are 78 =20
distributions with "API" in their name. And if you check, most =20
actually define low-level API to external things, for things ranging =20
from system stuff (Win32 stuff, GSSAPI, card terminal stuff) to =20
documents (PDF::API2), protocols (LDAP), and of course web sites =20
(EVDB, Flickr, Facebook, Google).

What I'm saying is just that there seems to be a pattern. Tim may or =20
may not want to follow it.
