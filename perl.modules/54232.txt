Gerry,

Given the stated purpose, and the implementation, of your 
DBD::mysql::informationschema module, it does not belong in the 
DBD::* namespace, which is reserved for modules that implement the 
DBI API against a particular DBMS.  Nor does it belong in DBI::*, 
which is also reserved.

So you should rename your module.

The smallest reasonable name delta would be to replace DBD with DBIx, 
so you get a name like DBIx::mysql::informationschema.

Other people may have further ideas.
