Subject: Module submission Rose::DBx::Object::Cached::CHI
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rose::DBx::Object::Cached::CHI
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Rose::DB::Object Cache using the CHI interfa
  userid:      KMCGRATH (Kevin Christopher McGrath)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Rose::DB::Object::Cached

  rationale:

    This is being placed under the Rose::DBx namespace as specified by
    the rules for extending Rose::DB. This module intends to extend the
    caching ability in Rose::DB::Object allowing objects to be cached by
    any driver that can be used with the CHI interface. This opens the
    possibility to cache objects across scripts or even servers by
    opening up methods of caching such as FastMmap and memcached.

  enteredby:   KMCGRATH (Kevin Christopher McGrath)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep 18 20:37:08 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Rose::DBx::Object::Cached::
::CHI             bdpOp Rose::DB::Object Cache using the CHI interfa KMCGRATH
