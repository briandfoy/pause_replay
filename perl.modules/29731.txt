Hi,

I was building a couple of modules I was thinking of uploading.  I have a
questions about their names.

Finance::Ameritrade

Seems reasonable enough, going by the other "Finance" modules.  It's a
simple module for logging in, getting some quotes, checking transactions...
against an Ameritrade account.

The other I'm unsure of.  InteractiveBrokers is another online
stock/commodity/currency broker.  But instead of communicating with a web
site, they distribute a little Java app, called TWS (Traders Work Station),
that one can talk to via a socket.   I was thinking of 2 different names:

Finance::InteractiveBrokers::TWS
or
InteractiveBrokers::TWS

I'm not sure which is preferable?

I'm not subscribed to modules@perl.org, so please include me in the reply

Thanks
Jay
