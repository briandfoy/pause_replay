So does this mean I don't need to fix anything? Will only.pm get through
the system as is?

I got the following text from PAUSE, but wasn't sure what it meant.

    The following report has been written by the PAUSE namespace indexer.
    Please contact modules@perl.org if there are any open questions.
      Id: mldistwatch 188 2003-02-18 20:41:32Z k

                CPAN ID: INGY
      Distribution file: I/IN/INGY/only-0.10.tar.gz
        Number of files: 27  
             *.pm files: 10
      Timestamp of file: Tue Feb 18 08:41:32 2003 UTC
       Time of this run: Tue Feb 18 20:45:01 2003 UTC

    The following packages have been found in the distro:

    CPAN::MakeMaker
        version: undef
        in file: only-0.10/CPAN/MakeMaker.pm
         status: Not indexed because CPAN-MakeMaker-0.10/MakeMaker.pm in
                 I/IN/INGY/CPAN-MakeMaker-0.10.tar.gz has a higher version
                 number (0.10)

    only
        version: 0.10
        in file: only-0.10/only.pm
         status: indexed

    __END__

I see the number '188' in there, so I assume its all good.

Thanks.

Cheers, Brian
