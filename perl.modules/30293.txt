Dear modules admin,

I must have had done something wrong when uploading
modules, so now I have problems accessing them.

A general search on CPAN returns 2 modules, which is Ok:
  http://search.cpan.org/~priluskyj/

I expected for Bio-Maxd to be listed in http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Miscellaneous
and for Bundle-DataMint to be listed in http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Bundles
but they are not.

The Edit Module Metadata on PAUSE thinks I have none:
"Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to PRILUSKYJ"

Can you please fix this?

Also, I requested a new namespace for a collaboration project related to
the CCP4 group. I would really like to have things right from the very
beginning. Can you figure out what I did wrong before?

Thanks in advance,
Jaim
