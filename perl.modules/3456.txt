Yes, you are.  You are arguing that your names should get to remain.  You
have a position and you offer reasoning and evidence to support it.  That
is an argument.

If that is how you prefer to see it, then yes.  Though I don't see it as
being a price to pay.  I see it as action to take, but the action is not
negative or punitive in any way that I can tell.

It has actually been discussed before you came along, I believe, but that's
neither here nor there.  The fact remains that there was a preexisting
distribution called HTML-Tree.  Whether or not there is a module named
HTML::Tree in there, a distribution named HTML_Tree is confusing and should
not be placed on the CPAN.  That you would contest this is, to me, odd,
since your arguments against changing the name centered around the
confusion it would cause, but the existing name is de facto confusing.

People who have been doing this for a long time.

There is no "the right" solution.  There are plenty of "right" solutions,
including the one I gave in my last message.

If Sean does not agree, then that is his business.  Since his was there
first, it is incumbent on you to deal with that by changing the name of
yours, in my opinion.
