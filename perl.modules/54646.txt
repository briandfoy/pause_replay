The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Personality::Type::MBTI
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
  userid:      NFERRAZ (Nelson Ferraz)

  rationale:

    The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality test
    designed to assist a person in identifying some significant personal
    preferences.

    The Indicator is frequently used in the areas of pedagogy, group
    dynamics, employee training, leadership training, marriage
    counseling, and personal development.

    The types the MBTI sorts for, known as dichotomies, are
    extraversion / introversion, sensing / intuition, thinking / feeling
    and judging / perceiving. Each of the sixteen types is referred to
    by a four-letter abbreviation, such as ESTJ or INFP, indicating that
    type's preference in each dichotomy.

    The MBTI includes 93 forced-choice questions, which means there are
    only two options. Participants may skip questions if they feel they
    are unable to choose. Using psychometric techniques, such as item
    response theory, the MBTI will then be scored and will attempt to
    identify which dichotomy the participant prefers. After taking the
    MBTI, participants are given a readout of their score, which will
    include a bar graph and number of how many points they received on a
    certain scale.

    This module calculates the MBTI scores on each scale and,
    eventually, will provide integration with other personality type
    theories (e.g. Keirsey, Big5).

    Therefore we can expect modules like this:

    Personality::Type::Big5 Personality::Type::Keirsey
    Personality::Type::MBTI

  enteredby:   NFERRAZ (Nelson Ferraz)
  enteredon:   Wed May 30 16:05:18 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Personality::Type::
::MBTI            adpOp Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)           NFERRAZ
