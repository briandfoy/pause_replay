     why:

    A module, tentatively titled DBIx::Connector, that allows DBI
    connection information to be stored in private or shared
    configuration files. This makes it easy to write CGI or commandline
    scripts that connect to a database with the appropriate permissions,
    without having to request this information from the user or hardcode
    the information into scripts or modules. Since it resides in
    separate text files, the login information is protected by OS-level
    permissions, and is easily managed by users themselves, with the
    assistance of some included scripts. It also has several additional
    benefits, which I would be happy to expand on, if you like.
