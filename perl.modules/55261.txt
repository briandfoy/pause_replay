The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Incunabulum
  DSLIP:       adphn
  description: MVC framework, but not tied to the Web.
  userid:      APEIRON (Christopher Nehren)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    #incunabulum on irc.freenode.net ,
    http://coitusmentis.info/projects/incunabulum/ (Trac)

  similar:
    Catalyst, Maypole, etc. -- though they're all *Web*-oriented, and
    Incunabulum is emphatically not.

  rationale:

    Yet another MVC framework? Doesn't the CPAN already have enough of
    these? Well, yes, in fact. CPAN does have enough Web-based,
    Web-oriented, Web-centric MVC frameworks. You are absolutely right,
    and this is what Incunabulum addresses.

    "Wait, what?"

    Incunabulum isn't a Web-based MVC framework. Instead, it's a
    general-purpose MVC workflow. What this means is that instead of
    having a hard dependency on some sort of Web software, Incunabulum
    works independently of any Web software you may or may not have
    installed. In turn, this frees you to use Incunabulum to publish via
    any medium you want, so long as you can write (or find) the software
    required to make the system do what you want.

    As an example of this, Incunabulum can be used as a mailing list
    manager. Set up to receive emails directed to a certain place at a
    certain domain (the controller), parsed for control messages or
    otherwise decided as intended for the list (the model), and then
    sent out to the subscribed users (the view). The majority of the
    hard code (at the lowest level, anyway) -- the email retrieving and
    sending code -- is available in modules. All you have to do is tell
    Incunabulum that 'subscribe' means subscribe, and so forth.

    Of course, that's all well and good on its own. But the really fun
    stuff, the magic, happens when you start to combine more than one
    class of part of the infrastructure -- e.g. two Models, or two
    Controllers. This allows for neat things like a Jabber bot that
    sends a message to interested parties on your corporate intranet
    when a document on your Intranet Web server has been updated.
    Another cool use would be desktop publishing: presenting a fully
    typical graphical interface and transforming the input into
    something like PDF or perhaps an XML-based equivalent.

    In a very real way, Incunabulum applies the Perl philosophy to the
    MVC workflow. Have fun, and don't forget to share the magic.

    Why should this be in the module list? So people see it. Why do
    they want to see it? Because it offers MVC in a way that I haven't
    been able to find on CPAN.

    The name is something I found via researching somewhat extensively
    on the Web when the project started a few years ago. I feel that the
    rootlevel namespace is necessary partly as a way for users to
    quickly identify the project: once enough support has been
    established for it, it's going to be very user-oriented software,
    and keeping things simple is a good thing if users are to be able to
    identify the software quickly and easily.

    Incunabulum is very, very plugin-centric: it has precisely zero
    functionality without plugins. This means that there's going to be a
    *lot* of modules in the Incunabulum namespace. In an effort to keep
    C<package> and C<use> lines at least a little shorter (as much as
    they can be with a name like Incunabulum), I request it be granted
    its own namespace.

    Another reason for the rootlevel, well, is that that seems to be
    the way things are going on the CPAN for this sort of software. It's
    not particularly the strongest argument, but it has the (admittedly
    weak) merit of precedence.

The resulting entry would be:
