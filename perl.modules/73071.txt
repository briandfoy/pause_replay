From: BottomsC@missouri.edu ("Bottoms, Christopher A")

Hello all. I've written a new module called DefinedOr that I'm thinking of =
uploading to CPAN. Specifically it provides a simple defined-or subroutine =
especially for those of us not "allowed" to use anything about Perl 5.8.x.

Below is the documentation. Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Christopher Bottoms (molecules)

SYNOPSIS
        use DefinedOr qw/ defined_or /;

        my $foo =3D defined_or( shift(), 1);=20
        my $bar =3D defined_or( $baz, defined_or( $boo, 1));

Description
    This is a simple implementation of defined/or (without the beautifully
    simple syntax) for those that are not using Perl 5.10 for some reason.

EXPORTED SUBROUTINES
    defined_or

    Yes, this is actually a subroutine, not pretty syntax like <c>//</c>.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS
    None have been reported as of the current release. Please report any=20
    bugs to bug-definedor@rt.cpan.org.

LIMITATIONS
    Use at your own risk.

    Christopher Bottoms, "<molecules at cpan.org>"

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to all those who developed the true defined-or for Perl 6 and=20
    Perl 5.10. This is a weak imitation.
