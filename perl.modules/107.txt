DESCRIPTION:  
  XML::Simple is a module which implements a trivial API for reading 
  and writing XML.  The original target application was to allow
  programmers to store configuration options for their scripts in XML 
  files rather than having to make up a file format and implement a
  parser for it.  The module also has more general application and has
  proven ideal for people wanting to 'get their feet wet' with XML
  and Perl.  More details at: http://www.web.co.nz/~grantm/cpan/
  
  XML::Simple is 'Pure Perl' but requires XML::Parser (it can also
  make use of Storable).

  the name took place on Perl-XML mailing list and private email.
