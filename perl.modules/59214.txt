The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Booklist
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: CLI application for managing reading lists
  userid:      GENEHACK (John SJ Anderson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    svn+ssh://genehack.net/var/lib/svn/booklist,
    http://trac.genehack.net/booklist

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module supports an App::Cmd-based CLI application called
    'booklist'. It looks like the current best practice is for stuff
    like this to go into App::$APPNAME, so that's where I've put it...

  enteredby:   GENEHACK (John SJ Anderson)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 27 02:35:16 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Booklist        bdpOp CLI application for managing reading lists   GENEHACK
