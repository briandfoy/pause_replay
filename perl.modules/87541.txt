Subject: Transferring *.tgz from PAUSE to MetaCPAN and search.cpan.org

Hi

I don't know how uploads to PAUSE get to MetaCPAN and search.cpan.org, 
but just now the mechanism is leaving a correct file on MetaCPAN and a 
corrupt file on search.cpan.org.

I can confirm the d/l from MetaCPAN matches what I uploaded to PAUSE.

However a similar but differently sized file on search.cpan.org can't be 
ungzipped.

See Tree-DAG_Node-1.18.tgz for an example.

Any ideas?
