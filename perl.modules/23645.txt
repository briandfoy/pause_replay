I've got a script and some supporting classes for converting POD-enabled
Perl into fake C++ that doxygen (an open-source documentation producer) can
handle.  I currently have the classes named doxy::???.  I don't see a
top-level Doc:: (or similar) namespace.  Is doxy:: unique enough?  Is there
a better place to put this stuff?

The classes don't do much without the calling script (doxyfilt.pl).  There
are apparently separate mechanisms for scripts and modules.  Any hints on
packaging a combination of both?

I'm chewing though the online PAUSE doc.  I'm still looking for the page
that tells me what I have to do to package this stuff up for submission.

Here's hoping that creating a PAUSE account put me on the modules@perl.org
mailing list...
