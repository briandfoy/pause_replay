Hi Module guys (long time, no speak),

I've been recently contacted to update my CPAN authorship. My
details are
Author Jack Shirazi
Email jack@JavaPerformanceTuning.com

More to the point, I'm no longer particularly active in Perl
and can't provide support for any of my old modules. I don't
know if you can indicate that anywhere. Finally,
Devel::DumpStack doesn't seem to be cpan installable.
Specifically, someone using cygwin tried to install it
and got problems. Again I don't know if you have a place for
indicating problems with packages.

I'd also like to congratulate you guys on the excellent work
you've done in maintaining and extending the CPAN Perl resources.
Well done.
