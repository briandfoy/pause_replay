Hello

First of all: Thanx for your excellent effort on all this. But:

Where do I find information about, how to make the core module distribution.
It seems to be a rule, that the module is contained in a gzip. And it seems
to be standard, that installation involves execution of the commands

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
(see http://18.85.40.23/INSTALL.html).
But what are the rules to make the new module following this installation
procedure? Is there some Perl-build-in technology helping on this? I would
like you to be very specific about this. Have I missed something? Or aren't
there any rules at all?
I would also like some explanation about how all this is related to using /
writing external code (C, etc.) with Perl modules and distributions.
If all this is proberly dealt with on CPAN (I haven't found anything) - why
don't you give an explicit link to it?
Best regards
