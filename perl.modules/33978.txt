Hello,

I previously had a conversation with the author of CGI::Imagemap and he
agreed to let me update the module, though I have since lost all documentation
of this and he never actually added me as a maintainer for the project?
Would this be possible?

I've had an updated version (cleaner and backwards compatabile*) ready for
some time, it's available at: ftp://pthbb.org/pub/pm/CGI-Imagemap/2.00.tgz

* except for the removal of one method, which if push came to shove could
  be added back, though it is redundant.
