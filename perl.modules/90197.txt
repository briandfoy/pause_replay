Hiho,

While searching for a fitting namespace for some idea, i felt over the
blocking distribution "Meta" which covers a huge amount of Namespaces
and is technical an abandon project (2002 last release, still defined
pre-alpha in README). I already talked with the author via email and
he approves that it can be deleted and the namespace be freed (he is
CC and will approve on this email again). Directly I want to suggest
to "reserve" the namespace "Meta" towards STEVAN, I already talked
with him and he will put it into good use.

Thanks in advance to all involved parties ;).

Bye!
