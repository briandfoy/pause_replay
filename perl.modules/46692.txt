The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::PDF
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Generates PDF reports in pure perl
  userid:      JMOOSMANN (James Moosmann)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    PDF::API2

  rationale:

    This module generates PDF's using perl only. I chose the Win32::PDF
    namespace because I developed it on a Win32 box and only have
    resources to work on that environment. Also, the PDF namespace is in
    disarray. There is no active maintainer of the PDF root namespace
    and attempts over the last 4 months to reach the author have been
    unsuccessful. I wish CPAN would remove inactive authors from
    maintenance if they have not updated their modules for several
    years. The PDF specification has changed significantly and the root
    module is broken and isn't used by anyone. PDF::API2 provide all of
    the functionality and more than the silly PDF module does. My module
    is different than API2 and has a simpler syntax and different
    feature set. My PDF module was also designed with a single purpose
    of generating business reports and has support for html-like tables,
    graphs( which are created using PDF drawing operators instead of a
    graphics program so that the resolution is device dependant),
    embedded fonts ( as well as support for all of the core fonts ) and
    unicode ( which was a lot of fun figuring out. ) This is a
    significant piece of work. I would prefer a Reports::PDF namespace
    if the root Reports were available, or perhaps MoosePdf.

The resulting entry would be:
