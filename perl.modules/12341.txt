Yes, any religious conviction to a particular naming scheme will
come unstuck at some point.

Using a phase name for the 2nd-level name would be quite reasonable
where the entire function of the module is *very* closely tied to the
action of just that one phase.

There's naturally a danger that once that convention is established
then some modules will use a phase name for their 2nd-level name
even though they don't fuly meet the critera described above
(or maybe they did at version 1.x but don't at version 2.x).

That's life. CPAN is littered with modules that could have been
given better names with hindsight and so too, I'd guess, is Apache::*.

Whatever set of conventions you can come up with they'll always be
imperfect and imperfectly applied - but having them is still better
than not.

Tim.
