The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Librarian
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Manage SQL in template files
  userid:      JMAY (Jason W. May)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailing lists (dbi and other)

  similar:
    Class::Phrasebook::SQL Ima::DBI SQL::Catalog DBIx::SearchProfiles

  rationale:

    This module is intended to provide an additional tool to support
    proper separation of concerns. While there are several excellent
    modules assisting in separate of UI (esp. HTML) from application
    code, there is a similar challenge for SQL queries. This domain is
    under-served on CPAN.

    The implementation provided by DBIx::Librarian is sufficiently
    different from other related modules (in particular, SQL::Catalog)
    that this module is not rehashing previously-explored territory.
    Future opportunities exist for combining functions of several of the
    related modules into a more comprehensive whole.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Librarian       adpOp Manage SQL in template files                 JMAY
