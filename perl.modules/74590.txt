Hi Colin,

sorry for the delay. We're all pretty busy :(

I haven't checked out the module, but in general terms:

Applications (as in things you would run as opposed to things you would 
load and use()) usually go in App::.

The Vim:: top level namespace sounds like a sane choice.

Your original choice is acceptable as a sort of branding as well.

The order above would reflect my preference, but it might well be that 
brian or other admins have a different preference, so in the end, it's 
up to you. None of your ideas was terrible.

Best regards,
Steffen
