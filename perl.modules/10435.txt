Moin,

I Cc:ed modules@perl.org, they are the "ones" ;) to decide this, if the
authors are not responding.

Although I wouldn't count on beeing lucky, since I am trying to
"patch/takeover/maintain" Math::Fraction for almost two years. The authors
address is dead, and multiply requests/efforts all resulting in "lets wait
a few months mores" ;)

The best bet is that the authors respond and let you do something.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to register a co-author via CPAN, like
someone who can release new versions, while the original author is still in
effect.

Hope that helps,

Tels
