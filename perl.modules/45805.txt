In IRC today SBURKE and I broke out our rather large CPAN The Gathering 
decks to compare them.

Turns out I've filed bugs against File::HomeDir I really need fixed, 
that he doesn't time to fix. And he's filed bugs against 
Data::JavaScript::Anon he really needs fixed, that I don't have time to fix.

So we've done an amicable trade :)

ADAMK is now the owner of File::HomeDir.
SBURKE is now the owner of Data::JavaScript::Anon.

I've already modernised File::HomeDir quite a bit, and released.

Anyone with dependencies on File::HomeDir should note there may be 
changes on Win32 as we move to using the ACTUAL home dir instead of the 
desktop as the home()
