Hi Neil,

very good, sorry this hasn't been fixed yet. First day back at work,
dealing with the email backlog. I'll try to get to this soon as I can.

Cheers,

Rutger

You have ownership of the =E2=80=9Cbeagle=E2=80=9D namespace, as a result o=

The best solution would be for you to rename the =E2=80=9Cbeagle=E2=80=9D m=
