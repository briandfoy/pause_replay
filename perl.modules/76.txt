Sincerest apologies, you are not the first person to be annoyed,
basically I am on the same boat.

To make a long story shorter, let me put it thusly: there has been
work in the entire mechanism of PAUSE and the module list and when
this work has come to an end, we will be having a daily or weekly
module list. A few more details at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules

Hey, 4 months isn't eternity, I'd love to be of service 24/7 hours for
CPAN, but life sometimes doesn't let you.
