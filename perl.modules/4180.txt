You wrote to me personally less than an hour ago and I
told you I went to deja.com and searched for "file 
upload" in the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup to find
1,000 messages about this subject. Apparently you spent
about 3 seconds at deja.com, because you wrote back to
me that you searched deja.com for "perl" and found 
nothing.

For the benefit of others on this mailing list, this
fellow with "21 years programming experience" is not
looking for information how to upload a file -- When I
pointed him to documentation for the CGI module and
the part about uploading a file, he complained:

  "as for the cgi.pm file, it is not a 'whole'
   example, but like many solutions, bits and pieces 
   you have to assemble, test, hope you get everything 
   right, whereas many languages/guides have a module 
   that says 'here's the code to do this job, 
   cut/paste it in' and away you go."

God forbid, a programmer who has to assemble and test
a program!

Then, after all the help I gave him, he wrote back to
me and told me that his Web site is losing money 
because he can't upload pictures to it.

I just love wasting my time...
