Hello,

A while back there was a thread on this list about the naming of a
module that makes it easy to create an API.

The original name I used was 'Module::API' - but this was, I now
realise, a very poor choice. Please could you comment on the follwing
potential names:

Background: The module provides a way to create an API. You subclass
it ( I think that is the correct jargon) and then write plugins that
handle the actual processing that is needed for each API call you
create. Having done this you can then call these plugins either
locally or over the network (both blocking and non blocking using a
select queue). The code deals with pretty much everything other than
writing the plugins and provides a nice clean abstracted interface, if
I do say so myself.

The main drive of the module is to create an API that can be accessed
over a network. Hence I think that the 'Net::' namespace is probably
most appropriate. 'IPC::' was suggested but that (to me at least)
implies between processes on the same machine, which is not what my
module does.

I've also tried quite hard to make the module simple to use, and would
like that in the name somewhere. These are my suggestions, in order of
preference:

Net::API::Framework
Net::API::Skeleton
Net::SimpleAPI
Net::API::Simple
Net::API

I appreciate that the terms 'API' and 'Framework' are extreemly broad
and can mean pretty much anything. However I am haing trouble thinking
of something a bit narrower that is not restrictive.

Your views on this much appreciated.

Cheers,
  Edmund.

PS the original code can be viewed at
http://search.cpan.org/~evdb/Module-API-0.01/ if you want to see more.
There is a new version to release but I want to get the name right
first.
