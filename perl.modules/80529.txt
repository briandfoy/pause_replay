Yeah. Between memcached itself, MogileFS, and work I have a hard time
keeping up with C::M. It's been a lot of hard work keeping those other
queues down, and we've been just recently catching up with Perlbal.

Hachi's been expressing interest in doing the work for C::M, and I think
we'll have some time next week to sit down and kick the bug queue.

Further interested co-maints may be nice, if you know of any who aren't
overloaded?

Thanks,
-Dormando
