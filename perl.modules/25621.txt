The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Meta
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Class automation, introspection, validation
  userid:      DWHEELER (David Wheeler)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    bricolage-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Class::Accessor, Params::Validate, Class::Tangram, Class::Contract

  rationale:

    Class::Meta provides an interface for automating the creation of
    Perl classes with attribute data type validation. It differs from
    other such modules in that it includes an introspection API that can
    be used as a unified interface for all Class::Meta-generated
    classes. In this sense, it is an implementation of the "Facade"
    design pattern.

    I chose the name space because it's a succinct description of the
    module and what it does. Not only does it provide an interface for
    generating constructors and attribute accessors, like other modules
    in the Class:: namespace, it also provides metadata about the
    classes it generates. This metadata is available via the
    introspection API, in which objects describe the classes, their
    constructors, attributes, and methods.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
