I requested my pause account be reset a bit ago, as my email address has 
  changed, but never heard back.

I'm not generally opposed to co-maintaining the module, but I would like 
to know your intentions with it and see your code first. In particular 
any replacement code should be able to pass modern tests, install 
cleanly on a variety of modern systems, and be documented such that 
anyone with a reasonable amount of 'domain knowledge' would be able to 
follow the logic without much effort.
