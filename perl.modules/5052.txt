Johan-

Thanks for the note. Here's the DSLI entry for it:

Name         DSLI  Description                                 
------------ ----  --------------------------------------------
Unix::Login  bdph  Customizable Unix login prompt and validation


In addition, a while back I sent in a couple more DSLI's for other
modules, but never heard back. I have a feeling they might have gotten
lost in the noise. These are uploaded already. I'm interested in getting
them listed, assuming you think they're modlist-worthy:

Name             DSLI  Description                           
------------     ----  --------------------------------------------
Class::Handler   bdpO  Make Apache-like pseudoclass event handlers
Text::Header     bdpf  Content-independent RFC 822 header functions
HTML::ActiveLink bdpO  Dynamically activate HTML links based on URL


The first one is the most interesting. The second one is a simple
interface to RFC 822 which is content-independent (I had asked if
Text:: was most appropriate, but got no replies). The last one is
useful in creating dynamic content without having to use a full
HTML authoring module. It will alter links in a document based on
the URL it was requested via.

In any case, thanks again for the reply. Let me know what you think of
these.

Cheers,
Nate
