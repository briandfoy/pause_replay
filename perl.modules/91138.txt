The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Run3::Shell
  DSLIP:       Rdpha
  description: easy execution of system commands
  userid:      HAUKEX (Hauke D)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    https://github.com/haukex/IPC-Run3-Shell

  similar:
    Shell IPC::Run3 IPC::Run

  rationale:

    (from the POD) This module's goal is to provide a relatively
    transparent interface to system commands from regular-looking Perl
    functions. It is inspired by and is similar to the module Shell, but
    with several important differences and added features: - functions
    are only exported at the request of the user (no autoloading in the
    user's namespace) - system commands and their arguments are never
    sent through the shell (so you don't have to worry about escaping
    shell metacharacters) - failures of the system commands are
    (optional) warnings, which can be made fatal (in the spirit of
    autodie or bash's set -e) - advanced capturing of STDIN, STDOUT and
    STDERR

    (other notes) I'm aware there are quite a few modules out there to
    execute system commands, my last count was 19 other such modules
    with various features, levels of support and interfaces. However, as
    far as I could tell, none of them offers a "Shell"-like API, which I
    really like. I also like IPC::Run3 very much because it is simple,
    yet it supports capturing STDERR, avoiding the shell, and it works
    on all tested OSes. Hence, this module was born.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::Run3::
::Shell           Rdpha easy execution of system commands            HAUKEX
