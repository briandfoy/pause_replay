The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       No::OCRData
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Operate on OCRed data from Norwegian banks
  userid:      KJETILK (Kjetil Kjernsmo)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It will be useful only to Norwegians, as it is a specialized
    application to parse very specific files. It certainly belongs in
    the No::-hierarchy (established by Gisle Aas). I could have nested
    it more (I thought about No::Finans::BBS::OCRData), but the
    guidelines said that one level was best, I left it at that... :-) It
    doesn't really have much to do with Optical Character Recognition,
    but the misnomer is not mine, it is what it is called by those who
    issue these files, so that is what people would be looking for if
    they look for something to parse these files.

The resulting entry would be:

No::
