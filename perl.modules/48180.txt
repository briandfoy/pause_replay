The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Parser
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Collection of parsers for testsuits
  userid:      BRYCE (Bryce Harrington)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/crucible-devel

  similar:

  rationale:

    It seems that every testsuite has its own unique log output format,
    yet they usually return the same type of information - PASS/FAIL on
    various testcases.

    This is a particular issue when considering tests beyond just Perl
    tests. Kernel tests like LTP have unique output formats. Apache
    tests have yet another. GUI testsuites report in a still different
    way.

    Test::Parser provides a common interface format for writing parsers
    for each of these formats. This enables a tester to extract
    PASS/FAIL data from a range of testsuites and operate on them in a
    consistent way, to generate reports, insert into databases, and so
    forth.

The resulting entry would be:
