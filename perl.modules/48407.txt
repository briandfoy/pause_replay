Subject: How to upload new module that fixes a  bug if author is unresponsive?

Howdy all,

I have found a bug, reported it, and even packaged up the module in a  
new version with the fix so that all the author needs to do is upload  
it via pause:

  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18792

It appears he's unresponsive, is there a way to get the one I put  
there (0.93) to replace the buggy one (0.92)?

Its pretty important to a project that has wide use of it across the  
globe.

Thanks
