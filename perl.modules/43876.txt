The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Debug
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: Implement multiple level of debug messages
  userid:      ERWAN (Erwan Lemonnier)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::Dispatch, Log::Log4perl

  rationale:

    Most logging modules follow the standard syslog hierarchy of
    message types: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG, etc. This is the case in
    for example Log::Log4perl.

    But what a developer often needs in larger projects is a special
    logging function only for debug messages, that accept more than one
    level of debug verbosity, and that can be triggered from a
    configuration file in a fashion similar to Log4perl. There are no
    such modules on CPAN, as far as I could see.

    Hence the creation of Log::Debug.

    Synopsis:

    hack.pl: use Log::Debug;

    sub hack { debug(2,"printing naph"); print "not another perl
    hacker.\n"; }

    debug(1,"starting code"); hack();

    When running ./hack.pl with a debug verbosity of 0, you'll get no
    debug message. > ./hack.pl not another perl hacker.

    When running ./hack.pl with a debug verbosity of 1, you'll get: >
    ./hack.pl # [main::main() l.10] [DEBUG 1]: starting code not another
    perl hacker.

    When running ./hack.pl with a debug verbosity of 2 or more, you'll
    get: > ./hack.pl # [main::main() l.10] [DEBUG 1]: starting code #
    [main::hack() l.6] [DEBUG 2]: printing naph not another perl hacker.

    That's the basic idea.

    Add to that the possibility of defining debug verbosity systemwide,
    or per file, per module or function, via a configuration file. Then
    add Log::Dispatch to handle the destination and formatting of debug
    messages. What you'll get is something pretty powerfull :)

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
