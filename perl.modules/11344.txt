Subject: Module submission X500::DN

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       X500::DN
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: handle X.500 Distinguished Names
  userid:      RJOOP (Robert Joop)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.moderated (2002-02-06 till --21),
    comp.lang.perl.modules (now)

  similar:
    X500::DN::Parser

  rationale:

    unlike the X500::DN::Parser module which allows for a quite limited
    syntax and is of use only when the DN structure is known beforehand,
    my module parses arbitrary RFC2253 formatted DNs (and is mostly
    RFC1779 compatible (the RFC2253 predecessor)).

    it allows access to the parsed DN/RDN structure. one can construct
    DNs from RDN lists. one can format (R)DNs according to RFC2253
    syntax. it parses and formats DNs according to openssl syntax.

    first discussed in c.l.p.moderated,
    http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&threadm=a4ba45%24li8%241%40rainbow.internal&rnum=2&prev=/groups%3Fq%3Dcomp.lang.perl.moderated%2BX500%26hl%3Den%26selm%3Da4ba45%2524li8%25241%2540rainbow.internal%26rnum%3D2

    the module is being used by OpenCA.

    you can add a line RFC2253 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (v3): UTF-8 String Representation of Distinguished Names X500::DN to
    http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#ID4.1_IETF-Inte

    X500::DN::Parser is in chapter 7, but perhaps it belongs into
    chapter 6, too? while X.500 is the directory standard and a
    directory is a database, X.500 DNs are used in X.509 certificates
    which don't necessarily have anything to do with databases.

  enteredby:   RJOOP (Robert Joop)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 22 16:25:35 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

X500::
::DN              adpOp handle X.500 Distinguished Names             RJOOP
