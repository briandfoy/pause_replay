From a purely information organization standpoint, perhaps.

From a political standpoint, I don't think so.  Here's part of the
response from Joe Gurman, the solar physicist who's in charge of the VSO
project, when I asked him the difference between solar physics, and
astrophysics:

	     Astrophysics is almost entirely based on statistical
	arguments, given samples of a handful to thousands of objects of a
	given type; there's only one Sun. Given the detail with which we
	can observe the Sun, the kinds of physics which we can apply are
	often quite different from those used in astrophysics, even though
	there is a significant amount of overlap. (E.g. one can do
	one-dimensional radiative transfer in a one-dimensional, model
	stellar atmosphere and build a grid of such models for classifying
	thousands of stellar spectra; for the Sun, we need couple
	radiative transfer and magnetohydrodynamic calculations to
	describe the features observed in a small patch of the solar
	surface, and their evolution in time.) Indeed, the element of time
	is perhaps the most important difference: with the exception of
	novae and supernovae, observable changes with time are nearly
	absent from astrophysics, whereas they constitute the stock in
	trade of solar physics. A notable class of exceptions is that of
	observations of "solar-like" stars over time to see if they have
	solar-like activity cycles (some do, some don't).

	     Much more to the point, the vast majority of astrophysicists
	are uninterested in solar physics, though the reverse is rarely
	true.  Having any structure impose don us by either
	astrophysicists or IT experts ignorant of solar physics,
	therefore, is likely not to be conducive to building the
	structures that we need to do our jobs.

	     As examples of things that can be measured in solar physics
	but not in astrophysics, consider: full, vector magnetic fields as
	opposed to magnetic field strength; spatially resolved
	observations of surface and coronal features; local-are
	helioseismology vs. 1-D asteroseismology, AND the time evolution
	of all of the above.

[I had made the mistake of asking in relation to Astrophysics, but in
fact, it seems that Astro::* is for astronomy, which is even less
related to our project]

And I even tried showing him the 'Solar' related items that were already
filed under Astro::* :

	     The Astro examples you give have to do with observing
	parameters for observing something other than the Sun. By
	definition, we always point at the Sun.

[And he's right -- the point of the Venus transit wasn't so much for
observing the sun -- it blocked the view of the sun -- it was for
observing the atmosphere on Venus, which was now viewable because of the
backlighting from the sun]



All things considered, as VSO currently only tracks solar physics data,
and we don't have immediate plans to track solar chemistry data, it'd be
preferable to be classified as:

	Physics::Solar::VSO

Of course, that still wouldn't provide a suitable location for
modules that deal with solar event catalogs, solar chemistry data, and
other non-physics solar science and research.

The group I'm working with does have plans to write interfaces for solar
event catalogs, as it can make it easier search solar physics data, but
the catalogs themselves are not physics, as they're just observations, so
I would most likely request Solar::Catalog::* or something similar
sometime in the future.  (exact time range based on funding allocations
for the next fiscal year)
