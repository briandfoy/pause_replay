Subject: Module submission Net::Autoconfig

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Autoconfig
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Template based configuration of Cisco/HP Dev
  userid:      KEVIN (Kevin Ehlers)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Cisco::Conf Net::Telnet::Cisco

  rationale:

    Namespace: I chose Net::Autoconfig for the namespace because it is
    used to quickly perform automated maintenance 100+ network devices.

    Approach: It uses templates and separate device configuration
    files. You can say "configure these hostnames", and it will
    determine the device type and apply the correct configuration to
    that device. It will configure devices either one at a time, or all
    (up to a limit) at once. It can use SSH or Telnet or anything that
    Expect can use. It can configure devices connected to a console
    server (i.e. ones that have been taken out of the box and plugged
    into a console server. No network connection necessary).

    Differences between existing modules: Cisco::Conf uses tftp
    (insecure) to manage switches and routers. It is specific to Cisco
    devices. It will not configure any other vendors products.
    Net::Autoconfig is vendor agnostic, supports secure connections, and
    can configure devices that do not have an IP address (connected to a
    console server).

    Net::Telnet::Cisco uses telnet (insecure) to configure Cisco
    devices. This is vendor specific and is insecure. Net::Autoconfig
    can use secure connections and can configure different vendors
    products. It supports HP and Cisco at the moment, but it could be
    extended to support Extreme, Foundry, Juniper, etc.
