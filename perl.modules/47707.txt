Subject: Module submission Myco:::Core::Person
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, sommerb@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Myco:::Core::Person
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Person base class for myco applications
  userid:      SOMMERB (Ben Sommer)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://www.mycohq.com

  similar:
    Myco

  rationale:

    Myco::Core::Person is intended as an add-on to the myco framework,
    with only the most basic attributes you'd need or expect in a person
    object. It ISA Myco::Entity object class. Even though it probably
    would (and has been) used in most every application built with Myco
    - it needed to be separated from the core framework, which I've now
    done.

    FYI, I'm filing another application right after this one - pardon
    if I cut and paste my rationale :)

  enteredby:   SOMMERB (Ben Sommer)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar  5 20:31:41 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Myco:::Core::
::Person          RdpOp Person base class for myco applications      SOMMERB
