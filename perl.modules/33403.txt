     why:

    Generic code parsing and code-analysis modules and scripts,
    originally intended for a book which wont be published anyway it
    seems. More precisely: a bnf2re script which can validate input
    against a bnf grammar a generic source high-lighting module
    (highlights Perl, C/C++, Java,...), output is either XML or HTML and
    completely confuigurable I have a number of other scripts and
    modules as well, but I'll have to go through them in detail before I
    decide.

    And, of course, there's also a bunch of not quite finished programs
    which I hope to finish soon :-)
