We do not log the actual deletion which usually happens about 72 hours
later.

Then, on Sun Dec 17 07:41:40 2006 you scheduled these files for deletion:

$CPAN/authors/id/K/KB/KBAUCOM/Image-Embroidery-1.0.meta
$CPAN/authors/id/K/KB/KBAUCOM/Image-Embroidery-1.0.readme
$CPAN/authors/id/K/KB/KBAUCOM/Image-Embroidery-1.0.tar.gz
$CPAN/authors/id/K/KB/KBAUCOM/Term-Animation-2.1.1.meta
$CPAN/authors/id/K/KB/KBAUCOM/Term-Animation-2.1.1.readme
$CPAN/authors/id/K/KB/KBAUCOM/Term-Animation-2.1.1.tar.gz

In both cases mail about the visit was sent to you at some address
starting with the letters "sch".

Let me know if you need additional information.
