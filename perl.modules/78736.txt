Hi,

This is to let you know that I may be asking for co-main on =
Geo::Coder::HostIP in 3 weeks or so.
The module was written by S=E9an Cannon (DODGER), and last released in =
April 2007.

I've reported some bugs (in RT), and have mailed S=E9an saying that I've =
created fixes, and put them on github.
I offered to do a release if he doesn't currently have the time or =
interest.

I'll try and contact him a couple of times over the next 3 weeks, and =
also post to module-authors to see
if anyone is in contact with him.

Neil
