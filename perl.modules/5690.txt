The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::JComboBox
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: another combo box (similar to the java comp)
  userid:      RCS (Rob Seegel)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.tk

  similar:
    Tk::BrowseEntry Tk::Optionmenu Tk::ComboEntry

  rationale:

    This module is meant as one widget that offers most of the combined
    functionality of Tk::BrowseEntry, Tk::Optionmenu, and
    Tk::ComboEntry, offering Tk programmers another option that might be
    used in a wider variety of situations, using one interface.

    This widget shares the look and feel plus most of general behavior
    of the Java Swing component of the same name (from which the name is
    derived), though it falls a little short of what I'd consider a
    clone. Suffice to say, this module supports enough of the
    component's methods to be familiar and easy to use for someone
    familar with the component, but does not yet offer it's complete
    functionality, and it's likely that it never will.

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
