The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Static
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Create static variables, arrays and hashes
  userid:      TILLY (Ben Tilly)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=96832

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module implements what are widely known as static lexical
    variables - variables which are tightly scoped but which "remember"
    their old values when you re-enter the scope. I don't know of other
    modules that implement this, though people often get the same effect
    by using closures or else the infamous "my $foo if 0;" bug.

    Like other modules in the Tie::* hierarchy this uses tie for its
    operation. And while many names could be invented for what this
    module does, the word "static" is widely understood to mean the kind
    of variable that it implements, hence my suggestion of Tie::Static.

    I am also requesting that this be listed under "Development
    Support" or "Miscellaneous Modules" despite the fact that the Tie
    namespace is so far associated with "Data and Data Types" or "User
    Interfaces". This doesn't fit with those existing categories.

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::Static          bdprp Create static variables, arrays and hashes   TILLY
