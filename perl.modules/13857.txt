The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::MiniXML
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: pure perl API to create and parse XML
  userid:      PDEEGAN (Pat Deegan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    XML::DOM

  rationale:

    While developing a shipping rate API, we were in need of a light,
    simple and portable means of generating XML requests and parsing XML
    responses. I created MiniXML - a pure perl, object-oriented API that
    provides classes for XML documents, elements and nodes - to fill
    these requirements.

    It is a "stand-alone" module in that it does not require additional
    libraries or even a compiler to install and is, in my opinion,
    flexible and easy to use. A project site was created
    (http://minixml.psychogenic.com) where you can find detailed
    information on the interface. Developer response has so far been
    positive.

    I would appreciate any comments you might have concerning the
    module and it's interface.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
