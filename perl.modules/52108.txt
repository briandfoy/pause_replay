Fair point :-)  I actually prefer a three digit style (which I use in 
the form major.minor.bugfix)
and have used that style in other code for some years.  I only used the 
two digit style for
CPAN because that seemed to be the convention at the time I first 
uploaded.  I will change my version
to 1.01 and upload again.  It is not a problem for me, but I thought I 
should highlight the (minor) issue
to the maintainers of PAUSE.  Maybe the version numbering requirements 
of PAUSE could be documented
somewhere?    If they are already, my apologies.  I had a look through
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_04about
but could not find anything.

Regards
Kevin
