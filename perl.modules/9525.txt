Hans,=20

 Remember me? Quite a while ago, I said that I'd take over maintenance=20
chores on MListbox. Well, recently, I've released a package or two that =

fix most of the bugs that people were complaining about. The problem is =
-=20
folks don't see the new versions in the Tk Modules directory, because =
you=20
still own the Tk::MListbox namespace. This prevents any versions that I =

create from being widely seen unless someone goes directly to my CPAN=20
directory. So this means people will likely continue to download your
package=20
and then send you emails asking for fixes.=20

Can you send an email to modules@perl.org, requesting that ownership of =

the Tk::MListbox namespace be transferred from HJHELGE to RCS (Rob =
Seegel)?=20

Thanks very much and a Happy New Year to you!=20

Rob=20
