     why:

    Two immediate reasons, 1) I have been in contact with the author of
    Zoidberg about possibly stepping in as maintainer, and 2) I have
    some Physics simulation code that I would like to release. Also I
    have a module for PDL that does FITS image interpretation over a
    sequence of images that is getting to the point of a possible
    release as well.
