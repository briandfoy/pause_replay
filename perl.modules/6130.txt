The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::Inline::PERL
  DSLIP:       Rupfa
  description: Add the power of PERL programming to Perl.
  userid:      JMCNAMARA (John McNamara)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Acme::* Inline::Foo

  rationale:

    This is a light hearted module, hence Acme.

    It is a working example of how to create a language add-in for
    Inline.

    From the docs:

    DESCRIPTION Inline::PERL gives you the power of the PERL
    programming language from within your Perl programs. This gives you
    instant access to hundreds of pre-coded applications such as
    bulletin boards, hit counters and shopping carts.

    PERL is a programming language for writing CGI applica­ tions.
    It's main strength is that it doesn't have any unnecessary warnings
    or strictures. It is a direct descendent of Perl, a programming
    language which was used mainly by programmers. However, the original
    language required too much reading and thinking and so PERL was
    developed as a language which was more in tune with the requirements
    of the Internet age.

The resulting entry would be:

Acme::Inline::
