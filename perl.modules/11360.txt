This is the consequence of what I did yesterday on the PAUSE, as I
posted in my message <m3znzvj31b.fsf@anima.de>:

    I have manually corrected the database, so that Ron's entry will
    change from

    X500::
    ::DN               MdpO? X500 Distinguished Name parser               RSAVAGE

    to

    X500::DN::
    ::Parser           MdpO? X500 Distinguished Name parser               RSAVAGE

I have now told the PAUSE indexer to re-index Ron's file and then we
will (hopefully) see Ron's module again.

Agree. And that's why I already have altered the database to that effect.
