The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::Meta::Plugin
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Implementation of modular classless objects
  userid:      NUFFIN (יובל קוג'מן)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/frytunes

  similar:
    Class::Classless, Class::Object

  rationale:

    Class::Classless, Class::Object provide a mechanism to edit one
    method at a time. It's oriented towards one heap of methods. I
    wanted something that is made of parts. Somewhat like many classes,
    with inheritance and so forth, within an object.

    I'm going to use this to develop a large application which needs
    modulability (drop in replacements, easy runtime modification,
    multiplicity of these so called plugins) which Class::Classless et
    al cannot and don't aim to offer.

    The stupid name: I don't think this qualifies as a class
    implementation, because it has a real, extensible, and integral
    class. The class simply makes up with the plugins. Hence it was not
    Class::Meta::Plugin.

The resulting entry would be:

Object::Meta::
