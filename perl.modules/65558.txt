Hi

I've recently been working with GnuPG (
http://search.cpan.org/~frajulac/GnuPG-0.09/GnuPG.pm ) and found a few
bugs. I also found that Debian maintainers appear to have patched the
bugs in their distribution. I tried to contact the owner at
frajulac@contre.com but got a bounce back - unknown mailbox. I'm
guessing based on that and the lack of activity on all of his
distributions on CPAN that he's out of the loop these days.

I'd like to apply changes to the package as per the Debian
distribution to the CPAN version. Would it be possible for me to take
over that module?

Thanks!
