     why:

    I'm going to mantain the WWW-SMS package started by Giulio Motta
    (http://search.cpan.org/author/GIULIENK/WWW-SMS-0.08/lib/WWW/SMS.pm).

    Furthermore I'm working on some Perl code which sooner or later
    will be ready to be uploaded, I also mantain some Perl projects at
    SourceForge, eg: eimSMS & MP3Roaster.

    As I can see the ID can only be as minimum 4 chars long, my
    prefered ID which I use on all of my projects is 'eim', could I
    request such ID anyway, maybe some CPAN admin can set it up for me,
    would be really nice. Thank you.
