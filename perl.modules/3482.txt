Hi--

[ This is a repost from a little more than a week ago. I'm not impatient,
nor do I think anyone's purposely forgotten about me; merely that my
message may have been overlooked? Anyway. :) ]

I've got a module that I called Config::FreeForm, which probably isn't the
best name. The idea behind it is that many configuration modules I've seen
want to enforce a structure to your config data. That didn't work for me--I
had an idea of the structure I wanted my data to take, based on a data
structure in which I was holding it, and I wanted my data to always look
*like that*.

Which is simply a matter of Data::Dumper and do, and in fact that's what
this module uses--it wraps around those, but it also manages your (multiple)
configuration files and--since the configuration is held in memory--can be
set up to automatically reload the configuration files from disk, when
they're changed. The rationale behind this is this was written for use in a
mod_perl environment, where the children needed their configuration
variables to stay in sync.

So I'd like to get this module up on CPAN and in the module list, though I'm
definitely taking suggestions for better names. :)

Here's the description, etc.:

NAME
    Config::FreeForm - Provide in-memory configuration data

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::FreeForm %options;

DESCRIPTION
    Config::FreeForm provides in-memory configuration data in a
    free-form manner. Many existing configuration modules attempt to
    provide some structure to your configuration data; in doing so,
    they force you to use their own configuration paradigm
    (association of keywords with values, etc.). Often this isn't
    what you need in a complex application--you need complete
    control over your configuration data, and you need the ability
    to structure it however you like. This is what
    Config::FreeForm gives you.

    In Config::FreeForm configuration data is stored as a Perl
    data structure. The logic behind this is that you know Perl--you
    shouldn't need to learn another little language to set up your
    configuration data, however simple that language may be.
