Friend

I read this message recently from a member
of our "New Houses Opportunity". 

Ever since I got the rights to offer this opportunity to the public I've been
reading letters like this one. 

Thought you might find it interesting. 

Best,

Lou

I have always wanted to invest in real estate, but it is nearly impossible to do
so here in California. The real estate prices here are ridiculously high. 

Therefore, when I came across NPL it was the perfect way to invest because I was
able to get a brand new house located by them for $150,000.

 They provided me a lease purchase tenant, and I will make $20,000 when they
buy, in addition to the positive cash flow. I recommend NPL to anyone. 

I am now on buying my fifth house with them and will do as many as I can. I have
now referred my friends to them because I have been so satisfied with their
service.

Unbelievable, huh? 

The brand new for 2005 NPL program has to be the
best kept secret in Real Estate investing because it basically requires no work
on your part and the profit potential is almost unlimited. My favorite part is
all properties are brand new! No more ugly houses!
