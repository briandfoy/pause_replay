The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MNG
  DSLIP:       cd+Op
  description: Perl I/F to the MNG library from Gerard Juyn
  userid:      MOTT (David Mott)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    GD supports PNG, which precedes MNG

  rationale:

    Ideally, MNG would be integrated into the GD library, and the PERL
    interface for GD would be extended to support MNG. Unfortunately,
    the GD I/F is geared for single-frame (i.e. non-animated) images. It
    does this very well, and it would be cumbersome to add support for
    animated formats (GIF, MNG, etc.)

    Also, since the MNG library is also in its infancy, the interface
    or behavior may change over the next few years. I'm hoping to
    accelerate the maturation of the MNG library by exposing it to the
    PERL community.

    By making a new PERL module, we can isolate the development from
    any other existing PERL modules or libraries (such as GD).

    Since PNG is quickly becoming an internet standard, I expect MNG to
    quickly follow (there are already plug-ins for IE and Netscape). We
    need a good way to generate images on the fly, from PERL scripts,
    just as we can generate PNG files. Hopefully this interface will
    help us do that.

The resulting entry would be:

MNG               cd+Op Perl I/F to the MNG library from Gerard Juyn MOTT
