The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geometry::Formula
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: geometry measurement formulas
  userid:      CVEGA (Casey Vega)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    has not been discussed, if discussed likely via email

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm open to several name spaces but settled on Geometry::Formula
    since the functions within the library are in fact geometry
    formulas.

    I don't know if my approach is unique since most geometry formulas
    are elementary in terms of mathematics. The reason I believe the
    module should be listed is because I intend to provide the most
    comprehensive library of geometry formulas. Secondly I have written
    the library in such a fashion that even non programmers can view the
    source code and understand the formula.

    Take for instance for the volume of a cube: $x = ( 4 / 3 ) * $PI *
    cubed( $param{'radius'} );

    If you have any questions please let me know. Thank you for your
    consideration.
