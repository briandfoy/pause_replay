I don't really have any authority either, but I like to help people
find the modules they need. :)

If you're dealing with a webservice, I'd name it after the website the
service goes with.

It would also be nice if we had a top-level namespace for things that
are biology-related but not BioPerl.

I really don't know enough about the subject area to be any more useful
that than.
