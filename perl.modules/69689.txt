The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Vector::BestRotation
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: best orthogonal map between two vector sets
  userid:      LGEHLEN (Lutz Gehlen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module finds the best orthogonal map that maps one given set of
    vectors to another set of the same size. It definitely belongs into
    the Math namespace. A subspace of Math::Matrix would also have been
    possible, but the problem is one between sets of vectors. A matrix
    is just the way of describing the solution, therefore I chose
    Math::Vector.

    Math::Vector::Orthogonal would be more precise because the module
    can not only look for strict rotations, but also for rotations in
    combination with a reflection. However, I think that for people
    searching for the module, rotation is the most important keyword.

    This choice of namespace has been discussed on the module-authors
    mailing list.

The resulting entry would be:
