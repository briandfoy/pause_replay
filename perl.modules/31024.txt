The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SimpleMySQL
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: A simple interface to creating MySQL queries
  userid:      LINNIN (Jacob Boswell)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Bases on DBI

  rationale:

    I wrote this module simply because I was tired of writing "SELECT
    ... FROM ... JOIN ... WHERE" and I could not find a module that did
    this for me. Root name space is used because I could not find a
    logical parent, this may be from a lack of understanding, or just
    bad searching on my part. I am open to suggestions :).

  enteredby:   LINNIN (Jacob Boswell)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 21 14:54:17 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SimpleMySQL       bdpfg A simple interface to creating MySQL queries LINNIN
