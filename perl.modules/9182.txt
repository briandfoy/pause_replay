This is kind of what Games::Dice is supposed to do. Only I, um, haven't
uploaded my version to CPAN yet; it's been gathering dust for quite a
while since I haven't touched the code for a long time.

I suggest the Games:: hierarchy, at any rate. But note that I am not a
PAUSE admin; they may have different suggestions.

Cheers,
