I can reproduce with

  /usr/local/perl-5.10.1/bin/perl -e 'use YAML::XS; print YAML::XS::LoadFile("META.yml")'
  YAML::XS::Load Error: The problem:

      Invalid trailing UTF-8 octet

  was found at document: 0

Looks like your META.yml was written in latin1 which I think is not
legal YAML.

  > It looks like it was indexed.

Yes.

I wouldn't sweat over it. If nobody complains you can fix it next time
you do a regular upload. As a PAUSE maintaintainer I see no immediate
reason to ask you to re-upload.

  > If so,

I don't know what you or some of the involved software did wrong. I see
only the result of a META.yml written in latin1.

Which previous upload are you talking about and what might have been
different in these? Note that developer releases do not get read by the
indexer, so those don't count.
