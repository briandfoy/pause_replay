     why:

    I guess this is mainly to avoid spammers, but if you look at the
    YAPC:EU attendants list you'll find me on six of them, as well as
    several workshops.

    First module I need to upload is an astronomical library written at
    the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Have also been thinking of
    taking over the abandoned Config::Simple which is broken and not
    available on MetaCPAN.
