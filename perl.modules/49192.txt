Actually now the url would be
  http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/D/DM/DMUEY/Apache-Admin- 
Config-0.93.tar.gz

The rt one is an html page telling you to login to view the actual  
file if you're not logged in :)

I see that I am co-maintainer now, thanks, and the new 0.93 is uploaded.

However its uploaded to my account (http://search.cpan.org/~dmuey/)  
and the problem is that installing via CPAN module still results in  
0.92 (latest in http://search.cpan.org/~rsoliv/ that still has the bug)

We're needing to provision this module on thousands of servers (added  
to a list of modules install()ed by CPAN.pm) and I really need the  
one in my account 0.93 to replace the broken 0.92 globally on CPAN.

How can this be done as a co-maintainer? (aside from Olivier  
uploading the new tarball at the url in my account above via pause) ?

Thanks!
