The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OpenGL::OGLFT
  DSLIP:       cd+Ol
  description: Truetype in OpenGL with Freetype and OGLFT
  userid:      GORK (John Laur)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    I tried to open a discussion on sdl-devel@perl.org, but nobody
    seemed very interested...

  similar:
    Games::OpenGL::Font::2D

  rationale:

    Rendering nice looking text in OpenGL is a hard problem. I
    initially experimented with Games::OpenGL::Font::2D, but found the
    implementaiton to be slow and inflexible (not to mention it is
    compatible with only pre-2.0 versions of SDL_perl)

    The OGLFT library handles this problem very well and has many
    useful drawing styles. Although my work, currently, is very
    preliminary, I am attempting to expose the majority of the
    functionality of this C++ library in perl with minimum overhead. I
    should have an upload ready within two weeks.

    OpenGL::OGLFT is designed to work with SDL::OpenGL; however, it
    should also work with any perl OpenGL implementation provided that
    the OGLFT library is linked to the same OpenGL library the perl
    module is using. It should work with the basic OpenGL module and
    also QT::OpenGL, thus the choice of namespace.

    Information on OGLFT can be found at http://oglft.sourceforge.net/

    Thanks for your consideration.

The resulting entry would be:
