I believe it was the "Ricardo throwing a hissy fit" comment in your
followup.  That took it from "please register this name" to "here's my
personal problem with p5p".

I hear that you feel misunderstood and/or ill-used by p5p.  But it's
not the responsibility of PAUSE maintainers to be your intermediaries
in such a dispute, and the module registration list is not the place
for a proxy battle over pragmas.

You may feel that Matt's comments to you were a personal attack.  I
grant they were *personal* in that they described your observed
behaviors.  However, they related directly to your comments, whereas
your "hissy fit" remarks were not relevant to a registration request.

Ignoring social niceties on this list (or any other) only encourages
the administrators to pay less attention to you.

On a more positive note, you've had two suggestions that the module
needs a different -- non-lowercase -- name.

You have two practical options:

(1) release your module to CPAN under whatever name you wish -- with
the understanding that an all-lowercase name may be reclaimed by p5p
if needed by core.  Such a module would not be "registered" on the
modules list, but would be indexed by PAUSE.

(2) rename your module in some fashion as suggested so that it is
acceptable to the PAUSE maintainers responsible for such a thing.
(And, FWIW, I am not one of the ones responsible for such things).

I hope you find one of those two options to be the way to proceed in
sharing your work.

Regards,
David
