i have written a new version of File::Slurp that is completely
compatible with the older one but is faster and has more options. the
original author, David Muir Sharnoff (cc'ed), has graciously allowed me
to take over the namespace. here is one letter he sent me in our exchange
about this module:

Okay, you can have the namespace, but you must be 100% backwards
compatable.  Even for error handling.   

You must include and pass my regression tests.



the new module does include his tests and many more and passes them all
on window and solaris (i did get some PAUSE test reports about darwin
and i will investigate them. i have darwin at home as well). and it is
fully compatible with his in the default mode (both api and
behavior). all extra features are controlled by optional arguments that
are not needed in the default mode. if you haven't seen it yet, i just
wrote an article about this module and it is now on perl.com.

so please arrange to transfer ownership of File::Slurp to the cpan id
URI. the module is in my author directory now but PAUSE sent me an error
email stating it won't index it due to permission (ownership)
issues. the new version number is 9999.01 which is greater than the old
module's date based version number so it will be seen by new downloaders
as soon as PAUSE indexes it.

thanx,

uri
