Hello Vman,

I already contacted you nearly one year ago to no avail. I retried 
yesterday, withour puting modules@ in copy. Now it is done.

Because you have not updated Net::Libdnet module since 2004, and 
because I wrote support for all libdnet functions, I need to take 
ownership of the module.

Tell me if you are ok to give me ownership. 

Regards,
