Hi,

This is really just advance notice that I will be asking for co-maint on =
the 'enum' dist:

https://metacpan.org/release/enum

This was written by Byron Brummer, and last released in 1999 (the last =
time Byron Brummer released anything).
His CPAN email address bounces, as did the other email addresses listed =
in the pod.

Once/if I have co-maint I'll address the two bugs in RT and add modern =
metadata, etc. It has 11 directly dependent dists, and 23 in total.

I've found Byron on LinkedIn, but I'm not in his network, so can't try =
and connect to him (which I've done with other adoption attempts). My =
only option would be to pay to send him an InMail, which I'm not going =
to do.

If any of the admins know of a working email address for Byron, please =
let me know. Otherwise in 19 days I'll be asking for co-maint.

Cheers,
Neil
