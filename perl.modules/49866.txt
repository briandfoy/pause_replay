The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MSExchange
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Interfaces Microsoft Exchange 2000/2003 DAV
  userid:      JERBROO (Jeremy D. Brooks)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This set of modules gives developers access to Microsoft exchange
    functionality including MIME E-mail, Contact, Calendar and Task
    Lists via WebDAV incluing support for embedded SQL queies to the
    Exchange server. These modules could be classified as HTTP/Web
    modules but they are so specific in function that classifying them
    as such may cause confusion. Further, since they also use WebDAv/XML
    extensively, they could also be classified as XML modules, I
    suppose. This module kit contains several modules for everything
    from server read/write to authentication and a customized version of
    HTTP::DAV. Therefore it seems appropriate that a new "MSExchange"
    namespace be created to house them.

The resulting entry would be:

MSExchange        adpOg Interfaces Microsoft Exchange 2000/2003 DAV  JERBROO
