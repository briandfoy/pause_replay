The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       X11::IdleTime
  DSLIP:       adhfp
  description: X11::IdleTime - Get the idle time from X11
  userid:      AWENDT (Adam Wendt)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    a little bit on #perl on opn or whatever they are called now

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    The reason for listing this module is that it takes what would
    require writing an XS module or atleast Inline::C code and cuts it
    down to $idle = GetIdleTime(); The namespace choice seems pretty
    simple as there is nothing else that does this and it requires X11,
    though it doesn't use any of the existing X11 modules (none of them
    are usable in this situation).

  enteredby:   AWENDT (Adam Wendt)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb  8 15:38:52 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

X11::
::IdleTime        adhfp X11::IdleTime - Get the idle time from X11   AWENDT
