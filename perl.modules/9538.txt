Hi 

I would like to register on PAUSE so I can contribute to CPAN please.

Name:    Robert Price
Email:   robert@robertprice.co.uk
user-ID: RPRICE

Description: 

WAP::WBXML::Decoder
I am planning to contribute a module that can decode binary encoded XML
and return XML that is readable by other XML modules already available on
CPAN. The module would decode the binary XML format as described by the
submission to the W3C at http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml/ .

There are two related modules on CPAN, but these both take XML and
compile it to binary. They are CGI::WML and WAP:wbxml. Neither can decode
back to XML.

I would appreciate any comments should the namespace or anything else
appear to be inappropriate with this request.

Thanks,

Robert Price
