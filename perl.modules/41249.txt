The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::quotas
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to the quotas database
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Quota

  rationale:

    Now, I understand that Tom Zoerner did a perfectly fine Quota
    package, however his release is very broad based and multi purpose;
    my package will give a low level interface to the local file only.
    The fact that his package uses actual quota related system calls
    means that he isnt actually interpreting the file, whereas mine will
    let you load it, do your processing, then save it back.

    This is a good approach in some environments where his Quota
    package dosent fill all the user's needs, like the one I am working
    in.

  enteredby:   CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun 25 19:22:01 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::quotas          adpOp Interface to the quotas database             CMORRIS
