The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Exception::Base
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Error handling with exception class
  userid:      DEXTER (Piotr Roszatycki)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Exception::Class Class::Throwable Error

  rationale:

    The Exception module is removed from indices. I hope it does mean
    this namespace is free. If not, I would like to upload it under
    Exception::Base name.

    Description:

    This class implements a fully OO exception mechanism similar to
    Exception::Class or Class::Throwable. It does not depend on other
    modules like Exception::Class and it is more powerful than
    Class::Throwable. Also it does not use closures as Error and does
    not polute namespace as Exception::Class::TryCatch. It is also much
    faster than Exception::Class.

    Advantages:

    * fast implementation of an exception object * fully OO without
    closures and source code filtering * does not mess with
    $SIG{__DIE__} and $SIG{__WARN__} * no external modules dependencies,
    requires core Perl modules only * implements error stack, the
    try/catch blocks can be nested * shows full backtrace stack on die
    by default * the default behaviour of exception class can be changed
    globally or just for the thrown exception * the exception can be
    created with defined custom properties * matching the exception by
    class, message or custom properties * matching with string, regex or
    closure function * creating automatically the derived exception
    classes ("use" interface) * easly expendable

The resulting entry would be:

Exception::
::Base            bdpOp Error handling with exception class          DEXTER
