     why:

    Being a Automation Test Developer in the industry for years, I
    would like to thank Perl and other contributors for giving us tools
    and libraries to improve this industry especially relating to
    testing. This is the time for me to contribute myself. I would like
    to help writing Perl's libraries on software functional testing,
    performance testing and stress testing. We would see Perl would have
    a better future because of everybody's contribution.
