Using the CPAN Module to upgrade perl with mysql I am encountering a serious
problem when trying to install Data-ShowTable using the command:
'install Data/Data-ShowTable'

I believe that the path that the CPAN module is trying to access is
incorrect as it has 2 /'s in it:
Could not fetch authors/id/D/D//D/Da/Data/Data-ShowTable

The alternative of course is that I'm doing something completely wrong!

Regards,
Tom Davidson
