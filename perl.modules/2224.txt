   New Module: IP::Address
   NEW Modules: Net-Subnet-Count and Tie-IP-Address
----------------------------------------------------------------------

lem> A while ago I uploaded a module called IP::Address. Since then it
lem> has been used by quite a few people in different platforms. Since
lem> it has been tested by a few tens of persons I would like to add
lem> it to the module list.

lem> Is this name acceptable or does a new name need to be figured
lem> out?

lem> These new modules have been available for a few months now.

lem> Net-Subnet-Count is written to simplify collecting subnet
lem> statistics out of log files. Tie-IP-Address provides a hash
lem> interface to IP-Address.

lem> I would like both to be included in the official module list.

I find no mention of any of them in the archives at all, did you ever
discuss the namespaces anywhere?

IP:: would be new toplevel namespace, so I'm not fond of introducing
it without a discussion of alternatives.

Net::Subnet::Count is a three level tier in which Net::Subnet:: is a
new namespace. Could you lend us a hand in justifying this new
namespace?

Same goes for Tie::IP::Address.

I'm not sure, but I could imagine somewhere in the NetPacket or
Network hierarchie or below the Net::DNS there might be a place to
consider settling.
