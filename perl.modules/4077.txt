The or isn't in the array.  Only the individual elements of the expression
are in the array. So, for "yea | ney" you would get a two element array
consisting of "yea" and "ney".  You replace each element of the array with
a 1 or 0 depending on whetever you do with the element.  So, for "yea |
nea" you would probably want to set the first element to 1 and the second
to 0.  Then you call the eval method to get the final evaluation of the
expression.  

See the examples in the docs.
