     why:

    Hi. I'm a long time perl programmer and 4-5 years in job know.
    Before, I studied computer science at university. I'd like to
    contribute some of my work back to the community. My plan is to
    publish on github and first get some feedback on irc before starting
    the PAUSE/CPAN process. First distribution for CPAN will probably be
    a low-level XS wrapper for Cryptoki allowing to talk to any PKCS#11
    token. Later based on that s/th more high-level and object-oriented
    (Moo(se), p5-mop).
