Request to register new user

     why:

    I was wondering if i could get access to my old PAUSE account:

    ADAVIES

    registered at my old email account Alex.Davies@ti.com

    I've also forgotten the password :-\ (I only used it the once back
    in 1999!).

    I'd like to upload the latest version of my script "peg".

    It's a command line tool file search tool which is (mostly)
    compatible with GNU grep, plus extra bells and whistles. The new
    version benefits from being Windows friendly, runs much faster, can
    (automatically) handle encodings, colours output, can process
    archives, with more options than you want, plus the usual bug fixes.

    Thanks.
