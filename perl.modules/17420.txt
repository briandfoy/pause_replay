     why:

    I expect to occasionally submit modules that are building blocks
    for, what I like to refer to as the Universal Canvas aka two-way
    web. More traditional this functionality is associated with
    weblogging tools -- RSS, TrackBack and so on. These functions also
    has a close assoication with Web services in the RESTful sense. One
    such module that I've completed and would like to submit can be
    found here: http://www.mplode.com/tima/archives/000191.html.
