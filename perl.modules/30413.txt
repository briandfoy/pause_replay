The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::RULI
  DSLIP:       adcfg
  description: Interface for querying DNS SRV records
  userid:      EMARQUES (Éverton da Silva Marques)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/ruli/

  similar:
    Net::DNS

  rationale:

    This is a Perl module for interfacing with the RULI library:

    http://www.nongnu.org/ruli/

    The usual description for the library RULI is:

    RULI stands for Resolver User Layer Interface. It's a library built
    on top of an asynchronous DNS stub resolver. RULI provides an
    easy-to-use interface for querying DNS SRV resource records. The
    goal is to promote the wide deployment of SRV-cognizant software.
    RULI aims to fully support SRV-related standards.

    I'm aware Net::DNS facilities for DNS handling are more general,
    and I suppose they are written in pure Perl.

    RULI is unique in the sense it enforces strict adherence to DNS SRV
    specification (RFC 2782), thus relieving the application programmer
    from doing it.

    Actually I would prefer to see a similar pure-Perl module, but I
    can't spend the time to maintain one. Thus I'm providing a wrapper
    module for an equivalent library.

    I'm unsure RULI would fit under Net::DNS, that's why it's proposed
    directly under Net. I'd really appreciate guidance on this, though.

The resulting entry would be:
