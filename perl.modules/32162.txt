From: sendmail3@certifiedit.com (Bookman Publishing)

Bookman Publishing is already the only company in the industry contacting 
bookstore owners for our authors.  Now, to learn even more about the retail 
book industry we have just purchased our first bookstore.

This is not a website, it's a real store made out of bricks and glass.  The 
Bookman Store is on the square in Franklin Indiana and will be open in 
June.  All of our author's books will be sold there automatically. 

For the very first time ever, we can now guarantee that your book will be 
sold in a real store.  As always, we will sell your book even if another 
company published it.

You still have time to take advantage of our 50% discount on selected 
bookselling services, or publish your book at our introductory price.  
(Both offers expire May 28)  Just reply or call:
