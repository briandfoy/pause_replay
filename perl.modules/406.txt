Hmmm....Ok. Now I'm confused. I uploaded them after posting to the
modules list with their DSLI codes and description back in June - 
and one module I uploaded went into modlist.long without any action 
beyond that by me (Tie::ListKeyedHash). The others never showed up
(and had _not_ shown up as of the  1999/10/31 17:43:14 update) 
It seems that somewhere around June a policy shift happened that PAUSE 
users have to upload and _then_ edit the DSLI etc themselves via the 
form interface before it can show up in the modlist.long file? 

I wonder how many other people like myself followed the procedure
layed out in http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html and are
still waiting for their modules to 'automagically' appear in the 
modlist.long file because they don't realize they have to manually
edit their information _after_ they have been discussed and 
uploaded....

I just did so. That should make them appear in modlist.long at the
next update, right?
