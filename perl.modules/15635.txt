It seems that the namespace is registered. This is the result of my
registration attempt:

ERROR: The submission didn't succeed due to the following reasons:

Dist R/RA/RANDY/Config-Properties-0.40.tar.gz, current version 0.40 has been
uploaded by RANDY. Please contact RANDY or choose a different namespace.

I don't think a different name will be useful now since there are people
using this module with it's present name. Maybe Config::JavaProperties would
have been a little better, but it's a bit late for that now.
