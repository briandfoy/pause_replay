     why:

    I plan on uploading a set of modules I've written at
    Net-a-porter.com that for providing a well defined, trustworthy
    interface for interacting with warn and die handlers. I believe this
    solves some issues in the community that currently haven't been
    fixed. By the end of today I plan to upload these already written
    modules to http://github.com/PhillipTaylor
