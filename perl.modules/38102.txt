Seems like the same concept. Maybe I'm wrong.

I'm not sure those are rightly classified. I'm not sure what an ISBN
has to do with Business, for example.

Neither does 'Business'. I think SSN::Validate is pretty clear, as
Business::OnlinePayment is. I'd propose a Validate::* for misc
validation like this (Validate::SSN, Validate::PhoneNumber::US, Validate::ISBN,
etc..) but I think there are a few Validate modules already thrown around.

I really can't see how SSNs are business specific, and wouldn't want to
just throw it in there because other modules were thrown in there. The
module specifically has to do with validating SSNs, not needing to be
in any business, CGI or financial context. 

I'm cool with it not being registered, and just keeping the name as it
is. I'm also cool with renaming it to something like Validate::SSN in
hopes to encourage more Validate:: modules. I don't think I'm cool with
putting it in Business:: though. 

Cheers,
Kevin
