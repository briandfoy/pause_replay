Hi All

I would like to submit a module and need an author ID.

sjsmith would work for me and it looks like it's not in use.

My email is sjs@chaos-tools.com, but this address
(sjs@sonic.net) also works.

I have a version of Getopt that takes a template as input,
parses the input and simplifies the problem of creating a
usage message by incorporating the help into the template.

I would like to call the module Getotp:OO since that doesn't
seem to be in use and the interface to this module is object
oriented.

Thanks
Steve S.
