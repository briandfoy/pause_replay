Hello CPAN admins,

I'm looking to get co-maint on Geo-IPfree [1] in order to make a
maintenance release. The module is owned by "Graciliano Monteiro
Passos" (GMPASSOS) who has been inactive for a while. A number of
other people have attempted to reach him about other module without
success (evidence can be found on the module-authors list).

A maintenance release is needed because the data provided by the
package is now obsolete. The debian-perl people have a number of fixes
integrated in to their release [2]. As a new member to that group,
I've offered (on their behalf) to attempt to get things fixed up
stream.

Thanks in advance,

-Brian Cassidy (BRICAS)
