This is not the correct mailing list for that question.

But to answer it anyway, normally you should be installing CPAN modules 
via the CPAN client. The client will see the dependency on 
IO::Compress::Gzip, map that CLASS dependency to the appropriate 
distribution, and then automatically pull that as well and install it 
(recursively).
