Hi Brian,

Yes, you all right. There is nothing amazing about this module, but 
frequently I needed only a certain subset of sequential numbers of pages 
to put into a template and generate a paginator widget.

I thought the other modules were too complicated for just that. Or I was 
too stupid to use them... :)

My first approach was create a function to do this for me, but it began 
to be requested in several different modules, them I put it into your 
own module and all be happy!

Maybe someone further make use of it, maybe not. So, I put it avaliable 
to all!

Thank you

Blabos
