The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Favorites
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: tally a stream for recently dominant items
  userid:      HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    my website, irc channels, future submitted modules

  similar:
    (no similar module found)

  rationale:

    From the README:

    A Favorites structure tracks the disposition of various keys. A
    key's disposition is a measurement of its relative predominance and
    freshness when tallied. This is a good way to infer favorites or
    other leadership-oriented facts from a historical data stream.

    At any time, keys can be culled by freshness or by their current
    ranking, or both. With these approaches, dispositions can be weighed
    over the whole historical record, rather than providing a simplistic
    "top events in the last N events" rolling count.

    This module will also be used by future integrated CPAN
    module/bundle submissions.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
