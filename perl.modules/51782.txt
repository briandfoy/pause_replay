Thanks for providing these explanations.

I had a look through CPAN authentication modules and it looks like the 
"Authen" top level namespace seems widely used. I will rename my perl 
module from "AuthCAS" to "Authen::CAS" then.

That's why most modules live under a general name, followed by a more
specific name.

CAS can mean several things. For instance, in my world, that means the
Chemical Abstracts Service, which also happens to be the first hit for
CAS in Google. A better name can dis-ambiguate that. :)
