Hello,

After discussing with the previous authors and having their agreement,=20=

I am taking over maintainer-ship of Net::Pcap.

Unfortunately, the email address of the first author, Peter Lister,=20
doesn't seem to work anymore. Googling for his name, I found another=20
Peter Lister that posted in the mod_perl list, but he didn't answer=20
either so I don't know whether this is the good one or not.

Hence this mail because I'd like the appropriate administrative rights=20=

(like the Net::Pcap namespace and RT queue ownership) transfer to my=20
CPAN ID, SAPER. And be sure that when I upload a new version of=20
Net::Pcap, it will be indexed by PAUSE.


Thanks in advance,

S=E9bastien Aperghis-Tramoni
