The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Go::DGS::Status
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Perl Interface to Dragon Go Server's status
  userid:      AMARQUIS (Adam Marquis)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Has been discussed with those running go-playing bots on Dragon Go
    Server. Will be debuted for the go community at large when finished.

  similar:
    KGS::* KGS::Listener

  rationale:

    The KGS::* modules provide an interface for interacting with the
    Kiseido Go Server, for go playing robots or humans. My
    Games::Go::DGS::Status will be, hopefully, the first in a series
    that bring that functionality to the Dragon Go Server.

    Honestly, I'm not sure why the KGS::* modules are in the root
    namespace. It feels to me that things of this sort belong with the
    other, similar go utility modules in the Games::Go space, so that's
    where I'm proposing mine go.

  enteredby:   AMARQUIS (Adam Marquis)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 18 03:25:03 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Go::DGS::
::Status          cdpOp Perl Interface to Dragon Go Server's status  AMARQUIS
