The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RSH::Servus
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: RSH::Servus - pure perl webserver
  userid:      MLUKER (Matt Luker)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    servus@redstarhackers.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    RSH::Servus is a pure perl webserver. It's based on HTTP::Daemon
    and HTTP::Daemon::SSL.

    I'm asking for a new root level because I don't think it would fit
    anywhere reasonable and I have quite a few support modules that
    would probably go under the RSH root too. I guess I also don't see
    too many people using it, but those who do use it would probably
    like to use CPAN to get at it--especially since it has some nasty
    dependencies thanks to HTTP::Daemon::SSL.

    If there is somewhere else I should consider instead of a new root
    space, I'm all ears.

The resulting entry would be:

RSH::
::Servus          bdpOa RSH::Servus - pure perl webserver            MLUKER
