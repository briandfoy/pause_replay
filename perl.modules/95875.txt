Please drop my permission, it doesn't make sense to make it CPAN indexed.

Thanks and keep up the good work.

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m still work=

Dobrica has ownership of the test::helper namespace, which was last indexed=
 in your Fuse 0.14 release =E2=80=94 it hasn=E2=80=99t been indexed for sub=
sequent releases, because Derrik (DPATES) who=E2=80=99s done those releases=

<br>
Your test::helper class is just used in tests, so shouldn=E2=80=99t really =
be indexed. If the dist was refactored:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0- rename the =E2=80=9Ctest=E2=80=9D directory to =E2=80=9Ct=E2=

then PAUSE wouldn=E2=80=99t try to index it or check permissions, as it ign=

<br>
In the meantime, I=E2=80=99d like to resolve the permissions clash by dropp=
