The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::UPS
  DSLIP:       adpO2
  description: Package Tracking using UPS Tools XML API
  userid:      KBRANDT (Kyle Brandt)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    #perl on irc.freenode.net

  similar:
    Net::UPS

  rationale:

    There are a few UPS modules out there, but I didn't find any that
    made tracking a package convenient or even really implemented this
    function. This provides a lot of simple methods like
    $trackedpackage->getActivityList() to make it easy for people to
    include UPS package tracking in there scripts. The namespace just
    makes sense to me, but I am open to different ones.

    Currently I have a working module with POD documentation. But I
    still have to adjust it to the final name space, and learn how to
    make proper make and test files.

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::
::UPS             adpO2 Package Tracking using UPS Tools XML API     KBRANDT
