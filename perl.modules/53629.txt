The issue of elections has come up before, in relation to a volunteer 
organisation. They had all sorts of election related stuff, not just the 
math.

At the time I think we recommended Election:: as a root namespace to 
base it under.

However, since you are I think just dealing with the math, I'm not sure 
if you want to trailblaze and do Election::Condorcet::RankedPairs...

And frankly, that doesn't look to me to be a statistical method (indeed 
the string "statistic" doesn't appear on the wikipedia page), rather an 
algorithmic one, and "Condorcet" is quite a suitable unique identifier.

So I'd suggest the conventional naming would probably be 
Algorithm::Condorcet::RankedPairs, or even just 
Algorithm::Vote::RankedPairs, or if there's no question whatsoever of 
"ranked pairs" ever meaning anything else, Algorithm::RankedPairs.
