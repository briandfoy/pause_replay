All,

I'd like to contribute a new module to CPAN which i'm currently calling
Pod::DocBookXML

As its name implies, the module is for converting Pod to DocBook XML.

FYI (for those that don't know): There are two types of DocBook  SGML
and XML.

I'm mailing this list to check that people are happy with the name and
with me contributing such a module to CPAN. Any other suggestions of
name are gratefully received.

Similar modules on CPAN:

Pod::DocBook - however this produces DocBook SGML
Pod::XML      - does not produce DocBook. Could use a stylesheet to
transform into XML, but introduces an extra processing step... and there
might be issues with ids on sections

As suggested on the london.pm irc channel, i tried emailing the author
of Pod::DocBook to see what he was up to and whether he was happy with
my module name (one person was concerned it might cause confusing - and
i agree it will for ppl who don't know that there are two types of
DocBook). However the email address he has on CPAN bounced back as
unknown address - guess he's moved on.

Thanks in advance for ur input,


Sagar
