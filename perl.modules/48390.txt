Dear CPAN/PAUSE admins,

I posted the message below on March 30 and have not seen a reply from 
the maintainer of Sub::Uplevel.

As suitable notification time has passed without objection, I would like 
to take over maintainence of Sub::Uplevel and get the bug-fix out as 
soon as possible.

Regards,
David Golden (DAGOLDEN)
