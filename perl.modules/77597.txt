The tarball does not contain any file Base.pm, so the indexer cannot
intuit that you just uploaded XML::SAX::Base. You can convince the
indexer by writing in the META.yml a "provides" entry instead.

I'm sorry that you did not get any email about this. The indexer just
gives up when a tarball has no pm file and no provides entry. I think
this is fixable, at least can be done better. ==> TODO
