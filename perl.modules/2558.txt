Hi,

I feel dumb for not having found that one in CPAN before writing mine :-).

Yes, I think mine could maybe be a replacement, BUT it doesn't do the one=
 feature that yours does: namely, reload based on file-changed-time. =20

That's an optimization that's probably missing from mine, but I=
 intentionally didn't add that because some modules have load-time side=
 effects (such as BEGIN blocks) and so forcing an unconditional reload is=
 slightly different from reloading only changed files.

In light of that, maybe mine should be a different module, maybe called:

Module::Reload::Force

?

=2E.. but one of the biggest aspects of mine is its ability to do nothing=
 during end-user runtime, but kick in selectively at Development time --=
 i.e. it doesn't always force the Reload.  That's why I thought Devel::=
 might be the best place for it.


Anyone else have any opinions?  I think naming is very important and I do=
 want to come up with the best name.

-c=20
