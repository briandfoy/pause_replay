Dear modules,

I wish to volunteer to maintain File::Path. The interface to mktree and 
rmtree are distinctly paleontological. I would like to add an alternate 
interface that allows a more modern approach (e.g. mode parameters named 
in a hash ref).

I would also like to offer to gather the names of files deleted into a 
passed listref, which would allow people to deal with the results other 
than by blindly having the stuff printed to STDOUT.

I shall endeavour to work with the Perl 5 Porters to ensure that blead 
and maint stay in synch, and that the module continues to work correctly 
going back as far as 5.004.

Having the module dual-lifed will enable to the new functionality to be 
brought to older perls without an entire upgrade.

Regards,
David Landgren
