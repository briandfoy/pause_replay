The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Player::Musicus
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: a POE wrapper for the musicus audio player
  userid:      MRPERSON (Curtis Hawthorne)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    POE::Component::Player::MPG123

  rationale:

    This module accomplishes the same goal as
    POE::Component::Player::MPG123, but for a different player app with
    a different interface. This makes the namespace choice pretty easy.
    The module allows a POE application to easily manipulate the musicus
    commandline audio player. This player supports most any format that
    an XMMS input plugin exists for and was designed for integration
    with other programs. So, by using this module it isn't very
    difficult to create a POE application that can play most any kind of
    audio file out there.

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Player::
::Musicus         RdpOo a POE wrapper for the musicus audio player   MRPERSON
