From: durist@world.std.com (Daniel J Urist)

I am the maintainer of the Proc::ProcessTable module, which allows OO
access to process information under a variety of (mostly unix-like)
operating systems. My module provides a simple generic API, and is
licensed under the same terms as perl. Most of the OS-specific sub-modules
have been contributed by others, generally with the understanding that the
code was licensed under the same terms as my module.

Recently someone submitted to me a windows port, which is derived from
some Cygwin code, which is licensed solely under the GPL. I'd very much
like to include this with my module, but I'm unclear on exactly how to do
this since my module, like Perl, is licensed under both GPL and Artistic
licenses. Would some sort of disclaimer in the README file be sufficient?
Or do I not have to do anything, since the code lives in its own source
files?

Thanks for any clarification,
Dan
