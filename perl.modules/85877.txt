Curiously, PAUSE appears to have no record of the two namespaces in that 
distribution. Technically, Caleb, that means if you go ahead and release 
a new version, PAUSE would likely pick it up automatically.

Nonetheless, please to refer to the takeover guidelines as you're making 
your changes:

Best regards,
Steffen

PS: Hey Sean, how are you? Still in Ketchikan?
