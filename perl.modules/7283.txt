The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::More
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: yet another framework for writing tests
  userid:      MSCHWERN (Michael G Schwern)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa@perl.org, perl5-porters@perl.org, TPC, YAPC

  similar:
    Test ExtUtils::TBone

  rationale:

    Test::More is the next step up from Test::Simple. It's a collection
    of more ways to say 'ok'. It's functions provide better failure
    reporting mechanisms, but are also more complicated and more
    daunting.

    Test::More was initially very similar to Test.pm, but it eclipses
    it with an interface that's easy to extend (as opposed to the "let's
    wedge everything into ok()" approach of Test.pm), easier to
    document, easier to test and with less surprising side-effects.
    Test.pm's use has since been discouraged in favor of Test::More.

  enteredby:   MSCHWERN (Michael G Schwern)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 30 23:32:37 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::More            Rdpfp yet another framework for writing tests      MSCHWERN
