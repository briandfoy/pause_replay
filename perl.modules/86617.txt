Please see below. It seems that Jean has made a good effort to find the 
original author, and said author has been awol for a long time.

It'd be great to give these modules to Jean (or just give him co-maint).


Thanks,

Subject: Status of Astro::Sunrise and DateTime::Event::Sunrise

Ron Hill, are you still active on the DateTime list?

>From August 2000 until October 2003, you have released several
versions of Astro::Sunrise. From March 2003 to March 2004,
you have released several versions of DateTime::Event::Sunrise.

Since then, nothing.

Yet, rt.cpan has several tickets for these distributions.
The oldest ones are just wishlists for the documentation
of DT::E::Sunrise, back in October 2004:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=7605
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=8065

No answer for these tickets.

And then, a showstopper bug appeared in both Astro::Sunrise
and DT::E::Sunrise: very wrong times for sunrise and sunset
on 20th or 21st of March (spring equinox), sometimes even
an error "sun never rises" or "sun never sets". In addition,
nearly all other days give wrong results (for example, at latitude
60Â°, the difference can be more than 3 minutes 1/2).
The problem with 20th / 21st March was reported
independently by several people, including me:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34770
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55762
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75927
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=47049
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=83394

There was even a patch for DT::E::Sunrise in
my ticket. And still no answer.

There was one review for DT::E::Sunrise. Did the
reviewer say that your module sucks? No. Did he
say that your module rocks? No. He just said:

Please apply patch from rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34770

And still no answer.

There are other tickets of various severities, including another with
a patch for DT::E::Sunrise:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=36532

When dealing with ticket 83394, someone has tried to reach you,
but the message was not delivered. So here is a new attempt,
with a copy to the DateTime mailing-list.

So, are you still active on the DateTime mailing-list?
Could you fix the bugs, especially the bugs for which
we provided a patch?

Or else, can you share maintenance of these two
modules with someone else? I volunteer to be a
co-maintener for these modules.

Best regards,

Jean Forget
