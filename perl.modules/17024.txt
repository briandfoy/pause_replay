The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tib::Rv
  DSLIP:       cdhOp
  description: Perl bindings and OO lib for TIB/Rendezvous
  userid:      STURM (Paul Sturm)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The TIBCO TIB/Rendezvous library ships as "libtibrv.so" and links
    as "-ltibrv", and all functions are prefixed with "tibrv" (such as
    "tibrv_Open( )"). Thus, "Tib::Rv" in Perl will be analogous to
    "tibrv" in C. Similarly for other, more advanced libraries that ship
    with TIB/Rendezvous, like tibrvft and tibrvcm. They will all map
    similarly -- Tib::Rvft, Tib::Rvcm.

    From a product standpoint, TIBCO abbreviates all their products
    with the "TIB/" prefix -- eg, TIB/Rendezvous, TIB/Hawk, and so on,
    so creating a top-level "Tib" namespace is consistent with that. I
    will possibly be creating a Tib::Hawk module in the future, and I'd
    like to see it all bundled under "Tib::".

    "TIB" is TIBCO's abbreviation for "The Information Bus", and so all
    users of TIBCO products will find a "Tib::" namespace to be natural
    and reasonable.

    Ultimately, I'd like to end up using:

    Tib::Rv Tib::Rvft Tib::Rvcm Tib::Rvcmq Tib::Rvsd Tib::Hawk

    ... and a Bundle::Tib

The resulting entry would be:

Tib::
