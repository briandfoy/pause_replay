Subject: Module Registration Confusion

I recently took over maintenance of Semi::Semicolons. I wanted to
resolve a bug in rt, but it's not letting me. When I look on pause, the
View Permissions page says the module's registered to me, but if I look
at the Edit Module Metadata page, it says I've got no modules registered
to me.

I find this confusing.  Could it be that half a permission went through? :-)

If we can fix this, I'd be grateful.

thanks.

I expect my version of ESP::Psychic will be ready sometime last week.
More likely, yesterday (you know how schedules tend to slip).
