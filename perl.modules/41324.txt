Hello,

I have uploaded my Class::Class module to CPAN to my homedir (DENYSV) =
without carefull
checking existing modules names ( that was absolutely DUMB from my side =
), so later I found
that Class::Class is an existing module name ( by  BINKLEY ). I renamed =
my module to Class::Frame,
but all files of my Class::Class are still in my homedir on CPAN. Is =
there a way that they can be
removed? I deleted them in my account but it only scheduled them for =
deletion.

I am terribly sorry for all troubles that my foolish actions caused. I =
am first timer here,
should have been more carefull.

Denys Vorobyov
