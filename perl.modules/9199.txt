Hi,

I would like to register for a PAUSE account.

The module I'd like to contribute when it's finished and that I
call C::Type at the moment is a configurable preprocessor/parser
for C code that allows to use C typedefs, structs and enums to
pack and unpack data from within Perl scripts. I use this module
for a debugger I have written in Perl for software running on
different embedded system platforms.

C::Type allows to configure byteorder and struct member alignment
as well as size of integers, pointers and enums. It also supports
packing of structs via #pragma pack(). This is required in order
to support different target platforms. C::Type itself should be
platform independent, I've tested it on HP-UX, Windows and Linux
with both, gcc and icc. The preprocessor is ISO-C99 compliant,
the C parser should parse most ANSI C code.

(I can supply some more info if you're interested.)

I know the User-ID should be 4-9 characters. But I've also seen
a few 3-letter-IDs around. It would be really great if MHX was
possible, because I use it everywhere else.
If MHX is not possible, MARCUS or MHOLLAND will also be ok.

Thanks and kind regards,
