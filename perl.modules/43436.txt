The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Module::Bundled::Files
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Access files bundled with Module
  userid:      PCAMPBELL (Paul Campbell)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    File::Find

  rationale:

    Module::Bundled::Files provides a simple interface to access files
    that are bundled with a module. I did consider simply
    Bundled::Files, but rejected that for fear of confusion with the
    Bundle:: namespace, which is a completely different concept. I
    rejected Module::Files because I thought that suggested the .pm
    files rather than files that were bundled with them.

    Where as File::Find provides a comprehensive method for finding any
    file anywhere on a filesystem, MBF is specialised to finding files
    that belong to a specified module. As such it is able to do so with
    a concise interface.

The resulting entry would be:

Module::Bundled::
::Files           adpOp Access files bundled with Module             PCAMPBELL
