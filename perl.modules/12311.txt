I'd be happy to see the Apache::* modules in section 15 (World Wide Web ...)
moved into a new 'Apache' section (needn't be mod_perl specific, could
include admin modules etc).

I'm not sure how Andreas maintains 00modlist.long.html these days
but there is clearly some 'sub-section' concept already in place
("Apache PerlAuthzHandler modules", "Apache PerlAccessHandler
modules" etc) so it seems very reasonable that PAUSE should allow
users to select which sub-section their module should be listed in.
You could almost call it a bug that it doesn't already support it.

The UI change ought to be as simple as adding the subsections to
the "Module List Chapter" drop-down list (that currently contains
just the 24 existing section names).

Tim.
