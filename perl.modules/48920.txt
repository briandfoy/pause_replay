The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Log4perl
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: An extension to log all DBI SQL activity
  userid:      MJEVANS (Martin J Evans)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    dbi-users@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    DBIx::Log4perl is an extension to DBI (hence the DBIx) which will
    optionally log all SQL, parameters, result-sets, transactions etc to
    a Log::Log4perl handle (hence Log4perl). The standard DBI tracing
    method is verbose even with low trace levels and includes a lot of
    internal DBI information. This extension restricts itself to the the
    what the user of DBI is doing, the SQL he is executing, whether it
    changes any rows etc. It is a good debugging aid for anyone using
    DBI and because it uses Log::Log4perl the logging is built in
    permanently but may be selectively turned on and off without
    changing your Perl DBI code.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Log4perl        ampOp An extension to log all DBI SQL activity     MJEVANS
