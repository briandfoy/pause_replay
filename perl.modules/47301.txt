The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Cdio
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Encapulates CD-ROM reading and control
  userid:      ROCKY (Rocky Bernstein)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    libcdio-help@gnu.org

  similar:
    AudioCD AudioCD::Mac the support libcdio provides is much larger as
    it encompases more than audio CD's and works on more platforms than
    MACs. (That said, the initial release will have major gaps from
    libcdio missing. Not so much because it is impossible to do but
    because there is a lot of material in libcdio and that means a lot
    of work in wrapping functions for Perl.)

  rationale:

    The C library is called libcdio. "lib" had been dropped because
    that's implied. The Device section currently contains AudioCD which
    I guess is the closest thing that is currently available.

  enteredby:   ROCKY (Rocky Bernstein)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb  9 00:15:49 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::Cdio            adpOg Encapulates CD-ROM reading and control       ROCKY
