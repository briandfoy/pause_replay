panel of inquiry to the financial activities of my late husband (formerHead =
of State ) with a decision to freeze all his assets respectively.The =
investigative teams has submitted their report presently some cash and

Fortunately, our family lawyer has recently protected the Personal will of my =

The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the =
assistance of well wishers. In view of this plight therefore, I expected you =

Children and me from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your
sincere and candid effort in this regard with 30% of the fund when finally =

with the Bankers to effect
complete dislodgment of this money within a week of the receipt of your =
response . They have equally guaranteed 100% risk free and smooth transfer. =
