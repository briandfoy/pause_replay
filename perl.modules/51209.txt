I disagree. For an application that has all kinds of specific modules
that are of no general use it is pointless to install them all into the
perl library. Apart from namespace issues, this just clutters the perl
library with no advantage at all.

"CPAN-installable" is currently meaningful for modules only, but not
suited for real life applications. Oh yes, you can install a couple of
scripts in /usr/bin but real life applications need much more than
that. Think local data. Think workspaces. Yes, work is in progress, I
know.

But, most important, end users do not build, they install. The PPM
system for Windows comes close (although it still installs everything
in the perl library, and Windows users prefer a Windows installer
instead) but up to this very moment I still have to see a Build.PL
producing a decent .rpm, .deb, .msi or whatsoever. Yes, work is in
progress, I know.

We have to get rid of the rather narrow-minded view that an
application is just a script plus some standard modules, installable
via "make install" or "./Build install".
