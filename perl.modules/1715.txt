I have just uploaded a File::Temp 0.07 to CPAN. This module 
can open temporary files, returning filehandles and filenames, first
checking for possible security problems. This module came out of a recent
discussion on perl5-porters where a need for such a module was raised (Tom
Christiansen suggested the name File::Temp). Can also be used to create
temporary directories.

CPAN userid = TJENNESS

DSLI entry for this module is:

File::Temp    adpf    Create temporary files safely     TJENNESS

Thanks
