The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nokia::File::NFB
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Manipulate Nokia .nfb/c phone backup files.
  userid:      RPRICE (Robert Price)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace choice came about by following a suggestion by brain d.
    foy. The suggestion was since Palm already has a rootlevel namespace
    for files, Nokia was also suitable. Also suggested was creating a
    File level so future Nokia file format modules will fit neatly into
    this namespace. The module's name corresponds to these suggestions.

    The module should be listed to help other developers working with
    Nokia phones. It provides access into the .nfb file's structure and
    allows for the creation, modification and extraction of data in a
    clean object orientated environment.

  enteredby:   RPRICE (Robert Price)
  enteredon:   Mon Sep 20 15:05:24 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Nokia::File::
::NFB             adpOp Manipulate Nokia .nfb/c phone backup files.  RPRICE
