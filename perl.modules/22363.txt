Dear friend,
Good day to you and please do not be offended by my intrusion into your 
privacy through your receipt of this letter. 

I am Barrister Robert Best,Legal counsel to Mr.Jean PaulGuei,only 
surviving child of late General Robert Guei,former president of 
Coted'Ivoire,a country in the western region of Africa. 

See links/////////

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/930254.stm> 

My client told me to contact you having gotten your contact from the 
internet hoping that you will give us more details about yourself in your 
reply.

My clients late father was estimated to have been worth over 
$50,000,000 USD but all his bank accounts were froozen by Cote d'Ivoire 
government except an account containing $15,450,000 USD saved under my
clients 
name which my client wants to move to your country with your assistance 
for the purpose of safe keeping and investment under your guidance and 
supervision for five years.

My partner is proposing a partnership that will benefit the two parties 
since he needs theassistance of a foreigner to be able to access the 
money in theaccount in a security company here in London.The account has 
been dormantsince it was opened therefore it attracted no attention 
because money was never withdrawn from it unlike the other accounts in 
other countriesoperated under the late General personal name. 

To move the funds to you,a change of ownership will be done in your 
favour.This will make you the new owner and only beneficiary of the money 
to ensure that any withdrawal will not attract attention because you 
are not related to the Guei family nor have you hadany prior dealing with 
them.You will then be given the name of a reputable bank where you will 
open a dollar account in your name.

I will then withdraw the money with a power of attorney from you and 
pay into the account you opened.After this you will contact the bank and  
instruct them to wire transfer the funds into your safe account in your 
country. I will then retrieve all documents used to make the transfer 
and destroy it. 

For your role, you will take 30% of the total money while 5% will be 
used to take care of and pay back all expenses incured by both parties 
during the course of moving the funds including my legal fees which are 
yet to be paid due to the situation of things.

The remaining 65% will be used by my client for his upkeep and 
investment by myclient who wishes to move finally to your country as soon
as 
thetransfer is effected into your account. You will negotiate with him 
later on the percentage you will get for any future assistance rendered 
in investing the funds. 

I guarantee that everything will be legally arrangedto ensure 100% risk 
free transaction. Contact me immediately you receive this letter via my 
alternative email address(WHICH I WILL USE FOR FURTHER 
CORRESPONDENCE):

or via my private secure phone line:44-7092027437. An urgent response 
from you will be highly appreciatedand remember always that you are not 
to discuss this letter or themoney with anyone for my clients sake. 

Yours Sincerely, 

Robert Best
