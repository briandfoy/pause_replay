The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Form::Factory
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A general-purpose form handling API
  userid:      HANENKAMP (Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://github.com/zostay/FormFactory

  similar:
    HTML::FormFu, Jifty::Action

  rationale:

    In my web apps, I've found myself reusing chunks of code that don't
    really belong with the schema and often end up in special utility
    classes or the controller. When I started using Jifty, I found that
    the Jifty action classes were what I was doing badly. I'm using
    Catalyst more than Jifty lately and wanted something similar, but
    even more general. With this API, the goal is to provide
    well-described functors designed for building forms in a web UI, but
    could be used for automatically building command-line interfaces,
    RESTful services, or whatever. Currently only a single basic
    HTML/HTTP renderer/consumer is built, but a CLI one and RESTful one
    will follow soon.
