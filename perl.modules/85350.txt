     why:

    Have developed a couple modules that allow interaction with the
    python based Deluge bittorrent server. One of the modules is a
    simple cross-language wire protocol that might be useful in other
    applications. Thought i'd share and see.

    If "loops" isn't available as an id, "tux68" would be fine.
