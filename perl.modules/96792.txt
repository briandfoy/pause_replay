Request to register new user

fullname: Ashish Gulhati
  userid: HASH
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: https://www.netropolis.org/hash/
     why:

    I already have a PAUSE ID (AGUL) which was I guess generated from
    my name back before this form existed, so I never had a chance to
    choose my own ID.

    I'd really like to change it to HASH, which is a nick I've used
    online for ages. I've searched many times for a way to change it but
    there doesn't seem to be one. Then I read a thread that one could
    request a new ID and move modules over to the new ID, so I'd like to
    do that.

    I've also got some new modules in the works that I'll be uploading
    in the near future, and would prefer to upload them under the HASH
    id.

    Thanks
