Yeah, I mean, he was only talking about doing another CPAN release on Dec 22,
and on irc.perl.org #perl today.

Clearly he's left.

Neil, can you /msg TorgoX next time you spot him online and double check
please? I know you're in #perl as well. Or reply saying you already did
that.

I strongly suspect he'll be entirely in favour of your adopting an old
module of his but I'd like a double check - or if you already did that and
Ron hasn't passed it on quite right, just reply telling me I'm an overly
paranoid idiot and I'll crawl back under my rock :D
