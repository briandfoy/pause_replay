Hi Spencer!

   (disclaimer: I'm not a member of the modules@perl.org cabal, I've just
been temporary recruited to help with the massive amount of email. So
caveat emptor. :-) )

   Uploaded distros should be automagically inspected, and any detected
namespaces updated.  In your case, I think I found out why it didn't
happen: the file GD-3DBarGrapher-0.9.2.tar.gz is indeed a tar'ed file,
but it's not gzip'ed. Try to upload a new version, this time properly
tar'ed and gz'ed. After you do that, you should receive a few emails
from the pause system telling you that the file has been processed, and
what the outcome is. If it still doesn't work, give me back a poke and
I'll look into it in more details.

Joy,
`/anick
