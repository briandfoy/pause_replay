The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sendmail::M4::Mail8_daemon
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: sendmail 8.13 socket server, module
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Sendmail::M4::Mail8 Sendmail::M4::mail8_daemon

  rationale:

    This is the ".pm" module part of mail8_daemon which in turn is just
    a user editable script to configure its actions. Required more than
    ever, as have found it quite impossible to do all the checking
    needed via M4 rules alone, the sendmail sockets interface gives me a
    sensible low cost interface to an external system, ideally this
    daemon would run on the secondary mail server, so that its spam
    detectors could inform the primary e-mail system to block spammers
    who have tried once to often. The last upload was due to having to
    remove a check that would not work, could not be made to work, and
    is essential!

The resulting entry would be:

Sendmail::M4::
::Mail8_daemon    bdpfp sendmail 8.13 socket server, module          CML
