     why:

    I'd like to add a module as Font::TypefaceJS. Here's it's
    description:

    Font::TypefaceJS converts truetype fonts to a format that
    typeface.js can read. typeface.js is a javascript library that uses
    web browsers' vector drawing capability (canvas and VML) to draw
    text in HTML documents. See http://typeface.neocracy.org.

    (In case it matters, I already signed up for an account previously,
    as DAVIDC, but I haven't used that one at all, and I'd rather have
    my ID as DCHESTER. I marked DAVIDC as "okay to remove")
