Hi Brian,

On my PC time + .123456 always leads to a fractional part of .12346.  So
floats are not generally sufficient to hold microseconds.  A new data
representation would have to be used throughout DateTime, only to handle
convertability with this obscure format.  Don't count on me for such
huge task!  Besides, potential implications on the outside API would
have to be thought about.

My class doesn't deal with days (except if you give more than 24 ^H^H^H
10 hours) so microsecond precision is much less of an issue.  There's
just one small hack to treat more than .999_999 as 1.

A good deal of my class also deals with clock functionality, which is
not needed for other formats (as there are more normal clock programs
than you could care for).

best regards
Daniel

Does your module do something that the DateTime version can't? Since
both modules have to deal with the same computer clock and math
operations, can you fix any round-off errors in the DateTime version,
rather than creating a new module?

I think it would be much better to improve the DateTime version instead
of making a new module and creating another development path. :)
