The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Badger
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Perl Application Programming Toolkit
  userid:      ABW (Andy Wardley)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    badger-users@badgerpower.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    Badger is a generic application platform on which I'm building the
    Template Toolkit v3 (and other things). The Badger is the animal
    associated with TT (from the O'Reilly book), hence the name. It's
    also in the same genre as "Moose" (and shares some of its goals) so
    the name seems fitting. It provides a number of foundation classes
    for OO programming. It started out as the successor to Class::Base
    (which was the previous "generic bit ripped out of TT") and grew.
    And grew. Now it does a lot more than just base classes. It's an
    application toolkit.

    It doesn't really fit into any existing category as the modules
    cover a range of functionality: object construction (base classes,
    etc), metaprogramming, file handling, data transcoding, symbol
    exporting, testing, and so on. There are ~40 modules in the Badger
    toolkit as it stands and more to come. I think it warrants a new
    top-level module namespace because a) it doesn't really fit under
    any existing namespace either lexically or conceptually and b)
    badgers are cool.

    OK, so b) wasn't a very good reason. How about c) it already says
    "Badger" 1621 times in the source code and extensive documentation.
    And I drew a nice badger logo for the web site.

    I'd also like to register BadgerX for Badger extension apps, in the
    same vein as other modules: Moose/MooseX, DBI/DBIx, etc. I'm not
    sure if I even need to register that, but I thought I'd mention it
    now that you've got me rambling on a bit.

The resulting entry would be:
