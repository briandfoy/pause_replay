The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bovlam::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Simple bovlam module
  userid:      XYLOS (Andreas Kryger Jensen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The whole concept of "bovlam" has gained a lot of interest lately -
    especially for people of Danish origin. Therefore the need of a perl
    module was high. The idea behind is quite unique, and I therefore
    think that the creation of a new rootlevel namespace is acceptable.
    Looking through the modules registrated under Miscellaneous, I seen
    no namespace where bovlam will fit into. I am also sure, that we in
    the future will se several different approaches on the concept of
    bovlam, and then the root namespace will come in handy. However, if
    you do not share my opinion about this, I am willing to discuss it
    further.

    Best regards, Andreas Kryger Jensen
