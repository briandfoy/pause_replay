Hi Friend,

After yesterday's email, I've heard from a few people who are, shall we say, still pretty darn skeptical about this whole preconstruction thing.

Take this one for example...

A subscriber wrote in to say (I'll paraphrase here), "Yeah, sure...you can make a decent living with preconstruction but you still need a minimum of fifty grand to even make it work."

Now, instead of me arguing...and to keep my blood pressure down...I just took a deep breath, and replied to let him know that what he said just ain't so.

In fact, the deal we talked about in yesterday's email ran me just two and a half grand to secure the unit...keep in mind, folks, we're talking about a unit worth a cool million here.

Eventually, I will have to put down the deposit...but I'll tell you what...

There aren't many investors who'll loan you the deposit, if you're looking at a cool hundred stacks in profit (that's a hundred thousand.) 

Think about it; even if you had to cough up 30 grand, that still leaves you with seventy large without having to do any hard labor.

I'll take that any day, with a smile on my face.

Anyway, to learn more about how this all works, head over to http://www.milliondollarrealestatedeals.com

Thanks,

Lou
