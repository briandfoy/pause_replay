     why:

    I had been searching for some Morse Code libraries to build my own
    personal practice program but found what was available as lacking in
    any useful programatic way. As I built Morse Code routines in C for
    Windoze back in the late 80s and early 90's I decided to roll my own
    and learn something about module building and cpan submission at the
    same time. I now have a module and app ready for the perl universe
    and all those frustrated perl hams out there wanting to build their
    own Morse Code apps.
