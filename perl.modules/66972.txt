Hello monks,
	I am a fairly young developer of perl, and I really love this
	language. One of the libraries I use a lot is SDL. However on
	perl I found that the SDL_perl module on cpan is abandonware.
	On CPAN the status is pretty bad.
	Last Update:04 Oct 2005
	PASS (1)   FAIL (71)   UNKNOWN (98) 
	and not to mention most of the new SDL features are missing.
	I have fixed the build system and pass all the test in t/ on
	linux. Moreover I have also made this code available at:
	http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_perl/tree/master
	
	What I am asking for is access to http://sdl.perl.org/ so that I
	can post update work. And anyhelp I can get. Moreover it would
	be helpful if I can post my version on cpan.
