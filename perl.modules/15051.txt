I think they are trying to establish a general File System API (VFS) 
that can be implmented by multiple VFS modules, akin to DBI.

And that is why VFS is being proposed. Having a top level FileSys.pm 
could happen however. One could also argue with success that we don't 
need a top level name and all that it takes is for these
module to share a generic API :-).

If we are not putting it in VFS:: then I agree that GnomeVFS is a good 
name, it is just the redundency of VFS::GnomeVFS that bothers me.
