Howdy I need a login to Pause.

here's the info you need:

your name: Brian Horakh
your email address: brian@zoovy.com
your homepage if you have one: http://www.digitalco.com/staff/brian=20

your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9 characters =
long, all uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed.
ZOOVY

a description of what you're planning to contribute:
I just spent the better part of a day updating the existing Compress::Bzip2=
 CPAN module to work with the latest version of Bzip 1.0.0, the previous =
module states in the documentation that it is an orphan and is no longer =
tended to by the author. Bzip has been updated since then, and they've =
changed the shared library considerably so its no longer compatible =
(hasn't been since 0.1-pl-a) the old (compatible) version isn't on the =
website since redhat took it over (those bastards).
