Thank you for the offer to help out.  My plan is to keep maintaining the
repo.  The simple fact is that I dropped the ball on those issues.  I
didn't see am email come in when the where created.  I'll create a new
distribution in the next day or two to fix the issues.  I will also create
a github repos so people can help me work on the repo that way.

Eddie
