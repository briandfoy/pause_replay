The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URL::Checkout
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Get one or more files from a remote location
  userid:      JNW (Jürgen Weigert)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    LWP

  rationale:

    this module just grabs, whatever is behind an url. (python has
    urlgrabber). I choose the verb 'checkout' as it is often a checkout
    action that pulls files out of a version control system. It was
    initially called File::Checkout, but this gave no hint that we work
    with URLs. Thus I ended up with URL::Checkout. Maybe
    File::UrlGrabber would be okay to :-)

  enteredby:   JNW (Jürgen Weigert)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug  5 12:56:14 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

URL::
::Checkout        adpOp Get one or more files from a remote location JNW
