Hi everybody,

i'm writing lib for reading and writing from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_area_network for my friend's
application, which gonna be car radio, gps, buttons and other
controller. Basic functionality is already done.

i have a few questions:
	- how to publish my new module:
	- are there any coding standarts?
	- must module be os/platform independent?
	- is needed to be implemented as subclass of IO:Socket?
(IO:Socket:CAN ?)

I'm not perl programmer actualy. And i cannot find any informations
about publishing modules into CPAN.

thank you for any answer, links or tips..

btw sorry for my english

J.Vitek
