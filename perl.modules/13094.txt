hi all...

   I was thinking about releasing Acme::No to CPAN but wanted to make 
sure that it follows the spirit of the Acme:: namespace properly.

   Acme::No can be downloaded from
 
http://www.modperlcookbook.org/~geoff/modules/experimental/Acme-No-0.01.tar.gz

   below is the README.

   thanks

--Geoff


NAME

Acme::No - makes no() work the way I want it to

SYNOPSIS

  use 5.6;            # I use our(), so 5.6 is required
  no  6.0;            # but this was coded for perl 5, not perl 6
                      # and the perl 6 compat layer isn't really 5.6
                      # so my code breaks under 6.0

  use mod_perl 1.27;  # we need at least version 1.27
  no mod_perl 2.0;    # but mod_perl 2.0 is entirely different than 1.0
                      # so keep my cpan email to a minimum


DESCRIPTION

ok, first the appropriate pod:

$ perldoc -f no
   =item no Module VERSION LIST

   =item no Module VERSION

   =item no Module LIST

   =item no Module

   See the L</use> function, which C<no> is the opposite of.


now, one might think that, since

  use mod_perl 1.27;

makes sure that mod_perl is at least version 1.27,

  no mod_perl 1.27;

should mean that 1.27 is too high - the manpage says use() and
no() are opposites, and that looks like opposite behavior to
me.  however...

  $ perl -e 'use mod_perl 2.0'
  mod_perl version 2 required--this is only version 1.2701 at -e line 1.
  BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.

  $ perl -e 'no mod_perl 2.0'
  mod_perl version 2 required--this is only version 1.2701 at -e line 1.
  BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.

so, no() and use() do the exact same thing here - hmmm... looks like a
bug in perl core...

enter Acme::No

Acme::No makes no() work the way I want it to.

FEATURES/BUGS

probably lots
