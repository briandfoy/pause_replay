Subject: LWP::Parallel::UserAgent author unreachable, may I co-maintain?

Hi,

In response to an earlier, similar request, brian d foy made me
co-maintainer of IPC::Shareable in order to apply some patches that
had been in RT for a number of years.  So far it looks like the
version I released (0.61) is at least passing more tests:

http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/I/IPC-Shareable.html#IPC-Shareable-0.61

I would like to do the same for LWP::Parallel::UserAgent if possible.
Mailing the author's address resulted in a bounce (see below), and I
was not able to find him via google search.

I put a patch in RT that lets the module work with more recent
versions of libwww, and verified that it still worked with a version
earlier than the one that introduced the incompatibility:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40261

If possible, I would like to be added as a co-maintainer on that
module so that I can release a new version of this module
incorporating that patch.

My PAUSE id is MSOUTH .

Thanks for your time,

mike
