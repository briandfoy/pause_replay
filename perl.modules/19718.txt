A while ago, I wrote a rather long "intro to perl"
training manual using a word processor. The problem
I kept running into was keeping the code samples
and execution output up to date. I had to resort to 
cut-and-paste approaches to get code samples and 
execution output into the document.

I want to rewrite the training manual, and this
time I want to make it easy on myself. I figured I'd
create a way to have code samples and output
embedded in a document such that the cut and paste
is automated in some way.

And, it would be a nice bonus if people reading the 
document could somehow easily run a code example from 
the document and see what it does.

So, I used POD as a base for the document and will add 
some kind of extension so that code examples, execution 
output, and demonstrations would be supported.

The tarball available on CPAN is an alpha release of
a POD viewer. Once I get all the POD functionality
squared away, I'll add the other functionality.
