You are trying to have both sides of the argument.  You are arguing at one
time against confusion, but here you are advocating more confusion, by
changing the names of established distributions.  Yes, it is a problem that
his distribution and module name don't match.  But many people have come to
know and expect it.  I think the most reasonable solution is to have a
dummy HTML::Tree module in his distribution, thereby unifying the name with
the distribution.
