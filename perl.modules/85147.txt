The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::VersionedMessages
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Handle all aspects of message localization
  userid:      SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Locale::Maketext, Locale::gettext

  rationale:

    When you look at the procedures for maintaining a set of localized
    messages, current localization module suffer from one serious flaw.
    Although they provide all the tools necessary to do initial
    translations and use those translations in your application, they
    provide only minimal support for maintaining a set of messages that
    might change over time.

    If your messages ever change (due to changes in functionality
    perhaps or simply improving the readability of the messages), those
    changes should be reflected in ALL the translations, but looking at
    the messages as they exist in some locale, it is quite difficult to
    determine which messages need to be updated and which are current
    using the tools currently available. I don't see how you can keep a
    set of translations up-to-date without per-message version
    information.

    If you have a set of hundred of messages, and they've been
    translated into multiple languages, and then you modify one of them,
    no tool exists for the translators to look at the message list in
    their language to see which are fine and which are out-of-date.

    This module uses message files which contain per-message version
    information (along with other information which will be useful to
    translators) to aid in maintaining different translations.

    In addition, a GUI tool (using the very widely available perl-Tk)
    which allows you to easily manage translations seeing at a glance
    which messages are out-of-date or missing from a lexicon.

    Initially, I had thought to make this an extension to
    Locale::Maketext, but that module is small enough that by the time I
    made the changes necessary, nothing would have been left of the
    original, so it was easier to start from scratch.

The resulting entry would be:
