Request for Namespace Games::Cryptoquote

Description:

  This module solves character displacement puzzles called cryptoquotes.
  In each letter of a cryptoquote, a letter stands for another letter.
  For example, 'FRA PIF XD FRA LIF' would be 'THE CAT IN THE HAT'.
  These puzzles can commonly be found in newspapers, magazines, and
  entertainment websites (eg: http://www.nypennysaver.com/cryptoquote/ and
  http://www.public.usit.net/jparsly/).

DSLI:

Discussion:

  There has been moderate discussion of this module on the rhizomatic
  and efnet #perl channels. There seems to be some positive interest.

  This is a followup RFN from a previous RFC at
  'http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-01/msg00178.html'.

  Thank you for your time and consideration of this request.
