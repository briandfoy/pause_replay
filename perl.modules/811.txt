I've written an entire GUI mail client (with Tk) in Perl,
called Hermes <http://hermes.freehosting.net/>.

It uses some modules of my own creation that I would like
to contribute to CPAN:

Mail::MsgStore - Easy/powerful mail folders.
PostScript::Columns - Create multicolumn PS.
Sys::UniqueID - Creates a guaranteed unique ID.

My preferred user id is 'FIVE'.

Thanks!
