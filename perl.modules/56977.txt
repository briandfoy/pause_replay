yes, the registration should and will stay, but there are a few things
which might need fixing:

- You registered Perlmenu, but you uploaded the package "perlmenu". (So
should the registration be for perlmenu or should the package be
upper-cased in the sources?)
- The indexer could not index your distribution. Possibly because:
--> It has an uncommon layout / file/directory structure.
--> It doesn't contain a Makefile.PL which is usually part of the
installation procedure.
--> The indexer wasn't as mature in 1997 as it is now.

I think all the details about this can be found in the "perlnewmod"
manual page. It's appreciated if you could find the time to fix this,
but you aren't obliged at all. I'm not sure how I would react to such a
request for a ten-year-old project. So it's really up to you to decide.

Best regards,
Steffen
