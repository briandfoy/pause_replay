Hi - I'm having some issues with my upload: I was able to upload the first
version, 1.3.0, without trouble, however I made an error in uploading that
version and decided I needed to upload a new version. While I have tarballs
of versions 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, both have the same issue as 1.3.0, so I decided
to upload a development version, namely 1.3.2_01. When I uploaded 1.3.0 the
first time I received an email from upload@pause.perl.org, a CPAN upload
report, and an indexer report. This second time, I did not receive the
indexer report and the update does not appear to have been acknowledged. I'm
sure that I haven't already managed to break your system, so either I messed
up packaging the new version, or I'm expecting to see something that I
shouldn't expect to see.

Any insight on this?
