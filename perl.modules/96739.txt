Hi,

I am the current maintainer of MooseX::Attribute::Chained having been
assigned maintainership by the Moritz Onken.

However, I am unathorized to release three modules in this distribution:
https://metacpan.org/release/MooseX-Attribute-Chained

I suspect Moritz forgot to assign me permission.  I have contacted both
him and David McLaughlin, the original maintainer, asking them to
resolve this twice.  I have waited several months.

I hope you don't mind me asking:  would you be able to give me comaint
on these modules?

Thank you,
Tom
