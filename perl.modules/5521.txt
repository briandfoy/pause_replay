No, I just had a look at Crypt::OpenSSL::BN, and as I needed a quick implementation
and it didn't fit my needs at first sight, I just reimplemented it my way :)

The problem is _not_ with IROBERTS, but with OpenSSL itself, as from the OpenSSL
LICENSE file you read :

 * 5. Products derived from this software may not be called "OpenSSL"
 *    nor may "OpenSSL" appear in their names without prior written
 *    permission of the OpenSSL Project.

so if IROBERTS and MADWOLF had permission it's OK, otherwise the name is illegal.

And LibCrypto is really what I meant, as it is the core library implementing
crypto stuff, although libssl really implements SSL/TLS layers...

Sure, of course you're right, as his goal seems quite close to mine ! I will ASAP.

Thanks for your time, Andreas,
