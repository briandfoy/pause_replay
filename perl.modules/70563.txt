Hi.

I've been using Filesys::SmbClient for a while for a couple of projects,
but noticed that it's significantly behind the currently shipping Samba
(libsmbclient.a) API, and indeed is using a deprecated interface.

The last release was about 4 years ago.

I contacted the author about 5 weeks ago, and he said he didn't have a
lot of time to work on it.

I followed up saying I had some fixes, and he said he would try to get
them in (below).

Since then, I've sent a couple more patches, some questions, and links
to a potential new release, but haven't heard back.

I know the "Taking over" section explains to "tread lightly", but one of
the issues I've tried to address is the fact that since Perl 5.6 came
out, the model for IO has completely changed, and that IO::Handle is the
base class that one is encouraged to use.  Part of the maintenance of
this module has been adapting it to take into account the
re-architecting of IO that went on in Perl 5.6.

In doing so, I would bump the version from 3.1 to 4.0 to reflect the
nature of the modified API.

Please advise.

Thanks,

-Philip

I don't know when I can work for CPAN ... but have enough time to apply patch if 
you want contribute to this module.

I might have something to test soon.

I rewrote parts of the .xs and I'm working on SmbClient.pm, I'm also
adding an SmbClient/FileHandle.pm and an SmbClient/DirHandle.pm wrapper.

The semantics of error indication will change significantly, so we'll
need to do a major version bump to 4.0.

Also, the semantics of methods like "write" and "read" have been to
emulate those of the intrinsic functions and IO::Handle.

Trying to decide how to expose the "open" and "new" methods in the
DirHandle module...

I'll keep you posted.

-Philip

I've done a bit of work on it.

Since you don't have time to maintain it, how about making me a co-owner?=


I've got a new version here:

ftp://ftp.redfish-solutions.com/pub/Filesys-SmbClient-3.99_10.tar.gz

I was thinking we would release it at as 4.00.

Thanks,
