	Apparently it does:

cpan> i /Test::CPAN/
Going to read /root/.cpan/sources/modules/03modlist.data.gz
Going to write /root/.cpan/Metadata
Module          Test::CPAN      (C/CR/CRAKRJACK/Test-CPAN-0.002.tar.gz)
Module          Test::CPAN::Fake (C/CR/CRAKRJACK/Test-CPAN-0.002.tar.gz)
2 items found

	Those modules were never approved... yet they're in 03modlist.data.
So what good is the "official" module list then? I was always under the
impression that it acted like a guardian, CPAN wouldn't allow you to
download a module that wasn't registered or wasn't uploaded by a registered
author, and that was supposed to prevent malice or accidents from happening
when somebody uploaded a module that was actually in somebody else's
namespace, or not approved.
