Hmm. May I suggest putting the Acme:: part of the module under Acme::
and the serious part where it belongs? Would it be possible to make the
"pirate-speak" part a subclass which could then live in Acme::Pirate?

I think it would be foolish to put your complete module in Acme:: since
that basically means nobody will ever use it except for fun.

I feel (without the pirate part) it would be appropriate in Locale::* or
Text::* or even constant::*. But if I understand you correctly, the
killer feature here is the localization, so that should somehow be
reflected in the name. As for your suggestions:

- Acme.:Pirate, Text::Pirate
Erm... no. Nobody would use it.
- Text::TLAP
Nobody is going to know what TLAP means by just seeing the name. Not good.
- Text::Define
Better since it gives a nod to the static, compile-time nature of
creating string constants. But I feel the localization support is
missing in the name.

How about Locale::Text::Constant or something similar? (Or
Locale::TextConstant if you prefer two-level namespaces?)

Best regards,
Steffen
