Subject: Module submission sys::MON::Lite

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       sys::MON::Lite
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: light weight system management framework
  userid:      JNBROOKES (Jon Brookes)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    will be supported by wiki at http://jonblog.com

  similar:
    nagios plugins

  rationale:

    'sys::mon::lite' is intended for use:

    * as a framework for managing a system by means of an extendible
    plugin mechanism * to manage single or multiple system checks,
    calculating an overall alert level based on the output of a given
    set of pre-registered plugins * to augment the monitoring
    capabilities of existing monitoring solutions * where use of full
    scale monitoring applications the likes of Nagios, BigBrother etc to
    monitor a systems availability and / or performance may not be
    practical and where a simple, stand alone, Perl based solution will
    suffice

    sys::mon::lite is here expressed as an idea - a simple management
    framework for small systems that can be expanded by the addition of
    plugins

    there is only one, publicly released, plugin:

    sys::MON::Lite::Plugin::HTTP::SimpleMultiSiteCheck

    sys::MON::Lite is very light of a monitoring framework with only
    one plugin

    more are to be added to this in future releases

    more documentation on how to add additional module plugins is
    needed

The resulting entry would be:

sys::MON::
