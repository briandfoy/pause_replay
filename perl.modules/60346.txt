The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       S1
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Class library for miscellaneous purposes
  userid:      FSEITZ (Frank Seitz)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    I want to put my Perl class library (named S1) on CPAN. Because it
    is a closed library with classes for very different purposes (HTML
    generation, database access, image manipulation etc.) which are
    using the same base classes, eg. S1::Object, S1::Hash (which is
    derived from S1::Object) and so on, it is not feasible for me to
    split the library into several modules. The library is documented in
    German, I hope this is not a exclusion criterion.

The resulting entry would be:

S1                adpOp Class library for miscellaneous purposes     FSEITZ
