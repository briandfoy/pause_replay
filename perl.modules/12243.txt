The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Girder::IEvent
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Interface to the Girder Internet Events API
  userid:      GBROCK (Gavin Brock)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Girder is a Win32 automation tool, originally designed to be driven
    by consumer IR remotes. To enable remote control of Windows via
    TCP/IP there is now an 'Internet Events' (IEvents for short) API for
    Girder.

    There already exists Java and C# example code, but no perl - so I
    came up with:

    Win32::Girder::IEvents::Client - Talk to a Girder instance
    Win32::Girder::IEvents::Server - Pretend to be a Girder instance

    I avoided Win32::Girder::xxxxx because that may later be needed for
    a direct Windows level interface.

    For more information about Girder (which really is very cool ;-),
    see http://www.girder.nl/
