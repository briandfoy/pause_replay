Paul, thanks for the bits. In order to upload, I'll have to have perms on
all of the autodie submodules.

Module Admins:
I note that Fatal shows as being owned by P5P because of first-come. Can
you help me with that bit? If Paul is the module owner on this dual life, I
suggest transferring ownership of Fatal to PJF. Looking at the blead tree,
Fatal is located under cpan/autodie
