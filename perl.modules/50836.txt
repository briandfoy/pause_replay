Request to register new user

fullname: Reserved Local Account
  userid: LOCAL
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    In some circumstances, it may be desirable to have a "fake" author
    account that can be used for local purposes with some certainty that
    no future CPAN author will take the name and break code.

    I'm creating this account for this specific use. Much like the Test
    Dummy modules, this author account will exist, but is guarenteed to
    NEVER upload any files, and thus is completely open for arbitrary
    use by some local system without worrying about clases.
