The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OnlineJudge::Progra
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Programming Tasks Grading System
  userid:      ILV (Israel Leiva)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Given that the module is an 'Online Judge', the creation of the
    root namespace 'OnlineJudge' is very descriptive of what the module
    does. And then, of course, the specific name of the module, wich is
    'Progra' (Programming tasks Grading System). Hopefully this will
    encourage to have more and distinct OnlineJudges.

  enteredby:   ILV (Israel Leiva)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr  2 06:00:00 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

OnlineJudge::
::Progra          RdpOp Programming Tasks Grading System             ILV
