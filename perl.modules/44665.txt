Data::JavaScript contains a couple of modules used to dump data to 
JavaScript.

Yours seems much more general... you can compress normal code as well yes?

What you want is probably just JavaScript::Compactor, or perhaps 
JavaScript::Squish to match Perl::Squish :) (or course, I wrote 
Perl::Squish, so I could be biased in that regard)
