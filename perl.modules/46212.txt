There's a perl module called Net::ParseWhois that seems to be orphaned. The 
original author and maintainer has been MIA for over three years now. E-mails 
to the author (Abraham A. Ingersoll) bounce back. The domain name listed in 
the documentation as the official project home does not work (though it does 
still seem to be registered).

The version of the module on CPAN is unusable, due to numerous changes in the 
WHOIS frontier. I've done a lot of updates, fixes and new coding to get all 
the original functionality back as well as adding a bunch of new registrars 
to it.

Now I'm not sure how to go forward with this contribution. I could upload it 
into a new namespace, but that seems like it'd be cluttering things, 
especially since there are already so many different WHOIS perl modules.

Is it possible to "adopt" CPAN module that's been abandoned? Or is there 
some other solution here?
