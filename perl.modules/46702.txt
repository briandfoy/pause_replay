	I know, I managed to upload Test::CPAN without approval, and it
showed up on my search.cpan.org homepage and everything... but can somebody
do "install My::Package" in CPAN.pm if "My::Package" is not on the module
list? I know that CPAN always downloads 03modlist.data.gz; does it use more
than just that to figure out if it can download your module from CPAN?

	Ideally I would like people to be able to install my package (or
more importantly, packages that depend on my package) in the standard way.
Hell, the entire *point* of this module is to simulate downloading your
package from CPAN so you can make sure that it is unpackable, preppable,
testable, etc in the standard way. :)

	Another oddity: I've deleted Test-CPAN from my cpan home directory,
but search.cpan.org is still showing it. Should I expect it to disappear in
the next few days, or does search.cpan.org hold everything in the backpan
forever?

	Thanks,
		Tyler
