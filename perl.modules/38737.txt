The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::PortIO
  DSLIP:       adhfp
  description: Perform direct port I/O from Perl
  userid:      ANDREWHO (Andrew Ho)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Device::ParallelPort

  rationale:

    This module provides Perl access via simple XS glue to port I/O on
    Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD (Windows support via third party DLLs
    would be available in future releases). The top-level Sys::
    namespace seems most appropriate for this level of basic machine
    I/O.

    The module has functional overlap with Device::ParallelPort, but
    the functions aren't parallel port specific. For example, it is
    possible to do serial or joystick port I/O with these functions.
    There is a Linux::Joystick that one might use for the latter, but it
    uses a higher level interface (/dev/joy) instead of direct port I/O.

    I posted a summary of this module to comp.lang.perl.modules and
    received no responses (positive or negative).

  enteredby:   ANDREWHO (Andrew Ho)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar  1 00:23:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::PortIO          adhfp Perform direct port I/O from Perl            ANDREWHO
