The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hash::Search
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Search and return hash keys using regex.
  userid:      XESTIA (Steve Brokenshire)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Newsgroups (comp.lang.perl.modules)

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've chosen the namespace as Hash::Search because the Perl module
    is to do with Hashes and it searches for keys in the hash based on a
    regular expression.

    I feel this module is unique as it searches through the names of
    the keys in a hash and matches them based on a regular expression. A
    quick search on CPAN seems to show that no similar module exists
    with obvious names so I do not know of another module which is
    similar to Hash::Search.

    I believe this module should be included in the module list as this
    would be useful to those who need to search through a hash finding
    keys with specific names or matches with a regular expression.

The resulting entry would be:

Hash::
::Search          adpfp Search and return hash keys using regex.     XESTIA
