Linda,

If you're in contact with the maintainer, they can assign primary
permissions to you.  That is the fastest fix to the situation.

If you are not in contact, there is a procedure to demonstrate
publicly that you've attempted contact and request to take over the
namespace:

http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about#takeover

Show modules@perl.org that you've followed those steps and you'll get
the namespace in a few weeks.

Regards,
David Golden
PAUSE Admin for IDs
