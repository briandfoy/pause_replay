Hi there,

recently I've ran into problems, need assistance.

I've been dependent on the Schedule::Cron::Events module by PKENT,
it seems that during last half of a year all his modules were deleted:
http://search.cpan.org/~pkent/

So I decided to bundle the last version of Schedule::Cron::Events
into my package. And this is what I've got after uploading package
to PAUSE (find below).

Could anyone explain the reason why PKENT's modules are gone
and are his permissions on module names are going to be recalled?


Thanks in advance,


Petya.
