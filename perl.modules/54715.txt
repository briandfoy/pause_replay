Actually, I thought through this matter before, and I've changed my mind.

My current thought is that continuing to use the QDRDBMS name 
further, even temporarily is a fool's errand.

So I now formally drop my QDRDBMS name registration request.

Rather, I will soon submit another name request with the longer-term 
name that I previously thought of.

So the new name I thought of that I want to register is Muldis::DB.

In the worst case scenario that this name doesn't work out, I would 
have to rename again, which is the same as if I stayed with QDRDBMS. 
In the best case scenario, I've just saved myself the trouble of 
doing a rename at all.

I will submit a registration request with that new name shortly (a 
few seconds after this, in fact), which also further rationalizes the 
Muldis::DB name on its own terms.

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
