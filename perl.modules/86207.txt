The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PGObject::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: Minimalist stored proc -> object method map
  userid:      EINHVERFR (Chris Travers)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://prepan.org/module/nXWJ8Y9sBo8, LedgerSMB mailing lists,will
    likely set up a repo somewhere

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    PGObject::Simple began life as a very quick and dirty stored
    procedure to object method mapping system. This is a version which
    has been cleaned up considerably but still is very much in line with
    its minimalist roots.

    While PGObject (the top-level module) is a set of bottom-half
    routines (database-facing), PGObject::Simple, is a minimalist set of
    top-half (developer-facing) routines.

    The module is "simple" in that it provides a flexible, minimalist
    interface, and omits a lot of the type checking of heavier object
    frameworks. PGObject::Simple::Role is under development to create a
    wrapper for this module which will work in Moo environments (where
    the other object framework can give the actual object type
    validations etc).

  enteredon:   Mon May 27 06:55:57 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

PGObject::
::Simple          RdpOb Minimalist stored proc -> object method map  EINHVERFR
