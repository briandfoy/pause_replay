I have built the following module for use at work and wanted to post to PAU=
SE.

NAME
       Logfile::SmartFilter - Perl extension for generating reports
from Secure Computing=E2s SmartFilter logs.

SYNOPSIS
         use Logfile::SmartFilter;

DESCRIPTION
       The Logfile::SmartFilter extension will help you to generate
various reports from Secure Computing's SmartFilter logs.  The package
was customised
       by subclassing the Logfile::Base package by Ulrich Pfeifer.
Please see that module for more information on how to pass logfiles to
this module and
       generate reports.

       This module will parse logfiles in the format used by the Cisco
Cache Engine appliances with SmartFilter installed.

       The following fields are available for reporting:      Records
               Host
               Date
               URL
               Bytes
               Elapsed
               Code_Status
               Method
               RFC931
               Peerstatus_Peerhost
               Type
               SmartFilter_Category

HISTORY
       0.01    Original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options

                 -A
                       -B

                       -X
                       -n
                       Logfile::SmartFilter
                       -v
                       0.01
                       --skip-exporter
