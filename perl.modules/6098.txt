Hello,

I'm working on a module that can import both BIND 8 nameserver configuration
and zone files into an SQL database.  It also provides methods to pull the
data out of the database, enabling a script to do useful things with said
data.  I would like to use the name 'Net::DNSDatabase' for this module, but
I am not sure that this is a good name for such a module.

I've also been working on a module that will allow sorting on IP addresses
and also on fully-qualified, as well as canonical, domain names.  I would
like to use the name 'Sort::Hostname" for this module.

I am not yet listed in PAUSE, but I would like to be.  My name is Brian
Knight, and my email address is <tforce@concentric.net>.  I would like the
user ID of 'BKNIGHT'.

Thank you.
./btk
