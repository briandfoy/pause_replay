modules -

I was registered as an author some time ago, as GLENNWOOD, but I've 
forgotten my password. I've also changed email addresses several times 
(worked for three different company while staying in the same cube, of 
course!) and suddenly find myself with lots of time on my hands. Quite 
coincidentally, I no longer receive email at glenn@savesmart.com

Can I get my password reset and/or sent to me at this address? Recently 
I've been working with Martin Thurn on some search engines 
(WWW::Search::Jobs...), and now Ed Peschko has stumbled across my humble 
offerings. I'd like to access PAUSE so I can better support these developments.

Thank you!
