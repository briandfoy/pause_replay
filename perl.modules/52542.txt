As far as we (Ovid and I) can gather James Freeman has left Perl  
world. As mentioned below I've produced a new release of CGI::Simple  
that fixes the outstanding mod_perl 2 problem and will work through  
the other outstanding bugs over the next few days. I'm happy to  
become maintainer for this module.

Would it be possible to fix the permissions for CGI::Simple so the  
new release gets indexed?

Currently I get:

      module: CGI::Simple
     version: 0.078
     in file: CGI-Simple-0.078/lib/CGI/Simple.pm
      status: Not indexed because permissions missing. Visit PAUSE and
              click "View Permissions" to find the legitimate
              maintainer(s).
