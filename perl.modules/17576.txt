The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::ContactForm
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Generates web contact forms
  userid:      GUNNAR (Gunnar Hjalmarsson)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    c.i.w.authoring.cgi, c.l.p.modules

  similar:
    CGI::FormBuilder

  rationale:

    The module should only be loaded from a CGI script, so the name
    CGI::ContactForm makes sense IMO.

    CGI::FormBuilder is a general module for generating forms. I think
    it's possible to do *about* the same thing with CGI::FormBuilder as
    CGI::ContactForm does, provided that you pass quite a few arguments
    to it.

    The characteristics of CGI::ContactForm, that I believe justifies
    its listing, are:

    - Since it only does one thing, i.e. generates web contact forms,
    it's *extremely* easy to use, especially if you make use of the
    style sheet, that is included in the distribution, as a starting
    point.

    - Possible failure messages goes to the recipient, so if the
    submitter enters an invalid address, you know that it's pointless to
    post a reply to that address.

    - It produces format=flowed messages in accordance with RFC 2646.

    - It generates code that validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
