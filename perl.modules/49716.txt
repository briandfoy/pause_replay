The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::TCB
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Barycentric Coordinate Time
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Barycentric Coordinate Time (TCB) is a coordinate time scale
    representing time in the Sol system. Specifically, it is the proper
    time experienced by a distant clock comoving with the barycentre of
    the Sol system.

    This module is intended to parallel Time::TCG (for Geocentric
    Coordinate Time) and Time::TT (for Terrestrial Time), to complete
    the trio of relativistic timescales in current astronomical use.
    There's less for it to do, though, because TCB is not currently
    realised by atomic clocks as TCG and TT are.

    As with the various modules that I submitted last month concerned
    with precision time scales, I don't think that the DateTime list is
    the right place to discuss this module. I'm open to suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::TCB             Rdpfp Barycentric Coordinate Time                  ZEFRAM
