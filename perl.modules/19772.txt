AUTRIJUS comments:
OurNet::FuzzyIndex implements a simple consecutive-letter indexing mechanism
specifically designed for multi-byte encoding maps, e.g. big-5 or utf8.
It is designed to both work with other OurNet::* components and as a stand-alone
search engine.

It uses DB_File to create an associative mapping from each character to its
consecutive one, utilizing DB_BTREE's duplicate key feature to speed up the
query time. Its scoring algorithm is also geared to reduce redundant word's
impact on the query's result.
