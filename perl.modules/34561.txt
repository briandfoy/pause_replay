The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::BinPack
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: efficiently pack items into bins
  userid:      CBTILDEN (Carey Tilden)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Algorithm::Bucketizer

  rationale:

    Similar to Algorithm::Bucketizer, but using a different algorithm.
    I couldn't see a clean way to add this algorithm to
    Algorithm::Bucketizer, and figured it could use a name that's more
    well-known (searching for variations on "bin packing" finds more
    relevant results than variations on "bucketizer").

  enteredby:   CBTILDEN (Carey Tilden)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep  7 01:00:13 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::BinPack         bdpOd efficiently pack items into bins             CBTILDEN
