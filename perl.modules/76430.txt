The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::VSM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A pure-Perl implementation of VSM and LSA
  userid:      AVIKAK (Avinash Kak)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    VSM and LSA models have been around for a long time in the
    Information Retrieval (IR) community. More recently such models have
    been shown to be effective in retrieving files/documents from
    software libraries. For an account of this research that was
    presented by Shivani Rao and the author of this module at the 2011
    Mining Software Repositories conference, see
    L<http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1985451>.

    The module provides full functionality for constructing the VSM and
    LSA models of software libraries and for using such models for the
    retrieval of files in response to search words.

    The module also has the ability to carry out precision vs. recall
    analysis and for the measurement of retrieval accuracy for a given
    corpus.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::VSM             bdpOp A pure-Perl implementation of VSM and LSA    AVIKAK
