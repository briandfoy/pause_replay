Steffen:  Thats interesting!  I had heard reports that PDL::NetCDF was not 
installable from the CPAN shell and the lack of a .pm file with 
'package PDL::NetCDF' must be why.

I could add a dummy .pm file to the package which gets overwritten when 
the module is built?  Maybe that would help your indexer.
