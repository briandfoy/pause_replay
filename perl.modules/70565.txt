I hadn't seen it before, probably because it's not very clear from the docs how 
one would go about using it to generate the WSDL.  If I went that route I'd end 
up having to write some sort of wrapper object that simplified the process so 
that the rest of the developers here (which range from very green to senior, 
plus a few wizards) wouldn't have so much to learn before they could produce 
working WSDLs.

In effect, I'd probably end up with something that looked a lot like Pod::WSDL 
before it was all said and done.  The idea of getting the Pod to basically pull 
double duty for documenting the source and creating the WSDL is pretty 
appealing.  Perhaps the ideal solution is to have POD::WSDL use XML::Compile 
under the hood in some future version...

What would you suggest?  Not take the generation from POD approach at all? 
Write a 'works similar to' module with a different name?
