Hello,

I've written an interface for a commercial credit card payment server
sold by a company called Ingenico (http://www.ingenico.com.au). 

[Ingenico are a world-wide organisation (well, Australia and Europe at
least, that I know of), their software may be in use in other
counntries. However, I believe their OCV product is specific to
Australia.]

With respect to the CPAN heirarchy, I believe it fits best under the
Business tree. It is similar in purpose to Business::Cashcow.

My module could be a 'driver' for Business::OnlinePayment. Future work
would be to provide an ::OnlinePayment interface / make OCV a subclass
thereof, however at this time it is a standalone module.

So, I'd like to register the module as Business::OCV. (It's already been
uploaded to via PAUSE).

Regards,
