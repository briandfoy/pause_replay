I think you might find that (1) is handled by prepan.org, (2) might be well
handled by questhub.io, and (3) ... I dunno how we'd do that, questhub might
be one place. Certainly, nobody's going to use the registered modules
information to produce such a list due to its mostly-obsolescence.

I like InteractivePerlTutorial and I think I'd argue that anybody wants
a GUI tutorial is probably going to use tab completion ... or make some
sort of UI shortcut for it :)
