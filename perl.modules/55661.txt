Sorry to hear that... ;-)

I gave the name quite some thought, and put it up
for discussion a number of places (here, perlmonks,
newsgroup). I have not heard a better suggestion
yet, and I could not come up with a name that was 
both more descriptive, and still be specific.

Let me restate my rationale for the current name:

1) I wanted something more specific and tangible
than "FormattedReport" or some such. A non-specific
name benefits nobody.

2) The name points to the source of the idea for this 
module: corporate metrics dashboards. What 
managers want to see are the key metrics of the 
business (sales, orders, what-have-you), with 
outliers highlighted to make it easy to see which 
metrics are "in the green" and which are "in the red".
This module allows you to do just that. (And more.)

3) I have not come up with, nor heard a better 
suggestion for the name of this module...

Best,

		Ph.
