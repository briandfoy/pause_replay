      <h3 align="center">How would you like 20 New Customers A Day For Only $80?</h3>
      <p>How is this possible? <a href="http://www.emailbuy.com/market01.htm">Email Marketing</a>.</p>
      <p>Does it work? Of course it does. Why do you think so many businesses 
        use it? If it didn't work, it wouldn't be used so often.</p>
      <p>Is it legal? Yes, advertising is legal even on the web.</p>
      <p>What do I need? <a href="http://www.emailbuy.com/market01.htm">Our list</a> 
        of over 3 million premium verified addresses and a normal dial up account.</p>
      <p>How well does it work? A common $20 a month dial up account can send 
        out tens of thousands of emails per day. A typical response rate is 1 
        out of a thousand. That means 10, 20, or even 30 new customers a day with 
        our list and a dial up account.</p>
      <p>Why this email list? We offer over 3 million of the freshest email addresses 
        on the web. Each of these email addresses has been verified active and 
        deliverable with the last 90 days. Our high quality minimizes the number 
        of undeliverable messages that get bounced back to you and the number 
        of complaints that you get.</p>
      <p>Are you ready for your new customers? <a href="http://www.emailbuy.com/market01.htm">Order</a> 
        our list by January 10th and get 2 bonus gifts. Our stealth email sending 
        software, &quot;The Email Connection&quot;, and our how to guide on &quot;How 
        To Succeed At Email Marketing&quot;.</p>
