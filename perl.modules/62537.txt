Have you been in touch with irc.perl.org #moose and/or the moose@perl.rg
mailing list about this yet?

I can't see off the top of my head what advantage starting a complete new
module has, and if there -is- reasons the two should be separate then I'm
sure the MooseX::Workers author would be happy to factor out whatever code
-can- be shared.

Plus if you contact the list the Moose community can arrange for repository
space and design advice etc., which we very strongly prefer to do in order
to keep the MooseX:: space as high quality as possible.
