perlmodlib says:

  If developing modules for private internal or project specific use,
  that will never be released to the public, then you should ensure that
  their names will not clash with any future public module.  You can do
  this either by using the reserved Local::* category or by using a
  category name that includes an underscore like Foo_Corp::*.

That implies that modules on Cpan should never have a name with an
underscore in their top-level.
