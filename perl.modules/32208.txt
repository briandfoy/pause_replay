The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32API::File::Time
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Change dates of Windows open files
  userid:      WYANT (Tom Wyant)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    ActiveState's Perl-Win32-Users

  similar:
    Win32::FileTime

  rationale:

    This module was written because of a need to change the
    modification date of an open file under Windows. The utime built-in
    will not do this. The inline comments in win32_utime indicate a
    desire to have utime be unable to change the dates on read-only
    files, and the inability to change the date on an open file (even
    one open read-only) appears to be a consequence of this.

    I have found no other modules to change Windows file dates.
    Win32::FileTime provides read-only access to the dates (via
    Win32::API), but won't change them. The utime built-in will, but
    with the restrictions mentioned above.

    The proposed Win32API::File::Time module provides greater access to
    modification and access time than any module I have found, and is
    the only module that provides the ability to change the creation
    time.

    The top-level name (Win32API) was chosen because this module is
    based on Win32::API. The rest was pretty well inevitable. I suppose
    Win32API::File::Date was a possibility, but "Time" is consistent
    with the underlying system API.

    I have checked the module name list archive and found no proposals
    for similar modules. A posting to ActiveState's Perl-Win32-Users
    mailing list also came up dry.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32API::File::
::Time            adpfp Change dates of Windows open files           WYANT
