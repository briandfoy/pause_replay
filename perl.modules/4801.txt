a description of what you're planning to contribute: Initially I want to
contribute demime, a script that is currently in fairly wide use that
removes mime from e-mail, converting to plain text.  See
http://scifi.squawk.com/demime.html
Runs on Unix only at this point, depends on several other perl modules, see
web page for dependencies.  Useful for (for example) front ending
submission addresses for majordomo to filter mime attachments and
alternative html sections from mailing lists. Also useful for indiviuals
who want to remove incoming mime from mailing lists that do not control
mime submissions.

Some of the mlms will now do mime removal, but if you are running majordomo
or mailman, this tool allows you to quickly add mime stripping.

[It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have
discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was
at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for submissions, but
we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality control. If your work
has never been discussed publicly, then it's extremely difficult for us to
make our judgement whether to accept the submission or not. ]

This tool has been discussed on the list-managers@greatcircle.com mailing
list  It also has its own discussion list, demime-l@scifi.squawk.com (see
http://majodomo.squawk.com for archives).

I know of no other stand alone tool that will collapse mime mail to plain
text and either remail it or filter it to another program or programs.
I've been using it since August, 1998 and have had a couple of users for
that long.  Repackaging it into standard CPAN format and changing one
default will be the only changes made to convert to 1.00.   I'm unsure
about how many users I have. I searched for a tool like this extensively
and coud not find one. Integration into CPAN installation format would
allow for automatic installation of dependencies and would make it easier
on users.
