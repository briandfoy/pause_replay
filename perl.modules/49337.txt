The autoresponder was a mistake in my filter.  I have been trying
to change the email that PAUSE uses to no avail - the one that
it has been using is shockingly overwhelmed with SPAM due to CPAN's
inability to obfuscate email addresses that it puts on the website.

I do apologize - I should have made sure that this situation would
not have happened, and I do appreciate your answer.  Thank you for
following up on it.  I'll look into the packages you mention.

Dave
