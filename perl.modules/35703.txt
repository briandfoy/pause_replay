The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::PSYC
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Protocol for SYncronous Conferencing
  userid:      AGOE (Arne Gödeke)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    psyc://ve.symlynx.com/@psyc, irc://ve.symlynx.com/#psyc

  similar:
    Net::Jabber

  rationale:

    Net::PSYC is the official perl implementation of PSYC which is
    basically a conferencing protocol. However it is flexible enough to
    be used for other needs beyond chatting, such as filesharing which
    is actually done. PSYC has some similarities to jabber but PSYC is
    capable of distributing messages to a group in an efficient manner
    and supports binary data.

    A full server implementation of PSYC including support for several
    other chat-protocols (jabber, irc, telnet-interface) can be found at
    http://muve.pages.de.

  enteredby:   AGOE (Arne Gödeke)
  enteredon:   Sun Oct 17 10:04:58 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::PSYC            bdphp Protocol for SYncronous Conferencing         AGOE
