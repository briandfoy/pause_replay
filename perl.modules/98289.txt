Hello Chris and everybody,

I=E2=80=99m following up on the discussion about Net::SAML2:
https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2017/02/msg97043.html
https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2017/03/msg97128.html

I=E2=80=99m interested in pushing updates and contributions to it as =
well, as the lack of a working CPAN module for SAML2 is a blocker for =
the community. I=E2=80=99m adding my name to the list of volunteers for =
(co)maintainership. My fork is at =
https://github.com/alexrj/perl-Net-SAML2 and I=E2=80=99m AAR on CPAN.

In the above message, Chris said he was going to check with his company. =
However, the code is already released under the Perl licenses, so =
there=E2=80=99s nothing the company can block; we could even rename it =
to Net::SAML2new module or whatever and continue on that. I=E2=80=99m =
not sure a company can claim ownership over a CPAN namespace on PAUSE. =
It=E2=80=99s not copyright matter, and AFAIK there=E2=80=99s no PAUSE =
policy about that. My suggestion to Chris and the PAUSE admins is to =
consider Chris himself technically unresponsive (I know he is =
responsive, but he=E2=80=99s not able to take actions because of his =
employer :)) and proceed with opening maintainership to other people.

Please don=E2=80=99t get me wrong - I don=E2=80=99t really want to sound =
rude. I totally appreciate the work Chris did on Net::SAML2 (without him =
we wouldn=E2=80=99t even have it!). I=E2=80=99m suggesting a potential =
approach for *him* to escape the current restrictions, and let the =
community work collaboratively on maintaining an important module.

Cheers,

- Alessandro
