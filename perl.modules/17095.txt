Randal --

Thanks for taking the time to check it out (and, sorry I didn't get it
right the first time). I see now where the problem was. The older
code was using the CVS revision number as the VERSION, so
the problem was deeper than just 0.009. Versions back to 0.005
have the same situation.

Therefore, I've upgraded the Perl Shell to the nicely inflated
version number of 1.7. Hopefully that will gloss over things
sufficiently. I did test my system by doing an r /Psh/ under cpan,
and it was satisfied that I am up to date.

Version 1.7 is on its way to CPAN as we speak. As before, let
me know if this doesn't make the problem go away for you...


Regards,

-- Gregor

No, that's still broken.

After installing 1.1, this is what it now complains:

    cpan> r /Psh/

    Package namespace         installed    latest  in CPAN file
    Psh                             1.1      1.67 
G/GR/GREGOR/psh-0.009.tar.gz

This says that even though I have Psh -- version 1.1, installed, I can
get a Psh version 1.67 by installingn psh-0.009.

Either remove psh-0.009 from the CPAN, or create a Psh module larger than 
1.67 in a new release of Psh.
