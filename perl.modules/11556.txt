Dear Sir or Madam,

I sent a user registration request early this month and received the 
following email as well as noticed this response message.
http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg11468.html

However, I've yet to receive a password or follow-up email regarding the 
account.  I've entered the user-id into the forgot password form on pause 
and haven't received any emails thus far.  Is there by any chance a problem 
with the queue on the mail server or could further messages be coming from 
a mail server listed on an RBL or unresolved IP to domain (thus my mail 
server rejecting the messages I'm expecting to receive from pause).

I would appreciate any assistance in obtaining the password for the account 
and isolating if any problems do exist in me obtaining future 
mailings.  Thanks for your time.

Regards,

Ralph Padron
