Hmm.. now I see it myself.. (that's why I sent everything to the
modulelist ;)

I think Devel would be another total misnomer :( Where would you put RPM
into? I guess RPM is certainly more an archiver than a devel tool.

The problem with that module is that, at the moment, it is just some kind
of installation manager: you can install a new version of a program,
test it, and then revert the installation completely (unfortunately you
need glibc-2.1 at the moment, although it worked with almost any elf
system _except_ glibc2.1 some time ago. Given more bug-reports this would
certainly be fixed ;)

It might be that, in the distant future, it would become something like
ltrace (library call tracer), which might justify a rename, but it is very
far from that.

Just to clarify, you do:

# cd ~/sources/gimp
# appman -v install gimp make install
(test, uh-oh it's borken, restore the older version)
# appman -v swap gimp
(get rid of that broken new gimp)
# appman delete gimp

I am not entirely happy with File:: as well, but it might be better (at
the moment) than App:: indeed.
