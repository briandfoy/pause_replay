As a first-timer to contribution to CPAN I'm proposing the above user ID &
have a templating module which I'd like to add. The module is primarily
intended as an HTML processor but I've had other uses for it as an email
message processor. The module has been in private and commercial use for
nearly a year now and I feel is ready for public use & scrutiny. It goes up
against several other worthy contenders but, I believe, qualifies as a
'middle ground' contender - Its not as heavy duty as Template::Toolkit &
Html::Mason but is simple to apply and offers some functionality over some
of the lighter weights.

Module synopsis:
Name Template::Termite
Goal: Removal of output content from perl scripts
Useage: Primarily HTML templates
Functionality:
    OO interface
    Loops (nested recursively)
        Loop If/else
        Loop Optional content
    If / Else clauses
    Optional content
    Variable substitution
    External file inclusions
    Debgging
    Error handling
    Extensive POD

I really look forward to contributing to CPAN.

Regards,
Paul Schnell
