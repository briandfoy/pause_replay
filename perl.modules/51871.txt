Aha - ok. I was humbly trying to fit into an existing category rather than 
propose a root level :-). I'd be very happy to use ProgressMonitor; by 
itself of course.

I (over-eagerly :-) filed a request for Misc::ProgressMonitor last night - 
should I file a new request or could you just change the existing request 
for me?

Thank you,
