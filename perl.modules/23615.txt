			The new e-stop or mushroom head push button switches from ASI are now available in a wide variety of 
			configurations. They include momentary 40mm, momentary 60mm, maintained pull to release, maintained twist 
			to release, and maintained twist key to release.  A key feature is the simple to install modular construction 
			with rear of panel locking screws on the mounting adapter. Up to 6 auxiliary contacts can be mounted to the 
			operator, all of which feature wiring connections that can be made even after the switch is assembled. 
			Information on these high quality emergency stop switches along with our complete line of push buttons, pilot 
			devices and joy switches can be found at 
			<a href="http://www.asi-interconnect.com/products_and_solutions/push_buttons/">www.asi-ez.com</a>.
