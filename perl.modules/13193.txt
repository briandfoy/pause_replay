Hi there,

I'd like to register with PAUSE so that I can start to contribute scripts to CPAN

My real life name         : Neil Lombardo
My email address          : nlombardo@rosbif.org
My homepage               : www.rosbif.org 
preferred user-ID on CPAN : LOMBARDO

I'd like to contribute a statistics script for newsgroups as a starter and as I
get more confident, other scripts in general.

Can this be done?

TIA,

Neil
