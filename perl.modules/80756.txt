Subject: Module submission Math::Prime::Util

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Prime::Util
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: Prime related utilities, including sieves
  userid:      DANAJ (Dana Jacobsen)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    IRC, github

  similar:
    Math::Prime::XS Math::Prime::FastSieve Math::Primality
    Data::BitStream::XS

  rationale:

    There are a number of prime related utilities that are not offered
    by existing modules, and I believe a new module is a good place for
    them. Things like prime_count (exact, approx, upper bound, lower
    bound), nth_prime (same), Li(n), R(n), primegap utilities,
    factoring, etc. Initially I planned on supporting native Perl data
    types (32-bit, 64-bit), but BigInt / GMP may be added later.

    I also have faster sieving methods in Data::BitStream::XS that will
    move here, as well as more planned. Some of these can be extended to
    Math::Prime::FastSieve.

    Math::Primality is only partially related. It isn't very complete,
    and some of the code is extremely inefficient. It also is targeting
    GMP, as compared to using native types.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Prime::
::Util            bdhOp Prime related utilities, including sieves    DANAJ
