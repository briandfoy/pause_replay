The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::SymbolicX::Inline
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Inlined Math::Symbolic functions
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Symbolic Inline Math::Symbolic::Compiler
    Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler

  rationale:

    Note that the "Modules with similar functionality" are only related
    and don't provide the same functionality.

    This module allows the user to include Math::Symbolic trees inlined
    in his or her Perl code. The algebraic expressions are automatically
    compiled to Perl code. They can use sub-expressions, derivatives, as
    well as call external Perl subroutines.

    The reason for me not to put it in the Inline:: hierarchy was that
    it's really an extension of the Math::Symbolic module. The
    Math::SymbolicX:: hierarchy is intended for modules that extend
    Math::Symbolic but don't fit in the narrow scope of
    Math::Symbolic::Custom. (I.e. which don't add additional methods to
    the M::S objects.)

    Whether or not this would be more appropriate in the Inline::
    hierarchy is probably arguable.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::SymbolicX::
::Inline          Rdpfp Inlined Math::Symbolic functions             SMUELLER
