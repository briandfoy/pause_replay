This size should not be a problem.

Distribution via CPAN (the network) would work in any case.

I'm pretty sure (but only Graham knows exactly), that search.cpan.org
will display it in any case.

But the indexer on PAUSE should NOT index a binary distribution of
perl. It indexes modules, not binary perl distributions. In fact, it
would lead to major complaints from users when the CPAN indexer
suggested them to download a new perl. Much more would be people upset
if they got a binary distribution then.

To communicate the existance of a new vanillaPerl distro to your
users, you/we would have to invent a new mechanism. Maybe the bundle
mechanism or a module that acts as a proxy via dependencies could
achieve something, I have no clear picture what *should* be achieved.

You would help the PAUSE indexer to recognize this file as a binary
distribution by including the string "-bin-" in the filename. Such
distros are skipped without the risk that something get indexed
erroneously.
