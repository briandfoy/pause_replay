 Yah, it's the crux. WWW::ShopBot can be regarded just as a higher application of WWW::ContentRetrieval. As to shops, users need to provide descriptions for various online shops.
 You can say the module is somewhat nonsense because users have to handle lots of verbose detail. Shop information is changing, so WWW::ShopBot cannot give users any static stuff. Everything has to be built from scratch according to users' needs.
 Another possible way to handle this problem is build a comprehensive site description website, something like that. Programmers all over the globe can upload descriptions to the site, and download them to do price comparison. That's it.

 Any suggestion is welcome.
