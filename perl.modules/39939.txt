Subject: Module submission WWW::Postini

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Postini
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interact with Postini mail filtering service
  userid:      PGUZIS (Peter Guzis)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The WWW namespace seems to be a natural fit, as this is a screen
    scraping module. It does not (at this point) make use of any
    specialized module like WWW::Mechanize so I have not opted for a
    more nested namespace.

    The Postini mail filtering service (www.postini.com) allows
    organizations to block file attachments by extension, but offers no
    way to notify either administrators or users that a quarantine has
    taken place. This module exists to address a need myself and others
    have for exactly that functionality.

  enteredby:   PGUZIS (Peter Guzis)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 26 17:28:44 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Postini         adpOp Interact with Postini mail filtering service PGUZIS
