Yeah, more or less.  I don't control the indexers, though, so of  
course they can do whatever they want.  And of course each indexer  
can have a different purpose from the others, so there's no one-size- 
fits-all declaration for them.

For instance, PAUSE indexes are intended for the use case I  
mentioned: if you want to get Foo::Bar, install version X of  
distribution Foo.  But search.cpan.org probably wants to be more  
liberal, so that if you want to find all places where a Foo::Bar  
module is created in CPAN, it'll show it to you (subject to whatever  
Graham finds prudent).

I think the META spec shouldn't add that kind of language, actually,  
because as I mentioned above, various consumers of the metadata can  
be doing very different things with it.  I think the spec needs to be  
more explicit about what it *means* to put a certain value in a  
certain field, though, so that consumers of META.yml can understand  
exactly what the author is asserting about their distribution in it.   
I agree that at the moment those consumers only have a vague idea  
about what "no_index" and "provides" really mean.
