The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GPIB
  DSLIP:       SdpOp
  description: GPIB test equipment control with Perl
  userid:      JEFFMOCK (Jeff Mock)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.mock.com/gpib

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This is a niche module for hardware guys that want to control test
    equipment through a GPIB interface (the big igly connector on the
    back of almost all test equipment).

    The module is pretty mature, I would like to make it available on
    CPAN and "GPIB" seems to be the best name space for it.

The resulting entry would be:

GPIB              SdpOp GPIB test equipment control with Perl        JEFFMOCK
