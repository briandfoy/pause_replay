Thanks for adding my xslt-parser!

However, I have changed several things meanwhile. First of all I continued
my sequence of distribution files as XML-XSLT-${VERSION}.tar.gz instead of
xslt-parser-${VERSION}.tar.gz, the link from the modules-list directs to
the latter one however. Because I have uploaded two newer version as
XML-XSLT-... these are not visible (at least, I presume the module-list
points to the newest one, most of the time)

Moreover, the backentrance which allows me to add files etc. (very
useful page!!) still tells me I have no module registered! :(

Is this something that just takes time? On internal discussion, or time on
replying all the emails you recieve?


I'm waiting in anticipation of your reply,
Geert
