Oh my, what an ugly whitespace in that sentence.

You lost the first-come again around 2019-11-10T21:17:03, as the commit
f9c6165578e11f4258c825482e03ebc4d97ab23b shows. URL:
https://github.com/batchpause/PAUSE-git/commit/f9c6165578e11f4258c825482e03=
ebc4d97ab23b

PDL-LinearAlgebra-0.13.tar.gz was uploaded 2019-11-10T21:12:20, so I
suspect this lossage happened during this upload.

This smells like a bug or two. For immediate relief I reestablished your
first-come on the three namespaces and scheduled a reindexing run.

Hope this works out, Regards
