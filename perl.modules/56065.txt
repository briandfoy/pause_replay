Mats Kindahl registered the namespace with modules@perl.org at some
point, but never uploaded a module with that name. Somebody else,
however, uploaded a Math::Interpolate in the late nineties. I suppose
the registration predates that.

Thus, the actual existing "Math::Interpolate" is flagged as an
"unauthorized release" on search.cpan.org (see
http://search.cpan.org/~bzajac/Math-Interpolate-1.05/). It is not
indexed by the PAUSE indexer and thus won't be installable from the CPAN
shell via the normal "i Foo::Bar" command without specifying the author
PAUSE id.

Most likely, the registration on Math::Interpolate for MATKIN should be
revoked since he never uploaded the module.

There are various such registered-but-never-uploaded namespaces. I have
suggested creating a time out of a year or so for registrations, but
haven't received any comments from the fellow PAUSE admins.

Now, I just wrote a little script to check how common this actually is.
Based on the PAUSE indices and the module list, it tells me that there
are 736 registered namespaces for which there has never been an upload*.
This does *not* include cases like the above where somebody else
uploaded under the registered name. That's because in order to do this
right, you would need to check with the uploader's PAUSE permissions.
They might be co-maintainers. Andreas is the only one who could do that,
I guess.

Even if we deduct, say, 200 which where registered "recently" or where
dev-releases exist, then we still have a lot of possibly prime
namespaces which are in the module list but lack any implementation.

If we're not going to let registrations time out as suggested, how about
purging any unused registrations which are older than two years just
once? Andreas?

Best regards,
Steffen
