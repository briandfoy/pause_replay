Dear PAUSE Admins,

Allen (cc'd) would like to add me (CJFIELDS) as the co-maintainer for SVG::=
Graph.  Unfortunately Allen (as evidenced below in our previous conversatio=
n on this) doesn't have his PAUSE login credentials.

chris

P.S. I uploaded a test version, now on CPAN, but as expected it's showing u=
p as unauthorized.

Faster to email them and CC me for approval, I don't know my login credenti=
als.

Thanks.

Allen,

Looks like the name is registered in PAUSE to you (I think it is automatica=
lly done).  Not sure if you can log into PAUSE and add me in; if not I can =
email the PAUSE admins and cc you so they know to make me co-maintainer.

Here's the link, BTW, to the one I uploaded:

   Allen,

   Do you want to add me as co-maint on PAUSE, or shoudl I just forward
   this to the CPAN admins?

   In the meantime, I may just check the latest code into my github
   account and work on it. most fixes are to deal with warnings popping
   up with newer versions of perl, but it might be nice to close out a
   few of the RT bugs.

   You can take it, if you like, or you can remove the dependencies
   from Bioperl. I think the code that depends on it is not really used.

       Allen,

       Are you still maintaining SVG::Graph? I could help co-maintain
       if needed. There are a few small issues that have popped up
       lately with BioPerl's use of SVG::Graph (mainly warnings) that I
       could work on, and I noticed the bugs on the RT queue haven't
       been touched in a while.

       Thanks!
