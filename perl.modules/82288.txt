The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shatterproof
  DSLIP:       cdpfg
  description: Bioinformatics- Sequencing Analysis Tool
  userid:      SGOVIND (Shaylan Govind)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Shatterproof is a bioinformatics tool that will be used to analyze
    genetic sequencing data. This tool searches for particular patterns
    in data that are indicative of shattered DNA. The phenomenon of
    shattered DNA was only recently discovered and as such there are no
    existing tools that perform such analysis. As such, I believe that
    both the content of my module in addition to its name are both
    highly unique. By listing this module in the module list, it will
    allow researchers to easily access the tool and thus aide in their
    investiagtion of the DNA shattering phenomenon.

The resulting entry would be:

Shatterproof      cdpfg Bioinformatics- Sequencing Analysis Tool     SGOVIND
