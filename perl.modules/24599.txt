The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::LineFit
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Weighted/unweighted least-squares line fit
  userid:      RANDERSON (Richard Anderson)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Statistics::OLS

  rationale:

    The module name is Statistics::LineFit because it uses statistics
    (linear regression using the method of least squares) to do line
    fitting to a set of (x,y) points.

    Statistics::LineFit was inspired by and borrows some ideas from the
    venerable Statistics::OLS module. The significant differences
    between Statistics::LineFit and Statistics::OLS are:

    * Statistics::LineFit is more robust. For certain datasets
    Statistics::OLS will return incorrect results (e.g., only two data
    points). Statistics::OLS does not deep copy its input arrays, which
    can lead to subtle bugs. The Statistics::OLS installation test has
    only one test and does not verify that the regression returned
    correct results. In contrast, Statistics::LineFit has over 200
    installation tests that use various datasets / calling sequences and
    it verifies the accuracy of the regression to within 1.0e-10.

    * Statistics::LineFit is faster. For a sequence of calls to new(),
    setData(\@x, \@y) and regress(), Statistics::LineFit is faster than
    Statistics::OLS by factors of 2.0, 1.6 and 2.4 for array lengths of
    5, 100 and 10000, respectively.

    * Statistics::LineFit can do weighted or unweighted regression.
    Statistics::OLS lacks this option.

    * Statistics::LineFit has a better (or at least different)
    interface.

    Once you call the Statistics::LineFit::setData() method, you can
    call the other methods in any order and call methods multiple times
    without invoking redundant calculations. Statistics::LineFit lets
    you enable or disable data verification or error messages.

    * Statistics::LineFit has better code and documentation. The code
    in Statistics::LineFit is more readable, more object oriented and
    more compliant with Perl coding standards than the code in
    Statistics::OLS. The documentation for Statistics::LineFit is more
    detailed and complete.
