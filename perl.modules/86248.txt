The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PGObject::Simple::Role
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: Simple Pg stored proc access fro Moo/Moose
  userid:      EINHVERFR (Chris Travers)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://prepan.org/module/nXWJ8Y9sBog

  similar:
    PGObject::Simple. This is different in the sense that
    PGObject::Simple is a quick and dirty object system to be built
    around stored procedures, while this is a role to add simplistic
    mappings between Moo/Moose objects and such stored procedures

  rationale:

    The PGObject::Simple approach, while it is great for simple scripts
    and light-weight programming, was found to allow too much decay for
    object form particularly when used by less disciplined development
    teams on larger projects. PGObject::Simple::Role essentially acts as
    a bridge allowing the functionality of PGObject::Simple to be used
    in Moo/Moose environments as a role implementing an interface. The
    two modules cover somewhat different territory, PGObject::Simple
    being best for quick and dirty operations while
    PGObject::Simple::Role allows the same stored procedures used in
    PGObject::Simple objects to be consumed in Moo/Moose objects as
    well, with the guarantees those systems give.

  enteredby:   EINHVERFR (Chris Travers)
  enteredon:   Fri May 31 12:45:16 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

PGObject::Simple::
::Role            RdpOb Simple Pg stored proc access fro Moo/Moose   EINHVERFR
