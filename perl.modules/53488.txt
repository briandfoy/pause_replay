Subject: Module submission Tie::FlatFile::Array
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, mumiaw@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::FlatFile::Array
  DSLIP:       adprg
  description: Treat binary packed files as arrays.
  userid:      MUMIAW (Mumia Wotse)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    FlatFile

  rationale:

    The namespace Tie::Flatfile::Array demonstrates that the purpose of
    the module is to present a tied interface to a flatfile database
    that is represented as an array.

    Although another module exists called "FlatFile," that module only
    deals with text databases. Tie::Flatfile::Array deals with binary
    data that has fixed-length records.

  enteredby:   MUMIAW (Mumia Wotse)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 11 08:52:12 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::FlatFile::
::Array           adprg Treat binary packed files as arrays.         MUMIAW
