Hi,

I'd like to apply for a CPAN user-ID.

As you might guess after readiny my signature, :o)
my name is Martin H. Sluka <mailto:martin@sluka.de>,
and my homepage can be found at <http://martin.sluka.de/>.

I've written a few Tie::Hash modules which I'd like to upload.
In detail:

* Tie::Hash::Array, which internally stores each hash as a sorted
  array (thus you will get its content in a sorted order, can use
  objects as keys etc.)

* Tie::Hash::Abbrev, which sub-classes Tie::Hash::Array, and
  allows you to access the contents of tied hashes via
  unambiguously abbreviated keys.

* Tie::Hash::Abbrev::Smart, which sub-classes Tie::Hash::Abbrev.
  Here an abbreviation is still considered unambiguous even if
  more than one matching key exists, as long as all the
  corresponding values are equal (that is, they are either all
  undefined or have identical string representations).

  Disclaimer: I'm not _too_ happy with this name and would
  appreciate alternative suggestions.

See <http://martin.sluka.de/4cpan/Tie-Hash-Array-0.01.tar.gz> for
details.  BTW, comments about these modules are welcome.

I'd also like to contribute a subclassable Net::TFTP_Server if I'll
ever find the time and nerves to finish it.

My preferred user-ID for CPAN would be FANY.

Regards,
fany.
