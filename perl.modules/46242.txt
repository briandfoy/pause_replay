Personally, I like Coach (although critic is fine).

Mainly from the angle that once I get this puppy integrated into 
Perl::Editor (I'll talk to you about that later :) ) and thus PCE the 
term "coaching editor" is quite a nice one.

But Perl::Critic is just fine.

You need to do a formal application using the form. Someone will approve it.
