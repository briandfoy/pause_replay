The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Palm::Keyring
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Handler for Palm Keyring databases
  userid:      ANDREW (Andrew Fresh)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Palm::*

  rationale:

    Adds support for additional databases to the Palm::* modules. brian
    d foy said he doesn't have time to maintain it in the p5-Palm
    distribution, so it is becoming it's own module.

    Since it is my first module, I am going to post to Perlmonks before
    uploading.

  enteredon:   Sun Jan 28 18:27:32 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Palm::
::Keyring         bdpOp Handler for Palm Keyring databases           ANDREW
