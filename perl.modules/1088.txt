Hello,

I would like to request a CPAN userid.

name:             Ben Pavon
email:            ben.pavon@hsc.hac.com
preferred userid: BENPAVON

In the past I have contributed a rewritten Tk::CmdLine which is part
of the Tk distribution. I am planning to contribute several of the
modules that I have developed over the last 3+ years.

I intend my first contribution to be

  DBG Rpdf Selective debugging using permanent code

I posted the module to this list on January 17.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-01/msg00139.html

I also posted to clpm a short description and a reference to the above URL.

Unfortunately I have not yet received any responses to my original posting
to this mailing list or to clpm. Perhaps debugging is not up there on
people's areas of interest :-)

Thanks,

--
