                     ====================================
                       Package "Date::Calc" Version 5.0
                     ====================================

                            - RELEASE CANDIDATE -

        This package is available for download from my web site at

                  http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/


Prerequisites:
--------------

    Perl version 5.000 or higher, and an ANSI C compiler (!)
                                         ^^^^^^

What's new in version 5.0:
--------------------------

 +  Added the new functions "check_time()", "Delta_YMD()",
    "Delta_YMDHMS()" and "Add_Delta_YMDHMS()" to Date::Calc.
 +  Added the module Date::Object, an object-oriented
    frontend to Date::Calc with overloaded operators.
 +  Added the module Carp::Clan (used by Date::Object).
 +  Added support for Norwegian.
 +  Added support for Swedish.
 +  Added support for Danish.
 +  Added support for Finnish.
 +  Fixed the broken parsing of special ISO-Latin-1 characters
    in Date::Calc (replaced <ctype.h> with better solution).
 -  Locales wouldn't help here, because "Decode_Language()" must
    work with any locale setting. Moreover, setting a language in
    Date::Calc would also require to set the proper corresponding
    locale in the current environment, which may not be available
    on the current system. The new solution works independently
    of any locale and with ALL languages.
 +  Fixed the misspelled word "whether" in the documentation.
 +  Added a missing "#include <stdio.h>" statement in DateCalc.c
    (apparently only relevant to very few platforms).
 +  Added a patch which should ensure compatibility with VMS
    (this should resolve the problem of too long identifiers).
 +  Changed the function "Add_Delta_YMD()" to have a more consistent
    (and reversible) behaviour. This might break existing code, though.
 +  Changed the corresponding test script (t/f029.t) accordingly.


Abstract:
---------

    The Date::Calc package consists of a C library and a Perl module
    (which uses the C library, internally) for all kinds of date
    calculations based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in
    all western countries today), thereby complying with all relevant
    norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971, DIN 1355 and, to some extent,
    ISO 8601 (where applicable). The package is designed as an efficient
    toolbox, not a bulky ready-made application. It provides extensive
    documentation and examples of use, multi-language support and
    special functions for business needs.

    The C library is specifically designed so that it can be used
    stand-alone, without Perl.

    Moreover, version 5.0 features a new OO frontend module with
    overloaded operators for maximum ease of use (Perl only).
