The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Triceps
  DSLIP:       RdhOl
  description: The Triceps Complex Event Processing engine
  userid:      BABKIN (Sergey Babkin)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://triceps.sf.net, svn co
    https://triceps.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/triceps,
    http://freecode.com/projects/triceps,
    http://babkin-cep.blogspot.com/, CEP-Interest@yahoogroups.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module implements an embeddable Complex Event Processing (CEP)
    system, or more exactly, its Perl API. You can think of the Complex
    Event Processing engine as an in-memory database driven by triggers,
    or a data-flow machine, or a spreadsheet on steroids (and without
    the GUI part).

    I've named the module "Triceps" historically, before I looked at
    the CPAN rules, so for me the easiest things is to keep the name the
    same :-). For all I can tell, the other project of similar scope
    have a top-level name, so it should be OK (BerkeleyDB, MySQL, and
    Postgres even has two). Of course, I don't know, maybe they have
    been created before the current policy and then grandfathered.

    The other option would be to name it "CEP::Triceps". However since
    it's done in an object-oriented fashion, has a fairly big hierarchy
    of classes under it, and the users have to drag these long class
    names, I would prefer to see the top-level name shorter.

    I don't see any other CEP-related project on CPAN at the monent.

The resulting entry would be:
