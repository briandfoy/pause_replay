href="http://www.cpifoam.com/srv-forum-217.htm">Shawn, you admitted in your letter to the forum 
that you sometimes spray more than in the specs. You also seemed to believe that your 
manufacturer will be standing by you when something happens. I still think this a not very 
responsible. The day's going to come that something happens somewhere. I'd bet you that your 
manufacturer is going to hide real fast when there's a chance that they have to defend themselves 
in court. I also see a real problem with our organizations which are supposedly working on our 
behalf such as the Spray Foam Alliance or the NRCA. They re doing absolutely nothing in terms of 
getting better acceptance for our products. The hard reality is this: it's every contractor for 
himself, and that's it. Perhaps the contractors should gang up on the manufacturers and stop 
buying their stuff. I know this is wishful thinking, but at least it's a nice day 
dream!</A></FONT></SPAN></P><P class=MsoNormal><SPAN class=557365719-05062004><STRONG>Also, there
