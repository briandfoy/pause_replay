Hello,

	I am currently engaged in coding a suite of modules for manipulation of various
configuration files on a typical unix system. I propose to release all the modules under the
namespace Nix::. I had considered releasing it under Unix::, similiar to Unix::Configfile. But
some of my modules like Bind8 go deep and it becomes inconvenient and unweildy. Also, when I
started off, I had not anticipated releasing these on CPAN. I would like the Nix::
namespace very much, as I have already some modules ready. 


Ready modules.
Bind8: 
	Handles named.conf and its associated records

Sendmail 
	support for adding/deleting options, macros, class macros, adding/deleting specific 
values from class macros with the ability to do so in specific files (F), or only those 
defined with C, as well on the class macro as a whole.

I am currently working on these 
Aliases 
	handles aliases and any :include: in it, with methods for adding/deleting email-ids 
to aliases, adding/deleting from specific lists or the aliases file itself

PasswdGroup
	add/modify/delete user/groups with validation like checks for existence of group, user. 
Will be available as a lump like Nix::PasswdGroup, which will work transparently on various 
systems like Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD. At least that is the intention.

	Code for Bind8 and Sendmail are available at www.extremix.net/Nix-pre-rel.tgz. Docs are in
the docs subdirectory instead of in pod format. No version numbers, not Makefile.pl etc.. Just
untar and feel free to test it out. 

	Advice, criticisms welcome, but only after discounting the fact that I am a Perl/OO tyro.

Regards
Karthik Krishnamurthy
