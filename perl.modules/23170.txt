     why:

    GridShell is what I'm trying to contribute.

    Now demonstrating: the World's First 100% All-Natural MPI/Threads
    Mixed Parallel Execution! The new implementation of the Next
    Generation Auto-Parallelizing Programming Language known as
    'SequenceL' includes the addition of bleeding-edge Artificial
    Intelligence algorithms and the ability to run on Major Grid
    Computing Platforms (Globus, Avaki, or even a plain old Cluster).
    Also included is a nifty Web-based UI called JSSIM (JavaScript
    Scaleable Image Map). JSSIM is fully Skin-able, with several
    eye-candy SkinSets for your Computing pleasure. All code is written
    in pure, Object-Oriented Perl. Surf to the SourceForge Release Page,
    for immediate access to the new WOOP::SequenceShell interface!
