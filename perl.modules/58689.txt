     why:

    I have a variety of modules and scripts which I've written over the
    years which I feel would be of benefit to the developer community at
    large. Some already have analogous modules on CPAN which for
    whatever reasons were deemed unsuitable to my needs. Others are
    unique, or are extensions of existing modules which I've found
    useful. All are test-driven OOP perl.
