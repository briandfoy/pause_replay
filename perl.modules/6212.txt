The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CDDB::Info
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Complete interface to CDDB/FreeDB Databases
  userid:      JOS (Jamie O'Shaughnessy)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    None.

  similar:
    CDDB CDDB_get Net::CDDBScan

  rationale:

    CDDB encompasses both *the* CDDB server/service and the protocol
    itself and hence cover both the CDDB and FreeDB CD databases.

    This modules differs from other modules on CPAN in that it
    implements the complete CDDB protocol (both querying and uploading)
    over both CDDBP and HTTP transports. It also differs in that it is a
    clean and abstract OO interface to the database. The other way that
    it differs to most of these modules is that it offers a pure Perl
    implementation of the CD ID calculation code.

    It uses a concept of loadable drivers to implement support for CDDB
    over different transports (CDDBP and HTTP implementations are
    provided) so that access to the database can be provided in a number
    of ways.

The resulting entry would be:

CDDB::
::Info            bdpOp Complete interface to CDDB/FreeDB Databases  JOS
