Welcome 樋口裕之,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

    HIGU

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      樋口裕之

  enteredby: Andreas J. König

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
if you want to protect yourself from SPAM. If you want to do this,
please visit

or

If you need any further information, please visit
  $CPAN/modules/04pause.html.
If this doesn't answer your questions, contact modules@perl.org.

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Andreas J. König:
I hope I reconstructed your name correctly from what I found in the session data. Please correct it if necessary. Sorry for any inconvenience that results from PAUSE's insufficient tolerance for Asian encodings.
