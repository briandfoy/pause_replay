> Hi Nikolay,
>
> I’m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that we’re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master[*]. This is caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author directories. So we’ve identified the authors who can free up the most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.
>
> Your CPAN directory has some old releases of FamilyTreeInfo:
>  http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/MI/MISHIN/
> Deleting all of the old releases could free up nearly 57M. Note that everything you’ve ever released to CPAN will always be available in your BackPAN directory:
>  http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/M/MI/MISHIN/
>
> You could also delete old releases of POD2-RU while you’re there as well :-)
>
> There are at least 2 ways we can make this happen:
>
> 1. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
> 2. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf
>
> If you give me permission, I would delete anything that’s not the most recent release of a distribution. When marked for deletion, you’d have 3 days to check and revert anything you’re not happy with, before PAUSE would actually delete them.
>
> Thanks for your help — please ask if anything isn’t clear, or if you want to suggest something else.
>
> Cheers,
> Neil
>
> [*] This is a temporary problem, which will eventually be resolved with more diskspace, but in the meantime we need to help out the NOC by freeing up some space.
