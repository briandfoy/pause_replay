Subject: Module submission Strut
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, minimal@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Strut
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Lightweight web framework based on Plack
  userid:      MINIMAL (minimalist)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Dancer, Mojolicious

  rationale:

    Most web frameworks try to reinvent the wheel by providing
    functionality that already exists on CPAN. Strut.pm will be a light
    weight web framework based on Plack. So it will only provide the
    necessary tools for web development that Plack does not already
    provide.

  enteredby:   MINIMAL (minimalist)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 29 20:06:31 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Strut             cdpOp Lightweight web framework based on Plack     MINIMAL
