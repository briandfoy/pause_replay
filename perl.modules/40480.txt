The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OzDB
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: The OzDB is a text DB format.
  userid:      NEXEN (Daniel Remsburg)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://support.linuxops.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    The OzDB format was developed to accomodate the needs of a variety
    of applications. This open source release of OzDB is slowly, but
    surely, incorporating every feature from the commercial version.
    This also consolidates the database format into a 'standard' format
    and will allow developers to cross-reference different data and
    functions from other applications through interaction with this perl
    module. The module maintains a text based database, with the DBI
    interface port scheduled for release as soon as it becomes stable.
    Please visit http://support.linuxops.net and submit a ticket for any
    contributions, suggestions, help requests, bug reports, or for any
    other inquiry about the OzDB Perl module. Future projects under this
    namespace might include applications which use and support the OzDB
    as they become available open source.

The resulting entry would be:

OzDB              bdpOg The OzDB is a text DB format.                NEXEN
