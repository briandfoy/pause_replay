Hi CPAN Modules managers,

it looks like we have some trouble regarding List::MoreUtils.

It took me a while to get the maintainership from Tassilo, but in late Summer I
received the permissions. Now I've seen that Adam hast co-maintainership (new)
without anyone asked me, wrote me a mail or anything else.

What has happened there?

Not that I'm unlucky having a co-maintainer who works on some stuff, but
I'd like to be asked what will be done and how and review the patches etc.

I beg for clarification about the situation.

Best regards,
Jens
