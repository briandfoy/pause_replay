The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::NYTProf
  DSLIP:       bdcOp
  description: a per-line Perl profiler w/advanced reports
  userid:      AKAPLAN (Adam J. Kaplan ☺)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Will be published to open.nytimes.com, the New York Times Open
    Source Code blog. Public discussion is enabled on that blog. A
    mailing list can be established if needed.

  similar:
    Devel::FastProf, Devel::SmallProf

  rationale:

    Devel::NYTProf is a per-line code profiler for Perl. The name,
    NYTProf stands for New York Times Profiler, since that is where it
    has been developed. This module started out as an add-on for
    Devel::FastProf. It's purpose was to morph the very crappy output of
    Devel::FastProf into HTML so that our developers could find quickly
    find bottlenecks using a visual scan.

    I hit a point where it was more difficult to coerce
    Devel::FastProf's output into rich reports than it would be to just
    rewrite it to suit our needs. Devel::NYTProf borrows some code from
    Devel::FastProf, but is nearly a complete rewrite. Its benefits
    include:

    - Solaris support - Removal of extra steps to translate the binary
    output into human readable form - Faster & smarter fork handling
    (e.g. i don't flush the output buffer after every line of perl
    code... MUCH faster) - the XS returns a cleaner, simple to use hash
    of statistics - Flexible reporting system can generate many kinds of
    reports with advanced statistics - ships with HTML and CSV canned
    report formats.

    Example report screen caps Index page:
    http://adkap.com/images/Screenshot-Profile-Index.png A file page:
    http://adkap.com/images/Screenshot-XML-LibXML.pm.png

    All in two commands, without options. Cool, no?

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
