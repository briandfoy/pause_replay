Subject: Module submission KA::Tie::Dir
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       KA::Tie::Dir
  DSLIP:       SdpOp
  description: Access file system via a Perl hash
  userid:      INITDOTD (Vadim V. Kouevda)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    initdotd@cpan.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Tie::File allows you to access file contents through arrays, but
    there is no module to access the whole file system through the hash.
    While working on troubleshooting system we realized that such kind
    of access is extremely simple and useful.

    We decided to make this module open source and available to all
    enthusiasts of Perl. There are 2 main reasons we would like to have
    it in separate name space:

    1) Tie::Dir is already taken by a module giving access to directory
    meta data,

    2) We are planning to make troubleshooting & monitoring systems,
    mentioned earlier, available to Perl community. It would be highly
    desirable to keep all related modules in one tidy place and do not
    intrude in other name spaces.

    "KA" stands for Komputer Associates - informal company name.

The resulting entry would be:

KA::Tie::
::Dir             SdpOp Access file system via a Perl hash           INITDOTD
