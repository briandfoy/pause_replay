I think perhaps you'll need to write such an explanation; generally it's
much easier for the person who was previously confused to know what needs
explaining - certainly I never had any trouble, and I've not previously
encountered anybody else who was surprised that an unindexed release doesn't
receive an indexing email.

Follow the 'View Permissions' link on the side bar once you're logged in
and you'll find that you can look.

Uploading releases at all to test what can be directly observed is a pretty
inefficient approach.
