Hi, my name is David DeLanoy. I work for 180Solutions, a company that
generates revenue for software developers like yourself. I am contacting
you because I noticed that you work with tucows.com to distribute your
software BeOS - Languages. 

180Solutions has developed n-CASE, which is the most widely distributed
client-side comparison shopping engine in the world. Not only is n-Case
distributed all over the world, it is the easiest comparison shopping
engine to use. We work with dozens of software developers just like you
that bundle and distribute n-CASE with their existing software
applications. I would like to offer you the opportunity to bundle n-CASE
with your software, and we will pay you $.07 for every one of your users
that opts-in to installing n-CASE. 

Typically, our distribution partners bundle n-CASE in their existing
setup programs or as a part of an upgrade, and then give their users the
option to install n-CASE during setup. Currently over 60% of users when
prompted, opt to install n-CASE. 

If you are interested in developing another source of revenue, please
feel free to contact me or follow this link:

<http://www.180solutions.com/Distribute?ref=dtd01>  I look forward to
hearing from you. 


Respectfully, 

David DeLanoy
