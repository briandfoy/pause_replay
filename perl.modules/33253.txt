The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Shipping::UPS_XML
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Interface to UPS new XML shipping interface
  userid:      DOWNHOM (Duane Hinkley)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    newsgroups CVS repository

  similar:
    Business::UPS Business::Shipping::RateRequest::Online::UPS

  rationale:

    This module uses the XML interface to UPS to get rates. Existing
    modules like Business::UPS and
    Business::Shipping::RateRequest::Online::UPS use other interfaces to
    get rates.

    I chose the Business::Shipping::UPS_XML name space to follow the
    existing naming scheme of simular UPS modules. Also this module will
    normally be uses by businesses with an account with UPS for the
    purpose of shipping.

  enteredby:   DOWNHOM (Duane Hinkley)
  enteredon:   Sun Jun 27 15:49:30 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::Shipping::
::UPS_XML         RdpOg Interface to UPS new XML shipping interface  DOWNHOM
