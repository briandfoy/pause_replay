Hello.  I recently released a Perl implementation of the OSCAR
protocol, Net::OSCAR.  This makes three modules for accessing AOL
Instant Messenger, not to mention Net::ICQ (and others?)

However, perhaps some sort of consolidation is in order.  I propose
that a new second-level hierarchy be created, Net::IM.  Some consensus
between the us would be reached as to the interface to this module,
and maybe some other details such as style guidelines.  It would have
a facility for creating IM system connections which allows you to
specify a protocol name, such as TOC, OSCAR, or ICQ.  This allows
application developers to write on application which works with
all systems, and allows module authors to avoid reinventing the wheel
with their interfaces.

Net::OSCAR would then be Net::IM::OSCAR (with perhaps a wrapper that
has a name indicating that it can be used to connect to AIM - and
eventually perhaps ICQ as well).  As for Net::AIM and Net::AOLIM, is
there a technical reason that the two modules aren't merged?  I don't
even see that many differences in the interfaces.  I understand that
there may be political reasons, but we should try to work those out if
we can. If not, then they can still be separate modules under the
Net::IM hierarchy.

Comments from the readers of modules@perl.org are also welcome.
