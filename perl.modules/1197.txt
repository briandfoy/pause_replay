4) prefered CPAN ID: HALLECK
5) Discription of what I'm planning to contribute:
   Two perl modules.  One a direct implementation of RFC 2396 for
   relative and absolute paths, and the other a direct implementation
   of RFC 2396 for relative and absolute paths.
   (RFC 2396 responds to complaints about some browsers doing absolute
   and relative path conversion incorrectly, and missparsing of url's
   by browsers...  It states officially exactly the way they work.)
6) for modules a description in module list format
Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
paths          Rdpf  RFC 2396 relative and absolute paths code    HALLECK
urls           Rdpf  RFC 2396 relative and absolute URLS code     HALLECK

7) It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have
   discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was
   at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for submissions, but
   we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality control

They have been discussed and used by various organizations at this campus,
they've not been discussed outside of that.  They have gone over well,
and have been used extensively here.
