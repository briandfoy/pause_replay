The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CML
  DSLIP:       Mdhhp
  description: Celmorlauren's public Perl based systems
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Celmorlauren are currently trawling through our libraries to see
    what can be released into the wild. Historically we used to link our
    BASE directly into the Perl directory structure! Something we wish
    to stop doing for at least the public code, we would also like to
    place our commercial stuff within this base as well, as time
    proceeds this will also be made public. Our code is very OO and so
    we would prefer to keep the naming conventions we have been using,
    changing from our current base to a common public base is a straight
    forward business, otherwise we will feel that it is totally
    uneconomic to make anything except the most intergrated non OO stuff
    public, currently only two of the three scripts offered originally
    fall into that category.

  enteredby:   CML (celmorlauren limited)
  enteredon:   Tue May 29 12:20:29 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CML               Mdhhp Celmorlauren's public Perl based systems     CML
