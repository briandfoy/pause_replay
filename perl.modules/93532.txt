Rafa=C3=ABl,

*** Resending with a subject so the email doesn't bounce ***

The module distro "base" is out of sync between CPAN and maint-5.22. P5P
is first come on this dual life module along with you as co-maint.
I'd like to offer to update this module on CPAN to keep it in sync. If
you're ok with that, I've already done the leg work to get the module
ready to upload to PAUSE so I'd just need co-maint. I'd probably bump this =
to a
devel release and do a release to testers before I release it as the
version currently in core.

If you'd rather do the upload yourself, please feel free to steal my
work in the above repo.

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
