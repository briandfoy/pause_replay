Perl Maintainers,

I have a module that I'd like to make available.  Its primary function
is to convert HTML documents to RTF format, though it also serves as a
general API in creating RTF documents.  While not using Philippe
Verdret's RTF-Parser engine, it should compliment the RTF group with its
HTML to RTF functionality.  If I could get an authors directory called
"jbarker", I would appreciate it.  Thank you.
