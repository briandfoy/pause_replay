     why:

    Well, for about over a year I have been using Perl. IMO, it's a
    great! I would like to write/contribute some modules. I have writen
    some flatfile-text database modules that I would like to contribute.

    I support open projects in general, I am a root editor of
    http://open-site.org/, which is an open-content project that uses
    perl to parse pages and for an editing interface.

    Please consider my request for an account. :-)
