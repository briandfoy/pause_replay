Hi--

I'd appreciate a bit of advice.  I'm newly registered with PAUSE and what 
I'd like to do is take over maintenance of the IniConf module.  I've run 
into a few bugs in it [and overall I have some other thoughts about ways 
to spiff it up some] and I haven't been able to contact the current owner 
of the module.

I posted a note to this effect on comp.lang.perl.modules and got no 
comment at all, one way or the other, so I assume that few, if any, of 
the folk in the community have much of an opinion about this module..


What's the preferred way to do this?  I can just create a brand new 
module, call it the same thing, 'IniConf', and make sure the original 
author gets appropriate credit.  [and whether you remove or do something 
like that to the old module [which'll basically be getting way out of 
date and not be supported] is a separate matter...

Thanks!!
  /Bernie\
