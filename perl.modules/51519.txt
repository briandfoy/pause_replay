The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Trace::ABIF
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Read and parse ABIF file format
  userid:      VITA (Nicola Vitacolonna)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    ABI Bio::SeqIO

  rationale:

    The namespace is meant for modules dealing with the trace files
    produced by sequencers (scf, ab1, phd, etc...). We have written a
    Perl module for parsing ABIF (Applied Biosystems Inc. Format) files,
    because the existing ABI module had very limited functionality and
    Bio::SeqIO requires the Staden libray, which is a bit old, needs
    updating and it is not Perl. Our module has extensive functionality:
    it can be used to read any chunk of an ABIF file and it can be used,
    for example, to easily produce analysis report as the AB's
    Sequencing Analysis program does.

    We think that such modules can be very useful in sequencing
    pipelines, e.g. for automatic quality assessment.

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::Trace::
::ABIF            bdpOp Read and parse ABIF file format              VITA
