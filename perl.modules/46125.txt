Subject: Module submission Language::Befunge
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::Befunge
  DSLIP:       MmpOp
  description: Module to interpret Befunge code.
  userid:      JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    language-befunge@mongueurs.net

  similar:
    Befunge::Interpreter

  rationale:

    The module exists since april 2002, and version 1 is available for
    one year.

    There is only one other module targeting befunge language:
    Befunge::Interpreter. But this module: - is still in version 0.01 -
    has not been updated since 2000 - is not in a standard cpan
    hierarchy (Befunge-* instead of Language-*)

    There is currently interest for module Language::Befunge, since I'm
    receiving patches for it (!), that I'm reviewing and integrating
    when they're interesting.

    There is a mailing list supporting the module.

    Last but not least, Language::Befunge is the base for
    Inline::Befunge.

    That's why I'd like to have the module Language::Befunge
    registered.

    Keep me informed at jquelin@cpan.org.

    thanks, Jerome
