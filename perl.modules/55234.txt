Subject: Module submission Test::Config::System
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Config::System
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Test aspects of system configuration
  userid:      IANK (Ian Kilgore)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perlmonks (node 623228)

  similar:
    Test::File::Contents File::Grep

  rationale:

    Test::Config::System provides functions to help test system
    configuration, such as packages, config files, directories, and
    symlinks. It was built for use in a cfengine staging environment,
    however it is not tied to cfengine (or any configuration management
    tool).

    I submitted an application last month for Sys::Configtest, which
    was not accepted, presumably because use of the Sys:: namespace is
    discouraged. I'm resubmitting it with the name Test::Config::System,
    which I think may be a more suitable name.

    The modules listed in ``similar:'' both provide a part of the
    functionality that Test::Config::System does. However, they both
    focus solely on files, whereas Test::Config::System tests files,
    packages, directories, links, and eventually other aspects of system
    configuration, such as network interfaces.

  enteredon:   Thu Jul  5 18:32:43 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Config::
::System          adpfp Test aspects of system configuration         IANK
