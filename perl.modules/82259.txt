It's the latter. Normally we keep them centralised under a single user;
in the case of Schema::Loader, ILMARI, which had been correctly done. In the
case of Model::DBIC::Schema, MSTROUT, which appears not to have been done.

That's incorrect.

The Schema::Loader permissions were centralised under ILMARI because that's
what we've been doing for years; all I did here was to revoke your co-maint
on them.

The Model::DBIC::Schema additional modules, I believe you still have
primary maint on, since I had no permission to touch that. You -should-
have been assigning those to me as you uploaded so that the permissions
were centralised under a single user, but that's simply a mistake that
we hadn't got round to correcting.

If you're going to refuse to allow anybody else to develop those modules
then we'll have to rename all of them, but it's your right to do so.

Please do remember that you still have all of your commit bits intact;
we're trying to ensure code gets reviewed before it goes to CPAN, not to
prevent you from ever writing code again.
