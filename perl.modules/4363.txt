Oh yeah, what you've done is quite fine.

I keep forgetting that there's a distinction between "X is in CPAN" and "X
is an indexed module dist in CPAN".  In fact, after years of putting module
dists in CPAN, it was just last week that I uploaded my first non-module
thing to CPAN -- a script called crontab2english -- it's now in CPAN, but
is clearly not an indexed module dist in CPAN.
