Yes, I was wondering about this myself when trying to decide what to
name my module.  One thing to note is that all of the modules listed
do very similar things.  I wrote Festival::Client::Async because the
other modules did not appear to be well-suited to my needs (meaning,
for the most part, non-blocking operation), and in this sense I'm to
blame for not consulting with the other module authors about adding
features to their existing modules.

Looking more closely at Speech::Festival, it seems that it would not
be too hard to merge Festival::Client::Async with it, as they have the
same goals, though the interfaces and internals are different (I
happen to think that mine is a better implementation of the protocol,
but that could just be Hubris)

I'm not sure to what degree Speech::Festival and Festival::Client are
maintained, perhaps they can answer here :)

Thanks for getting the discussion started, it is definitely something
that needs to be sorted out.

There are a few namespaces in which Festival related modules can be
put.  I do think the Festival:: namespace should not be used, as it is
not really very descriptive.  On the other hand, Kevin has got the
FestVox:: namespace for things related to building voices for
Festival, so in that sense it perhaps makes sense.

I would prefer for the module name Speech::Festival to be used as a
namespace for interfaces to the *internals* of Festival, and have the
(new, unified, all-singing, all-dancing) module which talks to a
Festival server be called something else.

I also very much like the idea (which Richard has implemented) of
having a common Speech::Synthesizer interface for people who just want
to do text-to-speech and don't care about being able to evaluate
arbitrary Scheme expressions and fiddle with utterance structures.
