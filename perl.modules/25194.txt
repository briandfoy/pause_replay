The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Refactor
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Module to assist in refactoring perl code.
  userid:      SSOTKA (Scott Sotka)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The namespace was chosen because refactoring (for those who do it)
    is generally part of the development process. I also didn't see a
    more relevant namespace, although I'm open to suggestions.

    As for uniqueness of my approach, I just decided that I needed a
    module like this and couldn't find one when I went hunting for it.
    So, I wrote it myself. It's not perfect, but it does most of what I
    needed. At this stage it may be useful for others, and they might be
    able to enhance it further.

    I have seen tools like this in Java editors (Eclipse and CodeGuide)
    and decided that it would be useful for Perl coding on the occasions
    that I have found myself putting too much functionality in too few
    subs.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
