Subject: Module submission Marpa::HTML

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Marpa::HTML
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: High-level HTML Parsing
  userid:      JKEGL (Jeffrey Kegler)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Planet Perl

  similar:
    HTML::TreeBuilder

  rationale:

    The HTML parser developed to test Marpa is now well enough
    developed to be useful independently. It has these advantages over
    other approaches.

    1.) Perl callbacks specified with CSS-like specifiers for
    semantics. 2.) A new approach to semantics, more general and (I
    hope) intuitive than bottom-up tree evaluation, but equally fast.
    3.) Based on mathematical algorithm, not ad hoc hacks. Because of
    this easier to understand and maintain; and 4.) (Once Marpa::XS is
    done) fast.

    This request is for a subdomain of the Marpa namespace, which
    should mean pre-emption or interferance with other projects is
    minimal.

The resulting entry would be:

Marpa::
