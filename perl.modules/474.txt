Questions

1. What are the aims and practice of the language/implementation?
2. What kind of language specifications are available?  Are they formal =
specs?  Are they some ISO/ANS/IEEE whatever standard?
3. How compatible is the language with anything?  How fast does it =
evolve?  Is it free, or do some corporations/institutions tighly control =
it?  Is it burdened by a reference implementation and legacy code whose =
quirks must be emulated?
4. What kind of language differences and extensions does the =
implementation support or not support?
5. What are libraries available?  Which are distributed with the =
implementation?

regards
