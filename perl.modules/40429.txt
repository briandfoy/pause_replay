Hello,

Just FYI,

I changed the /dev/null to be File::Spec->devnull for portability.

Any chance of getting this added to my namespace? I'd really appreciate  
it as its beenfinished for quite some time and I have projects waiting  
on its availability or not.

If not please let me know so I can make other plans for projects  
waiting on this, thanks.
