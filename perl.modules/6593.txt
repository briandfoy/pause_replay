The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Quantum::Usrn
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: provide 'square root of not' function
  userid:      KASEI (Marty Pauley)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Belfast.pm

  similar:

  rationale:

    On Monday 26th February 2001 I went to hear Damian Conway give his
    talk on Quantum::Superpositions at London.pm. During the talk he
    described the Physics of real quamtum superpositions, and mentioned
    the 'square root of not' operator. After explaining its properties
    (see above) he said "it is unlikely that you will see this operator
    in Perl any time soon". Well, we all know what happens when people
    say things like that...

  enteredby:   KASEI (Marty Pauley)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 16 20:47:44 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Quantum::
::Usrn            Rdpfp provide 'square root of not' function        KASEI
