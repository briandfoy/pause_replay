The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Patch::Rred
  DSLIP:       bnphp
  description: Safely apply diff --ed style patches
  userid:      JBOHM (Jakob Bøhm)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Patch PatchReader Meta::Development::Patch patch(1) red(1)

  rationale:

    Of the related modules listed above, only the patch(1) and red(1) C
    programs can apply --ed style patches, and patch(1) does this by
    invoking ed(1) or red(1), both of which expose a large language of
    commands and operations (including file access operations) for the
    contents of the apparent patch file to use and abuse.

    This module and the included command line script rred.pl provides a
    smaller, simpler and much simpler execution engine which does not
    allow the patch script to read any file not specified as input on
    the command line (or passed as arguments to module functions), nor
    to affect the contents of any file except the specified output file
    (or the file content data returned in-memory by the module
    functions).

    The inspiration for this module came from the use of --ed scripts
    to provide efficient (small) incremental patches for the Debian and
    Ubuntu download indices. To solve the same problem in that contents,
    a similar internal C++ module named rred was added to the inner
    workings of the apt download manager. However that internal C++
    module used a very inefficient file I/O heavy implementation and was
    in fact so slow it was soon disabled for speed reasons.

    However the idea was good and I created my own implementation
    capable of operating entirely in memory and process multiple patches
    in one go. This module is that implementation, written in pure perl
    for safety and portability. The module has received some usage in my
    own environment, with a high success rate, but the test suite is not
    yet complete and it hasn't been tested by other users yet.

    The placement directly below Text::Patch in the name space
    emphasizes its practical (but not dependency) relationship with the
    existing Text::Patch module and expresses a hope that a future
    version of Text::Patch might take advantage of Text::Patch::Rred
    when applicable.

    I preferred placement below Text::Patch to placement below
    Meta::Development::Patch because the name prefix Meta::Development::
    implies much less generality than the Text:: prefix.

    I preferred placement below Text::Patch to placement below
    PatchReader because the location of PatchReader in the root level
    looks more like namespace polution to me.

    I have a Beta stage package ready for upload but will hold for a
    few days just in case there are protests or better suggestions from
    the community.

    P.S.

    I am not subscribed to the list, please CC me on any thread posts
    about this.
