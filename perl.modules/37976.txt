Are you sure? 

Working on a huge project that uses Ant for building, I'd rather
consider it a nightmare. The basic idea of having everything 'in one',
with pluggable extensions is nice (but you might equally well call a
Unix command or shell script a 'make' extension) but that's where it
ends. The lack of control structures and the concept of immutable
properties make it very hard to use in complex situations. The ant
file language is ugly -- XML, and not even XML since it is run-time
extendable which means that you can get syntactical errors during
run-time in ant files that have been functioning correctly until then.

Having said that, there are several interesting features of Ant that a
decent build tool could profit from. But please don't call it Ant or
anything alike :-).
