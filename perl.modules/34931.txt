Subject: Module submission Data::Normalize

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Normalize
  DSLIP:       Sdpfp
  description: Normalize Text String
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    beginners@perl.org

  similar:
    Other Normalization modules I see on CPAN are a different type of
    normalization.

  rationale:

    Indexes, for example, can be more acurate if the data has been
    "normalized" in the sense that strings that can be represented in
    multiple ways (1 one dr doctor, etc) are consistently modified to be
    the same.

    So for example if someone serached for "dr worm"

    you would use this module to normalize "dr worm" into "doctor worm"
    and then do the search on the same data that has been normalixed the
    same.

    See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/Fulltext_Search.html and the
    post with "Tom's fulltext tips: To get MySQL searching well for me I
    did:" item #1 for another example.

    This module would give a standard consistent way to normailize
    data, with a way to expand it by simply giving it a hashref as the
    argument.

    For example in the database/search example above you could ensure
    compatibility by doing:

    Assuming $string to be "Dr. Worm"

    1) When its added to the database by a perl script (what else of
    course ;p)

    my $data_to_store = normalize($string); # then INSERT
    $dbh->quote($data_to_store);

    2) When its searhed for

    my $search_string = normalized($string); use $search_string in
    query

    3) Now regardless of if the admin or the searcher entered dr worm,
    Dr. Worm, or Doctor Worm - the record will match

    The same principle would apply to acronyms (and special cases)

    my %norm_map = ( tmbg => 'They Might Be Giants', rtfm => 'Read the
    Friendly Manual', stfw => 'Search The Friendly Web', );

    my $norm_data = normalized($string,\%norm_map);

    Plus ways to handle exeptions, say

    etc - where you mean Et Cetera or /etc/ It can be handled easily...

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Normalize       Sdpfp Normalize Text String                        DMUEY
