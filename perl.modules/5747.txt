Hello,

I have two modules that I'm getting ready for distribution on CPAN. As
per the FAQ, I'm emailing you for an author ID. I'd prefer the id
"JCARTER" if that works for you.

The modules I'd like to add are:

* GXML.pm, a transformation tool for XML and XML->HTML conversion. I
  currently distribute it at:

  http://multipart-mixed.com/xml/

  I plan to submit it under the XML namespace, i.e. XML::GXML.

* IPTCInfo, a module for extracting IPTC meta-info from image files
  (name, caption, location, etc.). It's currently at:

  http://multipart-mixed.com/photo/iptc.html

  I plan to submit it under the Image namespace.

Best regards,
Josh
