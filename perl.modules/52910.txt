Subject: Module submission Timestamp::Simple
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Timestamp::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Return a timestamp in the form yyyymmddHHMMS
  userid:      SHOOP (Steve Shoopak)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's a simple, but commonly require feature, that many people
    become confused deciding how to implement. By choosing Timestamp as
    a rootlevel name, and introducing this module as Simple, there is
    room for development of increasing complex modules that will expand
    the feature set.

    I know developers who write this function as a subroutine using the
    POSIX utilities; others, they implement a complete C solution, but
    most of the time, consistent timestamping is required for efficient
    logging.

The resulting entry would be:

Timestamp::
::Simple          RdpOp Return a timestamp in the form yyyymmddHHMMS SHOOP
