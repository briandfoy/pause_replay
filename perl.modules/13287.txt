The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Pod
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: test POD files for errors and warnings
  userid:      BDFOY (brian d foy)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::HTML::Lint

  rationale:

    I had a few errors in a released module's POD, so here's a way to
    test that so I can catch it before it happens. Test::Pod uses the
    usual Test::Builder stuff.

  enteredby:   BDFOY (brian d foy)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 19 20:36:12 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Pod             adpOp test POD files for errors and warnings       BDFOY
