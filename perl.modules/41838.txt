     why:

    David Craigon, one of your CPAN contributors has been posting our
    affymetrix modules onto your site. Unfortunately he is now leaving
    us to go to new pastures so we need to organise a handover.

    The other authors and I (Director of his group) are keen to
    continue developing these modules as a group effort and to release
    them into the public domain since we thoroughly support open source
    principles.

    We are a University based not-for-profit unit in the Plant sciences
    division of Nottingham University. We send out data and seed to
    people all over the world (free [data] or subsidised [seed]).
