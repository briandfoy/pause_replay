In many cases it's a one to one relationship, but sometimes it's a
many to many relationship: one module can use several namespaces and
one namespace may appear in several modules.

CPAN is optimized for the case of a one to one relationship. The other
cases sometimes require people talking with each other.

Yes, I missed this in my first answer.

Apparently, yes! Sorry, needs fixing.

No, we want a sane mapping of namespace X500::DN::Parser to
X500/DN/Parser.pm as it is enforced by perl itself.

What a relief:-)

I have manually corrected the database, so that Ron's entry will change from

X500::
::DN               MdpO? X500 Distinguished Name parser               RSAVAGE

to

X500::DN::
::Parser           MdpO? X500 Distinguished Name parser               RSAVAGE


This has the side effect that X500::DN is again an unused namespace.

If you should pick it or not should be clarified between you and Ron
directly. If you two can agree, it's likely everybody else will agree.

Yes, but fixed.
