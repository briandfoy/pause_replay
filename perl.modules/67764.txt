Hi,

I am the pumpking-in-residence of DBIx::Class (RIBASUSHI). I was
trying to transfer ownership of a "first-come" module back to the
namespace owner (MSTROUT), and in a moment of retarded bliss gave
up the ownership entirely.

The module in question: DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::AutoCast

What can be done to rectify this situation?

Thank you
Peter Rabbitson
