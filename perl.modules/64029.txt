The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::FormHandler
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: an HTML form handler written in Moose
  userid:      GSHANK (Gerda Shank)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    irc: #catalyst

  similar:
    Form::Processor

  rationale:

    This started as a Moose conversion of Form::Processor, but it
    wasn't possible to take full advantage of Moose features and
    conventions and maintain back compatibility. Many attributes and
    methods have been renamed, reorganized, or refactored. Many
    additional tests have been added, plus new Moose roles to interface
    with Catalyst. Other HTML form processors are in the HTML namespace,
    so that seemed a good choice. 'FormHandler' wasn't take for the
    second part of the name...

  enteredby:   GSHANK (Gerda Shank)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan 12 21:01:30 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::FormHandler     bdpOa an HTML form handler written in Moose        GSHANK
