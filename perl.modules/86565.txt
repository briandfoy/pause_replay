The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Evented::API
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: evented and objective API Engine
  userid:      COOPER (Mitchell Cooper)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/cooper/api-engine

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Evented::API "API Engine" provides a modular programming
    interface to applications written in Perl.

    API Engine uses Evented::Object to handle dynamic loading and
    unloading of modules. Code references are registered for handling
    specific tasks. Applications provide subclasses of API Engine
    classes that provide additional interface functionality.

    API Engine keeps track of the changes modules make to a Perl
    program and reverts those changes when a module is unloaded.

    Because API Engine's classes are direct subclasses of
    Evented::Object, this module belongs in the Evented:: namespace.

    The repository is located at https://github.com/cooper/api-engine.

The resulting entry would be:

Evented::
::API             RdpOb evented and objective API Engine             COOPER
