The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Reproducibility
  DSLIP:       cdph2
  description: Quantitation reproducibility in biology etc
  userid:      JIMI (Jimi Carlo Wills)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module addresses a problem not really address properly in
    biology, yet. Quantitative proteomics and microarray data give
    ratios between two samples for each protein. As usual experimental
    replicates are made to check the results are reproducible, but there
    is no formal standard for analysing

    (1) how reproducible the experiment was over all (2) if there is
    some precision-related cut-off that can be used to filter results
    (3) what to do if there are missing values (4) how reproducible
    (trustworthy) is the value for each protein

    Sometimes point (1) is addressed using Pearson's (r-square), but
    this is not independent of the variance, and therefore is not the
    correct measurement. This module accompanies a scientific article in
    preparation that addresses all 4 points.

    As far as I'm aware, there are no directly related modules.

    This module will use Statistics::QuickMedian and
    Statistics::TheilSenEstimator

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
::Reproducibility cdph2 Quantitation reproducibility in biology etc  JIMI
