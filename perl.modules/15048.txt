why not make the top-level FileSys?  that would group all of the
file system modules together.  

if you allow VFS at the top level, are we going to allow UFS, AFS,
HFS, HFSplus, and so on?

the only argument against FileSys:: has been that it requires more
typing, but i think that is specious.  the shortest name is not our
primary concern---we want a name that is obvious, descriptive, and
easy for the un-enlightened to understand.

beyond a good name, we also have to consider the overall structure
of CPAN.  top level names should be reserved for general topics.
i think VFS is too specific to be a top level name.  even the other
examples we discussed (VCS, DBI) are general groupings rather than
specific instances of the topic.  we should group filesystem modules
together too.  with VFS we're giving away the entire VFS space to 
a particular virtual filesystem, but when i checked google, i found
several other types of VFS.

i like either of these:

   FileSys::GnomeVFS
   Gnome::VFS
