The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Zenoss::API
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: PERL OO interface to the Zenoss API
  userid:      PATBAKER (Patrick Baker)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://community.zenoss.org/community/forums

  similar:
    I don't have any knowledge of an existing module

  rationale:

    Zenoss is an OpenSource monitoring system which is growing in
    popularity. In order to support the PERL users that use Zenoss, I've
    crafted OO interface to the Zenoss API. This interface allows one to
    accomplish ANY Zenoss type function from a PERL abstraction. The
    interface exhausts all possible Zenoss API calls.

    Zenoss::API was chosen as I did not want to consume a top level
    name space in the event others decide to develop PERL modules for
    Zenoss. ::API seems like a natural choice to the Zenoss top level
    namespace as its concise to the function of the module.

The resulting entry would be:

Zenoss::
::API             bdpO2 PERL OO interface to the Zenoss API          PATBAKER
