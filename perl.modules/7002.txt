The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SVG
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generate SVG images
  userid:      RONAN (Ronan Oger)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    svg-discuss@roasp.com

  similar:
    XML::Writer

  rationale:

    SVG is coming into existance of its own as an XML language, and
    there are no graphics packages in CPAN that deal explicitly with
    SVG.

    The SVG module will deal with the creation of the SVG components at
    the image level, much like GD does, allowing the the user to draw
    circles, arcs, or rectangles directly without having to dive into
    the guts of the XML. The intent is to follow it up with SVG-specific
    graphing and table-creating modules such as SVG::xy, SVG::pie and
    SVG::table

    I thought about going for XML::SVG or GD::SVG but thought that
    simply using SVG would be cleaner. The name in itself implies that
    this is for images and that it is for XML, and GD implicitly deals
    with raster graphics, while SVG is vector-based.

    The approach is not that unique in itself, except that nobody else
    has SVG modules on CPAN. There is a module called SVG-PL being
    developed by a UK university, but nothing new has come out since
    2000 from them, and they have not listed it on CPAN so far. I've
    contacted them to get some feedback about where they are, but
    nothing back yet.

    Instructions for getting onto svg-discuss@roasp.com mailing list as
    well as some application examples are at:

  enteredby:   RONAN (Ronan Oger)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 13 07:35:11 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SVG               adpOp Generate SVG images                          RONAN
