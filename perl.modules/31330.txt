Audio-M4pDecrypt-0.01 must be pulled from CPAN.  From the announcement:

"I've uploaded Audio::M4pDecrypt to CPAN. It should be indexed by 
tomorrow.
This is a Perl port of the DeDRMS.cs program by Jon Lech Johansen, 
which is
a C# program to decrypt Apple iTunes copy protected .m4p song files."

[best guess as to the author = Bill Herrera, http://www.lynxview.com/  ]

Disclaimer:  I cannot verify that this module actually does what it 
claims because it requires a Win32 module Win32::TieRegistry, which 
apparently is used to locate the local key, and I'm using a Macintosh. 
Apple had the original code pulled from Sourceforge and, when it was 
moved to India, removed from there also.
