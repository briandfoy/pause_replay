Hi, maintainers!

I've finally committed myself to *completing* a module (there are
quite a few in limbo ...) and put it on CPAN. (I need this for
a project, and decided to make it available for free rather
than charge my customer.)

Here's the info for PAUSE:

your name 
	Lupe Christoph

your email address 
	lupe@lupe-christoph.de

your homepage if you have one 
	http://free.prohosting.com/~lupe

your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9 characters long, all
uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed. 
	LUPE

a description of what you're planning to contribute 
	Filesys::SamFS

	Filesys::SamFS makes the SamFS API available to Perl. SamFS is a
	HSM (Hierarchical Storage Management) Filesystem; it manages
	files in two storage levels - a cache on disks and an archive
	on removable media like magneto-optical disks or tapes.

	SamFS is a product of LSC, Inc. For more information, please
	refer to http://www.lsci.com/ .

for modules a description in module list format
	Filesys::SamFS	adcf	Interface to SamFS API

It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have discussed some or
all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was at least a little bit of interest. We are
quite open for submissions, but we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality control. If
your work has never been discussed publicly, then it's extremely difficult for us to make our
judgement whether to accept the submission or not. 

Umm, I don't know where this *should* be discussed. clpm is probably
not very interested, and I know no SamFS mailing list.

Lupe Christoph
