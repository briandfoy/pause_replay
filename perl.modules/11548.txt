The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Plasmatronics
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Plasmatronics Regulator control and access
  userid:      SCOTT (Scott Penrose)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Actually I need a little help with the location of this device. It
    is a hardware control device, it does not really fit into
    Device::Plasmatronics like that of a Serial Port and Parallel Port,
    but then again maybe that is where it should be.

    The Plasmatronics Regulator is a device which controls the flow of
    power from charging devices (eg: Solar, Wind or Generators) into
    Batteries. It monitors the state of charge of the battery and
    current use etc.

    It has a complex interface via a serial port which just allows you
    to read and write locations in memory on the device.

    Thus this module provides the proper abstraction to that device and
    should work with all Plasmatronic regulators.
