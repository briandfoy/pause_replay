The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Polyhedra
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: vertices, edges, faces of common polyhedra
  userid:      HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    irc, perlmonks, sdl::opengl users, example scripts

  similar:
    none found

  rationale:

    (This is a repost, please don't flame if it's not in limbo, since 7
    May. My other two were registered quicker, and I've seen others
    registered since 7 May.)

    I chose "Math::Polyhedra" as the most obvious name for searching
    without starting some new and unintuitive deep namespace like
    Math::Geometry::Data::Polyhedra.

    This produces commonly calculated data for use in graphics
    programs. It's designed from a study of 120 points defined from the
    Golden Ratio.

  enteredby:   HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  enteredon:   Sat May 10 21:26:33 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::Polyhedra       bdpfp vertices, edges, faces of common polyhedra   HALLEY
