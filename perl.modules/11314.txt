I have designed, and am currently developing an object to be used on Windows
(NT-based), for mirroring file and directory structures. It uses
Win32::FileSecurity to ensure that file permissions are replicated. It is
currently at an alpha stage, although working in the test environment.
My suggested name for this module is Win32::Mirror, although this is upto
yourselves as per the PAUSE documentation says.

Other modules I would like to commit to CPAN in the future are libraries
for maintaining IIS (MS's webserver on 2000); and ones for managing Active
Directory on 2000 as well. I have also written an "Unparse" module for
XML::Parser
(tree structure)
