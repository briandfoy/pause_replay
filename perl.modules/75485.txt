Subject: Name space proposal: SIAM
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: ssinyagin@k-open.com (Stanislav Sinyagin)

hi all,

I'm intending to open a namespace request for SIAM.
It stands for "Service Inventory Abstraction Model", a new project of mine:
https://github.com/ssinyagin/SIAM

Apart from the core, there will be enterprise- and database-specific
driver modules, and probably third-party object modules. The ones that
don't disclose the enterprise's proprietary stuff may be also be
published at CPAN.

Please let me know if there's any objection to the name.

cheers,
stanislav
