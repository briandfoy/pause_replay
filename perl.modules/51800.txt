Concerning the problem stated below, what would be the best way to deal
with it?  Unfortunately, I am not able to work on my Linux box now
because of computer malfunctions so I had to tar and gzip the file on
Windows, and I am not sure of how well the utilities that I downloaded
work?  
 
Would it be better for me to just send a tarred version of the file
rather than a .gzipped (as the 'make dist' was only able to tar the file
and ran into problems with trying to gzip it because I couldn't find a
command-line version of gzip (only a graphical one)?
 
 
Thank you.
 
 
Obiora Embry
