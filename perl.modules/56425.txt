Hello PAUSE admins,

Actually I do have an implementation of ClearCase::Base, but I was unable to
upload it successfully to CPAN list.

Can you provide me more information about templates and/or format that I
must use for uploading a class regarding the perldoc and class downloadable
files ?

Thanks in advice.
M. Ribeiro
