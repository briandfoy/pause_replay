Subject: Request to adopt abandoned module - Authen-NTLM
Date: Sat, 9 May 2009 21:35:08 +0100

Hi

The Authen-NTLM distribution on CPAN appears to be abandoned.

It hasn't been touched since 2003, and it has an unauthorized  
namespace clash with the 'NTLM' distribution.

Unfortunately, the abandoned distribution in question contains the  
only server side implementation of NTLM on CPAN. This code works, and  
is useable, and I have a branch of Catalyst-Authentication-Credential- 
HTTP which uses it to support NTLM auth.

I obviously can't release the new feature until the namespace  
conflict is sorted out, so I'd like to officially start the module  
adoption procedure please...

I reported http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=44996 three  
weeks ago now, and I mailed the author at the time, and have done  
again today.

I've also posted publicly about this on perlmonks in case anyone else  
can contact the author:
http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=763072

Please can you try emailing the author, and start the clock ;_)

Thanks..
t0m
