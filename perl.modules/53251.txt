The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::JSON
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A JSON-based config file system.
  userid:      RIZEN (JT Smith)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    https://svn.webgui.org/svnroot/modules

  similar:
    Config::General Config::Any Parse::PlainConfig Config::INI

  rationale:

    We used to use other config file parsers, but we kept running into
    limitations. We already use JSON in our app, so using JSON to store
    config files means using less memory because we already have the
    JSON parser in memory. In addition, with JSON we can have any number
    of hierarchcal data structures represented in the config file,
    whereas most config files will give you only one level of hierarchy,
    if any at all. JSON parses faster than XML and YAML. JSON is easier
    to read and edit than XML. Many other config file systems allow you
    to read a config file, but they don't provide any mechanism or
    utilities to write back to it. JSON is taint safe. JSON is easily
    parsed by languages other than Perl when we need to do that.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::JSON            RdpOp A JSON-based config file system.             RIZEN
