This time, I'm doing it right and getting a namespace before really
going anywhere with the project.

I'm working on a web-based, LDAP-backed contacts organizer system for
a client.  I noticed http://ldap-abook.sourceforge.net/ and thought
that it was a good starting point.  Now come the namespace problems.

David Leigh, the orignial author, has chosen the namespace `Abook'.  I
feel that this is probably inappropriate, and, after discussing this
with him have come to you to ask your opinion.

What we suggest is creating a hierarchy of classes for various sorts
of address books.  Examples:

  AddressBook          -- abstract class
  AddressBook::LDAP    -- gets addresses from or puts them into an
                          LDAP server (uses Abook.pm and Net::LDAP)
  AddressBook::Palm    -- uses the Palm::* modules.
  AddressBook::BBDB    -- uses Emacs' BBDB file format as the backend.
  AddressBook::Outlook -- uses Outlook's file format as the backend.

And others.

Right now, I'm committed to working on the BBDB and LDAP backends.

Is this namespace acceptable?
