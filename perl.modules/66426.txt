Subject: Module submission Plex

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Plex
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: a fast and powerful application server
  userid:      SCIO (Daniel Zulla)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    chatrooms, mailingslists

  similar:
    mason (but plex has a webserver)

  rationale:

    Well, i think there a _really_ good projects with a similar idea:
    Making web development with perl easier, better and faster!

    Now i wrote plex, and i'm still developing plex every day. There's
    a preforking and precaching webserver based on HTTP::Request, which
    supports embedded perl (own compiler / lexer system, extendable),
    and an application framework (plex::database, plex::text, ...) for
    easier and safer programming.

    I want to share my work on cpan now, because i know there are still
    lots of developers like me out there, who don't like php, and the
    other stuff.

    Plex should help them, and maybe other people want to help me,
    developing plex.

    (second apply cause in my first i wrote "plex" and not "Plex")

  enteredby:   SCIO (Daniel Zulla)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun 29 18:06:12 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Plex              bdpOp a fast and powerful application server       SCIO
