I actually had to do this once with a module that had a Y2K bug that
nobody wanted to fix. I kept the old name, gave it a higher version
number and added all the sort of discouragement that Jarkko is talking
about. This strategy definitely worked very well. About two or three
years later I deleted it.

The module name was Date::GetDate and you can get it from the backpan.

The funniest feedback I got was from a user who asked me for
permission to use it in a commercial project. It turned out, the email
was from an automated script and so the sender and I had a good laugh.
