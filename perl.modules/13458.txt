From: orenbk@richfx.com (Oren Ben-Kiki)

I have an old CPAN user ID, ORENBK, that has the E-mail 
address oren@capella.co.il associated with it (luckily this 
the E-mail still works so you can verify this by replying to 
it). I haven't used this ID in years. I don't remember the 
password associated with it.

I'm writing a Perl script I want to upload to CPAN so I want 
to resurrect the user ID. My contact info is:

Name: Oren Ben-Kiki
E-mail: oren@ben-kiki.org
Home page: www.ben-kiki.org/oren
(existing) CPAN user ID: ORENBK

See veto.sourceforge.net for a description of the script I 
plan on uploading.

Thanks,

	Oren Ben-Kiki
