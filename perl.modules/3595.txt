And give people a direct pointer to the file in my directory. Why
didn't I think of it ??? It's much simpler .... :o}

I don't object at all. Maintaining the ptk module by editing an HTML
file is not much fun.

Good.

Great !

I will try it as soon as I can.

All in all, this is very good news. 

But, the Tk modules are now covering quite a range of applications:
specialised widget (RO::Text, TreeGraph ,...) , "real estate" manager
(NoteBook, Pane ...), development widget (debugger, logger) and so on.

Would it be possible to add sub-chapters in the module list within the
Tk (or XML, or whatever) category ?
