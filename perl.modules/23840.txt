Greetings,

I am a new PAUSE author. I registered because Steve Fink (SFINK) agreed
to transfer ownership of the CGI::Test module to me several weeks ago.
Mr. Fink tells me that he transferred ownership of the module to me no
later than Sept 10. 

I am prepared to release an updated version of the module, but PAUSE
does not seems reflect any change in ownership of the module. When I
"View Permissions" in the web interface, it reports I don't have
permissions for any modules. I have not uploaded anything yet.

When I search for permissions of the CGI::Test module, it only reports 
RAM (Raphael Manfredi, the original author of the module) as the
co-maintainer. Steven Fink is not listed.

I need to know if PAUSE knows that I am allowed to upload a new version
of the CGI::Test module, or will it ignore my attempts.

Can I proceed with uploading the module, or do I need to do something
else?

Thanks for any assistance.
