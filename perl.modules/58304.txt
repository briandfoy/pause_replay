    Well yeah, I've pretty much stopped working on it for a long time
    now so it is most probably in need of (a lot of?) attention.

    If you'd like to help out with the features that you need that
    would be great. You can just download the module and hack away. I'm
    actually not sure if I can list you as a co-maintainer on CPAN so
    that you can upload new releases directly, but I'll check into it,
    otherwise you may just send the patches (or the full release) my way
    and I'll put it up at CPAN.

    Other than that anything you need just let me know and I'll be more
    than happy to work with you on updating the distribution.

    Anyway, thanks for the interest, it's really nice to know that
    people are actually using this stuff! :-)

    Cheers, Nuno
