The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PAR
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Perl Archive
  userid:      AUTRIJUS (☺唐宗漢☻)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    magnet #perl, module-build

  similar:

  rationale:

    PAR is like Java's Jar files; .par files contains a zip-compressed
    folder of a typical blib/ directory, and could be put into @INC,
    loaded and executed on the file, as well as turning into stand-alone
    scripts or executables (aka Perl2Exe or PerlApp).

    Its multi-platform support (by having different architecture
    directories inside the .par file, and loading XS files on the fly)
    makes it a powerful way to distribute Perl applications, as well as
    letting multiple versions of a same module to coexist on a system.

    I choose a rootlevel namespace because it is of the same level as
    DynaLoader.pm or B.pm -- i.e. it fundamentally alters how Perl
    processes its behaviour in a pragma-like sense, but is also useful
    as a stand-alone module.

    Thanks, /Autrijus/
