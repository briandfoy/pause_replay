The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CNC::Cog
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Profiles and cnc code for milling cogs
  userid:      MARKWIN (Mark Winder)
  chapterid:   99 (Not_Yet_In_Modulelist)
  communities:
    Unsure

  similar:
    I've looked but not found any similar functionality.

  rationale:

    People who make clocks and other mechanical mecanisms need to make
    gears. The traditional methods of doing this involve having a large
    set of different cutters in order to be able to make a full range of
    gears. One alternative approach is to just cut the gear profile out
    of a sheet of material using a small diameter circular milling
    cutter. Although such an approach means that a few compromises must
    be made in terms of shape (you cannot for example, cut a square
    hole) in practice many useful gears can be cut.

    This module aims to offer a number of functions for setting up
    parameters of wheels and pairs of wheels and then offers the ability
    of direct generation of G-code to be fed to a CNC milling machine.
    It also currently use the GD module to plot out the same shapes for
    test purposes. Its about generating cogs and traslating them into
    metal.

    There might and indeed ought to be other perl modules that generate
    gcode for cnc metal and wood cutting machines. I've not found any
    yet, but if there are others I think that CNC is a good prefix to
    use. Its a new prefix, and I think is justified in this context. We
    need to steer clear of Gcode as a different type of Gcode with an
    entirely seperate meaning is used within the Perl interpreter I
    believe!

    So this module is (probably) to be called CNC::Cog and this seems
    fairly self explanetary. There is also the concept of a cog-pair, a
    pair of cogs with certain features in common which will mesh.

    At the moment I have code that generates Epicycylic gears. This
    will be uploaded shortly. Its structure needs more work, also there
    are always more features needed, for example the ability to stack 2
    or more gears on top of each other and cut them out of 1 piece of
    metal. Other teeth shapes, not only Cycloidal but also saw-tooth has
    aplications. Currently however it can sucessfully generate profiles
    in Gcode, and display them using GD as jpegs.

    I'd welcome email from anyone one intrested in this work or who has
    been doing similar work.
