Steffen, Jarkko, thank you very much for your feedback. I'll stick with=20
the mentioned names for the first two packages, and choose=20
Device::Blkid, if that is OK for you.

Jarkko, I understand your point; however, there are a number of reasons=20
why the Sys prefix has its advantages as well. I can find=20
multiple "system information" packages there, e.g. Sys::CPU,=20
Sys::MemInfo, Sys::Filesystem, ... They _do_ in fact have in common=20
that they provide access to low level information about, er, the=20
Sys::tem. My package belongs to the same category. In other words: I=20
like Sys:: :)

Best
   Bastian
