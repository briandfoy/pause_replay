Howdy,

I've a module, which locally I've been calling "GUS::Graph.pm" since GUS are my 
initials and it is a program which writes graphs in the format of *.eps with the 
intent of converting those *.eps to *.png or whatever.

My module surpasses GD::Graph::lines in one respect only, it repeatably and 
prettily deals with dual-Y axis graphs. That is to say it reconciles the Y1
and Y2 axes in a reliable and visually appealing manner. It does this by
handing all the real graphing functions off to Ghostscript itself to handle.

The eventual output, I expect, will be that folks convert their *.eps files to
*.png or whatever using 'gv' or 'GSView'. That's what I intend it for at any
rate. But the *.eps files could as readily be ported into PostScript via any
document editor.

So, about name spaces... My module does not seem to fit in with PostScript::*
or Graph::* as it is stand-alone, not relying upon any other module except
for Carp. I might like to add further modules, either for more graphing or
for who-knows-what. But my style is pretty much to make whatever I write to
be as stand-alone as it can possibly be. Toward those ends I might like to
have a namespace of GUS::* as my top level, like I do for home, if that is
to be permitted.

So my proposals, in order of preference, for this first module are...

GUS::Graph
GUS::EPS::Graph

...or just plain...

EPS::Graph

...if that is how things must be. I don't know what else EPS-ish I will get 
around to writing anytime soon, however. Some other things, maybe, equally ad 
hoc I might have ready within a year.

I've got some home-brew modules, nowhere near ready yet for CPAN, which make (I 
think) clever use of Tk to auto-build complex widgets. You can find those in use 
at my, admittedly cobbled, automotive road-load editor Perl script here...

http://starling.us/tet/gus_perl/gus_rpc_edit_pl/gus_rpc_edit.txt

...the Tk-ish modules of which I might like to eventually put in a namespace 
something like...

GUS::Tk

...but those modules are much needing to be cleaned up as they are not OOP or 
any such modern thing...yet. So my stuff is an ad hoc collection. It would be 
nice to have them together in one place under a common top-level namespace. 
Hoping this suggestion does not greatly offend.

Respectfully,

Gan Starling (aka APLONIS on CPAN)
