Hi Steffen:

I am the author/maintainer for a module in the PDL namespace called 
PDL::NetCDF.  This module is routinely used by some number of people 
(including myself) and I'd hate to see it removed.

I believe that I've uploaded a version of PDL::NetCDF not *too* long ago. 
I'll make sure that my latest version in on CPAN.

Best Regards,

   Doug Hunt
