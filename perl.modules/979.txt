Module Description: I have a module that acts as a wrapper around
Crypt::* block ciphers to make them operate in CFB or OFB modes. There's
been some interest in efnet #perl about this.

I think it would be better if it was integrated into the Cryptix code,
but the Cryptix web page says that the  Cryptix Perl code is no longer
actively maintained.

I'd like to use the names Crypt::CFB and Crypt::OFB in keeping with the
Crypt::CBC tradition.

Later,
Scott
