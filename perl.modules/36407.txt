How about a suggestion?  I feel like I'm shooting in
the dark.  The only answer I'm getting is "No, try
again".  It seems like publishing in cpan is too much
trouble.

Here are some other possibilities:

1. Another name that seems satisfactory for this
module and it's algorithms.  GSL uses gsl_root_fsolver
for 1-d its 1-d solver, so maybe Math::RootSolver. 
For some context, it uses gsl_multiroot_fsolver for
multidimensional solver, gsl_min_fminimizer for 1-d
minimizer, and gsl_multimin_fminimizer for
multidimensional minimizer.

2. I could put my stuff under Math::RootSolver along
with any other future one- or multi- dimensional
nonlinear root solvers.

3. This package could be put under an even more
general space for dealing with nonlinear functions
like "Math::Nonlinear".  This would be similar to
Math::Polynomial for dealing with polynomials or
Math::Matrix/Math::LP for dealing with linear
functions.  In this "Math::Nonlinear" namespace, root
solvers, minimizers or anything dealing with nonlinear
functions (defined by a subroutine ref) could be put
here.
