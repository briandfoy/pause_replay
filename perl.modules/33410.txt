The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IMAP::BodyStructure
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Parser for IMAP4 BODYSTRUCTURE fetch item
  userid:      KAPPA (Alex Kapranoff)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.com/index.pl?node_id=372164

  similar:
    Mail::IMAPClient::BodyStructure

  rationale:

    The Mail::IMAPClient::BodyStructure is really a Parse::RecDescent
    grammar which ends up as 700k(!) of perl code and works a little bit
    slowly. That's not bad as it is a part of big and interesting
    Mail::IMAPClient infrastrcuture.

    My module is a simple hand-written parser which does its job very
    well and very fast.

    There are some alternate names I thought over, like
    Mail::IMAP::BodyStructure or Net::IMAP::BodyStructure. The latter
    won't do as my module does nothing about "Net::", it's only a
    parser. The former would be nice, but there's no Mail::IMAP::
    anything on CPAN. That would be a waste of hierarchy level.
    Mail::IMAPBodyStructure looks as ugly as Mail::Body::Structure or
    IMAP::Body::Structure.

  enteredon:   Wed Jul  7 12:10:56 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IMAP::
::BodyStructure   bdpOa Parser for IMAP4 BODYSTRUCTURE fetch item    KAPPA
