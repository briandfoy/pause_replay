The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UID
  DSLIP:       Rdppp
  description: Define unique keyword-like identifier object
  userid:      PLATO (David Green)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    constant.pm define.pm

  rationale:

    UID.pm defines constant identifiers, much like "use constant" (or
    define.pm), but using objects that will be unique. ("use UID Foo" is
    close to "use constant Foo=>Foo", except that the constant will
    match any old string "Foo", whereas the UID can only match itself.)

    Since the module does not export any functions (or have any to
    export!), it's only interface is through "use UID foo", and I wanted
    to keep the name meaningful but as short as possible.

    I could not find any existing module that provides this feature;
    while the uniqueness of refs is sometimes taken advantage of, there
    does not seem to be a standard way to do this, nor any attempt to
    package it in a way that provides clean syntax (e.g. the ability to
    say "Foo 42" in place of something like "\'Foo' => 42").

  enteredby:   PLATO (David Green)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul 22 14:39:15 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

UID               Rdppp Define unique keyword-like identifier object PLATO
