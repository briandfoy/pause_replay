     why:

    I've been contributing some code to Dan Bricklin's wikiCalc
    project. I have a module which parses the "backup" files and
    presents the information in a perlish way. I've been talking with
    him about either providing the module via CPAN or as part of
    Socialtext's distribution of SocialCalc (which it will be renamed to
    at the beginning of the year). In general, as I have ideas for
    modules which would help others, I'd love to be able to give to the
    CPAN which has given so much to me.
