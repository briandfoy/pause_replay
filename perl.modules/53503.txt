Subject: Module submission KA

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       KA
  DSLIP:       MdpOg
  description: Komputer Associcates Solutions
  userid:      INITDOTD (Vadim V. Kouevda)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    mailinglist will be setup after approval

  similar:

  rationale:

    We ("KAITS, Inc" or "Komputer Asociates") are developing many
    automation utilities and systems. Some of them could and should be
    made opensource for the benefit of the whole Open Source Community
    and people, who love Perl and use it in everyday life.

    We are going to contribute quite a lot of various modules or even
    bumdles. It would be benefitial to keep them together in one
    namespace. So, to achieve this, to have clear distinction, not
    pollute root space, and not intrude in other namespaces, we would
    like to have our own root space "KA", which stands for "Komputer
    Associates".

  enteredby:   INITDOTD (Vadim V. Kouevda)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 12 21:09:05 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

KA                MdpOg Komputer Associcates Solutions               INITDOTD
