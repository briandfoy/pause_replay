The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::DeferredPartial
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Deferred evaluation / partial application
  userid:      SGOELDNER (Steffen Goeldner)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Sub::Curry Attribute::Curried Perl6::Currying overload

  rationale:

    An instance of this class behaves like a sub (or, more precisely:
    subroutine reference), but it supports partial application and the
    evaluation of operators applied to such function objects is deferred
    too. That means, evaluation has to be forced explicitly (which makes
    it easier to add introspection capabilities).

    Objects that represent deferred (delayed, suspended) expressions
    are known as suspensions or thunks in various programming circles.
    Don't confuse with the same terms in the context of threads!

    If you merely need currying, you may consider modules like
    Sub::Curry, Attribute::Curried or Perl6::Currying.

    The deferred evaluation strategy allows to write down expressions
    in a natural way - without the need for a wrapper function. This is
    the chief difference to the *::Curry modules mentioned above.
    Partial application aside, what comes closest is the Symbolic
    calculator example in the overload module.
