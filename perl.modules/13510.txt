I was granted ownership of the name Log::TraceMessages and uploaded
version 1.0 of that module a long time ago.  Then last year I uploaded
version 1.1.  It has appeared in my user directory (EDAVIS) but not in
modules/by-module/Log/, which still shows 1.0.

Do I need to contact this list to request updating the by-module
directories to point to the latest version - or is there some other
step I'm missing?
