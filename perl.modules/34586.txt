Subject: Fumble with Algorithm-Binpack ?
Cc: CBTILDEN@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: J2N-FORGET@wanadoo.fr ((Jean Forget))

Yesterday evening, I have uploaded one of *my* modules. But
there was a glitch with my browser which gave me the
impression that the upload was not complete. So I
logged again into PAUSE, went to the "upload a file"
page and read the list of pending modules.
I found my module, clicked the checkbutton and
the "upload" button. The result is that the
Algorithm-BinPack file was uploaded into my JFORGET directory.
I have checked on http://search.cpan.org and=20
Algorithm-BinPack is attributed to me, not to Carey Tilden.

Did I click on the wrong line? Is there a bug in the
server?

On the plus side, I have checked in
  https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/C/CB/CBTILDEN/
and the Algorithm-BinPack file is also uploaded there.=20
But there is no CBTILDEN subdirectory in
  http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/C/CB/
Well, maybe this directory does not exist yet but=20
will exist soon, since this is a first module.

Anyhow, could you ensure that the file was uploaded
in CBTILDEN's directory? And that Carey Tilden
is listed as the real and proper author of this
module?

Please excuse me for the inconvenience.

whose shortened form --- www --- takes three times longer to say than
what it=B9s short for).
