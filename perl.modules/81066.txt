The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Array::GroupBy
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Group "equal" elements of an ordered array
  userid:      SAMB (Sam Brain)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    List::Util

  rationale:

    Array::GroupBy exports an iterator "igroup_by()" which, when
    called, returns sub-arrays of a given array whose elements are
    "equal" as determined by a user-supplied boolean function. The name
    is inspired by the SQL "GROUP BY" clause.

    The module is most useful when grouping arrays of complex objects,
    not just simple 1-dimensional lists.

    I use it mostly on SQL-generated 2-D data (returned, e.g., by
    DBI::selectall_arrayref), where the array contains multiple levels
    of data from joined one-to-many tables, each level requiring its own
    "group by" iterator.

    It is used by utility functions (which I hope to submit to CPAN as
    a module) which build Moose objects from such SQL-generated 2-D
    arrays.

    In trying to find a place in the namespace, I looked at Iterator::,
    but I feel the fact that the implementation uses an iterator is
    merely incidental (as in List::MoreUtils::each_array(), for example)

    It seemed to fit most naturally in the Array:: namespace.

    There is another module called Array::Group, but that module
    transforms 1-D lists into 2-D arrays with user-specified row or
    column sizes.

The resulting entry would be:

Array::
::GroupBy         bdpfp Group "equal" elements of an ordered array   SAMB
