The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Xcopy
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: compare, copy, and move files like xcopy
  userid:      GEOTIGER (Hanming Tu)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    do know yet

  similar:
    File::Copy

  rationale:

    Check on CPAN and did not find similar module. The module will
    conduct basical copy as File::Copy with more functions such as
    comparing files in target dirctory before copying or overwriting,
    copying files based on time stamp, etc.

  enteredby:   GEOTIGER (Hanming Tu)
  enteredon:   Thu May 27 14:38:57 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Xcopy           cdpOp compare, copy, and move files like xcopy     GEOTIGER
