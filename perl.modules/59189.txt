The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Go::Referee
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Checks for illegal moves in a game of Go
  userid:      DEG (Daniel Gilder)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module can be used with Games::Go::SGF to parse a game record
    for illegal moves, or as a referee in an ongoing game to handle
    illegal moves. It can be used by anyone who writes a program to play
    Go, to check whether a candidate move is allowed or not. It is able
    to deal with the various slightly different rulesets that exist.

  enteredby:   DEG (Daniel Gilder)
  enteredon:   Sun Feb 24 22:36:08 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Go::
::Referee         bdpOp Checks for illegal moves in a game of Go     DEG
