Hi Neil,

Thank you for continuing to maintain PAUSE. I also prefer to keep 
history around, but if the historical releases have to go to make way 
for better things, please feel free to mark them for deletion on my behalf.

This email thread is like a little mini BPS reunion. ;-)

Thomas

          I'm ok with old releases going away, but have always
          appreciated having the history around. PAUSE really can't cope
          with having the historical uploads around?<br>
          <br>
          The trouble with keeping old releases in your author directory
          is if package names are changed, then the old names can stay
          in the index against an older release. And theoretically
          someone could try to install that old module, and accidentally
          downgrade a distribution, or install an old version.<br>
          <br>
          All releases ever done to CPAN are always available via
          BackPAN, and you install from BackPAN with cpanm. So overall
          it’s safer for everyone, but particularly for less experienced
          developers, to keep your author directories tidy. For most
          distributions people are only ever likely to install via the
          lead module, but there are some with multiple public facing
          modules, where people could shoot themselves in the foot.<br>
          <br>
          Cheers,<br>
