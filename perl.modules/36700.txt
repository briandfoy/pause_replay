Moin,

recently some bugs in Math::BigInteger (from 1996, Gary Howland, not to=20
confuse with Math::BigInt!) have been found. But as it turns out, Gary died=
=20
in 2002:

http://www.vmeng.com/mc/archives/2002-December/000114.html

So all his modules:

http://search.cpan.org/~gary/

are now orphaned.

How do we deal with this situation? So far nobody has stepped up as maintai=
ner=20
(probably because nobody noticed that Gary no longer answers his email)

A few ideas:

* the email could be redirected to an active (!) mailing list, that at leas=
t=20
can read and reply to emails, or look at bug reports, even though nobody=20
might be actively maintain the modules.
* instead of a group, a person could be found.
* the modules should be marked as "outdated, no longer actively maintained"=
=20
with a flag in CPAN. Something like a red bar that appears whenever you=20
access one of them. Since people installing them by other means would miss=
=20
the warning, I guess new versions with these warnings should be released,=20
too.

Me wouldn't mind taking over his modules, but apart from answering email an=
d=20
marking them as "outdated, no longer actively maintained" I would not have=
=20
much time to work on them.

I got some code from Ian (hi!) for Math::BigInteger, and at least it's fail=
ing=20
tests could be fixed. Apart from that, I do not think it makes sense to=20
maintain the code - but as I said, currently nobody can reach anybody=20
responsible for these modules and this is bad.

Please share your ideas and comments,

Tels
