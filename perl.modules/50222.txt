Subject: Module submission Net::SAML

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SAML
  DSLIP:       cdcfo
  description: Parse and generate SAML Assertions for SSO
  userid:      SAMPO (Sampo Kellomaki)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    -

  similar:
    Net::OpenID, Net::Yadis

  rationale:

    SAML is an OASIS standard, that has existed since 2001, for
    conveying trustworthy statements, called assertions, about user. The
    statements can convey authentication, authorization, and attributes
    of the user. SAML assertions are a federated identity management
    building block used in Single Sign-On (SSO) to web sites and as
    credentials in identity web services. SAML 2.0 also includes an
    actual SSO protocol (which is also supported by this module).

    I feel the usage domain, SSO and id web services, suggests Net::
    prefix rather than Security::. Authentication:: and Authorization::
    prefixes would be too narrow as SAML can do much more. Other modules
    in SSO area, such as Net::OpenID and Net::Yadis, also chose Net::
    prefix.

    --Sampo

  enteredby:   SAMPO (Sampo Kellomaki)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug  8 21:58:25 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::SAML            cdcfo Parse and generate SAML Assertions for SSO   SAMPO
