The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mac::AppleSingleDouble
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Read Mac AppleSingle or AppleDouble files
  userid:      JFLOURNOY (Jamie Flournoy)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    netatalk-admins, comp.lang.perl.announce,
    comp.sys.mac.programmer.misc

  similar:
    Unique, to my knowledge

  rationale:

    It's a class for reading a pair of nearly identical Mac file
    formats (AppleSingle and AppleDouble) which Apple invented back in
    the A/UX days, to allow MacOS files to be stored on a normal flat
    filesystem (i.e., UFS). In particular, Netatalk (the open-source
    AppleShare file server software for *nix) can use AppleDouble to
    store files in the local filesystem, so if you share the same
    directory on a *nix server via netatalk and SAMBA, Mac users and PC
    users can share files with one another.

    This module is essential if you want to write Perl scripts which
    run on the *nix side and which need to read the Mac metadata from
    the files - for example, if you want to back up and then delete all
    the locked BBEdit text files, or Photoshop files whose Finder label
    color is Green.

    As far as I know (I looked) there is no Perl module that handles
    this file format.
