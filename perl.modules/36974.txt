The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Commerce
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Generic Commerce Building Blocks
  userid:      CLACO (Christopher H. Laco)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Apache::iNcom, Business::OnlinePayment

  rationale:

    I'm currently working on an eComm site conversion from MSSQL/ASP to
    MySQL/AxKit. I'd like the package and share the modules as a base
    for a generic shopping cart system.

    The main focus of the kit is a set of modules to do basic cart i/o
    from any application, web or otherwise, with a set of AxKit Taglibs
    on top.

    Ideally, I would like to go for the Commerce namespace to keep the
    module/class names shorter, Commerce::Cart::Item vs.
    Business::Commerce::Cart::Item, but I can see that
    Business::Commerce would also be a good place for all things
    eCommerce related.

    The iNcom space seems to be soley based on Apache. My goal is to
    abstract everything away from any assumption on where the commerce
    will take place; over the web via html, via SOAP, via console
    application, via Tk, etc.
