on http://rt.cpan.org, I see:

To work with bugs, every module author with a PAUSE account can log
into rt.cpan.org with their PAUSE userid and password. If you can't log
in, don't have a PAUSE account or distributions you maintain aren't
listed, please write to cpan-questions@bestpractical.com at your
earliest convenience.
