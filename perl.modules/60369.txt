That's great news. I was going to do something relatively simple in
design using Template Toolkit and HTML::Table[1] as an internal object
you could play with. Generally I was thinking about a clean interface
that checks each object type in the DBI (thus, supporting DBD::*) and
corresponds it with the proper HTML input type (text, checkbox,
textarea) which you could configure and change it to.. say radio or
whatnot. Using HTML::Table it would be able to nicely portrait the DB
and allow maximal configuration for the display of it without being
bothered with it.
I haven't uploaded anything to CPAN because there's currently not much
to upload. It's beyond an idea but not much beyond.
I think working together presents new possibilities for it, and could
definitely benefit the general community in what we could accomplish.
I don't know Muldis::Rosetta (though I've read of it) and never really
played with Catalyst but I'm willing to go over these possibilities
and see if they would be better than what I had in mind for it. They
just might be.
