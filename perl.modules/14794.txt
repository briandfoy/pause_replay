i don't see making such a broad .  almost anything can come
after the leading underscore, and i bet someone somewhere is
using it for good use.  i also would not want to show examples
of a fake namespace using a leading underscore.  i should be able
to use the fake namespace in prose as well as code.

i want a top-level namespace that is definately intended for
examples.  a leading underscore still leaves a lot of decision
in the name.
