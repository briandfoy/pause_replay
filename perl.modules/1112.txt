I'm mainly concentrating on modules that help webmasters play around with 
search engines, although I'm also working towards some modules that work 
with web services (like an EMAIL::Hotmail).

Uh,
Sequin     adp(r?)     Parses logged search engine info

# This module is, as of this release,  in its *very* early stages. This
# release in  fact is  mainly just  so people  can have  a look  at the
# module,  point out  any bugs  that they  can see  already and prehaps
# offer help...

# The module  started its  life as a CGI script, that was full of bugs,
# and was one of my first Perl programs. I would like to think that the
# quality of the scripting has improved somewhat since then.

# In it's present state,  the main subroutine accepts an URL, which and
# tries to determine if this  URL is that of a Search-Engine query.  If
# it is,  it will decide which search terms were used,  and return both
# the name of the search engine, and the keywords used.

# Of course,  there are many plans for the future of it, and as, at the
# time  of  writing  (14-2-00)  I'm  ill,  this  version  may  never be
# released, and some of the features I hope to include will be included
# in the real first version.  Who knows?  Following is a list of future
# releases, and what I hope to include in them...

#  (0.1) - That which you have now
#  (0.2) - Inclusion of about 20 new search engines
#  (0.3) - Gives approximate ranking of URL on the search engine
#  (0.4) - Will give exact ranking of URL on the search engine
#  (0.5) - Gives information about other sites listed near URL
#  (+++) - Maybe Re-register the URL or process whole log file
