First, try several times to contact the original author, preferably by 
more methods than just email if you can locate contact details for them.

Try a couple of times over a couple of weeks.

Once you've established that the author has gone AWOL, contact modules@ 
again stating what you did to try and locate him, and we'll add you as a 
co-maintainer for the module, so when you upload the new versions it 
gets indexed.
