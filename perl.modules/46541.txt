Request to register new user

fullname: Lincoln Baxter, III
  userid: LBIII
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Requesting a new user ID to prevent confusion between LBAXTER and
    LINCOLNB. Cancelled old user ID. Sorry for the inconvenience.

    A recursive, object-oriented based, AI expert system using regular
    expression pattern matching on facts. Currently supports variable
    interpolation, summation, logical and, or, if, not, assert, gt, gte,
    lt, lte, sum, mult, div, subtract , and the join() method
    functionality in rules and assertions.

    A dynamic object-oriented parsing/data-compilation system to aid in
    generating facts and rules for the expertsystem modules. It could
    take a while to do all that by hand, no? :)
