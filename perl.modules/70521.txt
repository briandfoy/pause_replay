I'd like to send a friendly note to all PAUSE authors to let them know
they can help CPAN mirror maintainers by cleaning up some old files in
their PAUSE directories. I would strongly emphasize that the cleanup is
completely voluntary, and probably phrase is closely to recent blog
post:

http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2010/03/tidy-up-your-cpan-author-
directory.html

If no one objects, I'll do that toward the end of the week.
