The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GEB::Hyphen
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: "Godel, Escher, Bach" hyphen languages
  userid:      DEREK (Derek Thomson)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows the specification of hyphen languages as
    described in the book "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Doug Hofstadter. Once
    defined, sentences may be tested against the languages to determine
    if they are valid.

    I also propose the GEB root namespace as a namespace for all
    "Godel, Escher, Bach" related modules. I intend to implement as many
    of the illustrative examples that I can as I progress through the
    book, and others may wish to do the same, or even explore related
    ideas in interesting ways.

    For example, one of my colleagues has already started on a
    typogenetics module, which would be named GEB::Typogenetics.

  enteredby:   DEREK (Derek Thomson)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul  8 06:23:01 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GEB::
::Hyphen          adpOp "Godel, Escher, Bach" hyphen languages       DEREK
