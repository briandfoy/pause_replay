First Meta is indeed the name of the consulting company that I run but the 
name Meta is exactly right for what I need. I wanted a name without any 
connection to anything that people already know (like DB, XML, Development 
etc..). because Meta is a project to accomplish many tasks in an integrated 
mannger. The name fits right on.

There is actually a connection between the modules and my ambitions for it 
are quite high.

The idea is to develop a full suite of tools where by all information that 
these tools store will be in a SINGLE rdbms (with relations ofcourse).

The tools will include:
1. A source configuration tool (with all source files and history inside the 
database).
2. A build manager (make replacement).
3. A web server.
4. An email client (all mails in the database ofcourse).
5. A mailing list manager.
6. Integrated web application frame work (OpenFrame).
7. A set of XML tools to aid.
8. Database Schema designer via xml description and inheritance.
9. Music manager (with all mp3 in the database).
10. Video manager (with all info in the database).
11. Book library manager.
12. Contacts database.
13. Personal time tracker.
14. Bug tracking system integrated into the source control system.
15. Chess game database.
..... [and much much more....]

I know that this is ambitious but I think that in 2 years you'll be surprised.
To get all of this done I submit a lot of bug reports to a lot of low level 
modules that I use (and a lot of feature requests). Since I'm designing a 
very big system I don't have time to wait for the feature requests to come in 
so I extend each module [Foo] with [Meta::Foo] which provides the extra 
features that I need. Once I learn that [Foo] has the feature I remove 
[Meta::Foo] and use [Foo] directly. That's why I don't want to put 
[Meta::Foo] in a namespace which is not under [Meta] (since I add the feature 
in a sub optimal way and I wouldn't want anyone to actually rely on my 
implementation because that's just a small nail in Meta and I won't 
neccessarily keep maintaining for long - I prefer the lower level modules to 
acquire these capabilities).

The company Meta is my own (a small consulting company that I run) but the 
name strikes me as good for such an ambitious project. I don't think I am 
hurting anyone as I don't see anyone else using the name space or that has 
any qualms about it. In addition the name space is NOT registered in the full 
name space directory meaning that you can only get the package from my 
personal CPAN directory which means that I do not clobber regular CPAN 
development (If they wish to use the Meta namespace they do not need to fear 
colliding with me and only my users will suffer until I stop colliding with 
them). The name "Meta" has an english meaning and it is the exact meaning 
that I wish to convey: A package which pulls a lot of other packages together 
to create something which has never been seen before.

If anyone has problems with my name space I will change it. Do you have 
concrete problems with the name space NOW ?!? Did I collide with any other 
module you installed from CPAN ? Did you want to write a module with the 
[Meta::] prefix and found that you couldn't ? I don't really understand the 
issue.

Meta is a very large project and that's why they don't seem connected. Trust 
me - they are.

Meta is by no means a script and I want the benefits of Makefile.PL and 
prerequisites (did you look at the Meta prerequisite list ?!? I want 
automatic resolution for that - the list is a 100 modules long).

I'm not using CPAN as a work area. I could keep Meta on my private HD (the 
contributions have been minimal so far). I don't need the 0.5 M space that 
Meta takes on CPAN. Trust me. I have 120 Gig hard drive here and the 0.5 M 
space is the least of my concern. The idea is to provoke other people to 
seeing the potential. Take a look at the internals. How am I hurting someones 
time ? did I make someone lose working time by using Meta as the name space ? 
If you can give me an example I will be happy to change my namespace.
