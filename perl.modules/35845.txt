The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Traveller::UWP
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: UWP parser for Traveller RPG
  userid:      RJE (Robert Eaglestone)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    What few game-related modules there are, are all grouped together
    under Games; so be it. I then had a choice to either create a
    Traveller namespace, or RPG::Traveller; I chose the former so I
    wouldn't have to type as much. So the namespace I would prefer is
    Games::Traveller::UWP, though I am open to suggestions.

    An alternate namespace would be Games::TAS:UWP, where 'TAS' is a
    very common acronym in the Traveller RPG ( 'Travellers' Aid Society'
    ) and is somewhat relevant to Perl modules submitted on behalf of
    Traveller. But it's a bit less clear than just plain Traveller. So
    that's where I'm at.

  enteredby:   RJE (Robert Eaglestone)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct 22 04:39:56 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Traveller::
::UWP             bdpOp UWP parser for Traveller RPG                 RJE
