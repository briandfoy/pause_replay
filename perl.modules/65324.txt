the ::Funclib suffix doesn't seem to add much information as to what the
module actually does. Similarly, I generally object to the ::OO suffix.

How about any of the following namespaces instead:

Device::SunPower::Cryo
SunPower::Cryo

The Device:: top level namespace is generally used for modules that
communicate with some hardware device like in this case.

Best regards,
Steffen
