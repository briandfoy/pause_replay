The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::UTC_SLS
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: UTC with Smoothed Leap Seconds
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    UTC with Smoothed Leap Seconds (UTC-SLS) is a time scale devised by
    Markus Kuhn to avoid the complication of UTC's leap seconds in
    systems that in other respects want to use UTC. It is described at
    <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/utc-sls/>.

    This module is a straightforward implemetation of UTC-SLS,
    providing conversion functions between it and UTC. It is compatible
    with Time::UTC in its representation of UTC instants. UTC-SLS
    instants are represented as Modified Julian Dates, which is a
    standard interchange format for this kind of date.

    As with the various modules that I submitted last month concerned
    with precision time scales, I don't think that the DateTime list is
    the right place to discuss this module. I'm open to suggestions.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Tue Jul  4 21:56:48 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::UTC_SLS         Rdpfp UTC with Smoothed Leap Seconds               ZEFRAM
