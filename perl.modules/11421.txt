The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Openview::Message
  DSLIP:       Rdchp
  description: OO and function access to Openview opcmsg()
  userid:      LBAXTER (Lincoln A Baxter)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    There are other modules that are concerned with system monitoring in
    various places SNMP/Mon Net::SNMP none of these are good fits for
    Openview

  rationale:

    A discusion of the name space issues for this module was engaged on
    comp.lang.perl.modules. Reference is made to the discussion with the
    subject: "New module which provides Access to HP Openview opcmsg()
    API"

    Summary: There are other places which contain monitoring software,
    but no consistent place, where all monitoring software might be
    found. Net:: is large, and mostly OSS, or RFC standards related
    (except for AOL and one or two other packages of wide user
    acceptance and general user interest.

    In does not belong in SNMP:: and SNMP can be found in several
    places.

    Mon:: is specific to the software package:
    http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/

    The weight of existing practice and tradition, makes it hard to
    come up with a better location than a new TL namespace (Openview::)
    This package currently contains two modules: the perl XS extension
    to the Openview opcmsg() API (Openview::Message::opcmsg, and an OO
    interface, to this functionality (Openview::Message::Sender, that
    does not require any changes to the user's namespace. It was
    uploaded earlier this evening. I am of course open to other
    suggestions, but I could not think of anyting better, and that
    seemed to be the concensus of those who did engage in the
    discussion.
