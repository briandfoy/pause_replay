If the namespace is already a well established name in the software
world, it won't last long and somebody *will* use it. So it is kind of
a necessity to add this name as an approved root namespace.

I've added HtDig as rootlevel namespace to the database with your name
as contact. Feel free to occupy the namespace but please let others
share if they have the desire to do so.

Thanks,
