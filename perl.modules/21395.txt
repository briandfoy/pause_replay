Er, perhaps :-)

DOM shouldn't imply XML. But you could drop the D and expand the OM into
SQL::ObjectModel, or Class::SQLObjectModel, for example.

It's not trademarked. I'd say the benefits of including SQL in the
name outweigh any limitation it may imply.

Frameworks can be intimidating to use. Requiring a significant 'buy in'.
I think you'd gain more users overall by breaking it up (all else being equal).

Also I think you'll need to address Rosetta::Locale:: in a similar way.
Give it a new lease of life as an independantly useful set of modules.
(And you might be surprised to find that they become more widely used than
the other parts as it addresses a more common problem.)

dbi-users@perl.org is probably a better place to ask that.
