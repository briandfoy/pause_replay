Hi,

I would like to contribute a module to the CPAN.  I hope the following
information
is sufficient:

	Name: Guido Flohr

	E-Mail: guido@imperia.net (preferred)
		guido@freemint.de
		guido@flohr.as

	Homepage: http://www.imperia.net/

	Preferred CPAN user id: GUIDO
				or GFLOHR

	Module: Name         	DSLI	Description
		-------------	---- 	---------------------------------
		Crypt::DES_PP	bdpO 	DES (CBC interface) in Pure Perl

	Detailed: Crypt-DES_PP is compatible to Crypt-DES but entirely
		  written in Perl (no C compiler needed).  It has been
		  exhaustively tested on little- and big-endian 32-bit platforms,
		  tests on 64- for bit architectures is on the way.

	Publicly discussed: no

There may arise a problem with your records: Some time ago I have ported
Perl
to MiNT (see README.mint in the Perl sources).  I don't think that there
are
any traces left of in CPAN but maybe ... Anyway, that is the same Guido
Flohr,
I have only changed my employer and addresses.

As for namespace: There is a Crypt::Blowfish (XS version) and
Crypt::Blowfish_PP.
I thought it was a good idea to name my module Crypt::DES_PP (because
there
is already Crypt::DES) then.  However, I can also live with any other
naming 
convention.

Ciao and Thanks!

Guido
