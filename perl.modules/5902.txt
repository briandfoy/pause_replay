Tim,
I just purchase your book "Programming the Perl DBI ISBN 1-56592-699-4)=

Database Programming with Perl. It looks to be a well written book, how=
ever
I need some advice from you. Do you think you can find some time to pro=
vide
me with some advice.


I am in the process of installing Perl for the first time and I need so=
me
advice from someone who knows Perl.

I have been advice to use perl the do the following:


Window NT4.0:
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -=A0 user administration (add, delete, change, password=
 resets,
disabling logins, login scripts, etc).
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -=A0 user home directory administration and security ri=
ghts
administration (in=A0Windows NT servers)
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -=A0 Web development with CGI modules
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -=A0=A0 File transfer (FTP)
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -=A0=A0 e-mail to=A0other user environments (i.e. Lutos=
 Notes, Unix, Main
Frame, etc.).
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 -=A0=A0 DataBase access (i.e. Orecle, DB2, MS Access, E=
xcel, etc.)


Could you advice me what perl module do I need to install or is there o=
ne
module that covers all?


Tanks in advance.

Paul Rueda=
