The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::SAX::ConsumerObject
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: SAX consumer object for mod_perl handlers
  userid:      ASCOPE (Aaron Straup Cope)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Browse/Threaded/perl-xml

  similar:
    Apache::AxKit::Language::AxPoint::Output

  rationale:

    I am not at all wed to the suggested package name, but I couldn't
    dream up anything better.

    The package simply provides a valid consumer object to allow
    XML::SAX::Writer to print to STDOUT inside a mod_perl handler.

    By default, if no "output" widget is passed to XML::SAX::Writer, it
    will print to STDOUT. This doesn't seem to work in a mod_perl
    context, which means you have to create a scalar and fill it up with
    stuff before printing it at the browser.

    my $output = Apache::SAX::ConsumerObject->new($r); my $writer =
    XML::SAX::Writer->new(Output=>$output);

    Matt Sergeant has already written a similar package for AxPoint,
    but it would nice to have a simple bare bones consumer that does not
    require installing all the stuff used by AxPoint.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::SAX::
