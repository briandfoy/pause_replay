Craig,

The module is already on CPAN.  It's not a requirement to be on the
modules list.  IPC::MM isn't on it either.

It would be nice to remove IPC::MM from CPAN, now that IPC::MMA
effectively replaces it, but convincing the author of another module
to remove his work from CPAN completely is a heavy burden to place on
new module authors.  It's not a normal "takeover" situation.  More to
the point, I don't think anyone will come to CPAN specifically looking
for an interface to mm, so I don't think the name difference is very
important.
