I am aware of the problem, but cannot help it currently.
Some people (I don't know who exactly) have "usurped" the name of my module,
"Tie::Handle", and created a module of their own, which is now part of the
Perl Core. Therefore you don't need to download anything, the module you
probably want already comes with your copy of Perl!

At the YAPC::Europe conference, I talked with the maintainer of the Perl
Authors Upload SitE (PAUSE) about this problem, and we decided that it
would be best if the authors of the "new" Tie::Handle module simply
promoted it to version 4.0, so that automatic downloads would, in the
future, install the "correct" module, not mine.

This should work well because it is unlikely that I will continue maintaining
my own module. Should that ever happen, however, I would simply rename my
module in order to avoid all further conflicts.

I don't know if the authors of the Core's Tie::Handle module have been
contacted and informed yet, though, as I do not know who they are.

Best regards,
