The capitalization of the namespace is quite uncommon. Having a
top-level namespace starting with a lower-case letter is normally
reserved for pragmata which are usually discussed on p5p.

Furthermore, the API suffix seems somewhat redundant: You're publishing
a module, it's always an API, isn't it?

May I suggest one of the following namespaces?

WebService::IThenticate
WebService::iThenticate

Best regards,
Steffen
