Jarrko -

    I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't know whom else to ask.

    I (RKINYON) took over maintainership of PDF::Template from Dave
Ferrance (DFERRANCE) at his request and have uploaded 9 versions over
the past year. Yet, he is still listed as the author and if you try and
install PDF::Template through the CPAN module, you get his version, not
mine.

    What steps must I take to make this happen?

Thanks,
Rob Kinyo9n
