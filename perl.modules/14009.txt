The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Debugger
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Create Test Scripts which Generate Log Files
  userid:      KOLIBRIE (Nathan Gray)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    koha-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Test.pm Test::Simple Test::More

  rationale:

    Test.pm is no longer maintained, and has several hacks built into
    it, which are no longer necessary.

    Test::Simple and Test::More supposedly replace Test.pm, but use a
    completely different interface.

    Test::Debugger is built using the same interface as Test.pm, with
    an added object-oriented interface. It also adds the ability for
    test scripts to easily generate a log file of failed tests.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
