[I know it hasn't been that long since the original message; I'm being
impatient, and I know it. I understand the wait. But part of the reason I'm
being impatient is that I'd like this dist to get up on CPAN because it'll
be required for the new version of my module Net::SSH::Perl, which includes
SSH2 support.]

Hi--

I'd like to upload the following module to CPAN:

Name                   DSLI   Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crypt::DH              adpO   Diffie-Hellman key exchange system.

I'm open to alternate names, like Crypt::DiffieHellman, etc. Just let me
know.

My CPAN ID is BTROTT.

Thanks much.

bye,
Benjamin Trott
