Your request comes just in time for talking about a new option we have
on CPAN when the next CPAN.pm comes out. Unfortunately it's not yet
ready for a release but with 1.88_69 everything works quite well.

The new option is to put a patch on CPAN. CPAN.pm can be configured to
apply a patch to a distribution with the following steps:

- install the patch program
- set the config variable 'prefs_dir'
- install YAML (works also with Data::Dumper or Storable but is less fun with these)

Then a the YAML file that applies the patch looks like so:

  ---
  match:
    distribution: "^MSERGEANT/DBIx-AnyDBD-2\.01\.tar\.gz"
  patches:
    - "ANDK/patches/DBIx-AnyDBD-2.01-ANDK-01.patch.gz"

And, of course, somebody has to upload the patch to CPAN.

Now I'd be interested in hearing your opinion if this way of working
around AWOL seems acceptable. Of course, it requires more cooperation
from the user than that simple emergency release you intend to do. But
it has the advantage of leaving the source where it is and whenever a
patch is controversial, the end user has the last say what he prefers.
RT would be the ideal place to publish the such YAML snippets.

In the CPAN.pm distro you find already this:

    The patch is a reaction to
    http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20807 ; for the options
    you would probably prefer setting TT_* commandline args

  match:
    distribution: "^ABW/Template-Toolkit-2.15"
  pl: 
    args:
      - TT_EXTRAS=no
    expect:
      - "Do you want to build the XS Stash module"
      - "n\n"
      - "Do you want to install these components"
      - "n\n"
      - "Installation directory"
      - "\n"
      - "URL base for TT2 images"
      - "\n"
      - "Do you want to build the HTML documentation"
      - "\n"
      - "Do you want to use the Splash! library"
      - "\n"
      - "Enter name of colour scheme"
      - "\n"
      - "Do you want to build the HTML example pages"
      - "\n"
      - "."
      - "\n"
      - "."
      - "\n"
  patches:
    - ANDK/patches/Template-Toolkit-2.15-ANDK-01.patch.gz
