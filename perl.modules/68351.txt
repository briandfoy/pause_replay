Subject: a bold proposal, add "Science" category to CPAN splash page

Dear all,

I noticed that there is a single, empty, blank space (bottom right) on
the initial table of categories on search.cpan.org. I was thinking,
since there are several modules on CPAN which are related in one way
or the other to science (in the most abstract way), we could add the
"Science" category and list those modules. Name spaces that come to
mind that could potentially come under this would be "Bio::" (along
with bioperl), "AI::", "Math::" and "Medical::". Some of these are
currently listed under "Misc" and some others are not listed at all.

I know this might mean extra work for people so I am more than happy
to help out in any way I can. Any ideas?

regards,
Spiros
