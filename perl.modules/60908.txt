The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::BollingerBands
  DSLIP:       SdpOl
  description: Bollinger Bands
  userid:      JETTERO (Paul Miller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://groups.google.com/group/stockmonkey/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I had considered moving all the technical analysis modules to
    Finance::TechnicalAnalysis::* and registering it, but it turns out
    there's a couple other people contributing tech modules and I would
    rather people be able to upload tech modules without needing to talk
    to me first.

    Also, Finance:: seems to imply some kind of personal investment or
    currency and these tech modules can be used for things besides
    securities and commodities. I use them for data smoothing network
    traffic and charting my scores in some games...

    Because I don't want to reserve the whole M::B:: namespace, I
    intend to simply register each of the tech modules I have written
    and leave it to the other authors do do what they like with theirs.
