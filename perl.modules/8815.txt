Contribution:

I would like to contribute a set of cipher libraries which I have written
- these include Simple substitution ciphers, the Caesar Cipher, the Enigma
Cipher.

I also have a variety of other libs which I have written which I would
like to contribute once they have been cleaned up and debugged.

Regards,

Alistair Mills
