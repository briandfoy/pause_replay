Hello,

I have been watching your releases on CPAN and read parts of the released
documentation, and even though I do not understand much of the suggested
SVD-process subject matter it, I did not find much meat beyond the
description of the supposed contents in the documentation. Maybe you should
add a disclaimer to the included SVD* files that they do not contain
information relevant to the current module but only information relevant for
the history of the module, and can be safely skipped when evaluating a
module.

A second thing that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
"Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is descriptive
of what the routines actually do or what the module implements. I would
recommend renaming them to something closer to your other modules, maybe
"Test::SVDMaker::Util" and "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not
seem to be specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
(format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might even better
live in another module namespace, "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like
that.

Other routines seem to me duplicated effort from File::Spec, POSIX or plain
Perl, as Perl already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode" now :-)) - I
think that explaining why these methods are preferable over the other (core)
methods would help me in evaluating this module. But I also think that these
routines should have their own namespace, as they are not specific to
testing.

Thanks for reading,
-max
