     why:

    I work at a company that writes exclusively in perl. Currently our
    modules are all DarkPAN, but there are several developers, including
    myself, working toward releasing some of our generic modules into
    the wider world. Part of this process is joining PAUSE and CPAN.
    Additionally, STEVAN has offered me comaint of FCGI::Engine, a
    module we are beginning to use heavily and have an outstanding
    contribution toward.
