Subject: Module submission Sys::CpuAffinity
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, mob@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::CpuAffinity
  DSLIP:       bdhfp
  description: Get/set CPU affinity of processes
  userid:      MOB (Marty O'Brien)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    BSD::Process::Affinity

  rationale:

    This module will implement different techniques to get/set process
    (and possibly thread) CPU affinity on several different operating
    systems through a simple standard interface. Early releases will
    work on Windows/Cygwin, Linux, *BSD, and Solaris, allowing
    developers to make use of CPU affinities and target all of those
    platforms without worrying about how the implementations of setting
    CPU affinity differ on all those systems (and trust me, they are
    very different).

  enteredby:   MOB (Marty O'Brien)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr  3 08:14:14 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::CpuAffinity     bdhfp Get/set CPU affinity of processes            MOB
