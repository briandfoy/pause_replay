     why:

    Firstly I'd like to contribute my Bachelor's final project (read
    disertation), which is a website development suite.

    In essence, it's has become bad practice to mix presentation and
    functional code, like PHP or ASP currently do. One implementation of
    this system is JSP Servlet on Apache-Tomcat, but I chose to develop
    in Perl - for mod-perl, partly because I was unaware of JSP when I
    first designed my framework.

    As well as the framework, I also developed some tools to make site
    development easier - if you want to link functional webpages
    together, you almost certainly want to pass data between them, and
    have some flow control. I developed a couple of perl tools to take
    the laborieus parts of implementing this away. You still have to
    develop the code once the basic pages are there - however, it might
    be nice to develop an additional tool to make this more complete,
    and it would therefore be easy to document.

    I have developed the framework to have interchangeable templates;
    for example, if your browser requests an html document, the
    framework uses the html template for that page, if the browser
    requests a wap page, the browser uses the wap template, ad
    infinitum. I have left the hands in the framework to do this with
    XSLT, so the developer has the choice of using XML-XSLT transforms,
    or "static" templates.

    Anyway, I have a basic working framework, which could use some
    further development to incorporate XSLT functionality. As it stands
    the code is functional (needs to be ".tar.gz"ed and needs a nice
    makefile).

    I am also interested in generally helping any perl project that may
    be in need of another pair of eyes.

    I would like to put something back into CPAN, having taken a lot
    away from the Perl community and CPANs exstensive libraries over the
    last three years.

    Thanks for your time,

    John Whitley PhD Student, Loughborough University, UK.
