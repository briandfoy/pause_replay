     why:

    I have two modules to contribute. The first is File::Log. This is a
    module that I have been using for quite a while now and have not
    been able to find another module that does quite what this one
    allows. Here is some of the POD

    NAME Log - A simple Object Orientated Logger

    SYNOPSIS use Log;

    # With all the arguments my $log = Log->new({ debug => 4, # Set the
    debug level logFileName => 'myLogFile.log', # define the log
    filename logFileMode => '>', # '>>' Append or '>' overwrite
    dateTimeStamp => 1, # Timestamp log data entries stderrRedirect =>
    1, # Redirect STDERR to the log file defaultFile => 1, # Use the log
    file as the default filehandle logFileDateTime => 1, # Timestamp the
    log filename appName => 'myApplicationName', # The name of the
    application PIDstamp => 1, # Stamp the log data with the Process ID
    storeExpText => 1, # Store internally all exp text });

    # Or with the bare minimum my $log = Log->new();

    # Log this message if debug is 2 or greater $log->msg(2, "Add this
    to the log file if debug >= 2 \n");

    # Log an exception (ie error) $log->exp("Something went wrong\n");

    $log->close();

    $oldDebugValue = $log->debugValue($newDebugValue);
    $currentDebugValue = $log->debugValue();

    $allExceptions = $log->getExpText(); $numberErrors =
    $log->expCnt(); # How many times has $log->exp been called

    The second module is is SAP::DIME which is used to generate DIME
    Excel spreadsheets for loading into SAP using the DIME utility
