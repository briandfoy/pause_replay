I'd suggest, we call it commissionary maintenance instead of takeover.
That way the previous owner can come back within a reasonable
timeframe and accept or reject changes done by the commissioner.

Something like:

Max, are you willing to patch Net::Telnet and release it under your
name and maintain it properly for a yet undetermined time on behalf of
the original author, Jay, and are you ready to give control back to
Jay in case he demands it? 

If Max says yes, we should give him control ASAP, because this "helps
to safe the world".

As I believe, Max agrees, and I'll go on vacation to morrow, I just
change the ownership now. Max, feel free to upload a new version of
Net::Telnet. Jay, if you read this and disagree, let everybody know.
Nobody is intending to take your module away. It just seems as if you
are not available for maintenance currently.

I'll be back on June, 6th, if anything goes wrong.
