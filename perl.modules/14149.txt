The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TUTORIAL
  DSLIP:       ampfo
  description: In-depth Perl Programming Examples
  userid:      SNEEX (WC -Sx- Jones)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    perl-beginners, comp.lang.perl.misc, cis4dl-pubdis (sf.net)

  similar:
    None, that I know of.

  rationale:

    This name space, Tutorial::, would prove invaluable for people who
    are new to Perl and would like a collective package of examples,
    neatly packaged as a module searchable and available via CPAN. I
    would like to start off with the current example Perl Guide I have
    been working on and expand itto real examples - more than taking
    another book approach, but allowing a culmination of Perl examples
    with which to review and practice key ideas. Each lesson section
    will point to and list specific areas and examples on both the
    Internet as well as book sources. There are many sites on the
    Internet who have already addressed this idea to one degree ot
    another - however that now becomes the issue - there are many sites
    that address the issue to one degree or another -- but no definitive
    direction or goal. I feel strongly that Tutorial:: would help
    resolve and add direction to some of these long standing issues.
