Subject: Request to add new namespaces

I have recently registered on PAUSE as a contributor (under the name
paragape) and I wish to upload some modules within the next few weeks.  This
will be my first time contributing, so your advice and patience is
appreciated.

The purpose of the modules is to manipulate and test Windows applications.
While there are some existing modules that are similar, they do not have the
scope that I need.

According to the PAUSE FAQ, I must register any namespaces that I would like
to create.  I would like to create two new namespaces:

Win32::GUIAutomate
Win32::GUIAutotest

Each namespace introduces a suite of modules under them.

The GUIAutomate namespace provides modules that manipulate various windows
controls, one module for each control type (buttons, editboxes, comboboxes,
listviews, treeviews, etc.), as well as let you use the mouse, keyboard,
etc.  I would name these packages Win32::GUIAutomate::Mouse, ::Keyboard,
::Window, ::Window::Button, etc.

The GUIAutotest namespace provides modules that test the various controls
(and thus test the application), and they use the GUIAutomate modules to
manipulate the controls.  I would name these packages
Win32::GUIAutotest::Window::Button, ::Editbox, ::Combobox, etc.

Please let me know if these namespaces are acceptable and how I register
them.

Thanks!

John Adams Jackson
