The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Inline
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Inlining tests next to the code being tested
  userid:      MSCHWERN (Michael G Schwern)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa@perl.org, TPC, YAPC

  similar:
    Test::Unit SelfTest

  rationale:

    Test::Inline, formerly named Pod::Tests, let's you stick Tests into
    POD right next to the code being tested. Inline tests. Test::Inline.
    It's the XUnit test framework, perl-style.

    I considered Test::Embedded in order to avoid confusion with
    Inline.pm, but "Inline" describes the module better. You're not just
    putting tests in the source file (which might mean after the __END__
    tag), you're putting them right inline with the code being tested.

    Test::Unit is similar in spirit, but is a reproduction of the JUnit
    testing suite in Perl. It's rather stilted if you're not a Java
    programmer.

    PS I put the interface style as "functions" but it really should be
    "other".

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
