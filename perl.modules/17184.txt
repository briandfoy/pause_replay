Dear Readers,

I would like to introduce the new match-making site that has just been created. http://www.babulal.com/

The most unique feature about this site is, it is just for Gujarati speaking US residents only. This feature is the first of its kind. We thought it is important because similarities in dharma, poshaak and khorak (religion, dress and food), are essential ingredients to create a successful marriage.

The other most important thing is, this site is absolutely free. There are no fees for members registration or contacting members.

We need your cooperation to make this site a success for the community. Please participate if you are a candidate and / or forward this to your friends and relatives (Gujarati speaking US residents only).

If you are not Gujarati speaking US resident and / or need to be removed from this mailing list please email your REMOVE request to webmaster@babulal.com.
