I'm glad to for Neil et al to have maintenance-- in fact, I'll do a 
full pass-off in PAUSE... Wait, if there's more than one co-maint 
listed in PAUSE, I'm unsure how passing off main-maint should work. 
I'll leave it alone, and leave it like Class::ISA where I'm co-maint 
in theory, but in practice have no conceivable attention in releasing.

I'm sorry I haven't been replying to email lately, or even reading 
much of it.  Since April (!), I have been moving from Alaska to 
Canada.  This has turned out to be a fractally complex task, and far 
too many parts of it have come close to bankrupting or straight-up 
killing me-- which is extremely surprising since this should all have 
just been a matter of putting things in boxes in one place, and 
unpacking them in another, and doing bits of paperwork, and receiving 
comfortable checks, and living quietly in a nice neighborhood.

More to the CPAN-ish point at hand:  Every day feels like I'm just 
finishing up the /last/ parts of the /last/ tasks, and so I can get to 
/that/ piece of CPAN-Perl-etc email tomorrow (or even open its 
folder), but first I have three fires to put out today, but then 
TOMORROW everything will be fine,... really,... this time for sure.

Until it actually IS tomorrow, and then OH NO, more putting out new fires.

To give you a sense of things: on many different days (I stopped 
counting at three), me "putting out fires" has involved ACTUAL FIRE.
