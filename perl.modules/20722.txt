The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Search::ContextGraph
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A generic contextual network search engine
  userid:      MCEGLOWS (Maciej Ceglowski)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    mailing list at http://www.nitle.org/semantic_search.php

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    This is an implementation of a graph-based search algorithm we
    first presented at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology conference in
    April 2003. It turns out to be a re-implementation of work done by
    Scott Preece in the early 1980's. The search engine builds a
    bipartite graph of documents and terms, and runs queries by
    distributing energy among the nodes from a query node. This gives
    some of the benefits of latent semantic indexing (expanded recall,
    relevance feedback) without the big computational penalty.

The resulting entry would be:

Search::
::ContextGraph    bdpOp A generic contextual network search engine   MCEGLOWS
