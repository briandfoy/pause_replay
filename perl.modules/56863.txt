If you're saying that if "provides" is there, indexers should *only*
index those and not do any other searching?  I don't think that's the
case for search.cpan.org, as I seem to recall that failing to include
"inc" or "examples" directories in no_index wind up with them being
indexed for .pm files.  "t" directories are ignored, I think, but
that's it as far as I know.

Time permitting, I suggest that the META.yml spec be updated with some
tighter "must", "should", "shouldn't" kind of language to make these
kinds of cases more explicit.

Regards,
David
