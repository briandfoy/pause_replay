Subject: Module submission Music::DB

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Music::DB
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Relational DB and stats of music collections
  userid:      TWH (Todd Harris)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    none

  similar:

  rationale:

    Music::DB makes it easy to create relational DBs of music
    collections. It has its own internal schema to represent the
    relationships between artists, albums, genres, and so forth.
    Although the schema is hard-coded, the database is not - Music::DB
    uses a database adaptor based approach for different RDBMs
    (currently only MySQL is supported).

    Databases can be created from tab-delimited flat files, XML files
    (of the sort used by iTunes), or read from music files directly.

    In addition to the databasing facilities, Music::DB comes with a
    variety of modules for querying and reporting on collection. Also
    included at no extra charge or some handy GD-based scripts that
    generate, say, histograms of the growth of your collection over
    time!

    Music::DB fits most appropriately in the Music:: namespace and not
    under, say MP3:: as it can handle more than just MP3 files.

The resulting entry would be:

Music::
::DB              bdpOp Relational DB and stats of music collections TWH
