Subject: Module submission Tapper
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tapper
  DSLIP:       Mmphb
  description: Automated OS testing, also virtualized
  userid:      AMD (AMD OSRC (AMD Operating System Research Center))
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    tapper@amd64.org

  similar:
    Smolder

  rationale:

    [This is a variant of an already approved namespace request
    (formerly "Artemis" at user "SCHWIGON") about 9mths ago, but now
    with a different name due to, erm, difficult reasons.]

    We want to release our framework for automated OS and distribution
    testing to CPAN.

    It consists of several modules to have a central control program
    which triggers machines to boot via network, so they are
    automatically installed, executing satellite modules, injecting
    software into virtualized guest images (usually for Xen, KVM), a
    strong scheduler, some services to receive test results, a web
    application to view results, a DPath driven query interface, etc.,
    etc.

    It is all built around TAP.

    The report collection has some functional overlap with Smolder but
    the whole system is more targeted to run a complete infrastructure
    with scheduling several bandwidth-constrained use-cases over a pool
    of machines, primarily focusing an operating system test context.

    Many perl-related use-cases are also possible, it's not restricted
    to OS testing.

    The code is "quite ok", "medium-modern" Perl -- DBIC, Catalyst,
    Moose, some MX::Declare, although maybe not the most bleading edge.

    We presented parts of it (though under a different name) during
    German Perlworkshop and YAPC::Europe, both 2009:

    http://www.perl-workshop.de/talks/157/view
    http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1950

    We plan to release it the next few weeks; all formal hurdles are
    taken. This time it's a BSD license.

    All in all I think it's worth the top-level namespace due to it's a
    whole infrastructure in itself.

    You can "unregister" the original name "Artemis" at user "SCHWIGON"
    once "Tapper" got approved.

    Thanks and kind regards, Steffen
