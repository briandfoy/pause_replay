     why:

    I do a lot of work with social media. Net::Twitter is pretty cool
    but I found the learning curve steep. I've got a clutch of half page
    scripts that exercise various things Twitter features. I'm going to
    clean them up a bit, add command line options, etc. They should make
    a nice, simple starting point for others who want to learn and serve
    as usable tools from the command line.
