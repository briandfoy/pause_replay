What's the best way to transfer Filter::Simple from Damian to p5p, such that
PAUSE is happy when any pumpking uploads a release?

Given the complete failure of my campaign to gain acceptance for the

Is there anything I need to do to accomplish that, or will you just have
your CPAN elves make it so?
