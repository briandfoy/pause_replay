     why:

    to change password for JNBROOKES account - bigfoot mail no longer
    active

    cannot recieve password reminders, please help

    can the email address for JNBROOKES be changed to
    marshyon@gmail.com at least for now, so I can access the account
    again

    I dont really want to start a new account if I can help it - just
    re-activate the old one

    am assessing my module CGI::Application::GDGraph::lines_ap to
    either build on this or ditch

    I have other modules that will be ready to despatch soon to do with
    managing systems which would have direct use as 'nagios plugins'

    many thanks

    Jon.
