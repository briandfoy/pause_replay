Firstly, try submitting your changed to the author for him to apply the 
changes to his master version. If the owner of the package is AWOL and 
unresponsive (generally over several weeks to emails and other contact 
methods and won't respond to rt.cpan.org bug reports) then we can add a 
co-maint flag for you.

If the owner is happy for you to take over the maintenance of this 
package, he himself can set you as co-maintainer or new owner via PAUSE.
