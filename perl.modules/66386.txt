The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tempest
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: Flexible temperature-map/heat-map generator
  userid:      EVANK (Evan S Kaufman)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Image::Heatmap

  rationale:

    I'm requesting a root namespace for this package because, in
    addition to the Perl code, I'm also working on concurrent
    implementations in other languages (currently PHP and Python) that
    all conform to a common API specification. I think it would be more
    consistent to use an identical name for all implementations, so that
    transitioning between implementations would be simpler than having
    to use a different package/class name for each language.

    Additionally, Tempest is a unique enough name that I would think
    conflicts with any future modules or packages would be highly
    unlikely. No one is likely to write a great new module and decide
    off the cuff to name it "Tempest".

    As for the differences between this package and Image::Heatmap,
    mine is specifically designed to be extendable for use with multiple
    image manipulation libraries (currently Image::Magick and GD, but
    potentially any others as well). Image::Heatmap on the other hand is
    tightly coupled with Image::Magick.

The resulting entry would be:

Tempest           adpOo Flexible temperature-map/heat-map generator  EVANK
