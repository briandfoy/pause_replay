Subject: Net::Ident failing tests on most platforms

Jan-Pieter,

I would like to get some fixes put into the module Net::Ident. Right
now the test suite seems to fail on almost all platforms. I believe if
the items listed in the RT queue are addressed, this would correct the
problem. Spam Assassin also depends on this module and it causes much
confusion during install that the test suite fails.

I notice that the module hasn't had any attention since August of
1999. If you're open to it, I'd like to offer to be co-maintainer to
help apply the pending patches in the RT queue and get the updates
pushed out to CPAN.

I'm not really looking to make any changes so much as apply low
hanging fruit fixes hanging out in RT.

If you're open to this, you can just add TODDR as a co-maintainer in
PAUSE and I will do the needful from there. You can add co-maintainers
or transfer ownership via this link:
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
