The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::GraphItems
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: View-side for nodes and edges of Rel-Graphs
  userid:      LAMPRECHT (Lamprecht, Christoph)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    c.l.p.m c.l.p.tk

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is no module yet, providing similar functionality:
    Tk::GraphItems provides objects TextBox and Connector to display
    nodes and edges of given relation-graph implementations on a
    Tk::Canvas widget. Tk::GraphItems contain a dependency mechanism to
    ensure, that edges are updated on changes of position or size of
    their source- and target-nodes. Edges have view-properties like
    colour, width, direction(arrows). Nodes support (bg)colour and text
    (can be multiline). Nodes can be moved and placed programmatically
    or with drag/drop. To make integration into existing
    graph-implementations easier, Tk::GraphItems contains a simple
    tie-module to tie the nodes coords- getter-/setter - methods to
    given Variables in the underlying model. Bindings to Tk-Events can
    be set so it's easy to implement e.g. context-menus for the objects.

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
