you're right. It's there alright. The registration will not be deleted.
Must be a bug somewhere, probably in the indexer. I'll trigger a
reindexing. If it succeeds, there should be a .meta file and a readme
file in your CPAN author directory (eg.
http://www.mirrorspace.org/cpan/authors/id/K/KE/KENWU/) after the
process finished. If that doesn't happen, there must be some kind of
problem. I would appreciate if you checked this in a few days and
contacted modules@perl.org if the reindexing didn't help. As things are,
"cpan WWW::Google::Video" is likely not going to work for installation.

Best regards,
Steffen
