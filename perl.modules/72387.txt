I messed up a couple things in PAUSE today. 

I was updating JONBJ's email address, but it looked liked his account
got my account's values. I then looked at RJBS's account to see if I'd
see his values or my values. However, I don't recall ever submitting a
change for RJBS.

I think the old way of me doing this must not work anymore. I'd go to
'Select User / Action', then submit the form with me as the user
because it's such a pain to scroll through thousands of accounts. Once
I submitted the form and saw the URL, I'd insert the account I wanted
in the HIDDENNAME field right in the location bar. 

In these cases, something went wrong. You can also see part of the
chain of events when I tried to edit JONBJ's account (although links on
xray aren't available yet).
