After describing the issues on modules@perl.org:

http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg14357.html

brian d foy produced the only concrete suggestion/recommendation:

http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg14365.html

Nobody on libcurl disagreed with the modules@perl.org suggestion, or suggested 
any alternative.

Next best suggestion would have seemed to be HTTP::Curl (along with HTTP::Neon 
etc.), but libcurl most emphatically is not just an http library - I'd guess 
50% or so of usage is programatic FTP, and it also supports telnet, ldap, 
dict schemes, and others likely in future.
