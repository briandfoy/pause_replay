App::BLT       adpfg  biff-like client for twitter.com             MARNANEL

blt is a command-line client for twitter.com, designed to integrate 
helpfully with bash(1).  It makes sending messages simple, and receiving 
them as simple as with the old biff(1) program which tells you when you 
have new mail.

Future directions of the project include splitting out the Twitter 
interface as, for example, Net::Twitter::Tiny.  (It deliberately does 
not use Net::Twitter as it did in earlier versions because Net::Twitter 
is large and fairly slow.)  App::BLT is currently a rather ad hoc 
library without the script which now forms its front end, though.
