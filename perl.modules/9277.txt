Thanks, Kurt

Hi Lester,

    I certainly don't take any offense.  This sort of discussion doesn't
belong on scripts@perl.org, though -- it belongs on modules@perl.org.
Please take it there.

    Regards,
    Kurt

Subject: Lingua::EN::Numbers vs Lingua::EN::Nums2Words

Please do not take this email the wrong way.  I am not trying to be
critical or start a flame war;  I have a small, genuine concern.

I just noticed the Lingua::EN::Numbers module in CPAN.  It has been there
a long time, since 12-Jun-1999, so I have no excuse for taking 2+ years to
notice it... but I just did, just now.

That module seems to be in direct conflict with the Lingua::EN::Nums2Words
module that I contributed to CPAN in June of 1998.  I could not care less
with the one exception that I think we might want to look at maybe merging
the modules, or perhaps trying to identify and document the differences so
that people will know which to use for certain circumstances.

When I submitted Nums2Words to CPAN there was much discussion on the
scripts@perl.org list, with my involvement, on where it should go in the
module hierarchy, if it could be merged with any other module, etc.  
Perhaps those concerns have dissipated from the CPAN maintainers over the
past few years, and if so just let me know and I will go away, but through
my involvement in that process, which was quite lengthy, I gained an
appreciation for why it was important, and still feel it is.

Anyway, I felt obligated to point it out.  Please, no-one get offended...


Sincerely,
