I only received this email -  what did you set the password to?

JV (Johan Vromans) visited the
password changer on PAUSE at Fri Feb 13 19:23:13 2004 GMT
and changed the password for DAVEOLA (David Ljung Madison).

No action is required, but it would be a good idea if somebody
would check the correctness of the new password.
