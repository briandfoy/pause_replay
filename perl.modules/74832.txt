Dear "learn code",

You certainly don't need a PAUSE ID in order to learn Perl, though
we're happy to provide you with one if you intend to upload modules to
CPAN.

In general, CPAN authors register a PAUSE ID with a ID that they will
use to identify themselves in perpetuity and the vast majority choose
to provide their full name as well as part of establishing their
identity within the CPAN author community.

I'm concerned that once you've learned Perl, you'll no longer want to
be known as "LEARNCODE" and we prefer that people not change their
ID's once established.  I'd encourage you to resubmit a PAUSE
application with a more personal ID and to provide your full name
along with it.

If you prefer to have a more anonymous Perl identity while you learn,
I encourage you to join perlmonks.org instead, which is more open to
anonymous participation and is also a great community for learning
Perl.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Regards,
David Golden
