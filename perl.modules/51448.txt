I called it BIOPERLML because most other mailinglist accounts end on
"ML"

Done. Sendu, you should see a "Mailinglists Menu" on your PAUSE page
now with a single menu item "Select Mailinglist/Action". If the page
is not self explaining enough, don't hesitate to ask me for help.

  > Let me know if you need any more information from me.

I just realized that you cannot even change the name of the mailing
list or the subscribe information. There is no form for it. If you
have a mailing list and subscribe information, please let us know and
we will enter it for you.

Hope this helps,
