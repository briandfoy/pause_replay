Subject: Module submission WWW::Newzbin

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Newzbin
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to Newzbin.com's Usenet index
  userid:      CHRISN (Chris Novakovic)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Newzbin

  rationale:

    CPAN used to have a Net::Newzbin module that (as far as I can
    remember) used screen-scraping to search and download from
    Newzbin.com v2. Screen-scraping is now against the Newzbin terms and
    conditions (and the module was deleted for being outdated). With the
    advent of Newzbin v3, some much neater developer APIs are available.
    I've implemented these and would like to form namespaces for
    WWW::Newzbin and WWW::Newzbin::Constants.

    (I decided to put them in the WWW:: namespace because I thought
    they fit better in there than in the Net:: namespace - Newzbin is a
    WWW site, after all!)

  enteredby:   CHRISN (Chris Novakovic)
  enteredon:   Thu Nov 29 20:16:33 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Newzbin         RdpOp Interface to Newzbin.com's Usenet index      CHRISN
