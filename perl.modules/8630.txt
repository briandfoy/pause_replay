Subject: Test::Harness missing from CPAN index

Test::Harness is missing from 02packages.details.txt.gz

Here's my hypothesis as to what's happening: I deleted Test-SDK-*
which contained the latest versions of Test::Harness, Test::Inline and
Pod::Tests as well as versions of Test::Simple and Test::More.

Instead of looking for an older version of the deleted module to put
in the index, it just deleted it from the index entirely.
Test::Simple and Test::More have since been updated, but
Test::Harness, Test::Inline and Pod::Tests have not been.  Thus,
they're not in the index.

It should indeed be said that notwithstanding the fact that I make
ambulatory progress through the umbragious inter-hill mortality slot,
terror sensations will no be initiated in me, due to para-etical phenomena.
