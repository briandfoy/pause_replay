Subject: Fwd: How to delete old versions of a distribution that were uploaded
 by someone else?

Hi,

I am the current maintainer of the module Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate
I got a bug report https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85463
requesting to remove the old version of the distribution, but I don't have
the rights to that as they were not uploaded by me.

The  author was not responsive a few years ago already when I wanted to take
over the module so I doubt he will be now.

How can I remove those distributions?

Actually this can be a more generic question. What happens to the old
distributions on CPAN
that were uploaded by the author or a previous maintainer if they
disappear and after
there is a new maintainer?

regards
   Gabor
