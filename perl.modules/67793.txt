The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Game::Base
  DSLIP:       idhOl
  description: Simple games easy. Complex games possible.
  userid:      KTHAKORE (Kartik Thakore)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    sdl-devel@perl.org, #sdl on irc.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Currently there have been many examples of Perl modules that have
    made many areas of programming simple. Moose and POE are some
    examples. However nothing like this exists for developing Games. The
    idea behind this name space is to provide developers access to C/NCI
    implementations of game Design Patterns and critical Game
    algorithms. Moreover Game::Base will provide a base that can be
    extended into specific Game genres. Finally this will give a much
    need boost to the Perl language as a suitable game scripting
    environment for games.

The resulting entry would be:

Game::
::Base            idhOl Simple games easy. Complex games possible.   KTHAKORE
