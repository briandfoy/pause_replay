The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Verify
  DSLIP:       bdpfb
  description: Attempt to verify an email address
  userid:      PETEF (Pete Frichtman)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Planning on creating a freshmeat.net project entry.

  similar:

  rationale:

    The choice of Mail:: is obvious.

    I have seen a lot of perl that attempts to verify email addresses
    on it's own (usually a poorly-formed regexp). This may suffice for
    smaller sites, but larger sites that keep large databases of
    user-defined email addresses for mass-mailing or even for one-time
    verification may wish to validate the email address inputted as much
    as possible before wasting resources (ie: storage, bandwidth) in
    trying to send mail to the address.

    If it's not listed in the module list, nobody will know about this
    wonderful tool :-)

  enteredby:   PETEF (Pete Frichtman)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul  5 03:45:13 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::Verify          bdpfb Attempt to verify an email address           PETEF
