So, I ran some stats on the archives of modules@perl.org, both for its
entire history and for just the last few months.

About half the traffic of modules@perl.org is from the PAUSE 
auto-notifications (and more than half in recent times).

Looking through the archives at
http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/ I notice that there are
some PAUSE activities which seldom (never?) actually cause any
discussion, and which may in fact be utterly uninteresting to us.  They
include:

- Welcome new user
- User update

Stuff that's only occasionally interesting enough to merit a reply 
includes:

- New module submission
- Module update

More likely to be interesting to us are the emails from real human
beings, i.e. not auto-generated from PAUSE.  We definitely want to read
and respond to those :)

(I'm working on the assumption that replies indicate interest on the
part of modules@perl.org -- correct me if I'm mistaken on that one, as I 
may well be.)

So here's a quick suggestion: why don't we cut the traffic significantly
by /dev/null-ing all the "welcome new user" and "user update" stuff?
And, if we don't actually read or verify the "module update" stuff, that
too.  Or if /dev/null is too strong a measure, perhaps a separate
pause-notifications@perl.org list for those who actually care?
