     why:

    I've written some modules which I think could be of interest for
    other people, too.

    And I hope that I get feedback to these modules, so that they can
    be improved.

    That's why I want to upload them to CPAN.

    For example I've written a time calculator (e.g. 2:42min + 3h +
    11sec) and a win32 module which is able to add processes to a job.
