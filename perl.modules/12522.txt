The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Exporter::Cluster
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: Extension for easy multiple module imports
  userid:      DHAGEMAN (David Hageman)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is mainly for library developers who discover it can be
    hard at times to find a good way to provide a sane interface to
    their library while still using good coding practices. It allows a
    person to create a module that when it is 'use'd in a program - it
    will import several other modules into the callers namespace.
    Example of this module in action can be seen in
    XML::XForms::Generator. It does not intend to be a replacement for
    Exporter, but rather an extension of Exporter (in fact, it needs
    Exporter to really work properly).

The resulting entry would be:

Exporter::
