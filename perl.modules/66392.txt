The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Model3D::Poser::GetStringRes
  DSLIP:       Rupfp
  description: Emulation for Poser's GetStringRes lookups
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I made it for myself, and decided there might be at least one
    person out there who needs the same functionality.

    Not only does it duplicate most of the functionality of the English
    version results of Poser's GetStringRes() function, but it also, in
    the code, contains the most comprehensive list of those strings yet
    published anywhere (except, maybe, you know, running strings against
    the Poser executable itself -- but that's not going to result in
    anything really useful because it won't print out the matrix and so
    you won't see what's what).

    I mean, I can't be the only Perl-using animator in the world who
    also makes Poser content, right?

The resulting entry would be:

Model3D::Poser::
::GetStringRes    Rupfp Emulation for Poser's GetStringRes lookups   DODGER
