The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SVN::Agent
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Simple way of working with SVN checkout
  userid:      BOSU (Boris Sukholitko)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    SVN::Client, SVN::Simple

  rationale:

    The purpose of this module is to be as simple as possible in
    working with checked-out svn copy.

    Its methods are similar to SVN command line utility commands.

    Thus it differs from e.g. SVN::Client which is much more powerful,
    albeit complex SVN binding.

The resulting entry would be:

SVN::
::Agent           cdpOp Simple way of working with SVN checkout      BOSU
