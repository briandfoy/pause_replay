planned contribution: 

CGI::Session module for persistent data storage in CGI.  It differs
from CGI::Persistent in that it lets/makes the programmer select
exactly what is stored, rather than automatically storing/restoring
the CGI params, and it uses MLDBM, allowing storage of arbitrarily
complex structures.

Description:

CGI::Session   cdpO  Persistent storage of complex data in CGI    ZED

I have working code already, and will be soliciting comments on the
newsgroups shortly when it's Beta-ready.

Note that Marc Hedlund had CGI::Session registered for the past five
years; I've corresponded with him and he says he has no plans for it
and that he's already emailed Andreas that this is so.

Thanks.
