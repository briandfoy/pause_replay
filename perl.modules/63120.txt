Hi Steffen,

thanks for your quick reply. I've sent an email to the maintainer six
weeks ago, but haven't gotten a response:

     Subject: Patch for DNS-ZoneParse ok?

     Hi Simon,

     a collegue at Yahoo has asked me to follow up with you on the patch he
     provided:

          http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=24402

     Would it be possible to apply the patch and release a new version of the
     module? We're using the module and would be eager to get the patch in.

     Thanks for your module, it's of great use to us!

Would be great if you could set me for co-maintenance, I'll make sure to 
apply the patch but leave the architecture intact.

-- Mike
