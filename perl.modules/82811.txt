Hi Michael,

sorry for the delay in replying.

Indeed, it looks like it isn't registered. Therefore, you couldn't edit 
the registered-module-metadata.

That's not really a big deal, though. Module registration has long been 
barely a formality. There is no significant functionality that an 
ordinary "first-come" use of a namespace doesn't give you. To wit, your 
"perlcassa" module (distribution) is perfectly well findable via 
search.cpan.org and metacpan.org. It's also available via the cpan shell 
as usual "cpan perlcassa" will install it alright.

It used to be that registering modules and them being added to the 
"official" modules list was meaningless. That was from before Google 
existed, though. :)

So in summary, I didn't dig through the archives of modules@perl.org for 
lack of time. You can either (re-)register the module or you simply 
don't bother. The main use of registrations nowadays is feedback on the 
module naming. In that regard, I probably wouldn't have used "perlcassa" 
since it's a Perl module and including "perl" in the name is as 
redundant as it gets. Not a big deal, though.

Best regards,
Steffen
