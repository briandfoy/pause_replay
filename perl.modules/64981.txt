Subject: Module submission Tie::FlatFile::Hash
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::FlatFile::Hash
  DSLIP:       adprl
  description: Treat a flat file database as a hash
  userid:      MUMIAW (Mumia Wotse)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    FlatFile Tie::FlatFile::Array

  rationale:

    Tie::FlatFile::Hash makes it easy to view a flat-file database as a
    hash. It is not possible to use traditional database routines such
    as DB_File with flat-file databases that have arbitrary formats, but
    Tie::FlatFile::Hash can make any such file accessible through Perl
    as a hash. This module makes dealing with custom flat-file databases
    almost as easy has dealing with normal Perl database files.

  enteredby:   MUMIAW (Mumia Wotse)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar 19 00:36:21 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::FlatFile::
::Hash            adprl Treat a flat file database as a hash         MUMIAW
