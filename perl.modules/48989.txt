  There are already existing separate modules in the FTN namespace (and yes, 
I could wish that I'd known about registering them back when I started using 
them);  & my preference is that modules should be focused on a particular 
thing (however big that "thing" might be), rather than being a catchall... 


>called Net::FTN

  Although there are some things related to Fidonet/FTN that could fit in to 
the "Net" namespace, overall I really don't feel that it is the right 
context.   For instance;  the "Packet" in the FTN:Packet module is in the 
sense of a data file, rather than in the sense specifically of a TCP/IP 
packet, & there is nothing implied about its actual transport.  Original 
(and still basic) transport of the packet files (which contain netmail & 
echomail) is via modem-to-modem;  with transfer of the files via TCP/IP 
being in widespread use now as well, and also transport via email and/or any 
other way of moving a file from one point to another. 


> or Net::Fidonet?

  I've mentioned elsewhere why I'd prefer to avoid the name "Fidonet" itself 
for use in package names;  briefly, there are trademark issues with the 
name, so I'd prefer to avoid the issue altogether... 


> Also, our of curiosity, what community is "PERL Echo"?

  An Fidonet/FTN "echo" is similar to a newsgroup & "echomail" has been used 
for message transport between BBSs since the 80's...   The PERL echo is the 
one where the topic is Perl;  it's not very active anymore, but it is 
available.  (Including on systems that are Internet capable...)
