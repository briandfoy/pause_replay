okay, that makes sense. i usually don't write it that way so
i didn't think about that.  i use string concatenation to force
scalar context anyway.  i use closures a lot so they don't seem
strange to me, but that's just me.

   " some string " . $xyz->(abc) . " ";

i think Kurt has already presuaded you to use Interpolation though. :)
