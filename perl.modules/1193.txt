Hello! I have an update for the Parallel::Pvm module so 
it compiles and installs correctly under Perl 5 (basically
just a matter if re-implementing it in a "fresh" module
setup).

I have been unable to reach the author, Edward Walker.
I have tried both email addresses I could find for it
(edward@nsrc.nus.sg and ewalker@platform.com).

What should I do? Should I send this to you? 

I'm also quite willing to take over custody of 
Parallel::Pvm, but I don't want to step on anyone's 
toes.

Please let me know!
