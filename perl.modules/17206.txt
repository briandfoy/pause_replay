well, as long as i am around, i'm going to know that the namespace
belongs to you.

if, bu chance, it somehow happens, you can work it with the other
person who might have not known you had the namespace, and if you 
can't, someone here should be able to mediate the situation.  no one
else should get your namespace, registered or not.

unlikely, i might be more visible, but i'm certainly not scary to the
other admins.  :)
