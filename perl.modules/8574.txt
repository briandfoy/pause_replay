My PAUSE ID is JOHNSCA but I have lost my password.  What is the=
 procedure for getting or resetting the password for my account=
 so that I can upload further modules?

As a quick aside, the modules I was planning on submitting are:
  Tk::Carp  -  Redirect warnings and errors to Tk Dialogs=
 (similar in spirit to CGI::Carp)
  Alarm::Concurrent  -  Schedule multiple alarms that can go off=
 in any order
  Alarm::Queued  -  Schedule multiple alarms that can only go off=
 in the order you set them
  Alarm::_TieSIG  -  Takes over $SIG{ALRM} to prevent apps from=
 setting directly (helper for Alarm::*)

The three Alarm::* modules would probably be best as a bundle. =
 What are the conventions for creating a bundle package?  Or=
 would it be better to upload them separately?

Thank you for your time,

Cory Johns
