The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::Documenter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Used for generating auto docs of Moose Objs.
  userid:      DSBIKE (David Bury)
  chapterid:   26 (Documentation)
  communities:

  similar:
    PPI does the same idea for standard perl.

  rationale:

    This is a rename of previous request Moose::Documenter to
    MooseX::Documenter.

    -- previous notes w/ some small edits --

    The name MooseX::Documenter is an appropriate namespace because
    this module documents Moose classes. It does what is expected from
    the name and is now in the right place.

    What does it do: it creates from pure Moose/perl code information
    on the class structure. What methods does it use?, where did they
    come from?, what is the source for that method?, what roles are
    used?, etc. It makes it trivial to pull out documentation
    information for Moose classes.

    When, I personally need to learn how a Moose class is built and
    what functions/variables are available to it, this documenter makes
    life really easy. In one stroke, I can see where and how a class is
    built. That sure beats looking at all the dependent class/etc
    manually. Its really useful and currently is not on cpan. --

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::
::Documenter      bdpOp Used for generating auto docs of Moose Objs. DSBIKE
