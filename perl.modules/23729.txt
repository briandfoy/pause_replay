     why:

    Simple interface to MySQL. Requires DBI and DBD::mysql. Is meant
    only as a very basic and simple interface for quick requests. The
    documentation is not yet ready and probably won't be for a short
    time. If permitted, I'll make my contribution in a few weeks. I have
    other modules that I'd like to contribute, but they are not yet
    ready. These include an interface and advancements on
    Time::ParseDate to include date formatting and slightly more complex
    date requests. Also, an IO::Socket/IO::Select-based multiplexing
    server/client module that will enable a program to become a server
    on any requested port or connect to any remote host and port
    requested (permissions permitting, of course). This transponder code
    has been designed for usage on both Linux and Windows. It's been
    tested on several distributions of Linux, Windows 98, Windows 2000,
    and Windows XP. Also there are various little modules like a PID
    handler and specialized log handler.
