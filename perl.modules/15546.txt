I'm thinking about uploading a module I wrote to CPAN/pause, and I 
thought I should ask to make sure I do it correctly; I actually meant to 
do it awhile ago, but never quite got around to it.

The module is called StdDev; it uses the perl OO interface, and has only 
a few methods.

new() creates a new instance,
add(point) adds a point by tracking the total and number of points,
avg() computes the average and standard deviation (as list), or just 
average in scalar context

and string() is just a convenience routine to print a string describing 
the average and standard dev.

It's simple, but fast and quite useful.  I just wanted to make sure the 
interface and name go with what they should.

Thanks
  	-Steve
