     why:

    Hiya, I'm the guy who wrote Number::Format::Calc.

    I must admit I have lost my password and the password recovery
    doesn't work because the address is no longer operative.

    I would prefer to reactivate my old account. If you can't do that,
    please activate this account.

    Upcoming: Catalyst::Plugin::Auto::Validate
    DBIx::Class::CatawareResultset

    Thank you
