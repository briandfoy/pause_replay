The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FileMetadata
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Extract metadata from various file formats
  userid:      MIDH (Midh Mulpuri)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  rationale:

    Metadata is data on data. Such data can include the author of a
    document or the keywords describing the content in a document among
    others. FileMetadata is a framework for extracting metadata from
    various formats and storing such data.

    There are two types of components in the framework.

    Miners : Miners extract specific Metadata from a file. They
    specialize in specific data or specific file formats. Miners
    implement the FileMetadata::Miner interface and are packaged in the
    FileMetadata::Miner::* namespace.

    Stores : A store is used in an application to store Metadata from
    multiple miners. Stores implement the FileMetadata::Store interface
    and are packaged under the FileMetadata::Store::* namespace.

    A predefined interface makes it possible for miners to be written
    for specific file formats or customized for specific applications.
    Several miners can be used to extract all required metadata from a
    file. The stores provide an optional and uniform interface to store
    such metadata.

    Consider an application which needs to extract metadata from
    several file formats - such as Open Office files and HTML files. A
    miner for each format supports the same interface making the task of
    writing an application much easier.

    In the absence of related modules, 'FileMetadata' cannot be grouped
    under any other namespace. It could probably be grouped under 'File'
    but it does not provide any functions to work with files directly.
    Instead it extracts and stores metadata from the files. The
    suggestion for the 'FileMetadata' came from Tim Bunce on the
    module-authors mailing list. This namespace is both suggestive of
    the module's purpose and avoid grouping this module with unrelated
    modules.

The resulting entry would be:

FileMetadata      bdpOo Extract metadata from various file formats   MIDH
