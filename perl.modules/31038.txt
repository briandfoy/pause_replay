If I just see the name, I would guess that this module somehow
deals with the LaTeX picture environment. Can you tell us a bit
more about the module?

Is there a way that you can say that this module converts LaTeX
to an image format, perhaps in a way that makes room for other
similar modules that might convert TeX to other things (HTML,
text, and so on).
