Subject: Module submission CiviCRM::Client::REST
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CiviCRM::Client::REST
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl client for the CiviCRM REST API
  userid:      WMORGAN (Wes Morgan)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    IRC freenode.net #civicrm;
    http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php?board=41.0

  similar:
    WWW::Salesforce Salesforce

  rationale:

    CiviCRM is an open-source CRM application written in PHP. It is
    designed for use by the non-profit sector rather than sales teams
    like Salesforce. It is similar to the 2 Salesforce modules above in
    that it provides a simple OO interface to the CRM's API (CiviCRM
    uses a REST API whereas Salesforce uses SOAP).

    I asked about this module name on modules@perl.org and Brian D. Foy
    suggested this name (i.e. CiviCRM::Client implemented by
    CiviCRM::Client::REST). However, WWW::CiviCRM::Client::REST could
    work too if you all are in the habit of putting REST client modules
    in the WWW rootlevel namespace.

    No other client API module exists for CiviCRM in Perl that I know
    of. This module makes it much simpler to use the API rather than
    using LWP::UserAgent directly (which is what it uses internally to
    interact with the REST API).

The resulting entry would be:

CiviCRM::Client::
::REST            adpOp Perl client for the CiviCRM REST API         WMORGAN
