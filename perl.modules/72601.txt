The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CSS::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to read/write CSS correctly
  userid:      KAMELKEV (Kevin Hatim Kamel)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CSS::Tiny CSS::Tiny::Style

  rationale:

    This module directly interacts with css input/output, so it's home
    under the CSS namespace seems very appropriate.

    This module is going to be an improvement over an already existing
    module called CSS::Tiny.

    The author of CSS::Tiny intends to keep his module dependency free,
    despite requiring a dependency in order to produce correct output.

    CSS by it's very nature is a set of ordered rules, and CSS::Tiny
    alphabetizes the rules, thus rendering them incorrect.

    The author of CSS::Tiny wants to keep his module for very very
    basic CSS, while the module I am proposing will work for more
    substantial CSS rulesets.

    The proposed module will be a dependency for CSS::Inliner, an
    existing module I authored and currently maintain.
