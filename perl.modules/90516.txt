Hello CPAN modules,

Could you please let me know how to change ownership of Petal::Tiny (module
I uploaded some time ago, currently owned by me, JHIVER) to Lars copied
here (CPAN ID LBR)?

Lars seems to be interested in maintaining it, and I've moved to doing
mostly nodejs stuff for now, so I'm not doing much Perl anymore,
unfortunately.

I've looked around PAUSE but could not find any way of doing it.

Cheers
JM
