File-Seektar.gz of proposed first contribution attached - full details in pod.
In short a series of widgets that implement fast searches and extractions of
data from sorted flat files implementing the halve the difference search
algorithm. Several orders of magnitude faster than while (<FH>) { next unless
/$some-cond/; #blah } type searches as algorithm is geometric rather than
linear. Somewhat similar in utility to File::Readbackwards in being ideal for
logfile data extraction amongst other things but can extract data between any
date range in very short order.

Cheers

Dr James Freeman
