Hello Perl module gurus!

I recently registered as a CPAN author (though have been writing Perl for
15+ yrs) and am looking for some naming advice on a module that I was
planning to upload to CPAN.  Here's a little background, which is hopefully
relevant/helpful:

The module (not yet in CPAN) is currently named "Radio::Thermostat", and
it provides methods for interfacing with a line of Wifi thermostats
produced by Radio Thermostat Company of America (http://radiothermostat.com/).
 There is a published API for the thermostat (not very easy to find, but
it's on this page of their site
http://radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced).  The intent of the
module is to eventually fully implement the API in Perl.

This module was originally developed by Paul Roach and posted on his wiki (
http://central.isaroach.com/wiki/index.php/Perl) that was setup as an
unofficial community forum for Radio Thermostat owners/hackers.  He has not
updated the code in awhile, nor attempted to register/upload to CPAN.  I
first posted a couple of patches to the wiki to fix some issues but thought
the module might be more useful/visible to people if it appeared in CPAN.
I contacted him and asked if I could take over module maintenance and try
to upload it to CPAN and he was more than willing to have someone else take
over the module. (I can provide a copy of the email exchange if necessary.)

Looking at the Perl module top-level namespaces, I'm not certain that
Radio::Thermostat is the most appropriate name to use.  (Guessing here but
the original name was probably just derived from the name of the vendor.)
 I thought maybe the "Device::" top-level might at least be a good place to
start with here?

Although it is a little generic, I was thinking "Device::Wifi::Thermostat"
or "Device::Radio::Thermostat" might be a better name to use?
I did consider a specific device/model name (ie. Device::Thermostat::XXXX),
but since the interface does control a line of thermostats, I don't think
that's the most appropriate.  Also thought about
"Device::Thermostat::RTCOA" but something about that name seems not
right/useful to me. :-)

So I'd look forward to any advice you can provide on how I should name this
module.

Thanks in advance and let me know if you have any questions!

Cheers,
-steve
