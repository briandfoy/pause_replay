At first I thought I might have deleted two revisions of  
WWW::Mechanize by mistake, but it's not just Mech:  SOAP::Lite is  
missing revisions.

http://search.cpan.org/dist/SOAP-Lite/ only shows SOAP::Lite up to  
0.60a, but I know for a fact that there's been a 0.67.

http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/ shows 1.29_01 that I  
uploaded earlier in the week, but 1.26 has disappeared.

Different mirrors have different sets of modules.  For example:

* http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/CPAN/authors/id/P/PE/PETDANCE/
   shows 1.24 and 1.29_01
* http://mirror.datapipe.net/CPAN/authors/id/P/PE/PETDANCE/

Please tell me someone's aware of this besides me.

xoxo,
Andy
