The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RSH::Logging
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Utility for instrumenting code using Log::Lo
  userid:      MLUKER (Matt Luker)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    While I find this utility useful, it will most likely just be a
    part of code that I produce for clients. I want to make it publicly
    available via CPAN while not polluting other modules with code that
    may be highly esoteric to what I'm currently working on.

    If there is a better module to stick it in, please let me know. I
    do have several other modules (such as a ConfigFile) that are also a
    bit esoteric--so I'd prefer to just dump them all under a specific
    namespace where I won't be bothering anyone else.

    Again, if there is a better way to do this, just point me to the
    docs/reference/module name and I will re-submit.

    Thanks!
