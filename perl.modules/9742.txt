Hi,

Here is my request to be registered as a PAUSE developer:

name:         Kwindla Hultman Kramer
email:        kwindla@allafrica.com
homepage:     http://allafrica.com/staff/kwindla/
preferred-id: KWINDLA

description:  <<END;

I am one of the developers of a GPL'ed application toolkit called
XML::Comma. XML::Comma provides abstractions for manipulating
collections of structured documents, and generally is configured to
use XML as its normative format for information storage. Several large
websites use XML::Comma as a back-end platform, and we've finally
gotten good documentation written. We're nearing a 1.0 release, and
I'd like to make XML::Comma available via CPAN.

We chose the XML::Comma name based on the "concrete category +
abstract emotive name" pattern, somewhat influenced by HTML::Mason
(which Comma was written to sit "under.")

END

Thank you very much,
Kwin
