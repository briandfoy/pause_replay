Well, here's the mail. I'd certainly like you to take care of this. 
Nothing in my life is certain right now. It can take anywhere between 
weeks and years before I can make any plans whatsoever, so it's better 
to hand over the maintenance of any of my modules to anyone who volunteers.

I think you won't find much interest in most of the modules, but the 
Win32::* modules and maybe the Wx::* modules may gain some interest.

Thanks for the offfer!

Jouke
