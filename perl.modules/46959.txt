The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::MoosePdf
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Module for creating PDF reports
  userid:      JMOOSMANN (James Moosmann)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    PDF::Create, PDF::API2

  rationale:

    MoosePdf is high level module with a terse syntax, built-in
    html-like tables, embedded TrueType font support, CID2Font support
    for Unicode, support for Adobe's built-in core fonts. In addition,
    MoosePdf has api into full range of drawing operators, limited
    external image types ( only JPEG and PNG's with Alpha currently ).

    Another strength of MoosePdf is that it is vastly easier to use
    than any other PDF modules.

    NOTE: I had previously requested Win32::Pdf namespace, but think
    this namespace makes more sense.

The resulting entry would be:

PDF::
::MoosePdf        adpOa Module for creating PDF reports              JMOOSMANN
