I'm currently working on an implementation of a circular mean package, as described
at:

	http://www.stata.com/london/cox.html

I'd like to use the name Statistics::Circular, or something similar.  The module
will be initally released with the mean algorithm, with the option of adding
other algorithms in the future.

DSLIP is currently cdpfd.
