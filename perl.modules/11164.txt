They aren't, if anyone cares.

I had bad permissions on the original file. I fixed them and tried to
re-upload, but PAUSE wouldn't let me, whining that "it looks as if you
haven't changed any values in this form".

So I make a link with another name, changed the URL, and tried again; it
worked. Then I removed the link on shavian.org.

So the original URL is correct, the second URL was only correct for
about 15 minutes, as a work around for PAUSE's obstinacy ;)

Cheers,
Philip
