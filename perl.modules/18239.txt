APPENDIX: School Violence, Youth Problems, Violence Prevention, and Conduc=
t Education in the 21st Century

In recent years school violence has made many pieces of nation-shaking hig=
hlighted headline news, which have astounded the Americans=2E It may happe=
n at any school, at any time, and by students of any age=2E Some experts b=
elieve this is the most important national crisis the U=2ES=2E is facing=2E=
=20

"In the 21st century the problem will happen not only continuously in the =
U=2ES=2E but also in lots of other countries all over the world, if we do =
not act=2E" said Dr=2E John Newton in the late 20th century=2E Recent trag=
edies have proved this warning prediction=2E

"The most effective and proper way to solve the problem is appropriate con=
duct education=2E" said Dr=2E Newton=2E

"The significance of the problem" is much more important than "the number =
of people killed in schools"=2E=20

In addition to shooting and killing, other kinds of school violence, such =
as rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, robbery, bullying, mugging, f=
ighting, theft, harassment, =2E=2E=2E, and other youth problems, like suic=
ide, suicide attempt, suicide inclination, pessimism, sense of inferiority=
, lose of  self-control, relationship problems, emotion problems, drug abu=
se, discrimination, =2E=2E=2E, cannot be ignored, either=2E

Some measures may handle a few "symptoms" temporarily and partially but ar=
e not solutions for education, particularly in view of our responsibilitie=
s for the whole society=2E

Now an effective, proper, comprehensive, deep-rooted and permanent solutio=
n is needed!

The book, "Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century" by Dr=2E John=
 Newton, is regarded as "the very one that can effectively help solve the =
problem of school violence in a right way" by some experts in education, i=
ncluding Dr=2E Steve White, who pointed out clearly: "If students, teacher=
s and parents can learn the conduct principles in this book well, then tha=
t 'unsolvable' problem will be solved=2E  It is not difficult at all to le=
arn them, because the book is a simple, easy, clear, convenient and self-c=
ontained handbook, well designed to suit most people=2E"

"Unlike most books of this subject, it is NOT a religious book, nor is a c=
ollection of old conduct rules=2E"=20

As analyzed in the Preface of the book, "from now on learning good conduct=
 should be placed as No=2E 1 in education=2E"=20

The book's merit and importance have been recognized and praised by many e=
ducation experts, elected public officials, and world leaders=2E Some educ=
ational units, ranging from the level of nation or state to individual sch=
ool or university, have ordered the book as textbook, reference book, gift=
 to students, or as an active action to prevent school violence, to improv=
e education and to benefit students, teachers & parents=2E=20

"The book will also be effective for violence prevention for the whole soc=
iety=2E" said some experts=2E

Hence, to prevent school violence and other violence, to improve education=
, and to benefit students, teachers, parents, & the whole society, I earne=
stly request you to inform the students, teachers, parents, libraries and =
other relevant people you know of the availability of the book=2E

A reasonable method you may consider choosing is to simply  forward this l=
etter to them=2E

Although it will be helpful and appreciated, it is NOT necessary that you =
state any endorsement or the like=2E

Your efforts to prevent school violence and other violence, to improve edu=
cation, and to benefit students, teachers, parents, & the whole society wi=
ll be highly appreciated=2E
