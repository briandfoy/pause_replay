Is anyone monitoring this list for new PAUSE ID requests?

I haven't seen any new IDs for some time and there are still people 
requesting them (including my request which is reposted below).

Thanks,

Dave...

a description of what you're planning to contribute:
The first module I want to submit is an array comparison object. It takes 
references to two arrays and returns whether or not they are the same. You 
can control whether or not white space is significant and whether certain 
elements of the array are ignored. You can also get varying levels of 
information back, from a simple boolean flag to an array of the element 
indexes which differ.
