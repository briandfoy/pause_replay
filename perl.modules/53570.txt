Request to register new user

fullname: Bogdan Lucaciu
  userid: BOGDAN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.wiz.ro

    I do -a lot- of Perl programming, some of my modules could and
    should be used by other people.

    First I'll just upload some Catalyst related work, maybe some POE
    stuff as well.
