Dear Modules,

I have discovered myself listed by PAUSE as co-maintainer of Astro::SIMBAD::Client::WSQueryInterfaceService. But PAUSE lists no other maintainers of this. Since this is an internal class to Astro::SIMBAD::Client, I had expected it to be listed as 'first-come'. On the other hand, if I stomped on someone else's namespace, I would have expected a 'modulelist' entry.

So: Have I trampled someone else's namespace? If so, I'll be glad to rename mine. Or is the database in error, and the subject module should be listed under my name as 'first-come'?

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to resolve this.

Thank you for your time and trouble,

Tom Wyant (wyant@cpan.org)
