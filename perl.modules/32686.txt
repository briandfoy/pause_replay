     why:

    There are several modules I would like to contribute to CPAN: 1)
    GPS::Constants 2) GPS::Distance -- calculate the distance between 2
    GPS::Position objects 3) GPS::Latitude -- represents a latitudinal
    point 4) GPS::Longitude -- represents a longitudinal point 5)
    GPS::Position -- represents a single point on Earth

    Modules related to music/audio: (The Music::* modules can
    (optionally) read/write to a DBI handle.) 1) Music::Album --
    represents an album (i.e. artist, title, year, and an ID) 2)
    Music::Albums -- holds an array of Music::Album objects for sorting
    and searching 3) Music::Artist -- similar to Music::Album 4)
    Music::Artists -- similar to Music::Albums 5) Music::Song -- similar
    to Music::Album 6) Music::Songs -- similar to Music::Albums 7)
    Music::Genre -- holds an ID, name (ID3 string) and the ID3 ID 8)
    Music::Genres -- similar to Music::Albums

    I know there is already AudioFile::Info, but I have written
    Audio::File::Info which actually works with either an MP3 or an OGG
    audio file.
