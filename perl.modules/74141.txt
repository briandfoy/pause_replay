     why:

    RTF::Writer has long been without maintenance. I have some
    extensions to add (nested tables, colors to tables cells, table cell
    indents, autofill of prolog etc) developed as part of other
    projects. Would like to share these with the community, and SBURKE
    seems to have been away since 2005.

    Could I get a co-status?

    I tried to contact him a few years ago, with no result.
