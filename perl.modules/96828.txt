Hi Leo.

I emailed you back in July about possibly taking over maintenance of 
Wordpress::XMLRPC. I don't have any record of a response. I think I've 
found your art blog and will also try to contact you through there.

I see it was last udpated in 2009. I continue to make improvements at 
https://github.com/realflash/wordpress-xmlrpc and test it against 
current WordPress versions. I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
