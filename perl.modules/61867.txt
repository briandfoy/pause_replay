     why:

    We've created a template for munin [1] plugins

    http://sysmonblog.co.uk/?p=17

    We want to abstract the guts into a perl module, which the plugins
    can use.

    We're also working on a "time a full page download" plugin, that
    takes a url, fetches it, tries to extract all the media referenced
    within it (img, js, css, @import, etc) and download all of those
    (recursively), giving you something approximating the download
    time/bytes a typical user might experience.
