Request to register new user

fullname: Jarrod Linahan
  userid: TXH
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://texh.net
     why:

    I've been using other peoples code that I've found scattered about
    the CPAN for years now. Probably time I start to give something
    back.

    Firstly I plan on template toolkit filter (just because I spent a
    good while this morning looking for something that fit, but couldn't
    find it). Will eventually polish off some other niceties when I can
    find the time.
