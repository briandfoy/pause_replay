I'm Giulio Motta, alias GIULIENK.
I'm asking for the reassignment of WWW::SMS namespace to myself.
I wrote to AWRIGLEY (who currently got the ownership over the namespace) and he said that's alright for me to develop under this namespace.
I already posted a request for comment here
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-11/msg00269.html
but got no reply.
Bye and thank you.
GIULIENK
