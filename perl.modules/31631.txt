I think you guys can figure it out from here, but if you decide to 
transfer it:

Under your PAUSE account, go to "Edit Module Metadata", and select
the appropriate module.

   https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_mod

Near the bottom of the form at that URL, you will see a text entry
with your PAUSE user name.  Change that to the user name to which
you want to transfer the module.
