hi
i would like to register with cpan

preferred userid: LAWGON

module to be contributed:
1. Tk::DatePick.pm - a perl/tk widget for selecting a date. the approach is 
slightly different from the existing Date and DateEntry widgets. The module 
has only one dependency, TK::FireButton. The widget supports two date formats 
as well as user defined max and min values. The max and min values can also 
be set to coincide with the financial year or the calendar year. The date 
range is from 1905 to 2095.

2. Tk::DatePickRange.pm - based on the above widget, this enables the user to 
quickly and painlessly select a date range.

3. Tk::DbSelect - a dialog box type widget for selecting a value from a list 
obtained from a database table.
