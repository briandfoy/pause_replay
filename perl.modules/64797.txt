The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Quiz::Flashcard
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Cross-platform modular flashcard application
  userid:      MITHALDU (Christian Walde)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    Since I had problems finding any guidelines on this in the first
    place I don't really know what to write here. I think this
    application could be useful to others and that there is no other
    obvious namespace this could go in.

  enteredby:   MITHALDU (Christian Walde)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar  6 17:19:17 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Quiz::
::Flashcard       adpfp Cross-platform modular flashcard application MITHALDU
