Request to register new user

fullname: Michael Carman
  userid: MJCARMAN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Tk::DirSelect - cross platform directory picker (plan to take over
    maintenance from original author and release to CPAN)
    Text::TableFormat - Dynamic formatting for tabular data (maybe; not
    sure if it's valuble enough) Deep_Compare - Perform "deep"
    comparisons on structures. (maybe; there are already a couple of
    modules that do this (poorly) in addition to Test::*)
    Devel::Truth_Table - Create and manipulate truth tables. (once I can
    get my employer to okay release)

    Note: I actually already have a PAUSE ID -- CARMAN -- but cannot
    access it because I don't know the password. I ended up changing
    ISPs after I registered but before I recieved my password, so I
    can't have it mailed to me, either. I'd be happy to either get
    control of that account or to get a new one and have that one
    deleted.
