Wednesday night (CEST) this was logged on #moose:

19:03  * GumbyNET2 CPAN Upload: Class-MOP-0.80 by DROLSKY

It turned up on search.cpan.org pretty quickly, but it's still not in

ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/D/DR/DROLSKY/

and (afaiu) consequently not on any other cpan-mirror.  This is just an
example, there are most likely many others.

So, is distribution broken?

And are you unaware?  I haven't reported it until now because I assumed some
red lights would go off somewhere...

Cheers,
