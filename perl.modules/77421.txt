That is correct.

Being the person who handles most of the take-over requests on 
modules@perl.org, I'll add that Todd has done exactly that to non-core 
modules MANY times in the past when a new perl release has broken CPAN 
modules.

Let me take this opportunity to publicly thank Todd for doing this 
tireless work. It takes considerable tactfulness in dealing with 
occasionally reluctant almost-disappeared module authors and stamina in 
tracking them down in the first place. If we do not want to leave a 
significant fraction of CPAN in the dust, this work is very important as 
we push forward and improve the core with occasional fallout. Thank you, 
Todd!

Best regards,
Steffen
