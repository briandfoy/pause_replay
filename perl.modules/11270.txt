Dear Sir Phillip:

http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=rpm

I have already downloaded rjray's software (as well as
veltzer's).

From what I can see, the RPM-Tools software is unique in
its method of making RPMs and checking against an FTP/NFS
repository (well at least we can update outside of RedHat
network).

(Believe me, if there had been really good perl software
that existed for that a couple years ago, I would have jumped
at the opportunity to use it.)

I am also very confident about the functionality of my
software (it works reliably and works well with a
reasonable range of possible options).

The current versions that I posted could greatly benefit
from a better API.  For instance, I can foresee RPM::Update
working with rjray's RPM::Database.  And, the subroutine name
"execute" could ummm ... be better.

However, in light of the RPM version 3 to version 4 transition
I am hesitant to trust the RPM /var/lib/ databases beyond what
the command-line usage delivers.

I am very much delighted to collaborate, cooperate, see
my work digested by the jaws of another programmer, etc.

I am also trying to get together some DPKG-ing perl modules.

I want to build my software packages in a one-line command!
And, update them in a controllable one-line command!  And
incorporate that simplicity in a bigger effort...

http://lpml.sourceforge.net/.

Such is my rambling from over here at least.  I do foresee
myself actively curating this freeware, so in terms of
delegated effort, maybe it makes sense for RPM-Tools to
be a separate CPAN package for a while.

Regards,
Scott
