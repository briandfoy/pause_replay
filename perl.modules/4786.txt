Hi,

I would like to change the CPAN User-ID from "ENNO" to "TJMATHER" in the
Perl 5 Module List for XML::DOM and XML::XQL.  Nobody has been able to
track down ENNO for almost a year, and I have volunteered to take over
maintenance of the libxml-enno distribution, which contains XML::DOM and
XML::XQL.  I have already released version 1.04 of this distribution which
contains many bug and compatibility fixes.  I have announced this to
modules@perl.org and to the perlxml list and nobody has raised any
objections to my taking over maintenance of these modules.

Thanks,
TJ
