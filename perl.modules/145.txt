Marshal would indeed be a good place if the perl community would have
driven all the marshaling modules into that namespace at some time. I
can imagine less peope know the term Marshaling than than WDDX:-)

But look the mess we already have

Class::
::Eroot         RdpO Eternal Root - Object persistence            DMR
FreezeThaw      bdpf Convert arbitrary objects to/from strings    ILYAZ
Persistence::
::Object        adpO Store Object definitions with Data::Dumper   VIPUL
Storable        bdcr Persistent data structure mechanism          RAM
Marshal::
::Dispatch      cdpO Convert arbitrary objects to/from strings    MUIR
::Packed        cdpO Run-length coded version of Marshal module   MUIR
::Eval          cdpO Undo serialization with eval                 MUIR
Tangram         bupO Object persistence in relational databases   JLLEROY
Data::
::Dumper        RdpO Convert data structure into perl code        GSAR

And I'm not yet citing the XML module list.

Given the XML background, I'd say give it a try to ask on the XML
mailing list for more advice. I seem to recall that somebody there was
already working on WDDX anyway.

But whatever they say, I wouldn't object having WDDX in the root
namespace. It seems an already established name in the computing world
and it's likely to be extended, so a root namespace seems more than
justified.
