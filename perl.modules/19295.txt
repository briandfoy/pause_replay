The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Date
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: RFC2822 compliant email date-time
  userid:      HATA (畑　正憲)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    HTTP::Date

  rationale:

    The format of date-time expression for email has been changed in
    RFC2822 since April 2001. The RFC822 format has been obsoleted. We
    had been able to use HTTP::Date to gain a RFC822 compliant date-time
    and handle it as a email date-time. But now we should not. It seems
    that there is no RFC2822 compliant date-time generator at CPAN. Then
    I have decided to try to make it.

    It is a very simple module. I think that it may be better to be
    absorbed to another email utility module in the future. I will
    appreciate cooperating with perl people.

    Thanks! :)

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::Date            idpOp RFC2822 compliant email date-time            HATA
