Curses::Application  cmpO  OO framework for console applications      CORLISS

Or, more indepth:

OO framework for console applications, including management features for 
collections of forms, widgets, and so on.  Designed to work with Curses::Forms 
and Curses::Widgets.

Essentially, not only will this remove any need for make Curses calls
directly, but will provide a framework for managing (and automating) the
objects created with Curses::Forms and Curses::Widgets (the latter has an OO
implementation currently in development).  This will include the capability of
dynamically loading forms from form resource files (XML format) as necessary,
instead of having to have the entire application in memory at program launch.

A mailing list has already been started for Curses::Widgets and Curses::Forms
development.  If this module is approved, that same list would encompass
Curses::Application.
