Hi,

It is not clear to me whether hardware-specific modules are appropriate
for CPAN or not. If they are, then please review the following. Otherwise,
kindly ignore me.

Contribution: Perl interface to the 3com OCLM ISDN TA

Module Listing:

ISDN::OCLM::LanModem   adpO  Perl interface to the 3com OCLM ISDN TA

The 3com OCLM is an ISDN TA with a Web-based interface. It is, I believe,
relatively popular. I've written a Perl module that provides scriptable
access to the device. I've also written a GNOME/GTK user-interface for
this which uses an embedded Perl interpreter. This module should be of use
to any OCLM owner; particularly UNIX folks. I've not discussed the module
anywhere; I wrote it for myself and figured it could be useful to others.
The GNOME UI will be distributed freely on gnome.org.

It does not seem to fit into any existing Perl package as it is akin to a
hardware driver, although it is purely libwww-perl-based. Hence a proposed
ISDN::OCLM::* namespace (there are various helper classes).
