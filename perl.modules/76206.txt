     why:

    I have written several modules that assist in web development. For
    example I have a tool for dealing with whitespace issues, a tool for
    building and validating forms, a tool for generating seo urls aka
    slugs, and several other tidbits that might be useful to someone
    especially someone building Mason sites.
