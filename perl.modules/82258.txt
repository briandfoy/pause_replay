Rafael,

First, let me say that PAUSE admins are not here to be mediators for
project disputes.

But... since you're bringing the issues here, let me say that there
are generally two ways that a distribution winds up with mixed primary
maintainers:

(a) "Marriage" model -- two distributions merge into one (e.g.
Class::MOP into Moose)

(b) "Mitosis" model -- a comaintainer uploads a dist with new modules
added (without using "X_authority" metadata or from before that was
supported by PAUSE).  The comaintainer is getting "primary" because of
the act of uploading based on their "comaint" authority and PAUSE
doesn't know any better.

If your work fell under the "marriage" model, then you're saying you
want a "divorce".  OK.  Show me the distribution before the merge
where you had primary permissions, I'll restore them, and you can
split your stuff out again.

If your work fell under the "mitosis" model, please, please, please,
sort this out within the project community.

Think about it from our perspective.. what if PAUSE admins were to
restore your primary maintainer status just for a few modules?  What
then?  Would you drop comaint on everyone else, thus blocking the
project from releasing authorized dists?  Would you release a new,
separate dist with just those modules, possibly with changes that
break the project?

None of these scenarios give a lot of incentive for PAUSE admins to
help, since the motivation appears destructive rather than
constructive, the end result is a broken project, and then the other
maintainers will be right back here asking for PAUSE admins to sort
everything out again.

If you can't reconcile with the project, then the most constructive
thing to do is to fork the project -- release the whole thing (not
just your modules) under a new namespace.  That way, existing CPAN
end-users are not affected by a dispute within the project.

As I'm not here to be a mediator, this is the last I'll say about this issu=
e.

I really hope that with time, you and the project community can come
together, find the common ground you once had, and start writing
awesome software together again.

David
