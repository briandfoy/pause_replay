The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Video::Dumper::QuickTime
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Dump QuickTime movie file structure
  userid:      GRANDPA (Peter Jaquiery)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Video::Info::Quicktime_PL Video::OpenQuicktime

  rationale:

    Video::Dumper::QuickTime facilitates dumping the structure of a
    QuickTime movie file.

    The initial impetus for developing the module was to assist in
    diagnosing issues in software used to generate QuickTime files.
    Subclassing the base class allows further decoding and would allow
    extraction of data rather than a simple dump of structure as is
    currently provided.

    Existing related modules allow access to overview information, but
    do not attempt a detailed decomposition of the structure of the
    files.

The resulting entry would be:

Video::Dumper::
::QuickTime       RdpOp Dump QuickTime movie file structure          GRANDPA
