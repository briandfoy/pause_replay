script info:  Initially I am submitting an open source release from
hewlett-packard.  This is a release management system for web server
content that has been in production for over a year that is used to
release content from development machines to multiple mirrored
production machines.  There is also an associated tool that monitors
existence of processes and web pages and alerts someone if the resource
is not available (and optionally attempts to restart the process.)
discussion:  I have discussed this (verbally) with several other people
and they look forward to the release of this system.
