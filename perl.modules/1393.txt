This is the *fourth* time I have submitted this module for registration, yet
it has not been registered.

I have waited three weeks in between messages, yet no responses were posted
to any of my three last messages. If nothing is done after this message is
posted, maybe I'll move on to PHP.

New Module:
Proposed name Simulate::ConwayLife
(this would require a new Simulate::  category)

Otherwise it could also be put under
Statistics::ConwayLife
or Games::ConwayLife (though I hesitate to call it a game...)
(or maybe another idea?)

It simulates life using John Conway's simple cell growth algorithm.

Module list format description:
Simulate::ConwayLife | aDPr | Simulates life using Conway's algorithm. |
