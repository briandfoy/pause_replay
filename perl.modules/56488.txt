Hi - at one point in time I had a Pod -> FrameMaker MIF application
and module, but apparently I never uploaded it. Should such a thing
ever come into existence, whether written by me, or someone else, this
would be the appropriate place for it. I suggest you keep the
namespace around.

Thanks,

  -joseph
