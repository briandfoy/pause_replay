In the "Four Major problems of CPAN" blog post (
http://blogs.perl.org/users/brendan_byrd/2013/03/the-four-major-problems-wi=
th-cpan.html
), Brendan Byrd raises the problem of tracking abandoned modules.  In
the comments, brian mentions ADOPTME.

Setting aside the majority of the post -- which can continue to be
discussed there -- I want to get PAUSE admins' thoughts on expanding
the use of ADOPTME along these lines:

(1) Anyone can propose that any distribution (and it's contained
packages) have ADOPTME be added as co-maint on the grounds of it being
abandoned

(2) Such a request would need to meet the same standard as taking
co-maint, namely, showing the author is not responsive after repeated
contact attempts

(3) Because the author would not lose primary, if they became active,
they could remove ADOPTME from comaint if they wish at any time

How does this help CPAN?  Having ADOPTME show up in 06perms would give
search.cpan.org and metacpan.org a way to flag abandoned modules in
searches (or to modify search results themselves).  This helps users
by giving them a warning sign before using unmaintained modules they
find there.

Who would make such requests?   Why don't they take comaint and fix
things instead?  Not everyone wants to take on the burden of a module,
but people may find themselves burned using something unmaintained and
might want to flag it as such to help the next sucker avoid it.

What about authors who respond but still don't maintain their modules?
 We can't do anything about that and I don't think we should.  People
will need to find other ways to make that problem visible (e.g. bug
tickets and module reviews).

Why use PAUSE for this?  Because it is the official place for module
metadata and it won't go away.  Plus, we already have everything we
need to make it happen.  ADOPTME user?  Check.  Comaint process?
Check.  06perms?  Check.  We can solve the data side of this problem
*now*.

The only thing we have to do is say that people can propose that
ADOPTME take co-maint following the usual co-maint process.  (And by
"say" I mean, publish that on pause.perl.org in the appropriate
place.)

Then the search engines can be patched to look for ADOPTME anywhere in
06perms and everyone can benefit.  Other sites could be created to try
to attract new mantainers, etc.  And the more visible this is, the
more we might be able to encourage module authors themselves to add
ADOPTME as comaint as a way to signal that they are looking for
someone to take over.
