The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Thread::Apartment
  DSLIP:       cdpOa
  description: Apartment thread wrapper for Perl objects
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Thread::Apartment (http://www.presicient.com/thrdapt) addresses the
    problem that blessed objects cannot be passed between Perl threads
    (esp. threads allocated from a pre-created thread pool). Via a
    combination of introspection and Thread::Queue::Duplex communication
    channels, an object instance (or object hierarchy) runs within its
    own thread, and lightweight client proxy objects are passed between
    threads via TQD's to permit multiple threads to use the object
    instance. This solution is inspired by the apartment threading model
    often used by Microsoft COM objects (hence the module name), and is
    a generalization of the class-specific implementation developed for
    DBIx::Threaded (http://www.presicient.com/dbixthrd).
