    Of the three, I think that POS:: is best.  Everybody will know that it's
a Perl interface . . . .

    I was looking briefly at the jpos website, and I couldn't find what `POS'
stands for -- I'm assuming that it stands for `point of service', but it
doesn't seem to be an official protocol name.  I also wasn't sure what jpos
_does_, but it smells like it supports a network protocol.  Might I humbly
suggest Net::ISO8583?
