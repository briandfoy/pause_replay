Hi, Bradley.<br>
<br>
You&#39;ve run afoul of some very recent changes to tighten security of<br>
PAUSE. =C2=A0Specifically, you need to &quot;own&quot; the namespace<br>
&quot;Convert::Pluggable&quot; to be able to upload a distribution starting=
 with<br>
&quot;Convert-Pluggable-*&quot;. =C2=A0However, PAUSE should be able to see=
 that you<br>
are the first person to upload &quot;Convert/Pluggable.pm&quot; with the pa=
ckage<br>
&quot;Convert::Pluggable&quot; and assign permissions to you on the fly. =
=C2=A0So I<br>
suspect there might be a bug in the recent change to PAUSE and I&#39;ve<br>
copied the relevant people.<br>
<br>
That said, the Convert-Pluggable-0.014.tgz you uploaded looks very<br>
odd. =C2=A0The directory inside is not &quot;Convert-Pluggable-0.014&quot; =
and it<br>
contains a &quot;blib&quot; directory, a &quot;Makefile&quot; and &quot;MYM=
ETA.*&quot; files. =C2=A0It<br>
looks like you just tarred your development directory and that&#39;s<br>
wrong. =C2=A0You should run &quot;make dist&quot; and the makefile will cre=
ate a<br>
proper tarball for you and that&#39;s what you should upload. =C2=A0I don&#=
39;t<br>
think that&#39;s the problem, but I mention it both to help you do it<br>
better next time and to help those who can look into the bug to rule<br>
it in or out as a cause.<br>
