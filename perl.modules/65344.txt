Subject: Module submission Net::Lookup::DotTel
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, zebaz@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Lookup::DotTel
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Lookup information in DNS for .tel domains
  userid:      ZEBAZ (Sebastiaan Hoogeveen)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Net::Lookup would IMHO be a good place to put all modules that try
    to find some part of information using a network connection.

    This module relates specifically to .tel domains as it uses some of
    Telnic's special interpretations of TXT fields. Since the DNS
    lookups themselves have nothing to do with Telnic however, the name
    DotTel was chosen over the use of the Telnic's trademark.

  enteredby:   ZEBAZ (Sebastiaan Hoogeveen)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr  9 08:43:01 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Lookup::
::DotTel          adpOp Lookup information in DNS for .tel domains   ZEBAZ
