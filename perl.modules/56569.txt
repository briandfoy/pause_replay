We have no intention of removing valid registrations, so I'll remove Oak
from the deletion list. I can't give you any statistics at all since
CPAN is decentralized. I think some years ago, somebody running a CPAN
mirror posted some statistics. (It may actually have been brian d foy
and a pobox mirror or so? brian?)

I wouldn't necessarily delete a module from CPAN unless you're very
confident it has *zero* users.

Now, the reason you got the mail is that there is no Oak.pm (with a
"package Oak;" in it) which could be found by the indexer. You *could*
(read: don't have to) upload a new version of Oak with a mostly empty
Oak.pm which also serves as an entry point to the new user. ("For a
tutorial read XY, for the details, read the man pages of yz, za, and
zb...") That's entirely up to you, though. The registration stays.

Best regards,
Steffen
