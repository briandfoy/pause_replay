The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Tested
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Provides HTML widgets with built-in testing
  userid:      BOSU (Boris Sukholitko)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module generates various HTML widgets. It does so by filling
    in the stash suitable for use with Template Toolkit or
    HTML::Template.

    It also provides mechanism for testing those widgets as part of
    template stash and as part of the resulting page.

  enteredby:   BOSU (Boris Sukholitko)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 18 20:43:56 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Tested          cdpOp Provides HTML widgets with built-in testing  BOSU
