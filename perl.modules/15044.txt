The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SimTools::SynSim
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Simulation Automation Tool
  userid:      WVDB (Wim Vanderbauwhede)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    SynSim is a set of modules which allows the user to automate
    running a simulator with various parameters. It can work with any
    simulator that accepts text input files and produces text output
    files. It has support for data analysis and plotting.

    I found no modules on CPAN that do something similar. Therefore I
    propose a new namespace SimTools, under which all kinds of
    simulation tools could be put. SynSim (Synthesizer for Simulations)
    would be one of them.

    Anyway, I'm happy to accept any existing or new namespace if it has
    anything to do with simulations.

    If the name SynSim is to cryptic, AutomateSims is an alternative.

The resulting entry would be:

SimTools::
::SynSim          adpfp Simulation Automation Tool                   WVDB
