     why:

    This is a follow-up on my previous account request. We have a
    module for high-throughput sequence comparison that we would like to
    submit to CPAN to be disseminated among scientific computing
    community. Please allow us access to PAUSE so that we could
    accomplish that.

    Sincerely,
