PAUSE ADMINS,

Please change Austin's PAUSE ID (AUSCHUTZ) email address to
tex@off.org so he can change his PAUSE password via
http://pause.perl.org. I received this email address from Chromatic,
so he should be able to vouch that the address is still Austin Schutz
if necessary.

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo

I requested my pause account be reset a bit ago, as my email address
has =A0changed, but never heard back.

I'm not generally opposed to co-maintaining the module, but I would
like to know your intentions with it and see your code first. In
particular any replacement code should be able to pass modern tests,
install cleanly on a variety of modern systems, and be documented such
that anyone with a reasonable amount of 'domain knowledge' would be
able to follow the logic without much effort.
