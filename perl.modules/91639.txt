The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::BetfairNG
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: OO Perl interface to the Betfair JSON API
  userid:      MYRDDIN (Myrddin Wyllt)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Betfair Developer Program Forum; DIY Betfair Bots Forum

  similar:
    WWW::betfair

  rationale:

    The existing module interfaces with the old SOAP-based Betfair API
    which is being replaced by a completely re-designed JSON interface
    on 2014-11-01, at which point WWW:betfair will cease to work. I
    contacted the author of WWW::betfair (David Farrell - SILLYMOOS) who
    has no plans to re-write his module for the new API. As I had
    already written a module for the new API, I thought it would be good
    to share it. I considered using something under the existing
    namespace, but I am a bit concerned by the lower-case 'b' in
    'betfair', so I thought WWW::BetfairNG was a better choice (Betfair
    refer to their new API as 'API-NG'), as it makes it clear which API
    it is written against, as well as having a capitalised initial
    letter. With two weeks to go before the old API is turned off, no
    other perl libraries for the new API have appeared on CPAN or been
    discussed on the various forums concerned with automated Betfair
    access.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
