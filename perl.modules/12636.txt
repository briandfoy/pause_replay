Hello,

Due to genericness of keywords, couldn't find in archive:

Remembered hearing about a method of naming modules that leave them in your
authors directory but doesn't publish them them into the namespace indices.

I'd like to upload a few things of which there are either already too many
of (none of which are quite right) or I haven't recieved enough feedback on
to feel comfortable littering namespaces with yet.

Thanks very very much,

-scott walters (SWALTERS)
