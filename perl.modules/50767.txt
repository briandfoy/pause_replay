See the archives of module-authors@perl.org, watch out for recent
postings by Mark Stosberg, and keep up your impetus. I believe that
half a year of absense should be OK and even longer times should be
accepted by the community. But what is really helpful is documenting
the issues, preparing patches, preparing new releases, sorting things
out and help others without offending the author. There's a broad
range of helpful activities and if enough time has passed,
modules@perl.org is indeed willing to pass over the token to new
maintainers.
