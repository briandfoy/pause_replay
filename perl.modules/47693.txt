Subject: Module submission HTML::WikiConverter
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::WikiConverter
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Convert HTML to wiki markup
  userid:      DIBERRI (David Iberri)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/HTML-WikiConverter

  similar:
    Convert::Wiki

  rationale:

    I chose HTML::WikiConverter because this is a utility that operates
    on HTML; specifically, it converts it into wiki markup, so this
    namespace choice was the first thing that came to mind. Had I
    pondered it for a while more, I probably would have considered using
    "Convert::Wiki", but that wouldn't have made a difference since that
    module already exists.

    Convert::Wiki is just one of several HTML-to-wiki converters out
    there, most of which are regexp-based. HTML::WikiConverter, on the
    other hand, uses HTML::TreeBuilder to create a tree and then convert
    HTML elements into their wiki counterparts. This approach is more
    robust and mostly free of the pitfalls (eg, poor handling of
    malformed HTML, nesting issues) that regexp-based solutions commonly
    suffer from.

    Another benefit is that H::WC doesn't assume that there is one true
    wiki markup (eg, Convert::Wiki only emits MediaWiki markup AFAIK).
    Instead, H::WC relies on dialect modules to define the rules for
    wiki conversion. There are already twelve supported dialects
    (including MediaWiki, MoinMoin, PhpWiki, etc.), and adding new ones
    is rather trivial (ample docs are in HTML::WikiConverter::Dialects).

    I'd like to see H::WC listed in the module list because it performs
    a frequently requested job (judging from the dozens of emails I've
    received from users), and improving its searchability would help
    others find it more rapidly.

    Thanks for your consideration, David Iberri
