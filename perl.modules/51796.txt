I am easy either way.

But consider these points: 
1) Currently, there is no Graphics::Color namespace.
	Do we want to open one? Will other color related
	modules migrate into it?
2) The current Graphics:: namespace is not over-populated
	(containing only 6 modules at this point)
3) Finally, the modulelist seems to discourage nested
	namespaces ("Please avoid using more than one 
	level of nesting for module names", found in section
	2.5, 3rd paragraph of:
	http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#2)Guidelinesfor )
	Is this still a current recommendation?

All said, I would prefer to stay with the current name.
However, I will change it if someone comes out strongly
in favour of a change as suggested.

Best,

		Ph.
