     why:

    I developed a perl package base on the framework of Bioperl. It is
    a systematic package designed to integrate general Population
    Genetics analyses and computations, with a strong emphasis on SNP
    data processing. It currently contains: modules for routine
    processes and manipulation of SNP data, I/O parsers for many
    different formats, a rich collection of Population Genetics
    computations, a queue of wrappers for various third-part programs
    and algorithms, and some graphic tools. Please notice this is the
    same description as what I submitted a few days ago for an account
    name POPMXTM. I was confused about the account ID at that time and
    now I want to change it to this one KTANG. Hope this is ok. Sorry
    for the trouble
