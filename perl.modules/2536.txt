I have a module which I've written which allows you to call subroutines
with names which only approximately match their real names. I
realise that this is a completely stupid think to do but I wrote
it as a demonstration of using typeglobs and AUTOLOAD.

Currently I've been calling it Sub::Approx, but having uploaded
it to PAUSE I realise that this will require the creation of
a new namespace on CPAN as the Sub:: space doesn't already exist.

Can someone please either a) tell me how I'd go about getting
the namespace created or b) suggest a better name for the module.

Many thanks,

Dave...
