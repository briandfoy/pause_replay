The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Zeta
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Generic code foundation for various purposes
  userid:      ZETA (Gregory S. Youngblood)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    mailing list

  similar:
    Uses (and provides some similar functions to) DBI, CGI, and a few
    others

  rationale:

    The name Zeta was chosen after it was suggested it would be a
    better choice than my original name. Zeta is a collection of modules
    that I have put together and used over the years in several
    utilities, tools, and web applications.

    It is a foundation that can be used to quickly create anything from
    a quick command line tool to complete web applications. One of the
    features I use most frequently is the database interface. It
    provides methods to connect to and access a database using minimal
    code.

    Some of the code dates almost ten years. Until recently, this code
    was licensed to my customers, and with rare exceptions, has not been
    widely or publicly released as a stand alone package. I am in the
    process of cleaning up some older code, as well as working on some
    newer projects, all of which will use Zeta and be released as GPL,
    and I would like to separate the foundation code as a separate, CPAN
    accessable module.

    It provides methods from a variety of categories, not just CGI or
    DBI. It is meant to function as a complete package, and not be split
    up under several other modules.

The resulting entry would be:
