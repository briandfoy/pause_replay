Absolutely annouce to use.perl and perlmonks. In fact, I'd say to make
an announcement, wait a week (or two), then go for it.  I can make an
announcement in other places too once I see what you submit for
use.perl.

At the worst, we just have to re-register a lot of namespaces and face
the wrath of a lot of people. :)
