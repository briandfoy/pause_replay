The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::EasyTCP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Easy, secure, compressed TCP clients+servers
  userid:      MNAGUIB (Mina Naguib)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    comp.lang.*, #perl on EfNet, CVS repository exists but is not public
    yet but will be soon

  similar:
    Socket IO::Socket IO::Socket::INET Storable Compress::Zlib
    Compress::LZF Crypt::RSA Crypt::CBC Crypt::Rijndael Crypt::RC6
    Crypt::Blowfish Crypt::DES_EDE3 Crypt::DES Crypt::CipherSaber
    Crypt::Random

  rationale:

    The module has been around for a while and is being used by a few
    people. I'd like to register the namespace Net::EasyTCP since it's a
    logical categorization of the module's features.

    In regards to the above question, there are many modules on CPAN
    that do IPC, encryption, compression, serializing complex
    structures, etc... However nothing that easily strings them together
    into an easy to use package. That's what this module does and has
    been extremely helpful to myself and others for rapid deployment of
    many systems that need to talk to each other.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::EasyTCP         RdpOp Easy, secure, compressed TCP clients+servers MNAGUIB
