I won't need CVS or co-maintainership if you can take 20 seconds to:

1) log into pause and go to "Upload a file to CPAN" which is:
   https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri

2) enter
   http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Attachment/188327/67617/Apache-Admin- 
Config-0.93.tar.gz
into the field "If you want me to fetch a file from an URL, enter the  
full URL here."

3) press the button "upload this URL"

Please do this ASAP, the bug is causing many many problems and will  
take only seconds to resolve, thank you Olivier :)
