Brian,

I pointed you to the link to help give you context to
the problem I'm attacking: numerically solving (or
finding a root) of a single variable nonlinear
equation.  I'm not implementing the exact algorithms
in gsl, do not have the same API functions, and am
definitely not linking into the gsl C library (like
Math::Gsl).  I'm doing this from scratch based on the
publically known algorithms using my own
object-oriented API.

The reason for the name "Solver1" is "solver" for
numerically solving general (nonlinear) equations and
"1" for 1-dimensional (or one variable).  I was
thinking a "SolverN" package would be for
N-dimensional.

I'm quite open to another name.  I was thinking I
should put the base class (i.e. Math::Solver1.pm) one
level up from the sub-classes (i.e.
Math::Solver1::Bisect.pm), but I guess they could be
put on the same level.  If they are put in the same
level, it seems like they need to be in a directory
for either a) 1-d root finders, b) root finders (1-d
or N-d), or c) nonlinear programming (root finding is
part of the general nonlinear programming problem).
