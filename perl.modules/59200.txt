From: jand@activestate.com ("Jan Dubois")

I would like to bring this module up-to-date, add 5.10 repositories etc (it is actually
being used by PPM4 in ActivePerl: `ppm repo suggest` lists repositories registered
with PPM::Repositories, and their short names can be used with `ppm repo add` instead
of typing the full URL).

I've emailed the original author at crazyinsomniac@yahoo.com to ask about this,
but never got an answer.

The CPAN directory has not been updated since 2005:

    http://search.cpan.org/~podmaster/

I think both "podmaster" and "crazyinsomniac" were handles used by the author
on PerlMonks. Neither have been used in almost 2 years:

    http://www.perlmonks.com/?node=podmaster
    http://www.perlmonks.com/?node=crazyinsomniac

It looks like the module has been abandoned.

My CPAN author id is JDB.

Cheers,
-Jan
