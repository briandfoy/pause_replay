Hello

I wrote a new module [1] for manipulating OCS [2] datasets. I called it
XML::OCS, as it was a sort of sister / brother of XML::RSS, which is for RSS
files (which is one of the many things that OCS datasets describe).

I announced it to the Perl-XML list, and a comment or two was made about the
fact that XML:: is now (? was always ?) reserved for modules specifically
dealing with XML as an end in itself, rather than an application of XML
(means to an end). This is fair enough, but currently XML::RSS remains in
XML:: namespace (I have no problem with that - Jonathan's module is well
established).

We debated the namespace issue, and I think Metadata:: would be appropriate
for my module. This was also suggested by the author of the OCS standard Ian
Davis.

Matt Sergeant and Ken Macleod copied this email address on some of their
posts to the Perl-XML list on this debate.

I had also thought of Syndication:: but this is too narrow and doesn't
reflect what OCS is and is becoming.

I was wondering generally: (a) if you had any thoughts on this, and
specifically: (b) whether you think Metadata:: is OK. OCS is essentially
data about RSS, Scripting News, CDF, and CGI-GET-based services (a la
Meerkat, for example), which itself is data (or pointers) to the 'end' data,
so there's definitely one or two metas in there ;-)

Kind regards, and looking forward to hearing from you

DJ Adams
