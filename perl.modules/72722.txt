Subject: Moving Sys::HostIP maintainer status to me

Dear PAUSE administrators,

I've recently contacted Jon Schatz who is in charge of Sys::HostIP after
noticing a few important bugs that were left unattended.
I've offered to help review patches, fix stuff and take care of releases. He
offered moving the module ownership to me.

I would like to ask you to please grant me ownership status over the module
Sys::HostIP.

I've included at the bottom of the email the original (and untouched) email
exchange we've had to illustrate his permission to move the module ownership
to me.

Thank you,
S.

P.S.,
If this is the wrong address, my apologies. Feel free to direct me to the
right place!

Hi Jonathan,<br>
<br>
I got bit by a nasty bug in Sys::HostIP that seems like it&#39;s waiting in=
<br>
the queue for a very long time.<br>
I also noticed there are a few more stuff waiting there (and that the<br>
.tar.gz distribution structure isn&#39;t very optimal).<br>
<br>
You&#39;re probably too busy to update the project.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if I could get co-maintainer status so I could update<br>
the software, patch it up, document, fix it and both upload new versions<br=

<br>
What say you?<br>
