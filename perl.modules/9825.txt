Short description of contribution:

I have written an interface to the BIO portion of the openssl libraries. By 
using this high-level interface, it is possible to access several types of 
encryption using 1 of 4 modes: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB. You also have access to 
several types of message digests: MD2, MDC2, MD5, SHA and SHA1.

These are all implemented as separate Perl modules that use BIO.pm, which 
does nothing more than bootstraps the C code.



Thanks,

Shay
