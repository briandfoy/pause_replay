     why:

    Hi, I have some usefull perl modules which I want to share on CPAN.
    Some are already distributed from my site but CPAN is a better
    central place. Here are some of them: - Apache2::ModProxyPerlHtml -
    Apache2::AuthenCacheLDAP ... (my site: http://www.samse.fr/GPL/)

    Initially I want to move them to SourceForge but as they are pure
    Perl modules CPAN is the place I think, don't you ?
