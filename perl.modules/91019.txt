     why:

    Hello, I have been writing Perl on and off since the late 90s. For
    the last 5.5 years Perl has been my main language at work. Lately
    I've had more interest in, and have made more time for, side
    projects, and right now I'm working on some code to analyze my
    personal stock account transaction history. I didn't find anything
    related on CPAN to what I'm doing, so I thought I would write my
    own, and it might be nice to share it with others.

    See http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1095190 and PrePAN (I'm
    apparently only allowed to include one URL) for some of my initial
    planning on this. The code is still in development, but I'm trying
    to organized it in the appropriate directories and work toward
    uploading it, and getting this account is one step in the process.

    Please feel free to email me if you have any questions, advice, or
    concerns.

    Thank you,

    John
