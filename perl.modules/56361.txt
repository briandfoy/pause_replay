Yes, I never got around to completing that module.  I have some trial
code for it, but I haven't touched it in months.  This is why for
all my other modules I implemented first and only applied to register
the namespace when I had a module published or about to be published.
I guess I should stick to that pattern.

It's no doubt best to remove Authen::OTP from the module list for now.
I may work on the module again in the future, and we can revisit the
registration then.
