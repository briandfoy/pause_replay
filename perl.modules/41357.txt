     why:

    I have an OO module called Log::Simple. It provides a simple, yet
    flexible interface for writing logfiles. Most of the flexibility
    comes from the ability to assign callbacks to process data before
    recording it. Callbacks can also be overridden on any call to the
    log object.

    Examples of usage: $log->entry("Something happened");
    $log->exit("Alas, poor process, I knew me well.", 23);

    $log->entry($hash_ref, sub { Dumper @_ });

    $log->format( sub{ Dumper @_ } ); $log->entry( $hashref );

    I am happy to supply you with the full POD or distribution for
    further inspection.
