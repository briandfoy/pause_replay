The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::TransactHash
  DSLIP:       RupOg
  description: Allows edits on a hash without disturbing it
  userid:      MIKEDLR (Michael De La Rue)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    In distribution.

  similar:
    Tie::IxHash - used.

  rationale:

    Namespace: the interface provides a tied hash and also is designed
    to affect hashes. TransactHash because it works in a way somewhat
    similar to a transactional database, leaving the underlying hash
    intact until a commit is called.

    Unique: Whilst IxHash does provide ordered hashes and could be
    built on top of another database types, this would need
    pre-planning. Tie::TransactHash is designed to edit any already
    existing hash.

    Value: This is the only module allowing easy editing of existing
    hashes which is particularly useful in editing and examining DB
    files on disk e.g. for creating test cases for other software.
    During editing it is easy to understand the underlying hash because
    its order is not changed.

    P.S. No support means that I read email irregularly and so wouldn't
    be much help. It doesn't mean I wouldn't accept patches or even
    answer questions if I saw them early enough between the junkmail..

The resulting entry would be:
