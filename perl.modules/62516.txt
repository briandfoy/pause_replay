Well, I'd be perfectly happy with ::OpenGL::POGL personally.

Though it'd help if we could get in touch with the POGL project and explain
that using a top-level namespace of "OpenGL" is spectacularly silly and that
if the name's something else then it should probably be called
Graphics::OpenGL::POGL - at which point the names obviously match, searching
for POGL on search.cpan.org will produce much clearer results and life gets
simpler.

If we can't convince them to use a sensible namespace and continue with the
duff choice, then things get a bit murkier and ::OpenGL::Perl is probably
just as good since we're referring to "the OpenGL perl module" - CPAN
naming references are usually better using module names rather than project
names when the two bear no relation to each other.
