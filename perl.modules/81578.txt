Subject: Module submission Tk::TipEntry

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::TipEntry
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: An entry with tooltip inside when it's empty
  userid:      ASB (Alexander Becker)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    prepan.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module is located in the Tk namespace, because it's an
    extention of the Tk module. It provides a new widget with new
    functionality. There was no othe rmodule with this functionality and
    it is quite a bunch of work to implement it. However, it's something
    that is found as a usual widget in other places (e.g. HTML +
    jQuery).

  enteredby:   ASB (Alexander Becker)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 30 21:45:38 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::TipEntry        adphp An entry with tooltip inside when it's empty ASB
