This is the first time I have released a module so bear with me.

I have received notification that my module has been indexed and it is
out on pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id but I do not see it on
search.cpan.org and PAUSE's "Edit Module Metadata" does not show that I
have any modules registered. I don't mean to press, but about how long
will it take for the module to show up? Is there something else I need
to do?

Cheers,
Brandon
