Most likely, it would be best to just take over PDF::Table.

Could you please write a separate email direct to this list with a 
subject of "Taking over PDF::Table" detailing:

1. How you tried to contact him.
2. How many times over what period of time.
3. Any other details you think are pertinant to the situation.

Generally, we ask that people try several time over several weeks, and 
if at all possible check for alternative contact methods such as telephone.

Thanks
