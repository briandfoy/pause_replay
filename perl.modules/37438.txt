The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mobile::UserAgent
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Mobile user agent string parsing class.
  userid:      CMANLEY (Craig Manley)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    HTTP::MobileAgent

  rationale:

    == The "Mobile" root namespace ==: At the moment if you search CPAN
    for the text 'mobile', then you'll find mobile / wireless related
    modules scattered through numerous root namespaces. I think a root
    name such as 'Mobile' may be a good choice to keep all Mobile &
    Wireless modules together, especially since one can expect increase
    in the number of these modules being developed from now on.

    == The (not so) similar class HTTP::MobileAgent ==: It's
    description is similar, but it's functionality is very limited (and
    basically useless) compared to the class I've already developed for
    PHP5 and want to port to Perl. These are the 2 URL's to the PHP
    version: http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/2000.html
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobileuseragent/ The name choice of
    HTTP::MobileAgent isn't perfect seeing that user-agent parsing
    doesn't necessarily have to take place in HTTP apps (a real example
    is a cron job that parses useragents in log files/tables looking).

    == Alternative root space ideas ==: I've thought about using these
    root namespaces which exist but none are perfect: 1. GSM: this is a
    protocol. Mobile phones don't necessarily use GSM, especially the
    newer generations. 2. HTTP: useragent parsing hasn't got much or
    anything to do with the HTTP protocol. 3. Net: useragent parsing
    hasn't got much or anything to do with the networking.

    I've got more useful mobile & wireless classes that I may submit in
    the future but I must first decide if I want to opensource them. If
    I do, I'll need a good root namespace choice for them too.

The resulting entry would be:

Mobile::
::UserAgent       bdpOp Mobile user agent string parsing class.      CMANLEY
