The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::JavaScript::Compactor
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Methods to compact javascript source.
  userid:      UNRTST (Joshua I. Miller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Comments::Plugin::JavaScript

  rationale:

    Data::JavaScript::Compactor provides methods to compact javascript
    source down to just what is needed. It can remove all comments, put
    everything on one line (semi-)safely, and remove extra whitespace.
    It breaks the process down into individual steps, and one can pick
    and choose what parts to complete to get a custom amount of
    compactness.

    There are lots of javascript compactor's, but few that are good,
    free (perl artistic license or gpl), and moduler. Many of the free
    ones I encountered, broke in almost all situations.

    I debated using Data::Compactor::* as a namespace, but I don't see
    the a future need for a compacting framework that would support
    other languages (all the code compactors I've found have been for
    javascript alone). It seemed more fitting to place it under the
    existing Data::JavaScript namespace, as a tool that manipulates data
    in javascript form.

    This module can also be useful to other modules, such as
    "File::Comments", as an improved replacement for it's
    ::Plugin::JavaScript support which, currently, does not properly
    support all comment types. (note: the methods in this module won't
    just drop in and work in File::Comments just yet, but the framework
    is there for that type of support).

    Thanks for your time. I hope you find this module useful. -- Josh
    I.
