The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SAFT::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Create archival finding aids using SAFT-XML
  userid:      MHO (Martin Hoppenheit)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    MARC

  rationale:

    SAFT is a XML format for encoding archival finding aids, used
    primarily in Germany (like EAD in the US, distantly related to MARC
    in libraries). Archives use it to exchange metadata of their
    collections or to publish these metadata in web portals.

    Since not every possibility the SAFT DTD allows is covered by the
    module (and probably never will) I decided to name it SAFT::Simple.

    I've found no rootlevel namespace where this module might fit in
    (cf. the module MARC, which also uses a rootlevel namespace). I
    thought of XML::SAFT::Simple, but this would seem like the module
    could be used to do some general XML related stuff - which it
    cannot.

The resulting entry would be:

SAFT::
::Simple          RdpOp Create archival finding aids using SAFT-XML  MHO
