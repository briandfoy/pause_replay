Hi Andreas,

Quite a while ago we had a discussion concerning namespace issues with
my URI::Bookmarks suite of Perl modules (last e-mail in the discussion
is quoted below).  I'm currently extending the suite to provide
support for Mozilla, Lynx and Internet Explorer, so I'd really like to
get these namespace issues cleared up as soon as possible.  If you
still aren't happy with my naming decisions (despite my best efforts
to convince you in the text below ;-) then let me know what I can do
to resolve the problem and I'll get to work on it straight away.  If
on the other hand I've managed to persuade you, could the suite can be
registered on the module list please?

Cheers,

Adam
