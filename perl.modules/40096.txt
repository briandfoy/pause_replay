And if it not just Perl6-specific and doesn't rely on anything evil like 
source filters or what have you, you might consider also doing it as 
junctions.pm.

use junctions;
use junctions 'all';

But modules using pragma-style like that will want to be VERY stable and 
non-evil. Perhaps Perl6::Junctions for starters, and migrate to juntions 
later on after 6 months of people trying to reviewing?
