The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Payroll
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Payroll processing pipeline via XML
  userid:      JAMESP (James A. Pattie)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://pcxpayroll.sf.net/

  similar:

  rationale:

    We developed this module to allow us to process our payroll taxes
    here in the US, Missouri to be exact. We have uploaded it already to
    CPAN, but would like it officially accepted into the module list.

    The framework is such, that hopefully any country in the world
    could plug in the corresponding country module and any city/state
    modules they need and be able to process their payroll. Definitely
    the US is doable (by design), once someone implements the necessary
    info for their specific state and city taxes.

    I'm selecting the Miscellaneous Modules section as none of the
    listed sections come close to representing the nature of this
    module.

    Thanks for your consideration.
