Hello PAUSE people,

A month ago I become a maintainer of Data::Flow package.
Everything is OK, as the module is currently available in its latest release.
There's only author info that is missing on the CPAN
http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Data-Flow says only RADOS (my ID) ?!

.... and 
While digging the docs (the above may be a my mistake after all)
I found that each of the download links on the page:
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_04about

produce

Not Found
The requested URL /authors/00whois.html was not found on this server.

Sorry if bother you with problems you're aware of.

Have a nice day!
Rado
