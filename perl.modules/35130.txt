Ilike that name better, but...

I don't like the idea of a "Solar" top level namespace.  It's not
encompassing like Physics, Chemistry, Astro, or Bio (but then, 
apparently neither is the subject area), and there's not something
to give away that "Solar" means "dealing with the Sun" instead of
something else (especially since most poeple won't know what VSO is).

But, it's really not that bad of a name, and I guess it will have
to do if we can't fit it anywhere else.  Geo::* already exists.  Maybe
we'll get Martian::* and Venutian::* next :)

Anyone else have any ideas?
