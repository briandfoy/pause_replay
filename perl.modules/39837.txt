Subject: Module submission File::Rename

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Rename
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Renaming multiple files: based on eg/rename
  userid:      RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Copy

  rationale:

    The script in this distribution is called "rename" because it has
    been developed from the script "eg/rename" in the Perl distribution
    (when eg/ was in the Perl distribution).

    Namespace - its for renaming files: hence File:: - the script is
    called rename: hence ::Rename

    An earlier version of the "rename" script is available for linux,
    so the module should be listed so there is an obvious point for
    maintenance.

  enteredby:   RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 21 12:16:06 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Rename          bdpfp Renaming multiple files: based on eg/rename  RMBARKER
