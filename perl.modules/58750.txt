The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWikiFCK
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Graphic interface for FCKeditor on DokuWiki
  userid:      TURNERMM (Myron Turner)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    dokuwiki@freelists.org

  similar:
    HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki

  rationale:

    DokuWikiFCK subclasses HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki in order to
    support the FCKeditor. HTML::WikiConverter::DokuWiki converts
    DokuWiki's HTML into standard DokuWik markup. The aim of DokuWikiFCK
    is to support as many as possible of the graphic capabilities of the
    FCKeditor, converting the HTML inso and extended markup set that
    enables gives users of DokuWiki access to graphic layout and design
    features. DokuWikiFCK currently supports font selection, color
    choice (text-color and background-color), tables, lists, text sizes
    and weights, block elements, etc. In all of these it is possible to
    apply, where applicable, background colors (as in tables) and all
    font attributes.

    It supports both text and image positioning. The FCKeditor enables
    a number of fixed positioning features: --left, right, and center
    justification and fixed pixel width indents and outdents.
    DokuWikiFCK supports all of these. One of its unique features is
    that it supports space-bar positioning--i.e. pushing elements to the
    right one space at a time and movingg them backward with the delete
    key.
