The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Names
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Person name parsing & normalization
  userid:      DBOURGET (David Bourget)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides unique subroutines for parsing lists of person
    names and normalizing their constituent names. This is useful mainly
    as part of a citation parsing system. This module has been developed
    and fine-tuned over the course of several years. It is used in
    production at philpapers.org.

  enteredby:   DBOURGET (David Bourget)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 25 10:16:24 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Names           Rdpfp Person name parsing & normalization          DBOURGET
