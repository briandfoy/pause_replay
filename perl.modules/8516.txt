Mark Veltzer [mark2776@yahoo.com] quoth:
*>
*>I was told to refer this question to the two addresses above.
*>After fixing a few issues in Compress::Bzip2 I noticed that the module is no 
*>longer maintained (the author indicates in the README that he may not have 
*>time for this maintainance, the module is two years old, it no longer 
*>compiles on modern Linux boxes and the emails to the author are rejected 
*>becuase the email address is not valid anymore).
*>
*>Can I start maintaining it ? (I already have a new version).
*>What is the procedure for such a request ? Is this the right email to ask 
*>such a question on ?

Have you contacted the author or made a reasonable attempt to do so?

http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_maintain_module may be helpful
in explaining the rather loose process we have for this.

http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=Compress-Bzip2 shows the module last
upddated 27 June of this year. 

We encourage authors to work this sort of thing out agreeably between
themselves. Also, you may want to submit a "FAIL" report for the Linux
platform via the CPAN testers. See http://testers.cpan.org/ and use the
script for generating reports.
