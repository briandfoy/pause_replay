*grin* ... up to a week if things happen sequentially I guess.  It seems
like a few things fall through the cracks, which is why I think a
request tracker would be nice ("Which requests haven't been dealt
with yet?  Are any of them approaching a week old?")

Anyway.  Sounds like your requests were before my time, but I'll try and
dig them up.  Or you could resubmit if you wanted to make life easier
for me ;)
