The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::HTMLDumper
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: like Data::Dumper, but makes HTML tables
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Dumper Data::JavaScript Data::Tabular::Dumper

  rationale:

    Data::Dumper makes nice human readable output for complex data
    structures. It is extremely useful for debugging at the command
    line. When generating web pages, it isn't adequate, since browsers
    disregard the whitespace it uses to show the structure.
    Data::HTMLDumper takes the output of Data::Dumper and makes an HTML
    table out of it. These are much easier to understand when rendered
    in a browser.

    Data::JavaScript provides access to perl structures from JavaScript
    generated by CGI. Data::Tabular::Dumper allows for dumping to
    various formats including XML, but the XML is not suitable for
    inclusion directly in a web page. These modules are designed for
    program to program communication. Data::HTMLDumper is designed to
    generate human readable output.
