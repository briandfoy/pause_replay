     why:

    I am sitting here in the lightning talks, you announced we could
    have a PAUSE ID. I learned Perl from @genehack's Perl in a day
    seminar and am hooked! Not only do I FEEL I have finally found "my
    people", but it's the perfect language that stimulates my artistic &
    analytical/algorithmic passions simultaneously!

    As far as what I plan to contribute? (Blink, blink) I really have
    no idea at this point. There are literally, from my view, limitless
    applications. What I can say, is I plan on making a career in this,
    I don't know my niche yet, but I am entering the tech world after
    being away since 1998. I now NEED a career for my survival AND THIS
    LANGUAGE CURLS MY TOES WITH JOY! I CANT WAIT to keep exploring and
    doing a "job" with a language that feels like mental candy! (Smiling
    so huge my cheeks ache.) oh, I'm dating Chip Salzenberg and we
    agreed we would make Perl part of our social time together!
