     why:

    First, I'd like to put up a small module for generating horizontal
    bar charts with Image::Magick. Nothing too horribly fancy, just a
    simple way for people to write bar-chart-enabled (new buzzword)
    scripts in next to no time. Of course, I'll probably have more silly
    ideas after that.
