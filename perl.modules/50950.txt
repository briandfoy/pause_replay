hm.. before i was absolute sure about this namespace. now some confused..

yes, that's right, possible to use at many non persistent applications, 
worked on client-server scheme, such as web-sites. and, maybe, at some other 
places

will trying to think: pagination of what? data? of couse data, but data 
means to much.. results? if sql results - yes, but it can be simple array.. 
maybe list? pagination of list, list pagination

imho: more correctly be "paginal navigation under the list", but.. is to 
long and not useful

List::Pagination - what you think?

and chapter "Data and Data Types". i think..
