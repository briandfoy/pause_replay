Hi,

I've been trying to contact the author of Config::Properties, Randy Jay
Yarger, for some time now but can't get in touch with him. I've tried these
email addresses and they all bounce:
randyyarger@hotmail.com
randy@hs1.hst.msu.edu
ryarger@mediaone.net
I've also tried newsgroups, google, and msn to no avail.

I've fixed some bugs in Config::Properties and have uploaded version 0.41 to
my pause directory:
http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/C/CM/CMANLEY/

I'ld like to take ownership of the Config::Properties namespace so that
everybody can download this version instead of the buggy 0.40 version.


ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION
ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION:
The namespace is already registered to RANDY.

If you don't believe that, then this is the error I get when I try to
register it:

  Register Namespace

ERROR: The submission didn't succeed due to the following reasons:

Dist R/RA/RANDY/Config-Properties-0.40.tar.gz, current version 0.40 has been
uploaded by RANDY. Please contact RANDY or choose a different namespace.

Module rootnamespace Config doesn't match chapter. Config is already
registered in the chapters 2 and 12. If you really believe that it belongs
to chapter 9 too, please turn on the small checkbox next to the
chapterselection.

The D status of the DSLIP [?] is not known.
