Hi Guys,

At long last I've decided to add to CPAN a set of modules I've been
developing for the past four years.  Called the "BoulderIO" modules,
they create and manipulate generic data objects composed of
hierarchical tag/value relationships, similar to XML.  A series of
parsers provide interfaces to a variety of specific file formats,
among them XML, and database accessors provide interfaces to several
online and local databases.  Much of the library was developed for use
in handling genome project data, but enough people have started to use
it for non-biological data that I thought I'd make it generally
available.

The name is nondescriptive: I called individual data objects "Stones"
because they are opaque objects.  Boulder was a takeoff on that.
However it's too late to change the name without introducing a lot of
grief.  If the name is OK with you, here is a suggested module list
entry:

6) Data Types and Data Type Utilities (see also Database Interfaces)

   Boulder      MdpO    Generalized tag/value data objects     LDS
