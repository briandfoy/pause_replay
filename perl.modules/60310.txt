Subject: Module submission Test::CheckChanges

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::CheckChanges
  DSLIP:       bdpf2
  description: Checks Changes file Version against distro.
  userid:      GAM (G. Allen Morris III)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    None - Module::Changes could be used

  rationale:

    It is easy to forget to keep the Changes file in synce with the
    distrobution. This module simply looks that the current version
    number is the same as the distribution version.

  enteredby:   GAM (G. Allen Morris III)
  enteredon:   Fri May  2 17:35:09 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::CheckChanges    bdpf2 Checks Changes file Version against distro.  GAM
