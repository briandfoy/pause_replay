I'm okay to move this package elsewhere, but something in the line of
Test::NotBuilder::Subs would seems a little too self depreciative. What
I will do is add a warning in the documentation that I am not using
Test::Builder If that seems OK.

You're probably right that the name is far from perfect because the
anonymous block syntax serves to define tests and not subtests in
Test::Subs (the name is about anonymous subroutines, not sub-tests).
However other names which I though of were centered around the =E2=80=9Cblo=
ck=E2=80=9D
part of =E2=80=9Canonymous code block=E2=80=9D, but Test::Blocks or Test::W=
ithBlock are
even more confusing due to Test::Block package.

So I believe that I will stick to the name if you (perl.modules) agree
with this.
