I understand your concerns. However, in our case there is rarely a
single person who is responsible for a distribution. Where this is the
case, we recognise that maintainers change - whether by moving
departments, leaving the organistation or taking on new projects.

A per-department ID suffers from the fact that departments can change
names, merge, etc. There are very few constants in life, I know. But we
are committed as an organisation to releasing software to the community.

A single account has several benefits to us:
  1. It's 1 thing to manage and it sits better within our existing
processes
  2. We can centralise quality control and support
  3. Distributions have a central home even if maintainers change

Thanks
