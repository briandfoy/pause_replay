Subject: Module submission Data::Walk::Extracted
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Walk::Extracted
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: An extracted dataref walker
  userid:      JANDREW (Jed Lund)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jandrew/Data-Walk-Extracted

  similar:
    Data::Walk Data::Walker

  rationale:

    The goal was to extract the Data walking from the functionality
    provided in the travel. This would provide a Moose based platform to
    do something usefull while travling a data structure.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Walk::
::Extracted       bdpOp An extracted dataref walker                  JANDREW
