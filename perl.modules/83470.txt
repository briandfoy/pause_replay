Dear Rishwanth,

Thank you for your interest in PAUSE.

Generally, PAUSE accounts are intended for individuals that intend to
upload modules to CPAN or take over maintenance of existing modules
and your stated reason for applying doesn't mention either of those.

If you do plan to upload to CPAN or if you have a class/book that
instructs you to get a PAUSE ID to teach you about uploading to CPAN,
please reapply with more details so that we can approve your request.

If you just want an ID to file rt.cpan.org tickets or participate in
community sites, you need a BitCard ID instead:
http://www.bitcard.org/

Regards,
David Golden
PAUSE Admin for IDs
