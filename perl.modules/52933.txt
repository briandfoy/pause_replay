The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Monitor
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: monitor websites for updates and changes
  userid:      YARON (Yaron Kahanovitch)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    WWW::Mechanize WWWMechanize::Cache

  rationale:

    Hi, (Sorry if this is the second time that you receive this messa)
    WWW::Monitor scans given set of web pages and compares them against
    a pre-cached version. If a change is being detected, then a callback
    is activated with a detailed message. This callback can, as an
    example, send emails and notify. This module uses a methology of
    "If-Modify-Since". That is, the user may prefer not to test a web
    page target if it's modification date is ealier than the last cache
    date. In the near future I intend to add a "dynamic data
    filtration". This means that if a zone in a target web pages changes
    dynamically, in every query, than this "false notification report"
    will not Be sent. WWW::Monitor can be easily combined with "cron
    like" mechanism that can be activated priodically according to given
    scheduling. This module Will includes several examples and scripts
    that implements and shows the above.
