Subject: Module submission Filter::Heredoc

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filter::Heredoc
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Search and print here documents in scripts
  userid:      BKRON (Bertil Kronlund)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    Github

  similar:
    Filter::Indent::Heredoc Filter::HereDocIndent PPI::Token::HereDoc

  rationale:

    'Filter::Heredoc' provides subroutines to process text lines from
    e.g. STDIN or an input file. This source stream can then be routed
    to STDOUT. This module extracts here documents from shell scripts
    (i.e. POSIX compliant shell scripts). Perl have derived a similar
    syntax but is at the same time different in the details.

    The name 'Filter::Heredoc' describes exactly what is does and is
    the classical definition of a shell filter. The reverse rootlevel
    namespace 'Heredoc::Filter' is attractive but not required, and may
    need more arguments from my side.

    Here document indentation is a stylistic problem in e.g. in Perl
    code. Modules like 'Filter::Indent::Heredoc' and
    'Filter::HereDocIndent' have addressed that need. 'Filter::Heredoc'
    is not oriented towards code but to search and extract "any" here
    document. The output can be piped to an external program such as
    hunspell or aspell.

    'PPI::Token::HereDoc' is a token class for parsing Perl code and
    creates Heredoc objects with all here document lines. On the other
    hand 'Filter::Heredoc' supports shell here documents. Perl here
    documents can be supported as well with an additional Perl "rule".
    Perl support is experimental in the initial version.
