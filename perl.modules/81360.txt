     why:

    I want to upload several modules that I am maintainig outside CPAN
    for many years now. Most useful among these might be libraries and
    associated command-line utilities to work with numerical ASCII data
    files as they occur in physics from measurements and simulations.

    I'll still have to ponder if I will include my general-purpose
    templating/preprocessing package ... and face the flames for
    bringing up another variant of those;-)
