You need to delete old versions from CPAN, otherwise these old
distributions continue to be indexed. Look:

cpan> m /Template-Toolkit-0/
Module          Template::OS    (ABW/Template-Toolkit-0.23.tar.gz)
Module          Template::Plugin::Filter (ABW/Template-Toolkit-0.27.tar.gz)

CPAN still finds the old Template::Plugin::Filter in the 0.27 package.

I've scheduled the old files for deletion. Don't be worried, thay are
not lost for eternity, a history site is under construction.
