It would help substantially because 'adoptable' would be front and centre
on the relevant search pages - I see a lot of times that people don't
really find out about there being an adoption process without being told
and this allows us to flag that as being 'in progress' without needing
any extra infrastructure.

I believe that Brendan's plans should already result in the creation of a
group of people who'd send the requests to this list.

If we decide that the policy side is appropriate, I'm happy enough being
the mechanism (i.e. the one who goes and kicks the PAUSE interface); I'm
sure I can find us a couple more volunteers who people wouldn't be too scared
of having as PAUSE admins if the workload gets too much for me.
