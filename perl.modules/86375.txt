The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Evented::Object
  DSLIP:       bdpOb
  description: allows you to fire events on objects
  userid:      COOPER (Mitchell Cooper)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    irc.notroll.net #k

  similar:
    IO::Async AnyEvent

  rationale:

    EventedObject is a base class for registering callbacks and firing
    events on those objects. In its simplest use, it provides an
    interface to register and fire callbacks for events on blessed hash
    references.

    However, EventedObject has expanded and now includes several
    additional features such as priorities, callback canceling, and
    other more complex features such as firing multiple events together,
    sharing events between multiple objects, and more. Its interface is
    entirely objective.

    Many subclasses that are designed specifically around EventedObject
    have been named using the Evented:: namespace. For this reason, I
    would like to register this new namespace and make use of it for
    these "evented" modules. These subclasses include an evented wrapper
    for DBI, an evented configuration class, a TCP event transfer
    protocol, an evented and objective Internet Relay Chat client
    library, and others.

    I suppose it would be logical to rename EventedObject to
    Evented::Object as well so that it falls into this namespace.

    In addition, I am now working on an event framework similar to
    AnyEvent and IO::Async that makes use of EventedObject. I would like
    for it to fall into this namespace as well, likely as
    Evented::Framework.

    EventedObject is currently located on GitHub at
    https://github.com/cooper/eventedobject.

The resulting entry would be:

Evented::
