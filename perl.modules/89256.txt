     why:

    I have written a Perl module to extract data from a very specific
    application: CMDBuild (cmdbuild.org).

    From the underlying postgresql 9 database it extracts the data
    model as well as the data, and represents this in a perl hash.

    At my client site, we are using this extract to automatically
    update monitoring items (in Zabbix) from the CMDB data. That is a
    very specific application, not part of the underlying Perl module
    itself.

    My client, who are open source minded, has agreed that I can make
    the underlying Perl module open source.

    I'm currently employed by Snow B.V. (Unix consultants) and I've
    been working with Perl since 1999. It's about time that I do
    something back.
