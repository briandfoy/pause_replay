The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gantry
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Web Application Framework
  userid:      TKEEFER (Tim Keefer)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    mailinglist and subversion at http://www.usegantry.org

  similar:
    Maypole Catalyst CGI::Application

  rationale:

    Gantry has recently been listed on the mod_perl site with this
    description:

    "Gantry's object oriented design allows for a pragmatic, modular
    approach to URL dispatching. Gantry supports MVC and initiates rapid
    development, offering an organized coding scheme for web
    applications."

    http://perl.apache.org/products/app-server.html

    Gantry began in about 1997 when our company (a cable/ISP owned by a
    newspaper). Since then it has flourished through three revisions the
    last of which has now been released under the same license as Perl.

    Here's a feature list:

    a central mod_perl handler all apps may inherit (Gantry.pm)
    CGI/FastCGI support

    automated CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete)

    flexible CRUD for the sophisticated parts of applications

    easy date entry (via JavaScript code in form.tt)

    Basic Apache authentication

    AJAX (via HTML::Prototype or your favorite AJAX module)

  enteredby:   TKEEFER (Tim Keefer)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 14 21:14:35 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Gantry            bmpOp Web Application Framework                    TKEEFER
