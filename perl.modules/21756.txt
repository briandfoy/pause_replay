I received the following message when uploading Time::Format v0.03
yesterday afternoon.

I had uploaded Time::Format v0.02 (my first upload of this module)
on Jun 10 with no problem.  But I got this "not indexed" message
yesterday, Jun 11.  And in fact, the new version of the module did
not show up on CPAN for several hours.  However, it did eventually
show up.

I did click on "View Permissions", and it listed PGALUCCI as an
author who had "first-come claims on the name Time::Format, as well
as several other modules.  However, when I search on CPAN for
Time::Format, it returns my module and nothing else by that name.
Also, when I look up PGOLUCCI in CPAN by author, it shows a blank
page -- no modules listed.

Is there some sort of problem?

I would like to register Time::Format as a modulelist module at
some point, when it becomes more stable.  I hope that this will
be doable.
