Thanks for the response.

We generally push people in the direction of DateTime if we don't see 
you putting anything into the "Community" section of the application. It 
lets us know that it's been run past the usual experts and we ourselves 
don't have to do much checking.

In future, if there's been discussion of the module in various places 
could you detail that in the community section?

Approved, and thanks for the contribution :)
