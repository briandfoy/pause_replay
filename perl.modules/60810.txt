Hi Andreas,

sorry for the late answer.

Thanks for that suggestion.

However, I still have a bit of a problem. If provides has to look like this:

  provides:
    lib:
      file: lib.pm
      version: 0.57

what happens if there is no file lib.pm in the distribution?
Should I make that

  provides:
    lib:
      file: lib_pm.PL
      version: 0.57

where lib_pm.PL is the file lib.pm is generated from? (I guess not.)

Or will

  provides:
    lib:
      version: 0.57

suffice? The examples in
http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-current.html#provides
suggest "file:" is mandatory.

Best regards,
Steffen
