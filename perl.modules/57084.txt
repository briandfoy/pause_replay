Subject: Module submission Test::Dynamic

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Dynamic
  DSLIP:       Rmpfb
  description: Automatic counting of tests for Test::More
  userid:      TURNSTEP (Greg Sabino Mullane)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa@perl.org, bucardo-general@bucardo.org

  similar:
    Test::Count

  rationale:

    Developed internally for a long while, decided to clean up and
    release to the public, as it has been quite useful. Dynamic was
    chosen as the name to indicate that a test script can change quite
    often (even by setting ENV vars), and Test::More should
    automatically know how many tests are expected without the
    programmer having to do more work.

  enteredby:   TURNSTEP (Greg Sabino Mullane)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct  5 13:01:40 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Dynamic         Rmpfb Automatic counting of tests for Test::More   TURNSTEP
