Subject: Module submission Filter::Crypto

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filter::Crypto
  DSLIP:       bdchp
  description: Create runnable encrypted Perl files
  userid:      SHAY (Steve Hay)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Filter::CBC, Crypt::License

  rationale:

    This distribution contains modules to create runnable encrypted
    Perl files.

    This is achieved, of course, using source code filters, hence
    Filter:: for the top-level namespace.

    The encryption/decryption is done using functions in the OpenSSL
    libcrypto library, hence ::Crypto.

    The Filter::Crypto module itself contains only the version number
    of the distribution, plus some documentation. The guts of the code
    is contained in two separate modules:

    Filter::Crypto::CryptFile Filter::Crypto::Decrypt

    The former provides a function for creating the encrypted files
    (and can also decrypt them). It is typically used via a script
    called crypt_file (also in this distribution).

    The latter is the filter module which does the source code
    filtering (i.e. decryption) when the encrypted file is run.

    In addition, one more module is contained in this distribution:

    PAR::Filter::Crypto

    which is a PAR::Filter sub-class which makes use of
    Filter::Crypto::CryptFile to create a PAR archive containing
    encrypted files.

    Two similar modules already exist on CPAN: Filter::CBC and
    Crypt::License.

    However, these modules both use Perl-level source code filters and
    hence are considerably less secure than this distribution, which
    uses a C-level source code filter. I realise that this is still by
    no means "uncrackable", but it does represent a significant
    improvement.

The resulting entry would be:

Filter::
::Crypto          bdchp Create runnable encrypted Perl files         SHAY
