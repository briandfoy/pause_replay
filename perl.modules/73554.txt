Historically, it looks like the email address is usually updated to
"modules@perl.org", but not always.

A consistent way to update the name and email address (e.g. modules
unless a person steps forward) makes sense.

E.g. "John Doe (deceased)" and "modules@perl.org" or "John Doe
(deceased) (custodian: john q public)" and "johnqpublic@example.com"
