That is workable.  I will go with a new top level namespace if that is
what folks think is best. I went with Net:: because the page that
discussed naming:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_namingmodules


Explicitly lists HTTP as one of the protocols it was originally designed
for.  HTTP a;ready has has a top level so HTTP2 does make sense.  The
philosophical question is will we be talking alout HTTP/2.0 five years
from now (thus HTTP2:: makes sense) or will it just simply be HTTP and
presumably part of the HTTP:: namespace.  I'll punt on that question and
work with HTTP2::Draft for now.

Thanks for the guidance,

-stephen
