     why:

    I have two Perl modules I've developed to extract shipping rate
    information from UPS and FedEX using XML. The UPS module works
    properly for shipments to, from and within Canada. The existing
    shipping modules use the old UPS cgi interface and don't calculate
    Canadian shipping.

    The FedEx module calculates FedEx rates for all modes on both
    domestic and international shipping. It also submits the shippment
    to FedEx and returns a printable shipping label. I've completed
    FedEx certification of the module and waiting for approval.
