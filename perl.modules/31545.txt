I got this message about two weeks ago and completely forgot about it.  If
I send it to the list, though, either I or someone else will see it again.

Hi Brian,

Talking about (not so) abandonned modules, I forward you this from what I
believe is the author of Roman.pm.

Alternatively a properly packaged, and patched for unicode, version is
available at http://xmltwig.com/module/roman/, but really, I believe the
original author should get his module back.

Thanks

Yes, I am the author of Roman.pm, but I cannot update the module
for now:(, because I have been away from perl for VERY LONG time and
I don't know how to use PAUSE(Perl Authors Upload SErver) which is
established after my last upload of Roman.pm.

I am now asking CPAN how I can prove myself as the author
and try to update my profile(password or something like that).
When I got proved, I'll upload newer version.
