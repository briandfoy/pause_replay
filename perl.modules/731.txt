Hi,

    I am working on a project which requires perl 5.003 to be there on
NT. I was able to get perl5.005_64 instead from CPAN site. I also have
perl 5.001. But some of the modules (like Config.pm, Basename.pm etc...)
are missing in the perl5.005_64. But my project needs to have all
modules that are available in perl 5.003. Is it some thing like the
above listed modules (Config.pm, Basename.pm..) are not continued after
5.003.

    Please clarify my doubts and refer me to right sites for getting
more needed info.
It would be great if you can write me to get complete details of
availability and modules of perl 5.003 on NT.



Thanks in Advance,
Raama....
