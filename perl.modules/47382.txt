The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Singleton
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Test singleton classes
  userid:      TPG (Toni Prug)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::More

  rationale:

    Whenever one has a singleton class, it is crucial to test it. This
    modules saved me cuting/pasting those 10 lines of code I used to
    test whether a class produces each time single object or not. It's
    done with standard Test::Builder. It also passes tests with
    singletons created with Object::InsideOut, but i didn't include them
    into tests to reduce build dependency.

  enteredon:   Tue Feb 14 14:32:58 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Singleton       Rdpfg Test singleton classes                       TPG
