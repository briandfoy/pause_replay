Call for Papers: DEADLINE EXTENDED

2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2005)
===================================================================
July 12-15, 2005, Orlando, Florida, USA
Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society

http://conferences.computer.org/scc/2005
Theme: Bridge the Gap between Business Services and IT Services

Services now account for more than half of the U.S. economy. Services
Computing, as a new cross discipline, addresses how to enable IT technology
to
help people perform business services more efficiently and effectively. As
we
can see, Services Computing currently shapes the processes of business
modeling, business consulting, solution creation, service delivery, and
software
architecture design, development and deployment. 

The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2005)
aims to the topics of bridging the gap between Business Services and IT
Services
with a new ground breaking technology suite that includes Web services and
service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and
performance management, utility/grid computing and autonomic computing. It
is
sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Steering Committee for
Services
Computing (TSC-SC) and will be co-located with the 2005 IEEE International
Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2005). The theme of this joint IEEE
conference on
SERVICES is "Bridge the Gap between Business Services and IT Services". 

SCC 2004 was held in Shanghai, China, September 15-18, 2004. A total of 330
papers were submitted to SCC 2004. Submissions were from over 30 countries
and regions. 37 were accepted as full research papers, 9 were accepted as
short papers, and 50 were accepted as special session papers. 

SCC 2005 has the following major research tracks: Foundations of Services
Computing, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Grid/Utility Computing, and
Business Performance Management Services and Business Integration.

SCOPE: Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

Foundations of Services Computing 

- Services science 
- Services Modeling 
- Service-oriented business consulting methodology and utilities 
- Services delivery 
- Servicesvalue chain and innovation lifecycle 

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 

- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 
- SOA Solution Stack 
- SOA Industry Standards 
- SOA Industry Solutions 

Business Performance Management Services and Business Integration 

- Business Strategy and Design
- Enterprise Modeling 
- Business process modeling, transformation and integration 
- Business performance management 
- Software architecture design, development and deployment (software as a
service) 
- Application integration services (e.g. Enterprise Service Bus) 
- Service Level Automation and Orchestration 
- Industry solution patterns 

Grid/Utility Computing 

- Grid Computing 
- Utility Computing
- Utility Business Services 
 

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS: 

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that
are not being considered in another forum. Manuscripts will be limited to
8-10
(IEEE Proceeding style) pages and be printed on 10 or 12 size font. Please
follow the IEEE Computer Society Press Proceedings Author Guidelines to
prepare
your papers. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format)
is
required. Detailed Instructions for electronic paper submission, panel
proposals, tutorial proposals, and review process can be found at
http://conferences.computer.org/scc/2005/ . The length of the camera-ready
of an accepted
paper will be limited to 8 (IEEE style) pages. At least one author of each
accepted paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper.
The
IEEE SCC 2005 Proceedings will be collected in EI Compendex. The detailed
submission instructions can be found at SCC 2005 web site. The enhanced
version of
the selected best papers published in the SCC 2005 will be invited !
 to publication in the International Journal of Web Services Research
(JWSR) (by Idea Group) and possibly other related journals. Some speakers
of the
keynotes, panels, and tutorials will be invited to submit articles to
extend
their presentations for IEEE IT Professional Magazine. 

EVALUATION PROCESS: 

All submissions will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
and soundness. Each paper will be refereed by at least two to three
researchers in the topical area. 

BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARDS: 

One Best Paper award and 1-3 Best Student Paper Awards will be presented by
SCC 2005. The first author of the best student papers should be full-time
students.
