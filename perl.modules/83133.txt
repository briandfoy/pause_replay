Unfortunately, there is no way to delete something completely from 
BackPan. That is because "BackPan" as such doesn't exist - many people 
keep a full history of all files ever uploaded to PAUSE and never delete 
files. There is no one true BackPan.

This being said, if there is value in *reducing* (but not eliminating) 
the number of places that your information is available from, then you 
can (nicely please) get in touch with some people who operate backpans. 
Robert and Barbie are in CC. Robert, I believe has access to 
backpan.perl.org, Barbie runs a BackPan for the CPAN testers. Can you 
help out Soeren?

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
