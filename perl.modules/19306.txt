Very nice, thanks for your work on this, it looks promising.

I think a regular upload of this to CPAN will be OK, but let's
consider our options about *how* to upload it. Looking at the sizes

  612352  PerlDesignPatterns.html
  515881  PerlDesignPatterns.pm
  420174  SWALTERS/Object-PerlDesignPatterns-0.01.tar.gz
  575971  SWALTERS/Perl_Design_Patterns_book_20021008.html

we see, the .tar.gz file is not much smaller than the HTML file.
Nobody will be interested in old versions of it. Looks like you should
just upload the PerlDesignPatterns.html regularly (maybe once a
month). Note: files matching /\.html$/ can be uploaded again and
again.

If you want to have "PerlDesignPatterns" in the modules' index, you
should probably write a module using LWP that fetches the
PerlDesignPatterns.html from the CPAN or from your server or gives
instructions how to do that. The downside would be that C< perldoc
Object::PerlDesignPatterns > will only show the manpage for the
module, but that's probably better than showing the whole document as
a manpage because it's not suited for man(1) and best viewed with a
browser.
