All things are possible I guess!  However the modules do different things
(at the moment).  WWW::Freshmeat allows you to examine (ie. read only I
believe) the complete Freshmeat projects database via LWP scraping whereas
WWW::FreshMeat::API only allows you to see and manage (ie.
amend/submit/delete releases) of your own projects (NB. these are Freshmeat
XML-RPC api limitations).

So I think they are different beasts and probably should remain separate
however I see there maybe a concern over the module naming which could be
confusing & could cause possible future namespace pollution?.

I'm new to CPAN uploads etc... is this an issue?    If so I'm happy to
rename module it if helps?  My original thought was FreshMeat::API but then
I saw that there were other XML-RPC modules under the WWW::* namespace so
thought that was more appropriate.   Net::FreshMeat is another alternative?

Happy to go with whatever naming u suggest brian.   Let me know and I'll fix
it before doing next version of module.

regards Barry
