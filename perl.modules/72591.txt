The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::ES::Hyphenate
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Splits Spanish words into Syllables.
  userid:      NGLENN (Nathan Gary Glenn)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    In the Lingua space, there already exist Hyphenators for Finnish,
    Portuguese, Turkish, and Klingon. They use Lingua::[Two character
    abreviation of language name]. I would like to use the same naming
    scheme for the Spanish Hyphenate.pm. I searched for other
    Hyphenators of Spanish, and I can find none, so this module should
    be unique. I believe it should be listed because this kind of tool
    is often necessary in linguistics research. I initially developed it
    for BYU PSST to create grading forms for proficiency tests which are
    graded by syllable.

  enteredby:   NGLENN (Nathan Gary Glenn)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 30 17:27:28 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::ES::
::Hyphenate       Rdphp Splits Spanish words into Syllables.         NGLENN
