Dear Sir=2C

 and give me a positive responsehence time is essence=2E

I am Olu Williams=2CMember of Contract Award Committee with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture=2E
 By the virtue of our position and the power bestowed on us by the government=2C we carefully and deliberately
 over invoiced the value of some contracts that we award to some foreign contractor to the tune o
 Twenty-Two Million five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars =28US$22=2C500=2C000 00=29=2E 

Now the contracts  have been fully executed and commission and payment are about to be made to all the
 contractors who have successfully executed their contracts=2C the over invoiced sum of =28US$22=2C500=2C000=2E00=29 is what
 we want to transfer out of our country for our own use=2E Unfortunately=2C as Civil Servants=2C we are not permitted by 
law to operate foreign accounts=2C this has constituted a major hindrance to our success in transferring this fund 
out of our country and to this end=2C my colleagues have mandated me to look for an honest and trust worthy foreign
 partner who will assist us to provide a foreign account to receive the fund on our behalf for our mutual benefit=2E 

Hence we are seeking your assistance=2E My colleagues and I have agreed that the owner of the account will be
 compensated with twenty percent =2820%=29=2C of the total sum if you will stand as the beneficiary of the
 fund=2EEighty percent =2880%=29 for we the officials involved=2E

Note that we have done our home work very well in our country=2C this transaction is safe and guaranteed 100% risk free=2E
If you are interested please send down to us account information=2C so that  we will immediately seek approval of the fund
 on your behalf from the relevant authorities=2Cincluding the federal ministry of finance =28F=2EM=2EF=29=2Cwhich will allocate you and
 your company foreign exchange cover $22=2C500=2E000=2E00 for the immediate release of this fund into your account 
by the Central Bank of Nigeria =28CBN=29=2E 

We will visit you immediately we conclude the transaction to collect and invest part of our share into any viable business
 you may advice in your country=2E We will also buy industrial goods for a resale here in Nigeria=2E Please ensure to treat this
 matter in strict privacy=2C as we have to protect our job as Civil Servants=2E I await your urgent response=2E

Yours Faithfully=2C
