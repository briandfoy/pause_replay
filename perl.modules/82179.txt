I'm a new member of PAUSE, looking to upload my first module.  I ask for
some advice from those who have more experience than I, as I'd like to do
this the right way the first time :)

1. I have developed a module that provides an XS interface to the WMI
library (libasync_wmi_lib.so) that is generated by building the Zenoss WMI
software and provides a method of calling the WMI client without forking
to use the wmic binary.  My initial inclination was to just call the
module WMIClient, but I'm not sure if WMI::Client or some other name would
be better.  The only 2 modules I currently see on CPAN that provide
similar functionality are DBD::WMI and Win32::WMIC, both of which collect
and parse the output of `wmic`, which is what my module is designed to
avoid.  Suggestions on the best way to name it would be greatly
appreciated.

2. Said module currently has 1 function, wmiclient, which I was planning
on exporting by default.  I see that it's generally recommended not to do
that, but it seems that there's little chance of polluting the general
namespace, given that the existing WMI modules don't use it nor do they
operate that way.  At some point I may add an OO interface, but that's not
an immediate concern of mine.  Do you have any strong objections to the
default export?

3. The module uses several chunks of C code from the WMI package itself,
which are distributed under the GPL.  My initial license though was to
distribute the .xs file as GPL with the rest of the module package under
the same terms as Perl itself, but I don't know if that's a valid
licensing model.  Can I do that, or do I need to distribute the entire
module as GPL (which is OK with me).  Is this a problem for distribution
via CPAN?

4. In order to successfully build this module, you need to have the WMI
library installed and specify the location of the WMI source code as a
parameter to 'perl Makefile.PL' so it can find the necessary headers
(which I'd rather not have to package with the module source).  I have
specified this in the README and Makefile.PL, but I don't know how to
handle that requirement via CPAN.  Suggestions/pointers would be
appreciated.

5. I'm only starting to look into testing now, but one of the requirements
for testing this will be that information be passed regarding
username/password and machine to test against.  Again, I don't know how to
handle that requirement via CPAN - if you can point me to a good reference
on how to do that, I'd appreciate that as well.

Thanks, and I look forward to your response.
Josh
