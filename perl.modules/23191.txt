The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PHP::MySource::Session
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: read / write MySource PHP session files
  userid:      HOMSHERD (Dave Homsher, II)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    chatroom at http://mysource.squiz.net

  similar:
    PHP::Session

  rationale:

    This module useses the PHP::Session module to provide an interface
    to the MySource content management system, available under GPL at
    http://mysoruce.squiz.net.

    There are not many people using this system currently, so there is
    very little documentation and no perl modules available to interface
    with it. I am trying to provide generic integration between this
    system (written in PHP) and a few mod_Perl applications that I
    support.

    Will hundreds of people download this? Probably not, but it will at
    least provide a place to put these modules that is publicly
    available and where I don't have to worry about backups ;)

    I do plan to create other modules under this same directory to
    allow for more integration with the MySource tools, so it seems to
    make sense to create a namespace under PHP::Session

    Thanks, Dave http://www.homsher.com
