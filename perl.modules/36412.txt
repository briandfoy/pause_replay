Choosing a good name is a tough thing, but it's extremely
important that users know what your module does.  I'm
still really confused about that, so I don't have a 
suggestion other than the ones I've already given.  Your
the one who knows the most about your module, and that
I'm having trouble helping you despite my research should
tell you that other people are going to skip right over
your module because they don't realize its the one that
they want.

You should consider these things:

   * Describe what your module does.  "Solver1" doesn't
   say what it solves.

   * Break it down into a heirarchy if appropriate.  If
   this module deals with polynomials, for instance, it
   can go in Math::Polynomial.

   * Expect expansion.  If your stuff only does one
   dimensional things, choose a name that can expand
   to other dimensions when other people want to add
   things.
