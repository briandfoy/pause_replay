The Director,
Sir,
URGENT AND EXTREMELY CONFIDENTIAL

It is with trust and confidentiality, that I make this urgent and important> business proposal to you. It gives
me so much enthusiasm to write this letter to you. It is all in a view to
soliciting for assistance to enable us execute a venture of mutual benefit.

My name is Igho Agbon an employee with the Central Bank of Zimbabwe, a senior
employee, during the last political disturbance by the Government held by
president Robert Mugabe, (I and my other colleagues worked out over
US$26,000,000,00 (Twenty Six Million,United States Dollars Only) as over
invoiced and inflated payment for election materials and the funds is now with
the security company in Holland for safe keeping.

Now that we are not sure of the future of this country, due to the cry of
sanction by world leaders in and around the world. For the brutal take over of
white people farm resident in Zimbabwe by the
Administration, and the lack of purpose in the administration, my colleaques
and I have decided to invest this funds wisely. I am currently
in the Netherlands on a short diplomatic course and my involvement in this
transaction shall be kept secret,since our civil service code of conduct
forbids us to have any private financial of this magnitude.We need a
successful transfer of the funds to a designated account.

We need the assistance of a foreign company/persons to push this money into
their accounts. You will do very well with what we have in mind. Your share of
whatever we succeed in putting into your account will be 20% of the total sum,
while 70% will be for us and 10% will
be mapped out for any expenses incurred by both parties in the process of the
transfer, we require you your willingness to assist us.

I will refrain from giving out more operational details, until I receive your
reply. Since time is of the essence to us, reply this letter quickly so as to
know what next to do, even if this letter does not meet your approval, please
inform me. There is no risk
involved, as we have done our homework carefully.

Looking forward to hearing from you.


Yours Sincerely,
Igho Agbon.
