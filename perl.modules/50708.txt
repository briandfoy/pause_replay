Subject: Module submission Bio::NEXUS

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::NEXUS
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: API for parsing and manipulating NEXUS files
  userid:      TJHLADISH (Thomas Hladish)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Bio::Phylo BioPerl

  rationale:

    Although Bio::NEXUS is currently fully independent of BioPerl, we
    have chosen to share the Bio:: namespace with BioPerl because (1)
    both provide bioinformatics tools, and (2) we intend to eventually
    integrate with BioPerl. Our modules are different from BioPerl in
    that the NEXUS file format is supported only very weakly by BioPerl,
    whereas we support around 2/3 of all possible NEXUS commands (no
    software currently supports the file format completely).

    NEXUS is an interchange file format used by many different
    bioinformatics programs and databases. Its complex structure make it
    both versatile and hard to support fully.

The resulting entry would be:
