The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::Controller
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: OO framework for Apache2 handler apps
  userid:      MARKLE (Mark Hedges)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Catalyst, other MVC frameworks

  rationale:

    Apache2::Controller is a lightweight controller framework for
    object-oriented applications designed to run only under mod_perl
    children in high-performance Apache2 handler modules. It features
    URL dispatch with flexible configuration, auth plugins for OpenID, a
    cookie session and MySQL store, a pluggable infrastructure for your
    own models and views, and limited base inheritance configuration
    allowing you to construct your applications as you need, without
    trying to be all things to all people or assimilate the world, and
    without having to load all site modules for every page handler. It
    is intended as a framework for new applications specialized as
    Apache2 handlers, not as a means to absorb existing applications or
    to create portable code. Template Tookit is used by default to
    render page views, but can be overloaded, but the model layer is
    left entirely to the user to implement.
