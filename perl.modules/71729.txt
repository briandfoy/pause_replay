Hi!

My name is Henrik Theiling and I am about to complete a module for
internationalisation.  It is supposed to be a replacement for
Locale::gettext for multi-language support, i.e., in does not have
a global locale setting like all the other gettext-modules I found.

My module will work very much like you'd expect a gettext module to
work, with the exception that you can have multiple objects doing
catalog lookups with different locale settings, all at the same time
and without the need to change the global locale setting.

I use it to generate multilingual, static HTML pages and still want my
script to talk to me in English, for example.

Now, I'm searching for a nice module name.  For example:

   Locale::Multi::Gettext

Maybe you have a better suggestion?

Bye,
  Henrik
