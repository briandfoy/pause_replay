Maintainers of the Perl 5 modules list:

Sharing and discussing one's modules is a pain, but I finally
give in and feel ready to join the noble ranks of CPAN authors.
I have a degree in maths and at some time been a teacher for
OO programming.  I am also one of the charter members of ulm.pm
(see http://ulm.pm.org/).

contributions:

One of my first contributions will be a family of modules dealing
with time and date conversions -- unless comp.lang.perl.modules
people completely scare me out of it.  Naming issues aside,
I reckon they probably might not.

Other subjects of interest I might be tempted to add my $0.02
worth are scheduling algorithms and symbolic calculations.  Or
even sysadmin paraphernalia.  Time will tell.

Thank you for your time!
