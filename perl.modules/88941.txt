Hi Steve,

You are the maintainer and originator of the Class::Generate CPAN distribut=
ion (
https://metacpan.org/release/Class-Generate ) and currently it accumulated 3
bugs in the rt.cpan.org bug tracker
( https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=3DClass-Generate ) and tests
sometimes fail with perls-5.18.x and above. I contributed a patch to the
latter here:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3D81623

So I'm asking you either of two things:

1. Resume maintenance of Class::Generate - close the bugs, etc.

2. Give me COMAINT (=3D co-maintenance on the distribution) on PAUSE so I c=
an
continue to maintain it.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish=20
