I'm new to this process so I may have gone about the registration request
(among other things) the wrong way.  I thought File:: would be a good place to
put the module.  Haven't uploaded yet.  I could use any advice on what to do
(or not do).  Here's the documentation:

=head1 NAME

File::Renamer - Perform interactive filename changes from within an editor


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Renamer;

  InteractiveRename();
  InteractiveRename(verbose);
  InteractiveRename(debug);
  InteractiveRename(verbose,debug);


  E.g. 

    $ perl -MFile::Renamer -e 'InteractiveRename()' mydirectory
    $ perl -MFile::Renamer -e 'InteractiveRename(verbose)' /tmp/mydirectory


    or via a separate script:

    $ cat mytest.pl
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Renamer;

    InteractiveRename();


    $ mytest.pl ~/mydir


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This interactive file renamer module allows filename changes from within
your favorite editor.  

It is most useful when complicated or one-time repetitive changes to a
directory must be made but programmatic solutions are probably not worth
the time to implement.  Does not recurse.  Ignores subdirectories, if
any.

It assumes a Unix-like environment that exports $EDITOR.
If you're on Win32, Cygwin works well.

It exports a single function called InteractiveRename()


=head2 EXPORT

None by default.


=head1 SEE ALSO

Perl's rename function.
