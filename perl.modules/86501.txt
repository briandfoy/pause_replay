Hi Konstantin

There is very rarely a perfect name for a module.

The considerations you've mentioned indicate a good attempt to take past 
and future other module names into account. Often, that's the best we 
can do...

The standard help for such matters is:

http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_namingmodules

I think your use of Bucket is not very indicative of what you module 
offers. I would not want it to give me buckets :-).

How about Statistics::Descriptive::Approx?

That makes sense to me because it indicates a close link to 
Statistics::Descriptive::Full while distinguishing itself by 
specifically stating what's different.

That still leaves Statistics::Descriptive::ProbResampling.

As for the length of the name, at this very moment I'm writing

MarpaX::Demo::OldInterface::JSON. I've had a long think about this name, 
too, since there are already 2 other interfaces (BNF, Scanless), even 
though they as yet have no demos.

The longest name in the disto will be 
MarpaX::Demo::OldInterface::JSON::Renderer::JSON.

Such is life.
