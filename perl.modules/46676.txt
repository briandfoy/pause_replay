There is File::Attribute. It does something similar but in a completely 
different way. It creates .filename.attributename files to store the 
attribute data.

I wouldn't use the File::ExtAttr name either since it's too cryptic. 
Personally, I was well aware that different OS's and file systems 
support per-file meta data, but I didn't know what it was called. If I 
searched CPAN for that functionality, I'd look for File::MetaData or 
File::Atribute(s), but I would probably miss File::ExtAddr.
