Hi there.

I'm writing to request a PAUSE account.

My details are as follows:

Name: chocolateboy
Email: chocolate.boy@email.com
User ID: CHOCOLATE

Modules I am planning to submit:

Xelig: A Model-View-Controller XML-template toolkit inspired by Enhydra's XMLC. Unlike XSLT, PHP, ASP, JSP, Struts, Template Toolkit, ZPT, and the other 5000 template toolkits, Xelig offers a genuine separation of layout and logic.

Util: A collection of FAQ-ish functions. Util has had the looks_like_number() wrapper that was recently added to Scalar:Util for the past two years. In addition, it contains Swiss-Army file-read and write operators, a handy cross-platform implementation of Infinity, a fast (XS) clone(), and various math/web/text time-savers.

For a variety of reasons, I'd prefer Xelig to be just plain old Xelig rather than, say, XML::Xelig. But I'm happy to surrender the Util namespace (e.g. Acme::Util, Acme::FAQ) if someone has a better claim to it.

Thanks in advance,
chocolateboy
