    IPTables::libiptc - Perl extension for iptables libiptc

    This package is written from scratch, but is inspired by the CPAN
    module IPTables-IPv4. The CPAN module IPTa­bles-IPv4 could not be
    used because it has not been keept up-to-date, with the newest
    iptables extentions, as it needs to contain every extention and thus
    needs to port them individually.

    This package has another approach, it links with the systems
    libiptc.a library and depend on dynamic loading of iptables
    extensions available on the system.
