The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Socket::GetAddrInfo
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Use or emulate Socket6's resolver functions
  userid:      PEVANS (Paul Evans)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Socket6

  rationale:

    Socket6 provides getaddinfo() and getnameinfo() resolution
    functions for converting names to or from socket addresses. These
    are XS wrappers around the functions provided by the platform. Not
    every platform provides these at the libc level, so not every
    platform can use Socket6. But the interface that Socket6 provides is
    still useful to code against.

    Socket::GetAddrInfo provides the same two functions with the same
    interfaces. If the host it runs on provides Socket6, then this is
    loaded and those functions are called directly. If it does not, then
    the module provides some emulation functions that provide similar
    behaviour as best they can by calling the legacy resolver functions,
    such as gethostbyname(). This allows authors to use the new features
    of Socket6, such as IPv4/IPv6 transparency, while still allowing
    their code to be used on older systems that cannot support Socket6,
    albeit at reduced IPv4-only level.

The resulting entry would be:
