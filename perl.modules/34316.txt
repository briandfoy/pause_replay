Subject: Module submission Tree::Authz

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree::Authz
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: hierarchical groups-based permissions system
  userid:      DAVEBAIRD (David R. Baird)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Data::ACL

  rationale:

    In Tree::Authz, a user is placed in a single group. That group can
    contain subgroups, in a tree-like structure. The user queries the
    group object to see if the user is permitted to carry out certain
    operations. The user can do anything her group, or any subgroup, is
    permitted to do. Users can only belong to a single group.

    The aim is to provide a structure that can model the hierarchical
    structure of real organisations. The group model is not like Unix
    groups, where a user can be a member of multiple groups. I could
    never get my head round that anyway.

    The other main feature of the module is that code can be associated
    with the nodes (groups) of the tree, either as coderefs, or as
    package names. So the groups can contain all the code to carry out
    their own tasks. I think that will work well, but I haven't used it
    in anger yet.

    Data::ACL uses a similar hierarchical structure to manage
    permissions, but doesn't seem to be complete, and doesn't feature
    the code management aspects of my module. It uses a different method
    of modelling the tree.

    I've struggled to find a suitable top level namespace for this.
    Tree:: is OK, and is relevant, but the primary task of the module is
    authorization, not modelling trees. It would have been nice if it
    could have gone in Authz::, something like Authz::Inherit or
    Authz::Tree. There's a big Authen:: namespace, I'd suggest it should
    be accompanied by an Authz:: namespace. Any takers?

    Best wishes,

    David.
