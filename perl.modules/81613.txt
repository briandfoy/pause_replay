Subject: [COMAINT REQUEST] DateTime::BusinessHours

Dear PAUSE Admins,

I recently found myself in need of a "business hours/days" calculator,
and quickly found DateTime::BusinessHours [1] on CPAN. Unfortunately,
it suffers from a few critical bugs [2]. The module has had only a few
releases, all dating to late November 2007 -- nothing since.

I emailed the author (Antano Solar John [SOLARANT]; cc'ed) on June 26
(using their cpan.org email, plus an alternate contact found in the
DateTime::BusinessHours pod) to see what their intentions were and if
I could be of any assistance -- I've yet to receive a reply.

I wish to formally request COMAINT on the module to fix the
outstanding issues and generally improve the codebase.

I've already created a github repo [3] where I've fixed all 3 RT bugs,
amongst other things.

Thanks in advance.
