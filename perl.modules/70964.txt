The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBI::Factory
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: a factory class for DBI database handle
  userid:      BAHOOTYPR (Bahootyper)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://github.com/bahootyper/DBI-Factory

  similar:

  rationale:

    Since it is nothing rather than a simple factory interface of the
    DBI database handle, but with a bit usefulness of collecting up the
    same connection information into a single configuration file.

  enteredby:   BAHOOTYPR (Bahootyper)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 24 12:56:21 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBI::
::Factory         bdpOp a factory class for DBI database handle      BAHOOTYPR
