Hi,

    Please register Class::Delegate in the annotated modules list.

    Section:  Data Types and Data Type Utilities
    DSLI:  bdpO
    Short description:  Easy-to-use implementation of object delegation.

    I suggested the name on modules@perl.org a few months ago, and I got
the endorsement implied by complete lack of response.  :^)

    Peace,
