The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Plugin::Instsaller
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Autoload interface for installing plugins.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are plugins for various purposes, but no general plugin
    handler utilities (that I can find). Plugin::Installer is the
    top-end of a general plugin handler utility. It installs &
    dispatches to methods named by keys in a hash-object using metadata
    in the values. Because the object has its own compiler/handler this
    is generic: it doesn't care HOW the object's compiler does the deed,
    it just installs the result. I also have Plugin::Language::DML as an
    exmaple compiled language that is handled by Plugin::Installer. Net
    result is a generic plugin utility.

    All of the existing items I can find that do anything similar are
    crammed into Class::, which this isn't since the hash doesn't really
    even need to be blessed, just present. It isn't an autoloader
    (although the handler language may choose to use that technique).

The resulting entry would be:

Plugin::
::Instsaller      bdpfp Autoload interface for installing plugins.   LEMBARK
