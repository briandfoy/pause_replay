Request to register new user

fullname: Xan Tronix
  userid: XAN
    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    I would like a PAUSE ID so that I may publish work on a new Perl
    compiler, or rather, a mechanism to generate C or machine code with
    the aid of the B backend. The new compiler would have an advanced
    linker capable of generating shared objects for as many or as few
    .pm files as desired, and would address some of the shortcomings in
    B::C with a specific goal of reliability over speed.
