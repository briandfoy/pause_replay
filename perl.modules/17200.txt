Your preference against this namespace notwithstanding, what happens if some
does get a module approved in this namespace?  I have to think that you don't
want rogue squatters already there.

Not quite.  If, as I point out above, this namespace is doled out to someone
in the future, you can't have my modules mucking it up, so I'd have to remove
what I've already uploaded.  Which is going to break some existing scripts as
they're deployed on new installations.

Right.  Sorry, but your visibility in the community far exceeds mine, so I
have to think the other admins are more likely to defer in response to your
objections.

I'm going to have to sulk on this over a beer or two. . .
