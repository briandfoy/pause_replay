Hi Chris,

I'm sorry this reply has taken a couple of days. First, let me tell you
and the rest of the PDL porters that, although I'm only a casual user,
I'm a huge fan of PDL. It's a great tool and boy, there's some good
ideas and hard work in it!

I cannot give you password for the PERLDL mailing list account as there
is none. You can't "log in" as a mailinglist account. There's just
representatives. Currently Karl is the only representative. AFAIK, that
gives him a new section in the PAUSE menu that lets him control things.
Details would have to be told by a PAUSE admin with better memory.

However, I just "sudo"d to the account to give you permissions as Karl
already sent a note of endorsement about your release plans (thanks for
that). You now have permissions for all but one namespaces: PDL::IO::HDF
It's owned by Olivier Archer and has been included in the PDL
distribution for quite some time, but never been indexed correctly. The
PAUSE policy is not to transfer maintenance of any namespace unless
requested by the author/previous maintainer or if the author disappeared
entirely. I'm CC'ing Olivier so maybe he can simply sort this out or
drop us a note to modules@perl.org. In case he doesn't react, maybe one
of you knows of his whereabouts?

Again, I'm sorry this that has taken so long and also it's not quite
done yet.

Best regards,
Steffen
