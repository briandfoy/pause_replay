     why:

    I've been working on an internal project here at work and I've come
    up with a module that I think others will find useful. Its a
    recursive data diff on two arbitrary data structures. It treats
    arrays as unordered collections and does a best guess merge of the
    data to minimize differences. The result of the diff is an other
    data structure that identifies what is unique, different and the
    same at all levels.
