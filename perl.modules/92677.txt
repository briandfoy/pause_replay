Hi Hagen,

I=E2=80=99m writing this email in my role as a PAUSE admin.

Following on from my previous emails, I am going to give co-maint =
permissions for the =E2=80=98chart=E2=80=99 namespace to the CHARTGRP =
pause id, which will let them release the Chart distribution.

For now we=E2=80=99ll let you keep the permission, but in 6 months =
we=E2=80=99ll remove the permission. This gives you plenty of time to =
refactor Finance::Quant to use internal package names within the =
Finance::Quant namespace rather than using toplevel package names.

This isn=E2=80=99t a perfect solution, but will let CHARTGRP proceed =
with a release. This situation came about due to a change in the PAUSE =
permissions model, which means we now have a number of clashes, which =
will need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis.

Note for the record: I submitted a pull request for the change, to help =
Hagen with the change:

<https://github.com/santex/finance-quant/pull/1>

Cheers,
