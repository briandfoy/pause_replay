The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Classic::Perl
  DSLIP:       bdcpp
  description: Selectively reinstate deleted Perl features
  userid:      SPROUT (Father Chrysostomos)
  chapterid:   27 (Pragma)
  communities:

  similar:
    Modern::Perl

  rationale:

    This module reinstates old Perl features that have been deleted
    from the latest versions. (Right now in only provides split to @_ in
    void and scalar context.)

    The name is inspired by Modern::Perl, but the functionality is not
    the same. In fact, thereâs nothing to stop one from writing:

    use Modern::Perl; use Classic'Perl;

    :-)

    I chose C as the language, above, but Iâm not sure itâs
    correct. Iâm using Perl for $^H manipulation and XS for binding.
    Should I have chosen hybrid?

  enteredby:   SPROUT (Father Chrysostomos)
  enteredon:   Sun May 23 20:22:55 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Classic::
::Perl            bdcpp Selectively reinstate deleted Perl features  SPROUT
