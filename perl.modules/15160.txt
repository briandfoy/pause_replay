The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Text2XML
  DSLIP:       Rmpfg
  description: Parse text into XML using regexes.
  userid:      RELIANCE (Reliance Technology Consultants, Inc.)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    mailinglists, web site

  similar:

  rationale:

    After much conversation with the developer, and some conversation
    with this list, the name XML::Text2XML was decided on. It makes use
    of XML, so it was somewhat forced into the XML namespace (much to
    the developer's disenjoyment), and it processes anything that can be
    matched by a regex into XML, hence its name -- assuming that only
    text can be matched by a regex, of course.

  enteredby:   RELIANCE (Reliance Technology Consultants, Inc.)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov 11 02:00:50 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Text2XML        Rmpfg Parse text into XML using regexes.           RELIANCE
