Please use the URL
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=3Dapply_mod for =
submitting
module registrations; it makes things a bit easier on the PAUSE admins.
It also asks you for some information which is helpful in categorising

=46or example, what does your module do? Are there any existing modules

discuss the module name anywhere previously?

"webtools" is a very broad name.

Cheers,
