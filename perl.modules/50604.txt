Unless I'm missing something, I'd point to the CPAN manpage, chapter FAQ:

       8)  In our intranet we have many modules for internal use. How can I
           integrate these modules with CPAN.pm but without uploading the mod-
           ules to CPAN?

           Have a look at the CPAN::Site module.

People are using CPAN::Site with good success. They are not many and
as soon as they have their solution, they disappear, so they never
advocate the solution they use. No surprise here:)
