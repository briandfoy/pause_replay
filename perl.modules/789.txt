Hmmm, something strange is afoot.

The Template::Plugin::Filter module was removed from the distribution
between versions 0.27 and 0.28, being replaced by Template::Filters.

I've checked that versions 0.28 through 1.02 have correct MANIFEST
files that reflect this change and all files seem to be in order.  Is 
there perhaps something else I should have done to denote a file 
being removed from a distribution?  

Looking back through CVS, the Template::Plugin::Filter 1.03 corresponds
to release 0.23 of the Template Toolkit which was some time ago.  I 
can't find anywhere else that this file could have crept into in later
releases.  

Any ideas?
