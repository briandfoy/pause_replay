The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Skype
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Interface to the Skype API on Windows
  userid:      MNCOPPOLA (Michael Coppola)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    It's in my college applications

  similar:
    http://search.cpan.org/~laomoi/SkypeAPI-0.08/lib/SkypeAPI.pm (My
    submission is meant to deprecate this module, because the existing
    one is very buggy and prints hard-coded debugging information)

  rationale:

    I use Win32::OLE to access the Skype4COM API interface, so I
    figured it would be appropriate, since it is esoteric to Windows. If
    you think it should be named otherwise, I would appreciate
    correction on the matter, since I'm new to CPAN.

    My module offers a much more simpler interface to the Skype API and
    will be actively developed, while the author of the existing module
    has told me he has ceased development and support.

  enteredby:   MNCOPPOLA (Michael Coppola)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb 27 19:12:12 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::Skype           bdpOg Interface to the Skype API on Windows        MNCOPPOLA
