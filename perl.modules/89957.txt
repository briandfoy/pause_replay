Hi,

I'm trying to put RTF::Parser "on ice" nicely, by getting a version that
passes all tests, doesn't say UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE, etc, up on the CPAN.

The most recent version gave me indexing failures for the following
submodules:

RTF::Action
RTF::Charsets
RTF::Config
RTF::Control
RTF::HTML::Converter
RTF::TEXT::Converter

Which were part of the original distribution, but apparently didn't get
transferred over circa 2004 when the module was handed over to me.

Please could someone fix?
