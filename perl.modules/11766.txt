Hello,

I've taken over maintenance of Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet with
the blessing of the original author (see below).

An updated version is located in my CPAN directory (my CPAN id is IVAN).
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/I/IV/IVAN/Business-OnlinePayment-AuthorizeNet-3.11.tar.gz

Would you be so kind as to update the CPAN index to reflect this
information?  Thanks you.

I haven't used or really maintained the onlinepayment modules in quite a
while, if you would like to take them over, be my guest, I'll try and
answer questions the best I can if you have any...
