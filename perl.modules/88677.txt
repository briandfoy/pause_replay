The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MIME::Multipart::ParseSimple
  DSLIP:       adpO2
  description: simple multipart parser, maintains doc order
  userid:      JIMI (Jimi Carlo Wills)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    MIME::Parse

  rationale:

    I have a requirement for knowing the part order, and I can't find
    another parser that keeps the order (because they're all in a hash
    keyed on content-disposition). Also, they all write the files out to
    tmp, which I don't want (and can't guarantee will work on every
    target).

    So instead of that, I parse into an array. This is returned (by
    reference) from a parse() method, which accepts a filehandle as its
    argument. Each item of the list corresponds to a MIME header and is
    a hash of header items, with the first corresponding to the
    multipart header and including Preable and Epilog if present. The
    content of each part is keyed as "Body" and any header parameters
    (e.g. boundary) are parsed into hashed and keyed as
    "<Header-Name>.params".

    E.g., the boundary itself would be at:

    $returned_listref->[0]->{"Content-Type.params"}->{boundary}

    I do nothing to parse/decode the actual content.

    This module is pure for my own needs, but I figure I might as well
    share it. Somebody might find it interesting.

The resulting entry would be:

MIME::Multipart::
