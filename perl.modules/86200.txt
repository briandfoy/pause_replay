PAUSE only insists that version be non-decreasing.  There is no
problem with them being the same. Many distributions manage module
versions by keeping versions the same unless that specific file is
touched.  Even if you have an entire distribution of modules with the
same version, I don't think there's any problem with that. Perhaps you
were fixing some file permissions or line-ending issue or correcting a
README typo.  PAUSE doesn't care.  It just needs to know which tarball
contains the latest version of a module.

There is a restriction on the *tarball* path -- but you uploaded to
different author directories so that doesn't matter.  Basically, you
just swapped one author for the other as far as PAUSE is concerned.

No, it's because metacpan is stupid.  See
