The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plugin::EnvHash
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Environment Variable Hash for TT2
  userid:      SRSHAH (Sagar R. Shah)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    none - trivial (but very useful imho) module.

  similar:
    no similar Template Toolkit plugins known. Env has a similar name
    for standard perl, but does something quite different.

  rationale:

    NAME Template::Plugin::EnvHash - Environment Variable Hash for TT2

    SYNOPSIS [% USE env = EnvHash %] [% env.SOME_ENV_VAR %]

    DESCRIPTION This is a trivial Template::Toolkit plugin to allow any
    template writer to suck environment variables into their template. I
    wrote it because i was sick of passing %ENV as one of the contents
    of the vars hash that i pass to the process method of Template.

    NAMING I've named this module EnvHash rather than Env because most
    Template::Plugin::X modules are wrappers around module X. Whereas
    this is *not* a wrapper around Perl's Env module. This is because
    the purpose of that module is to export environment variables into a
    package. I did not want to export environment variables into my
    template as environment variables as most environment variables tend
    to have capitalised names (by popular convention) and this might
    cause confusion with the tt2 style of using capitalised words for
    its control structure syntax.

    Of course someone else might come along and not care about this, so
    i leave Template::Plugin::Env free for such a person.

    USING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN TEMPLATES As well as this being a
    useful module for sucking in standard environment variables it also
    allows you to configure template via the environment.

    Some might say using the environment variables to configure your
    template is dangerous, and in an *uncontrolled environment* i would
    agree. However if you have a *controlled* environment it can be
    incredibly useful. Say for example you quickly want to fire your
    usual apache server, but on a different port (perhaps because u want
    to test two sets of changes simultaneous, or perhaps just because
    someone else is using that port). Then using an environment variable
    to pass the port number can be quick dirty and useful.

    Config files are generally better in the long run for most things,
    but as i say it can be useful in a *controlled* environment.

    INSTALLATION This module uses Module::Build for its installation.
    To install this module type the following:

    perl Build.PL ./Build ./Build test ./Build install

    If you do not have Module::Build type:

    perl Makefile.PL

    to fetch it. Or use CPAN or CPANPLUS and fetch it "manually".

    BUGS None known at time of writing. To report a bug or request an
    enhancement use CPAN's excellent Request Tracker:
