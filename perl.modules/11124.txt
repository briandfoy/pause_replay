The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UPS::Nut
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A module to communicate with NUT's upsd
  userid:      KPETERS (Kit Peters)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, NUT ups & upsdev mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm not sure if the module belongs in UPS::Nut or Net::UPS::Nut
    (there's been some debate about that on c.l.p.m) but for the moment,
    I'm submitting as UPS::Nut, and if you folks think it better belongs
    in Net::UPS::Nut, I'll rename it accordingly.

    This module is useful in that it provides an immediately useful
    Perl interface to NUT's upsd, without the need to write the
    underlying socket code. There are methods for querying the most
    commonly-requested bits of information (battery percentage, whether
    it's on-line or on-battery, etc.) and methods for querying other
    bits of information.

    Basically, I think it's a useful animal, and I think other people
    will think so too.
