The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::passwd
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to the passwd database
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am soon to add (and register) many of these modules to CPAN-
    however I really dont beleive the File:: namepsace is the correct
    place for them.

    I have looked into the database namespaces but there is even less
    there.

    What is everyone's thoughts about a root namespace like
    VirtualFile::, VirtualDB::, ::, or something similiar.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::passwd          bdpOp Interface to the passwd database             CMORRIS
