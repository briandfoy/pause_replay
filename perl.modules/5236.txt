Hello All-

Name:  John D. Shearer
e-mail:  jds@jkshearer.com
Homepage:  none
User ID:  JSHEARER

The first module I would like to contribute is Net::BridgeQuery.  BridgeQuery
takes two arguments (address of a bridge enabled device - like a layer 2 switch
- and a community name) and returns a hash reference which is based on MAC address
and port numbers from the bridge forwarding database.  We have found this very
useful for tracking computer locations by incorporating it into a web interface.
 This module uses SNMP and currently requires Net::SNMP.

Description:
Net::BridgeQuery  bdpf?  Query Bridge Forwarding Databases

I would be happy to discuss naming.  Perhaps Net::SNMP::BridgeQuery since it
requires that module?

TIA
John
