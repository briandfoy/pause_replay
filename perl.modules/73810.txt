That all sounds fine to me.

I'll just take EU:M and ::Win32 for the moment then.

EU:C can sit where it is until I actually have a chance to apply, or
something better takes it.

I may also want to play with CPAN::SQLite a bit (at the moment the way
it populates the database is pretty horrible) but I've got other
priorities first, so I'll revisit at a later time.
