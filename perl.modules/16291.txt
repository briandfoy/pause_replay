I am happy to announce that Class-Prototyped-0.90 has been released.
Class::Prototyped provides for fast and full-featured prototype-based OO
programming in Perl.

The impetus behind this release was trying to figure out why some of the
test suite was failing under Perl v5.8.0.  I was happy in the end to
discover that the problem was actually in the test suite.  In v.5.6.x,
lexically scoped variables with the same scoping go out of scope in the
order in which they were declared.  In v.5.8.0, it appears that they go out
of scope in the reverse order (which actually makes a lot more sense).  The
new test suite addresses this issue by adding additional scopes so that the
order in which the variables go out of scope is explicitly defined.  In
discovering this, however, I decided that the existing destruction behavior
was suboptimal, and so the code was modified to improve the behavior and
additional test cases were added to verify the code.

Ned Konz (NEDKONZ) is no longer the primary maintainer of this module - he
has stopped using Perl in favor of Squeak (he is one of the 6 core Squeak
developers), and so I have assumed complete responsibility for the module.
