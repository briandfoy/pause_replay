Hi there

I wrote a bunch of classes to speed up the building of a gtk2 gui to fetch =
records from a database.=20

These were all in the package Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker.

Access to the database can be made with plain sql and DBI, Rose::DB::Object=
 or DBIx::Class, however the classes that interact with the database are al=
so under Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker and not somewhere in Rose::DB::Ex ... or DBIx::=
Class ...=20

Now I have added two classes to build the gui using Wx. I would like to add=
 these classes in the same Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker for simplicity, but isn't tha=
t a little weird ?

Should I migrate all the classes to a different package hierarchy ? should =
I split ?=20

Thanks for any suggestion

Fran=E7ois
