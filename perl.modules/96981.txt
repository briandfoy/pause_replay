     why:

    I'm working on, amongst other things, a perl library that
    implements the Discord public API
    (https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) and a couple of bots
    that leverage it.

    I don't believe there are any other perl implementations of this
    yet, and I'm not aware of any in active development other than my
    own.

    On a more selfish note, it would be nice if I this module could be
    installed from cpan like anything else so that I don't have to make
    others manually install from my github.

    I also write a lot of asynchronous api implementations using
    Mojo::UserAgent, often because CPAN doesn't have an existing
    asynchronous module available, so these might be useful to others as
    well.
