The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::IPfree
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Look up country of IP Address.
  userid:      GMPASSOS (Gaciliano Monteiro Passos)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    hwx-users@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Geo::IP

  rationale:

    This module, Geo::IPfree, can be used off-line and has a free,
    small(200Kb) and fast database to make the country lookpup of the
    IPs. It has an open architecture for the database file too.

    CPAN has a similar module (Geo::IP), but it's not FREE, because it
    doesn't come with the database and you need to buy it! It's very
    slow (if you use the PurePerl version) or you need to use a DLL (not
    open source)!!!!! The database file is very big (1MB) and has a
    crazy architecture to the user don't see the content!!!! :-/

    My module is more simple, but with the same resources, fast and the
    users are free to do what they want with it!

    I can't deal with the developer of Geo::IP to make it like
    Geo::IPfree or to work with him, since my architecture make the
    moudle 100% free and the developer of Geo::IP showed that he don't
    want this.

    ... Well, my module is done and I want to publish it ;-)

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
