Hey there Friend,

What a weekend here in the Midwest!

The weather was picture perfect, and I pretty much didn't do anything except relax. Let me tell ya, that doesn't happen too often. But now that I'm back in the office (and frankly, I don't really wanna be here) I figured it's a great time to take on some questions from my subscribers. That always brightens my day!

Okay...here's one I've been getting (and this is no joke) on average of about 20 times per DAY...

Email: "Hey Lou, I know fortunes are made in realestate every day but you see, I'm working 9 to 5 every day with a two hour commute. By the time I get home I have to help the kids with homework, make dinner and when I'm done with all that I just don't have the time to get involved in this...what can I do?"

My reply: Great question, but the first thing you have to understand is that you cannot create time. It's that simple. You really only have a couple of choices. One, quit your job and hope you make money in realestate right away. I really don't advise that but it is a choice. Or two, find the type of investing that works with your busy schedule. 

For example...our New Homes Program.

The beauty of this program is that virtually anyone can do it as long as you can spare a few minutes a week, because the company that centers around this does all the work FOR you. They find the property, finance the property...and even find you a buyer.

And my absolute favorite part is...all the houses are brand spanking new construction. No junkers and no repairs...leaving you with yet even more time to do what needs to be done in your life.

It really doesn't get much easier than that, Friend!

So you haven't checked it out yet?

Well, you better do it like, right NOW!

http://www.homebusinessrealestate.com 

We only have 34 spots left as of today and just by the interest this has sparked among my subscribers, I can betcha they will be gone by the end of the day...

Don't say I didn't warn you.

Take care,

Lou
