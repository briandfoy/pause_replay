The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Std
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Standardize a DBI based app's DB interaction
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::SQLEngine, SQL::AnyDBD

  rationale:

    Some standard tools and framework for standarizing your DBI based
    Applications to make them easier to write & maintain, run as
    efficiently and portable as possible, and give a "best pratice" safe
    and perlish "do or die"ability base form which to create Database
    intensive apps.

    Trimmed down "smarter" idea of DBIx::SQLEngine and more efficient
    than SQL::AnyDBD

    - Abstracts some ideas like table prefixes and simplifies theri
    use. - adds a more perlish $dbh->method or die $dbh->errstr paradigm
    to - works more intuitively and efficiently on queries by using
    iteratable-code-refs (sort of like HACK #25)

The resulting entry would be:
