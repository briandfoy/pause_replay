Hi Baruch!

   (disclaimer: I'm not a member of the modules@perl.org cabal, I've just
been temporary recruited to help with the massive amount of email. So
caveat emptor. :-) )

	Depends of what you want to do.

	At first glance, cf-0.01_1.pl looks more like a script than a module. If 
that's the way you want to publish it, then look at 
http://cpan.org/scripts/submitting.html for how to publish a script to CPAN. 
cf-0.01_1.pl is not too far from the required format, so you should be able 
to correct it rather easily.

	If you really want to publish it under the Number::Theory::CFrac umbrella, 
then I recommend that you look at perlnewmod 
(http://perldoc.perl.org/perlnewmod.html), which is a pretty thorough 
tutorial on publishing modules on CPAN. 

	As for the alphaness of the module, you can tag it as such by logging to 
PAUSE, go to 'Edit Module Metadata' and set the development phase of the 
module as 'alpha'. 

	If you have further questions/problems, please feel free to poke me back.

Joy,
`/anick
