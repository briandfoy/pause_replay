Contribution: XML::EasySlice - Fast, Easy, Different Access to XML

XML::EasySlice is similar to XML::EasyOBJ, XML::XPath, XML::Generator 
and XML::Simple.  EasySlice is built on top of XML::LibXML.  EasySlice 
is most similar to EasyOBJ but deals with slicces of an XML document.  
EasySlice should also be much faster since it is written on top of 
XML::LibXML.  EasySlice is must more flexible about dealing with 
attributes.  I have had my team testing XML::EasySlice in production for 
a few weeks and everyone is very happy with it's ease of use and 
performance.

Thanks for your time-
