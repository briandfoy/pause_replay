Well, of the various things we've bandied about, I have to say I'm still
partial to Text::QuickTemplate.  This module is quicker to learn, 
about as quick to type, and quicker to execute than Template.

Failing that, Text::SimpleTemplate, Text::FastTemplate, even
Text::StupidTemplate :-)  I think that focusing on the printf-like
features misses the point.

Also, I'd like to revisit a comment you made earlier in this thread:

Was that a non-sequitur, referring to how quick (as in easy) it is to
use the module (as measured in characters of code)?  Or did you misread
the benchmark statistics I posted there?  My module ran 15 to 28 times
quicker than Template!

I've been wondering about that... it just seemed an odd place in the
message for you to make that statement.

Thanks,
Eric
