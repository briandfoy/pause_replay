My module has now been uploaded as:
	
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/ML/MLFISHER/SQL-AnchoredWildcards-1.0.tar.g
z
along with the appropriate readme file.  Could you please enter it onto the
modules list?  The DSLI entry should be:

DSLI entry:
SQL::
::AnchoredWildcards	Rdpf	SQL LIKE terms with '^' and '$' anchors

Thanks!

> NAME
>     SQL::AnchoredWildcards - add anchors ('^', '$') to SQL wildcards
> 
> SYNOPSIS
>       use SQL::AnchoredWildcards;
>       $pattern = sql_anchor_wildcards($pattern);
> 
> DESCRIPTION
>     SQL::AnchorWildcards enhances the default SQL wildcard
>     processing by adding support for '^' and '$' as in Perl regular
>     expressions. When using sql_anchor_wildcards(), if the pattern
>     does not contain '^' ('$'), the search pattern is unanchored at
>     the beginning (end). Escaping of '^' and '$' is done with '\'.
> 
>     Please also note that '$' is properly escaped for Perl's
>     benefit.
