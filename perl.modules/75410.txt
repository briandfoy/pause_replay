Argh, I choose the wrong link in the email and ending up registering
the module anyway. So, I marked that namespace as "Can be deleted from
database", which means it will disappear when PAUSE decides to clean
up. You still might see it. Just ignore it.

I re-registered it as SAFT and transferred primary maintainership to
you.

If you run into any problems, please let us know.

Thanks,
