Given he's a fairly laid back guy and "doesn't work on 5.12" is a bitch at
this stage, I've granted you co-maint in order to get this situation
resolved. Please *only* use this co-maint access for bug fixes for 5.12 and
any further bug fixes that result from that for the moment; my motivation
is not a fast takeover but merely a fixed version on CPAN (I cite Adam
Kennedy's treatment of Template as precedent for this).

If we don't hear anything from xmath for a few months, we can consider the
module to be yours.

XMATH, come back, we miss you!
