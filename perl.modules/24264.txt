Hi,

I am looking for IO::SOCKET::INET module for perl version 5_004 running on AIX
4.3.3. I have browsed thru www.perl.com/CPAN, but not able to see any relevant
info.

Can you share this information such as from where I can download this module
along with installation instructions ?

Thanks in advance,
Mani.A.K.
