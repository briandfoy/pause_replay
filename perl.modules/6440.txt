Planning to contribute:
	just a simple patch to HTTP::Lite to allow multipart/form-data
POST,  thus allowing for file uploading, while being faithful to the
original principle of an independent, stand alone HTTP module.

	The HTTP::Lite module by Roy Hooper (rhooper) makes sense.

	Although really basic and with probably some limitations/(bugs?) ,
this  package is really interesting for having perl accessing the web
without the need for ghttp lib from gnome, or LWP libwww, or curl-easy -
the other substitutes. Just as the initial HTTP::Lite, this addition is simple,
and prone to be abused and does NOT depend on any other modules other than
the standard.

Original author of HTTP::Lite

	What should I do now ? Is there a CVS I can submit the update for
revision by the author ? Am I supposed to create the test.pl patch to test
it as well ?
