The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::SQLEngine
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Extends DBI with high-level operations
  userid:      EVO (Matthew Simon Cavalletto)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perl Monks

  similar:
    Alzabo Class::DBI DBIx::Abstract DBIx::SearchBuilder SQL::AnyDBD

  rationale:

    The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for the
    DBI database framework.

    Each SQLEngine driver object is a wrapper around a DBI database
    handle, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation and query
    execution in a single call. Dynamic subclassing based on database
    server type enables cross-platform portability. Schema objects allow
    you to treat each table in your database as an object, while Record
    objects allow you to treat each row in a table as an object.

    I've selected the DBIx:: namespace as this seems to be the emerging
    standard for DBI wrappers and assistants.

    This module has been on CPAN for around two years and is a required
    dependency of several other packages.
