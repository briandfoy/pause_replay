The DBI::* namespace is reserved for modules that form part of the DBI.
The DBIx::* namespace is for modules that extend the functionality of the DBI.

So DBIx::SimpleTools would be better, only "SimpleTools" isn't a
very meaningful module name.

There are many DBI related modules that seem to provide similar
functionality (not to mention that selectall_arrayref can return
data just as your "handiest feature" does). Perhaps you could discuss
yours on the dbi-users mailing list to see how they compare and get
a better feel for the unique features of yours.

The ARS functionality probably ought to be in a separate module.

Tim.
