You keep asking us for our advice, and when we tell you you end up at a
point where it's as if we hadn't said anything. At least three people
(myself, Adam, and Jarkko) have tried very diplomatically to discourage
your idea, and Adam has posted a very thoughtful and long message about
it.

What more do you need? That's not really a question for you to answer
because I'm starting to think that you really don't care what we say
and will just keep askinge until you get some answer that you can
rationalize as an endorsement.

So, here it is, again, in a nutshell with no equivocation: 

YOUR IDEA OF BREAKING UP BIOPERL IS REALLY, REALLY BAD.

And our conclusion is:

DON'T DO IT!
