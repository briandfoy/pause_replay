Hi Andrew,

I'm writing to you as one of the admins of the Perl Authors Upload
Server. We noticed your recent upload of Acme::Pasty. Although it may
be an interesting experiment to see how your search engine rankings
improve, I don't think the module is appropriate for CPAN. Once
somebody gets away with something like this, many people will follow.

Please delete Acme::Pasty. If you're not sure how to do that, I can do
it for you.

Thanks,
