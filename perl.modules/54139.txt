The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       QDRDBMS
  DSLIP:       cmpOg
  description: Full-featured truly relational DBMS in Perl
  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    qdrdbms-*@mm.DarrenDuncan.net, dbi-users, perl6-language,
    #perl6@freenode, dbix-class and other DB-related lists

  similar:
    Rosetta (which it replaces), DBI, DBD::*, Genezzo, various DBI
    wrappers, ORMs, persistence solutions, Set implementing modules,
    language implementations

  rationale:

    First and foremost, QDRDBMS is a ground-up rewrite of Rosetta and
    is its official successor; unlike Rosetta, QDRDBMS actually works.
    Rosetta was granted a place in the module list on 2003-01-21.

    Rosetta should be deleted from the module list, and QDRDBMS added
    instead.

    In the interest of full disclosure, I intend QDRDBMS to be a
    temporary name for the project while it is in its pre-alpha
    implementation stage, and I intend to rename it to something else
    when it becomes mature, the other new name being what it would be
    branded with (that should be the last change). That rename could
    happen in about 1 year's time; however, I still believe it is
    worthwhile to register the QDRDBMS name in the mean time, and remove
    the Rosetta registration.

    I intend to release QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 to CPAN any
    day now (maybe even today?), but meanwhile you can see its latest
    version in version control at http://utsl.gen.nz/gitweb/?p=QDRDBMS .
    A co-developed and synchronized QDRDBMS version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is
    bundled with the Perl6-Pugs project, in its ext/QDRDBMS/ directory;
    whenever the next Pugs is released to CPAN, that will be included.

    With both initial versions, QDRDBMS has zero external dependencies
    but for Perl/Pugs itself and what is bundled with it; this should
    ease installation.

    For the best explanation at the moment of what QDRDBMS is, see the
    DESCRIPTION POD in file lib/QDRDBMS.pm at the url above. But to
    summarize:

    QDRDBMS defines and implements a computationally complete
    programming language with integrated database functionality. It is a
    framework with a separate programmatic API and pluggable
    implementing engines, one of which is bundled with the core so it
    works out of the box. Structurally the framework resembles the DBI,
    but that its native input and output is a tree of QDRDBMS::AST
    objects rather than strings of SQL or something else. The AST is
    fully expressive and can represent anything SQL can, but in a more
    deterministic fashion, and it can represent many things that SQL
    can't easily. QDRDBMS implements a D language according to Darwin
    and Date (see docs).

    Conceptually speaking, QDRDBMS is either a replacement for DBI, or
    a replacement for any SQL DBMS itself, depending on how you use it;
    out of the box it replaces both, but plug-in bridges can be made
    that bridge to either.

    As far as the whole package goes, perhaps Genezzo on CPAN is the
    most similar, as both are written in Perl and implement a
    self-contained DBMS.

    In general, I like to think that QDRDBMS is truly unique and
    nothing on CPAN comes close to it; any resemblences are more at a
    distance.

    In addition, there are no Perl 6 modules at all that work with
    databases, so in that area QDRDBMS for Perl 6 would be the first.
