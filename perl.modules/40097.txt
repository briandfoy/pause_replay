Autrijus,

That had occured to me, however all the Perl6:: modules I've seen are
experimental source filters, whereas this isn't, and neither does it
try to do anything particularly 'funky' that can't/shouldn't be done
in perl5.

I'm not sure whether it's suitable (and also not sure whether I want
to be 'tarred with that brush').

Carl
