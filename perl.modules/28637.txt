From now until Friday, February 27, 2004, we are offering our unique 
bookselling service at our lowest price ever.  

For just $150, we will feature your book for 6 months on our unique 
bookselling website www.bookmanmarketing.com.

We will also compose and send a snappy promotion about your book directly 
to the owners of 1000 independent bookstores.  You approve the promotion 
and can make any changes you want at no extra charge.   You also help 
choose what part of the country and what kind of bookstore to target.  
  
That $150 also includes following up on every lead from your campaign and 
doing whatever we can to get your book into stores.
