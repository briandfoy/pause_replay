No the main goal of the module is to automate GUI tasks such
as clicking the mouse or typing something. I've thought about
it and simple Win32::Automate is too ambiguous, as I am not
automating things beyond GUI, or in other words, the module
emulates a normal user interacting with the computer, as in 
"wait for certain graphic to appear on the screen and press
appropriate buttons regarding the location of that graphic"

The way my module came to existence is: I needed to automate
certain GUI tasks. I've used Win32::GUIRobot, I found it rather
complicated for "quickie-hacks", I wrote an extension that
simplified (at least in my opinion) the use on Win32::GUIRobot
thus I named it Win32::GUIRobot::Easy.

I've used HTML::TokeParser, I found it complicated to use for
"quickie-hacks". I was HTML::TokeParser::Simple and it simplified
the use of HTML::TokeParser.

I figured the whole *::Easy thing would be straight-forward,
but apparently it's not, especially because my module does
a little bit more and leaves some of the features behind. Therefore,
I propose a name:

	Win32::GUITaskAutomate
