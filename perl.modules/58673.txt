To whom it may concern,

I have mostly implemented a technique for extracting data records from
websites that is listed here:

http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/KDD-03-techReport.pdf

I want to upload to CPAN for the first time.  And I would wonder what
to call this particular module.

Moreover, I have written hundreds of other modules and I plan to
upload many of them to CPAN.  Even though I use CPAN in depth, I doubt
that I know enough about the naming conventions to properly name all
of the modules I plan to upload.

Should we create a new namespace starting with FRDCSA:: and just dump
all the modules in there, or I prepare a large list of all the
modules, their function, and proposed renaming, or can someone assist
me in person with the renaming?

My project is at:

http://frdcsa.onshore.net/frdcsa/internal/index.html

Thanks,
Andrew Dougherty (not Andy Dougherty)

p.s.  Also, does anyone know of a CPAN compatible license that forbids
against military (and/or intelligence community) use?
