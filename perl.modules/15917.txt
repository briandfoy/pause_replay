The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Cursor
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Manipulate the mouse cursor programmatically
  userid:      DUNNIGANJ (Jack Dunnigan)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    ptk Mailing list - comp.lang.perl.tk newsgroup

  similar:
    Tk::HideCursor

  rationale:

    This module will use existing Tk features or native win32 calls
    (requires Win32::API) to manipulate the mouse cursor
    programmatically. All methods will apply to user-specified
    widget(s). This module will incorporate calls to hide or show the
    cursor when over a widget, move the cursor to a specified widget, or
    confine the cursor within a widget boundary.

    Tk already has the capability to 'configure' the cursor
    type(shape), so this module does not do that. However, easier cursor
    configuration to a number of widgets simultaneously could be grafted
    in a future release.

    Tk::HideCursor is a relatively new module on CPAN which is limited
    in functionality, has bugs on Win32, and writes temporary files on
    Unix :-(

    Tk::Cursor will have no relation to this existing module.

    The above mentioned functionality suggests that Tk::Cursor is an
    appropriate name. Others I have considered are Tk::CursorControl,
    Tk::MouseControl. I have dropped a few hints on using the Tk::Cursor
    namespace in e-mails to the ptk mailing list and to
    comp.lang.perl.tk and have not yet heard any negative feedback.

    As time comes closer to a release, I will discuss this namespace
    again on the lists mentioned.

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
