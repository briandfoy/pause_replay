     why:

    I've been working on a project, which should come to fruition soon,
    that will allow a more OO approach to entering data and style
    information to gnuplot, and the integration to Catalyst (although
    I'm aiming to make this more flexible than just gnuplot). I would
    like to make this public, and this seems the most appropriate portal
    through which to achieve this :)
