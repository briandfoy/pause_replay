From: boards@sheldrake.net (Mike Sheldrake)

I've made an extension module around "Triangle", a production quality C 
library that does fast, robust Delaunay triangulations and quality mesh 
generation. Triangle is by Jonathan Shewchuck, a CS professor at UC 
Berkeley, and an active researcher in the field of computational geometry.

I'm proposing Math::Geometry::Delaunay as the package name.

The Triangle library should be worthy of backing that claim on the 
Delaunay name in the Perl realm. It does conforming Delaunay 
triangulations as well as constrained and conforming constrained 
triangulations. It uses the fastest known strategy, and achieves
numerical robustness in an efficient and convenient way.

Other packages that might provide similar quality services in the future 
will probably come into Perl under larger package names like CGAL, GEOS, 
or Boost. As a standalone dedicated Delaunay triangulator,
Triangle seems to be one of the best in the field. So,

Math::Geometry::Delaunay

Sound okay?
