Hi there,

There is an Agent module - see:

	http://search.cpan.org/dist/Agent/

Maybe there is a problem with the CPAN indexer?  See the comment here:

	http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Agent

Though it is old and I am not maintaining the module anymore, I've  
kept it up there because it is mentioned in Paul Barry's book:

	http://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/~pnb/

If someone else can make better use of the namespace, I'm all ears.

Cheers,
-Steve
