I recently uploaded Pod-Index-0.10, which contains the Pod::Index 
module, and got an indexing error.

I *did* check to make sure that such a module didn't exist already, but 
I failed to notice that this namespace had been registered as "under 
construction" many years ago by KJALB (http://search.cpan.org/~kjalb/). 
Since KJALB has not uploaded anything in five years, and his domain 
seems to have expired, I'm assuming that he abandoned his plans for an 
implementation of Pod::Index.

I would like the registration for Pod::Index to be transferred to my 
PAUSE ID, ITUB, if possible.

Thanks,
Ivan (itub)
