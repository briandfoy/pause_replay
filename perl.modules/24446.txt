Hi, I have a problem with the installation of my modules=
 (Text::MagicTemplate 
and HTML::MagicTemplate) that I am not able to solve by myself even reading=
 all 
the doc I found until now.

It's a very simple installation with just 2 very simple Makefile.PL, that I=
 
checked some hundred of times, but I probably ignore some simple rule or=
 there 
is a bug in the cpan system.

If you try to install by cpan the Text::MagicTemplate module, cpan tries to=
 
install HTML::MagicTemplate instead, and since the HTML::MagicTemplate has=
 the 
Text::MagicTemplate module as a prerequisite, cpan detects a recursive 
dependency.

Please try this to  reproduce the problem :

install Bundle::Text::MagicTemplate

It should be reproducible even if you just try:

install Text::MagicTemplate

These are the important lines that you should obtain from the installation=
 that 
should explain the problem:

> Running install for module Text::MagicTemplate
> Running make for D/DO/DOMIZIO/HTML-MagicTemplate-3.14.tar.gz

Please let me know what is happening.

THANK YOU for your time

Domizio Demichelis
