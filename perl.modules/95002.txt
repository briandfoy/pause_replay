People come to me and ask "Mr Trump, aren't you too divisive?". I am going
to tell you - I am a uniter. I can always strike a deal across the isle,
and in fact I am going to prove it by making a deal with lying Dave: if he
approves this account, I am going to vouch for his Leftpad thing! How is
that for bipausemanship!?
