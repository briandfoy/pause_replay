It makes an object that twiddles text for plain text , html.

In addition it can be used as a base class to twiddle text in an  
animated gif, tk, curses, etc

Term::Twiddle does that for a terminal only and as far as twiddleing  
is just

  start()
  do_something_that_takes_awhile()
  stop()

So its terminal specific in that start() is still twiddling while   
do_something_that_takes_awhile() is running, you can't really do that  
in a browser without some Spork()ing and process watching.
