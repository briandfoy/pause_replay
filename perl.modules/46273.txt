The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Ex
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Utility Suite - applications made fun & easy
  userid:      RHANDOM (Paul T. Seamons)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    On the dev teams of several companies (not so much in public forums
    yet)

  similar:
    CGI::Application CGI::Prototype HTML::FillInForm Data::FormValidator

  rationale:

    Belatedly registering the namespace for a module that has been out
    for several years and is employing principles gathered for several
    years before that.

    CGI::Ex and its modules makes programming CGI's simple (once the
    documentation is updated). It uses CGI and Template::Toolkit as
    basics and provides all of the
    wrapper/dispatcher/stickyforms/validator code necessary to let you
    model applications the way you want and then handle the rest for
    you.

    It uses techniques that with a little bit of glue scripts can be as
    powerful as Catalyst, but using a model that is less magic and tries
    not to get in your way. You can also do simple dispatching ala
    CGI::Application and CGI::Prototype should you desire.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
