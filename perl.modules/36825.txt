Moin,

ah, forgot one:

http://search.cpan.org/search%3fmodule=3DMath::Prime

This seems also no longer to exist. In addition, the module list registrati=
on=20
of it is faulty (says somethign about FreeBSD system calls). It should be=20
deleted from the module list.

In addition, can the maintainer status for these modules:

> http://search.cpan.org/search%3fmodule=3DMath::RandomPrime
> http://search.cpan.org/search%3fmodule=3DFreeBSD::SysCalls
> http://search.cpan.org/search%3fmodule=3DMath::Prime
> http://search.cpan.org/search%3fmodule=3DCrypt::PRSG

be set to "none" or the maintainer deleted entirely? The modules don't exis=
t,=20
and I really don't want to block their names by having the maintainer statu=
s=20
for them :)

Thank you in advance,

Tels
