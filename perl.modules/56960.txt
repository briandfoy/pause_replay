The two things that are broken are:

1. The earlier versions of Tk were not indexed correctly and had some
unauthorized releases. I think I screwed this up even worse (see the
indexer reports on Tk from earlier this week).

2. NI-S did not have current contact information, which is why I
updated the name field to "PAUSE" and pointed the secret email to
modules.

I don't care how this gets done, and never really have. I'm just trying
to fix these two problems.
