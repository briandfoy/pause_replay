The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Workflow::XPDL
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Modules for XPDL support
  userid:      SRHOTON (Stephen Rhoton)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    cvs.andrew.cmu.edu

  similar:
    Workflow::Xfmc

  rationale:

    Workflow::XPDL is essentially a object oriented reference library
    to read XML documents in XPDL format
    (http://www.Workflow.org/standards/xpdl.htm). As such, it seemed
    logical to put it under workflow, with the name of the language it
    interacts with. This library is different from anything else
    currently on CPAN - it allows a user a Perl interface to directly
    access aspects of XPDL documents, and take action on them as the
    Perl program sees fit. It differs from Workflow::Xfmc, in that
    Workflow::Xfmc allows you to execute an entire XPDL workflow in real
    time. Workflow::XPDL allows perl to interrogate the workflow, and
    act on each step asynchronously, without having to complete the
    workflow - i.e., it gives the user a library to interrogate the
    workflow definition, but does dictate the workflow's complete
    execution.

The resulting entry would be:

Workflow::
::XPDL            bdpOg Modules for XPDL support                     SRHOTON
