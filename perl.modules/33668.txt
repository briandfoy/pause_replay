Maybe I didn't make that clear. This ID _is_ for a single person, in
their work capacity, not for a company or a group - basically because my
employer doesn't want people to use their personal account for work. On
the other hand, I can see how it could be interpreted as a "company ID".

OK, someone at my end is under the impression that BBCIFL should _not_
be used because it goes against your "no accounts for groups of people"
rule. That's why Simon set up BBCSIMONF as distinct from SIMONFLK - he
was under the impression that we ought to have per-person accounts, I
believe.

So are you saying that it's actually better for us to use the BBCIFL
account, given that you've made the effort of creating that already?
Maybe there's simply been a misunderstanding at this end.

best regards
