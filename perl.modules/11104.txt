The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Gsm
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO Interface to GSM phones and modems
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    GSM::SMS::Transport::Serial

  rationale:

    This is a somewhat low-level interface for GSM phones and modems
    (such as Falcom), that allows user to do the basic functions of
    these devices: issuing AT commands, registering to network, checking
    battery charge, signal line status, SMS (text/pdu) sending, ...

    Inherits from Device::Modem class, and re-implements only GSM
    specific AT commands ( `hangup()', for example).

    It differs from GSM::SMS::* modules because this is meant to be an
    open implementation, where I can control all operations done by the
    device, not being concentrated on SMS/Logo/... sending.

  enteredby:   COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr  9 23:40:24 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::Gsm             adpOp OO Interface to GSM phones and modems        COSIMO
