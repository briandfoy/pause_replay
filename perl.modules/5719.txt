To which I can only reply "huh?"

Getargs:: did not pre-exist.  The only module in that namespace is
Raphael Manfredi's Getargs::Long, which was released _after_
Params::Validate by about a month!

So we both simply made up our own namespaces.  The difference is that his
has gotten listed and mine has not.  Admittedly, both modules may belong
in the same namespace.  But my opjection to Getargs:: still stands.  It is
too close to Getopt:: and my module doesn't actually do any 'getting', it
only validates.

As to the 'what it might be good for' bit.  If you're referring to the
modules themselves, they are similar in aims but very different in
interface and capabilities.  They are definitely both useful.  If you're
referring to the namespace, I do think that both modules should share a
namespace, but not Getargs::.
