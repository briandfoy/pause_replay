I uploaded DBD-DB2-070.OS390.pax.gz and the readme file to PAUSE on
07/31/2000. I would like to know when I can have the driver posted on
http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/DBD/
Thanks.

I have put some changes in the source code of DBD-DB2-0.70 and modify the
readme and the CAVEAT files to make the driver work on OS/390. Because it
has some differences in the code such as the method to build the driver and
the level of the driver  I 'd like to have the driver separated for OS/390.
I have uploaded to PAUSE 2 files: DBD-DB2-0.70.OS390.pax.gz ( the source
code) and DBD-DB2_0.70.0S390.readme ( the read me file)

I'm not sure what you're actually registering for.

CPAN doesn't usually store pre-built binaries of modules.

If what you've got is source code changes to the existing IBM DBD::DB2
module, to make it build on OS/390, then they should be fed back to the
maintainers of the module.

Or am I misunderstanding you?

Tim.
