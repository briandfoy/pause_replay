The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Robotics::IRobot
  DSLIP:       anpOp
  description: Module to control iRobot Roomba and Create
  userid:      RATLIFFM (Michael Ratliff)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Robotics root namespace has already been created by Jonathan
    Cline. I agree with his opinion that "Robotics" should be used for
    hardware robots, while "Robots" can be used for software robots
    (webcrawlers and etc.)

    While there exists some good libraries for controlling iRobot
    products in other languages. I was surprised that none exist for
    Perl. So, I am creating one.

  enteredon:   Fri Jan 21 00:21:06 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Robotics::
::IRobot          anpOp Module to control iRobot Roomba and Create   RATLIFFM
