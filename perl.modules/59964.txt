Subject: Module submission Proliphix

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proliphix
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Control Proliphix network thermostats
  userid:      NEBULOUS (John Lifsey)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am certainly willing to put this module in any namespace where it
    fits. Originally I was thinking of something in the Device:: space,
    but it didn't seem to be a peer with the type of devices already
    there. Suggestions welcome. The module is Moose based and already
    working albeit without pleasantries as Proliphix.

  enteredby:   NEBULOUS (John Lifsey)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 10 15:14:21 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Proliphix         adpOp Control Proliphix network thermostats        NEBULOUS
