The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::Assert
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Design-by-contract: pre- and postconditions
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Carp::Assert Class::Contract

  rationale:

    Basically, the module's functionality lies somewhere between that
    of Carp::Assert and Class::Contract in that it replaces subroutines
    with wrappers that test for pre- and postconditions and
    (?:die|warn|croak|carp) in case any of them isn't met. Furthermore,
    it allows to limit the calling context of the subroutine to either
    scalar, list, novoid, void, or any context.

    Carp::Assert is not directly related to subroutine calls.
    Class::Contract is - well - an entirely different league. You can't
    use the assertions functionality of Class::Contract without adopting
    the whole C::C paradigm. Sub::Assert is aimed at providing useful
    error messages as early as possible (read: late) regardless of what
    kind of programming style you prefer. (Well, unless you prefer goto
    over subroutines.)

The resulting entry would be:
