The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::WaveBand
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Filter, wavelength and frequency transforms
  userid:      TJENNESS (Tim Jenness)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Starlink astronomy developer community

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module transparently converts between astronomical filter (eg
    J, H and K in the infrared) to the associated wavelength and
    frequency. It can support multiple telescopes and instruments and
    eases the writing of cross-telescope software.

    Interest has already been expressed in this module from other UK
    telescopes.

    No other modules provide this functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

Astro::
