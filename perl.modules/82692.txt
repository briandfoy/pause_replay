The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Exchange
  DSLIP:       RdpO2
  description: Modules to interface with Microsoft Exchange
  userid:      GBL (Guntram Blohm)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:

  similar:
    Mail::Outlook Email::Outlook

  rationale:

    At the current stage, this module implements reading, modifying and
    writing MS Outlook .msg files. It might have been named
    Mail::Outlook or Email::Outlook, but both these Namespaces are
    already taken.

    Mail::Outlook does a similar thing, but is purely Win32-based and
    relies on Outlook being installed, while this module has no such
    prerequisites (and works well on Linux), and Email::Outlook is a
    pure reader for .msg files that supports just a few attribute, and
    has "converting to MIME format" as its only functionality. It says
    "It would be nice if we could write .MSG files too, but that will
    require quite a big rewrite.".

    Mail::Exchange was written using quite a lot of official MS
    documentation, and its subclasses define lots of constants and
    attribute values which are useful to implement communication with a
    "real" MS Exchange server. Over time, i'm planning to add more
    functionality in that direction, eventually being able to
    communicate with an Exchange server in its native protocol directly
    from perl, without the need for IMAP, SMTP or Exchange Web
    interface.

The resulting entry would be:
