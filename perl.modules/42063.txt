     why:

    This is about a script which can be used to compare output of
    two(or more/series) of files. This is really very important in
    Migration projects. For example If a set of 100 perl files is to me
    migrated to C++/C then the output of Files with Perl or C++ must be
    same. This script can be used to compare outputs of 2 different
    applications.
