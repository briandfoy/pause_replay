The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::AoN
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: All or Nothing Pre-Processing
  userid:      ZANDET (Timothy G. Zander)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a cryptographic module, thus Crypt, AoN for All or Nothing.
    This functionality has not yet been written in Perl, and I needed to
    write this to write a Chaffing and Winnowing module, and would like
    to have it be part of CPAN so that many people can use the module
    easily.

  enteredby:   ZANDET (Timothy G. Zander)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 20 18:12:10 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::AoN             cdpOp All or Nothing Pre-Processing                ZANDET
