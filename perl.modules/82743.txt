My CPAN ID is BULKDD see http://search.cpan.org/~bulkdd/ . It is a derivati=
ve of my online username bulk88. There is an unauthorized release of Win32:=
:API there so that account is me. Also the unauth release did get a PASS cp=
antesters report=2C http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/f87f09c0-3a6b-10=
15-863c-2ca505085451 . My plans in the near future once I get the pause per=
mission is to close the fixed tickets on CPAN RT if that is ok. Thank you f=
or the CPAN release. My goal is to get feedback or bug reports for all my c=
hanges to Win32::API from the public.
