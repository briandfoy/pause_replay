The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Decimal
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Handle french revolutionary time
  userid:      PFEIFFER (Daniel Pfeiffer)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc, soc.culture.esperanto

  similar:
    DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary

  rationale:

    Unlike the above module, my name centers on functionality rather
    than history. Also the DateTime hierarchy does not fit for this
    functionality. That is because it explicitly uses integral seconds
    granularity which is hardly capable of handling a time scheme with
    seconds of a slightly different length.

    Note that this module is already visible in the long module list,
    but is otherwise uncategorised.

  enteredby:   PFEIFFER (Daniel Pfeiffer)
  enteredon:   Mon May  1 14:49:41 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::Decimal         adphp Handle french revolutionary time             PFEIFFER
