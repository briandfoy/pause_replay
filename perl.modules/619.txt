Hello, I'm Clinton Wolfe.  I work for Indiana University, Bloomington,
Indiana, USA.  I am the webmaster of the Stat/Math Center
http://www.indiana.edu/~statmath 
and I'm working on a website management suite, tentatively called Sarah.

I'd like my userid to be CLWOLFE .

The suite is intended for content-rich sites; ie large amounts of HTML,
XML, or text data that can be organized into a tree heirarchy (eg host,
site, document, page, section, subsection...).  See the stat/math center
site for an example of teh type of site it is intended to  manage.

I plan (in the near future) to contribute Sarah to the public domain.
Sarah started as a set of CGI scripts, became a swiss-army-knife module,
and is now becoming a suite of modules.  This is its third incarnation,
so I'm calling this Sarah 3.0 .  

You should know that I am entirely willing to release the whole thing as
WWW::Sarah* . Probably a good idea.

Sarah includes
Sarah
	- Search and Replacement Automaton for Hypertext
Sarah::DBI
	- Utility interface to persistent data source that supports the
DBI::* standard.  Not used by the user.
Sarah::Structure
	- Data structure class.  
Sarah::Importer
	- imports data (From a file, url, etc) into the database.
Intended to be subclassed.
Sarah::Importer::HTML (general html)
Sarah::Importer::XML (general XML)
Sarah::Exporter
	- Exports data in batch (ie a tarball is created of your site) or
on the fly using HTML::Mason.
Sarah::Config
	- site-wide configuration
Sarah::Transfer
	- utilities for exporting and importing files over HTTP, FTP,
ssh's scp, and tcp/ip sockets.  
Sarah::Interface
	- general class for connecting silicon to carbon
Sarah::Interface::Tk
Sarah::Interface::Terminal
Sarah::Interface::CGI
Sarah::Interface::Java (probably won't happen...)
Sarah::Daemon
	- watches for modifications to files, pushes through updates, and
generally keeps the staging and production servers. 

Here's the current status of the project:
DSLI	Name
cdpO	Sarah
adpO	Sarah::Config
idpO	Sarah::Daemon
cdpO	Sarah::DBI
bdpO	Sarah::Importer
bdpO	Sarah::Importer::HTML
idpO	Sarah::Importer::XML
cdpO	Sarah::Interface
idoO	Sarah::Interface::Tk
idpO	Sarah::Interface::Terminal
idpO	Sarah::Interface::CGI
cdpO	Sarah::Structure
cdpO	Sarah::Transfer
iup	Bundle::Sarah

Unfortunately, I haven't talked about this project with anyone public,
outside the Stat/Math Center.

Cheers!
