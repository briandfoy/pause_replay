Either include an empty Apache::AxKit as lib/Apache/Axkit.pm which could
be a documentation index only (i.e. "to get started, read ::Tutorial,
blah blah").

If you don't like that, you're free to ignore this as I have removed the
registration from the deletion list. Be aware, however, that "cpan
Apache::AxKit" probably doesn't work.

Best regards,
Steffen
