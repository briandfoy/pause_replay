The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Params::CallbackRequest
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Parameter-triggered callback architecture
  userid:      DWHEELER (David Wheeler)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    bricolage-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Params::Validate

  rationale:

    Params::CallbackRequest provides functional and object-oriented
    callbacks to method and function parameters. Callbacks can either be
    "request callbacks," triggered for every call to the request()
    method; or can be triggered by special parameter hash key names.
    Although potentially useful in any Perl application,
    Params::CallbackRequest was designed to be used with web
    applications, where the parameters submitted by the browser may be
    configured specifically to trigger callbacks on the server.

    This module takes an important piece of
    MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks (which is deprecated), and
    generalizes it for use with other templating architectures, or
    indeed with any context that processes parameter arguments. Although
    Params::Validate also offers callbacks on parameter arguments, it
    does so purely for validation. Params::CallbackRequest, OTOH, is
    designed for creating callbacks that drive a user interface, such as
    those created by various Perl templating systems.

    The "Request" part of the namespace indicates that the module is
    used to process any requested callbacks in a single call to the the
    function or method that needs its parameters analyzed for callbacks.
    The Params::Callback namespace, on the other hand, represents a
    single instance of a callback object. I'd like to register that
    namespace, as well.

The resulting entry would be:

Params::
::CallbackRequest RdpOp Parameter-triggered callback architecture    DWHEELER
