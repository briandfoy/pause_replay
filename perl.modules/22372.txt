Hello

I had some troubles with Compress::Bzip2.
This Module was uploaded in 1999 as 1.00 and never touched again.

Maintainer is AZEMGI, but the address mentioned on
http://search.cpan.org/author/AZEMGI/
is not vaild anymore.
But I was able to reach him (because the domain is his surname and I
played a little bit with addresses) and he said that he doesn't have
access to CPAN anymore and that he is not longer interested in
maintaining Compress-Bzip2.

Is there any defined process for a module handover from him to me in CPAN?
I started fixing the big bugs and there are still some smaller problems
which needed to be fixed but Compress-Bzip2-1.00 is really buggy, so I
would like to maintain Compress-Bzip2 and release a usable Version.

Please contact me directly for AZEMGI's actual email-address, because he
asked me not to post it onto web archived lists.

Greetings
Oliver Paukstadt
