The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree::FP
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: FP-Tree for TDB association rule mining
  userid:      NITRAM (Martin Paczynski)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    Module implements a FP (Frequent Pattern) Tree data structure.
    Therefore it makes sense to put it in the Tree:: namespace and the
    FP part seems logical since this is how this particular data
    structure is usually referenced (as opposed to using the full name).

    This tree is unique in that it makes mining association rules from
    transactional databases much faster (see "Mining Frequent Patterns
    without Candidate Generation" by Jiawei Han, Jian Pei, and Yiwen
    Yin, 2000 for details). No other member of the CPAN community
    appears to have implemented this data structure before.

    I believe it would be useful to place Tree::FP in the module list
    as it is a fundamental data structure in DM.

  enteredby:   NITRAM (Martin Paczynski)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep  4 13:39:24 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tree::
::FP              bdpOp FP-Tree for TDB association rule mining      NITRAM
