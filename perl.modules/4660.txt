From: ian@bilstone.co.uk (Ian Steel)

I've recently posted this to CPAN.

The module allows templates to be used to layout webpages, and then the =
perl programmer writes code that assigns data to a template. The module =
then merges the data with the template and sends it to a web server.
It is called HTMLTMPL because I originally wrote it for use with my web =
pages, but it can be used for any kind of template / data merging, so =
I'm not sure which part of the module hierarchy it should reside in. =
Currently it is a standalone module.
Would you please advise me where in the module hierarchy this could =
sensibly live, or can it stay standalone?
Will you also be able to add it to the CPAN listings for modules once =
this has been decided please?

Many thanks,

Ian.
