The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Alien::Gnuplot
  DSLIP:       adhnp
  description: Check for (and try to install) Gnuplot
  userid:      ZOWIE (Craig DeForest)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot Chart::Gnuplot Term::Gnuplot
    Charg::Graph::Gnuplot

  rationale:

    Several modules exist whose job is to dispatch plot requests to the
    standalone Gnuplot application in various Perl contexts. Each module
    currently has to check for Gnuplot's presence on its own, and users
    have to manually search for Gnuplot at various repositories.

    Alien::Gnuplot follows the Alien creed: on install it checks for
    Gnuplot and, if it is not present, attempts to install it. On "use
    Alien::Gnuplot" it attempts to find Gnuplot and loads a few package
    variables with self-reported information about the Gnuplot on your
    system (or else throws an exception if it can't find gnuplot). there
    is some hackage so that "use Alien::Gnuplot 4.6" will apply the 4.6
    to the Gnuplot application instead of the module.

The resulting entry would be:

Alien::
::Gnuplot         adhnp Check for (and try to install) Gnuplot       ZOWIE
