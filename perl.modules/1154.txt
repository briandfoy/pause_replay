I can't see any good reason for it to be in the SQL:: category. It's
actually hiding SQL from the user. If I was looking for a module that
let me avoid SQL when using the DBI then I wouldn't look in the SQL::
category.

The DBIx:: category is where most DBI extensions live and this is certainly
a DBI extension.

How about DBIx::Abstract, DBIx::AbstractSQL, etc?
