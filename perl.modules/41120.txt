Subject: Module submission Net::IP::Correct
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IP::Correct
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Breakdown an incorrect range of IP addresses
  userid:      ROHAN (Rohan Almeida)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    newsgroups, web site forums, perlmonks.org, mailinglist

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will exist as a subclass of Net::IP It would basically
    accept a range of IP address (Net::IP objects), and if the range is
    incorrect, it would break it down into seperate correct IP ranges.
    Each IP range returned would be a Net::IP object

    I think Net::IP::Correct is a good enough namespace, although there
    is also Net::IP::Range::Correct, which is more meaningful. I'm open
    to suggestions.

    For example: given the range 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.5, this module
    would break this range down into: - 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.252 -
    192.168.1.4/255.255.255.255 - 192.168.1.5/255.255.255.255

  enteredon:   Sun Jun 19 12:46:47 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::IP::
::Correct         idpOp Breakdown an incorrect range of IP addresses ROHAN
