I would agree that the CUPS API floats among several categories.  The 
reason why Net seems like the most appropriate place for such a module is 
that:

1) Net::LPR is already a registered module and Net::CUPS is very similar 
to that in that it provides the same functionality, but is restricted to 
the CUPS software package.  
2) Eventually I would like to reveal the IPP C API of cups with this 
module - it just isn't on the todo list for next week.
3) The difference between working with a remote CUPS sever and a local one 
is nill with the C API.  Communication is done the same way.

Any suggestions for a more appropriate namespace is definately 
appreciated.
