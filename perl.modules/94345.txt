mework system I have developed to the top level namespace 'Ginger'. Origina=
l discussion is simply that it is multi-purpose and has many components. Mo=

any other namespace properly.</div><div><br></div><div>The original names w=
ere 'App::Core' and 'Framework::Core'.</div><div><br></div><div>'App::Core'=
 was deemed bad, because the framework by itself is not an App. There will =
be apps that utilize it, and those will properly be placed under 'App'.</di=
v><div><br></div><div>'Framework::Core' was deemed bad, because it causes c=
onfusion to the 'Framework' top level namespace, potentially making people =
think it is somehow a 'core thing' of the 'Framework' namespace.</div><div>=
<br></div><div>I have uploaded the changed module to my pause account, but =
it says I do not have permissions to the top level namespace. Could someone=
 please give permissions to my account so that I can make this change?</div=
