ABACHA’S ROYAL FAMILY ESTATE DEVELOPERS/CONSULTANT 


DIRECT PHONE NUMBER - 234-42-25-65-53

sir,

I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that
you will understand my predicament and answer back
without hesitation. I am DR MARYAM ABACHA the wife of
the late Nigerian head of State GENERAL SANI ABACHA.
          I got your contact through business inquires
from the chamber or commerce as I was making contact
for a Honest foreigner who will help save my life and
my children, hence our country has been frustrating us
since the death of my husband.
          I am in possession of $35 000.000 (THIRTY
FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) which I want to invest in
your country. For your clarification and
understanding, this money is in a box which was
deposited with the finance and security company in
disguise as a family effect since 5th of May 1999, is
not an ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from
my Organization FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will
enlighten you more of this organization if you
indicate a helping interest to secure this money on
mybehalf. 
          On your acceptance to render this assistance
to me, I will instruct the finance company to effect a
change of ownership of this fund in your name as the
bona-fide owner/my next of kin to enable you retrieve
the fund, also I will disclose to you the country and
the name of the finance and security company wherethis
money is being deposited.
          What I demand from you is to arrange and go
to the finance company where this money is
beingdeposited 
   And claim it. It is very ideal you forward to me
your private telephone and fax numbers / Company
Profile, Occupation, enable me send all relevant
documents pertaining the deposit of this fund for your
study.  Bear in mind that this transaction demands
absolute confidentiality because properties, assets
and bank accounts both local and international bearing
the ABACHA’S family name, are being ordered to be
confiscated by the Already elected civilian President
of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will
not want to be exposed. For your knowledge, 20% of
this fund $35 000.000 (THIRTY FIVE MILLION U.S
DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me to
secure this fund and another 5% has  set aside
for
all the expenses you might incur during the process of
securing this fund.   Example: TELEPHONE BILLS, HOTEL
BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS and other miscellaneous expenses.
          When you must have taken the agreed
percentage, you will use part of the balance to buy a
living house for my family there in your country,
where we shall live in future and the remaining part
will be kept for investment package also in your
country, which will be under your supervision.
Contact me immediately, as I and my son
(NOVA ABACHA) who knows everything as regards to this
business is longing to have a talk with you. And bear
in mind that this is the only remaining fund for
the  survival of my family.

Thanks for your 

ABACHA.
