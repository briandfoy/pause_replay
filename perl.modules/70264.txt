So. My memory sayeth that we don't normally do corporate accounts, since
previously there's been a lot of trouble with them having -nobody- attached,
whereas with a single person's account they can be marked unresponsive and
another single person found, whereas given an entire company people can
simply, well, not know who's supposed to care anymore.

I wonder if this might be a case for a mailing list account that can give
out permissions to whichever 6a authors are actually doing the uploading?
