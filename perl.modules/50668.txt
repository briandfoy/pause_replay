The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audacious
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to Audacious
  userid:      AERDAN (Kiyoshi Aman)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    #audacious on irc.oscnet.org

  similar:
    XMMS

  rationale:

    Audacious deserves its own namespace, as the associated application
    is accessible similarly to XMMS, but lately supports TCP sockets as
    well. Please note that audacious [not audacity] is a GTK2-based fork
    off of BMP, which in turn was forked off of XMMS.

  enteredby:   AERDAN (Kiyoshi Aman)
  enteredon:   Sat Sep  2 05:06:13 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Audacious         RdpOp Interface to Audacious                       AERDAN
