The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::ReluctantORM
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: A reluctant ORM for reluctant people
  userid:      CLWOLFE (Clinton Wolfe)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::DBI DBIx::Class RoseDB

  rationale:

    Class::ReluctantORM is the public release of an ORM developed
    in-house at OmniTI Computer Consulting (http://www.omniti.com).
    Class::ReluctantORM is designed appeal to DBAs and others who are
    reluctant to use (or permit their developers to use) ORMs. Three
    major features make this possible:

    - "Reluctance" - calling an accessor on a relational field will
    never result in a database fetch - if the related object was
    pre-fetched, the cached value is returned, otherwise, an exception
    is thrown. This tends to catch hidden fetches at development time,
    and coerces the developer into using a prefetching approach.

    - "Monitors" - as the ORM converts an API call into SQL, the ORM
    provides an event-listener model for 6 events through the
    transformation process. The SQL monitors may collect statistics, log
    diagnostics, or abort the query. Several monitors are provided, and
    it is easy to add custom monitors.

    - "SQL Pass-Thru" - Other ORMs attempt to solve 100% of your data
    access and manipulation needs, while still allowing custom SQL.
    Class::ReluctantORM allows custom SQL, but only tries to solve 90%
    of your problems :-) The hard problems are yours to solve in SQL.

    Note on namespace: I'm comfortable moving this to any other
    rootlevel namespace more appropriate for ORMs. The distro is being
    renamed from its internal name (OmniTI::Class::TableBacked) anyway,
    so if something else make more sense, I'm open to the idea.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::ReluctantORM    adpOb A reluctant ORM for reluctant people         CLWOLFE
