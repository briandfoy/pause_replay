The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Tweak
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: tweak nested data with composable changes
  userid:      BOWMANBS (Brad Bowman)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    In person

  similar:
    Hash::Merge Class::XPath

  rationale:

    Hash::Merge has top level control of merging and issues with
    cloning. I aim to push the edit smarts into the data, increasing
    flexibility while preserving shared references where possible. The
    edits should compose so that they can be prepared onced and applied
    many times. It'll be well cool. I hope.

  enteredby:   BOWMANBS (Brad Bowman)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 22 01:56:52 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Tweak           cdphp tweak nested data with composable changes    BOWMANBS
