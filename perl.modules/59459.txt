From: andy@dynamicbits.com ("Andy")

I am writing a perl module to control a HDZ300 HD Radio via serial port.
Some modules I have found which provide similar control for other types
of radio are named as follows:

Audio::Radio::Sirius
Audio::Radio::XM::PCR
Audio::Xmpcr
THD7

Based solely on those examples, it would seem that
Audio::Radio::HD::HDZ300 would be an appropriate name.

On the other hand, looking through the list of modules for other
devices, it seems that something like Device::Radio::HD::HDZ300 is
actually more appropriate since this module will directly control a
device rather than actually handle audio.

Is there any better documentation available that could assist me?
