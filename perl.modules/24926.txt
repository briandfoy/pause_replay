     why:

    First plan is a module to produce reasonably intelligent "diffs"
    between data structures (not just tell if they are different.)
    Motivation was finding out how inadequate diffing Data::Dumper
    output was when testing that a replacement system did (essentially)
    the same thing as an original system. Output will be code to
    transform one structure into another (excepting CODEREFs, etc), with
    various ways of configuring choices made between, say, overwriting
    an array and splicing into it.
