The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTime
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: A complete, easy to use date and time object
  userid:      DROLSKY (Dave Rolsky)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org list

  similar:
    Lots of them, but none of them work with each other, and none are
    complete. It's a mess.

  rationale:

    There's been a _lot_ of discussion of this on the datetime@perl.org
    list. The main reason to avoid the existing Date:: and Time::
    namespaces is that the goal is for everything in DateTime::* to
    actually work together, as opposed to the existing date and time
    modules, none of which are designed to be inter-operable.

  enteredby:   DROLSKY (Dave Rolsky)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb  4 20:06:33 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DateTime          ampOp A complete, easy to use date and time object DROLSKY
