Subject: Module submission eBay::API::Simple

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       eBay::API::Simple
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Flexible SDK for all eBay web services
  userid:      TKEEFER (Tim Keefer)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://code.google.com/p/ebay-api-simple/

  similar:
    eBay::API, Net::eBay

  rationale:

    This library is an object-oriented approach that allows for
    backends to be built that can support the ever changing web services
    that eBay makes public. This SDK is generic enough to support more
    than eBay, but specifically targets eBay. This library was built and
    is maintained by an employee working at eBay (me .. :-)) and
    currently supports the http://worldofgood.ebay.com and
    http://global.ebay.com eBay sites. The group I joined at eBay
    originally build eBay::API which is now a deprecated toolkit since
    it works only with eBay's trading API services. I would like to get
    this module registered so I can start promoting this toolkit on
    developer.ebay.com

The resulting entry would be:

eBay::API::
::Simple          MdpOp Flexible SDK for all eBay web services       TKEEFER
