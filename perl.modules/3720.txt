I've written a Crypt::CipherSaber module that I would like to contribute as 
soon as possible, and am developing other modules.

The module description is as follows:

Crypt::CipherSaber
bdpo
OO module for CS-1 and CS-2 encryption.

I have posted the code for discussion at PerlMonks.org.  While it has 
generated little discussion, it has earned a high reputation.

Thanks for your time.
