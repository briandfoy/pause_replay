To me, a (corporate) dashboard is a display
of data, which also indicates clearly which 
metrics are "in the green" or "in the red", etc.
It may also include graphs or other stuff. 
This module does all that, hence the name.

I am unhappy with "Spreadsheet", since a
spreadsheet mostly performs calculations -
the data-dependent formatting is an add-on.

This being said, I am open to suggestions 
for a better name. I want to avoid things like
HTML::PowerTable etc, since this really has
no information content.

Best,

		Ph.
