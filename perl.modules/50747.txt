I'd be glad if it turned out that PAUSE can also be PAUSE6 and CPAN
can also be CPAN6, but then if we get a better world by restarting
from scratch, I'll be glad to hear this news.

I've told my mailagent to put modules@ and the two new lists into one
folder, so everything stays within the family, at least for now:)
