Well, except that it's really what it's meant to be doing, processing
XML files... RSS, SVG, XHTML, VoiceXML, you name it.

HTML has been added because it's convenient (unfortunately not everyone
uses XHTML), but all the module does is merely using TreeBuilder to fire
XML events by traversing the HTML parsed tree...

Take a look at examples in the documentation to check it out by
yourself. You can also check the mailing list archive:

http://lists.webarch.co.uk/pipermail/petal/

If everyone agrees that this module is primarily a templating system
rather than an XML tool, fine. I'll be glad to remove the HTML
functionality and make it process stricly XML files if that makes more
sense.
