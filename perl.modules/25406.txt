The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Convert::VH
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Convert and Manipulate Telco V and H coords
  userid:      PTIMMINS (Paul Timmins)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    #mi2600 on IIP (http://www.invisiblenet.net/iip/)

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is alot of code that duplicates the effort I am offering.
    There are APIs people have written to do this in Java, and I think
    there should be perl modules for them too (especially since either
    way I need this module for a project I'm working on - I just want to
    make it publically available on the encouragement of a few friends).

    I intend to start out with my V+H to Lat/Long converter, and to add
    distance calculations between V+H coordinates, as well as Lat/Long
    to V+H coordinate converters in future versions.

The resulting entry would be:

Convert::
::VH              bdpOp Convert and Manipulate Telco V and H coords  PTIMMINS
