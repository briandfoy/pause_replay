The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::EnigmaMachine
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Perl implementation of the Enigma Machine.
  userid:      ALIZTA (Alistair Mills)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Crypt::Enigma

  rationale:

    The Enigma library which I have written follows the specs of the
    original Enigma Machine to the letter, including the full set of 9
    rotors, 4 reflectors and a plugboard.

    I have had discussions with the developer who is using the
    Crypt::Enigma namespace and it appears that he is illustrating the
    features of the Enigma Machine but is not designing a full
    implementaion of the WWII ciphering device.

    Hence, I would like to use the Crypt::EnigmaMachine namespace to
    provide an exact software replica of the Enigma Machine

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::EnigmaMachine   adpOg Perl implementation of the Enigma Machine.   ALIZTA
