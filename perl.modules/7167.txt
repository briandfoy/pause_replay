The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Number::BR::Cadastro
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Validates brazilian CNPJ and CPF numbers
  userid:      DIEGO (Diego de Lima)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    diego_de_lima@hotmail.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    I chosed this namespace (Number::BR::Cadastro) aware of the
    following reasons:

    1) There is already o mudule named Number::Phone::US, which
    validates US phone numbers. So the root 'Number' should be aplicable
    for my module, because it validates numbers as well.

    2) The 'BR' applys to the country which it is aplicable. Any other
    module made specialy for brazilian numbers could be placed in the
    same root.

    3) The 'Cadastro' sufix means, in portuguese 'registration' and is
    what it validates: brazilian CPF (Cadastro Pessoa Física) and CNPJ
    (Cadastro Nacional de Pessoa Jurídica). These numbers are kinds of
    government tax IDs.

    My module is unique in its usefullness. CPF and CNPJ numbers are
    largelly used in all brazilian comercial transactions, and PERL
    doesn't have a public known interface to it. There is no good
    e-commerce site in Brazil which doesn't checks CNPJ and CPF numbers
    of its buyers. For e-business and b2b sites, its even more
    important.

The resulting entry would be:

Number::BR::
::Cadastro        Rdpfg Validates brazilian CNPJ and CPF numbers     DIEGO
