ATTENTION!!!
BUSINNESS PROPOSAL
I am Prince Ovie O. Odafe an accountant with NIPPC , a senior member of its
contract award committee board and a key member of the Federal Contract
Award Committee to the NIPPC. I do have an urgent need for a trust worthy
foreign contact person with whom I can carry out a successful business deal.
Four of our Refineries and one Liquefied Natural Gas Plant have been bad
all these years, and now the Present Elected Democratic Government has
voted the sum of US$1.86 Billion for the repairs. The Government has also
considered some new projects to upgrade our Oil Industries. We have already
started awarding new contracts to that effect. As an incentive to do a good
job and finished promptly, the Government makes 75% upfront payment to
successful bidders.
Looking at what has been happening in Nigeria and other African Countries,
every wise businessman and Government Official is trying to push out any
money he can lay his hands on so that incase anything happens, they will
have something they can fall back on and be rest assured overseas on
retirement. Based on this, we wish to transfer US$85.050 for disbursement
that we have just secured access to push out. But because we are citizen,
we cannot move this money out ourselves. Though we have made an attempt
before which was an unsuccessful cash movement of US$800 million that was
disrupt at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport On August 12, 1995 by
the Nigerian Customs and Air- port Security Officials, hence we decide now
to do this deal via TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. At this point in time we
therefore need an honest, trustworthy and reliable assistance of a
foreigner who will be a kind and honest person to us and will not
disappoint us at the end of this transaction .
I want you to summit immediately your complete Company name and address if
you have one, your name as President or Managing Director / C.E.O of the
company, your Banking Particulars:- (Bank’s Name & Address, Telephone, Fax
and Telex numbers. Your Receiving Account Numbers, Swift and Routing
Numbers). With this information, I can get you properly registered as one
of the contractors to NIPPC who has already been awarded this contract for
the sum of US$113.4 million to supply, install and service some of the
REFINERIES PLANTS PARTS which documents I already have in my custody. 
After receiving the above needed and stated information from you, I will
process all the documentation, and summit them for immediate approvals, and
the Federal Government will pay 75% of the total sum for US$113.4M into
your given account. In no time, the remaining of the US$28.35 Million shall
be paid as balance payment or we together in agreement as partners will use
another foreign firm’s name that will carry out the plants servicing
documentation as a sub-contractor to your company in our follow up
documentation to receive the balance payment.
We shall come to your Country immediately this fund is in your account to
share the US$85.05 million. The sharing pattern is as follows:- We will
give to you 20% of the total sum, 5% will be set aside for all expenses
incurred during the transacting period and 75% for me and my colleague.
However, be rest assured that no risk is involved or any scandal in the
future, for we have done all our homework very well, nobody will be hunt
during and after this transaction. 
It may also please you to know that all the GOODS that covers the 75%
payment of this contract had earlier been supplied by other contractors
whose contract were cancelled half way during the past Military Regime Of
Gen. Sanni Abacha. No record of this exists anywhere only the two of us
that are key members of the contract board committee has this knowledge and
information so there is the serious need to keep this transaction secret
and very confidential. To that effect, I would require your private phone
and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication. I await your
immediate respond to this PROPOSAL through my email address immediately:-
prince_odafe@rediffmail.com .
Meanwhile, I look forward to establishing a life long business relationship
with you.

Best regards.

PRINCE OVIE O. ODAFE
