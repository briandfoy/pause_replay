The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GSM::Gnokii
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: API to libgnokii
  userid:      HMBRAND (H.Merijn Brand)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    All existing interfaces to libgnokii were either faulty (core dump)
    or incomplete (only support SMS)

    This module creates an XS interface that maps all functionality in
    libgnokii to perl methods staying as close as possible to what
    gnokii and libgnokii expect with a rather intuitive and consistent
    interface.

    I'll be maintaining this module as long as I have an (older) Nokia
    phone. I think that all phones that can connect through libgnokii
    can use this module. Initialisation and configuration is shared with
    gnokii configuration, no extra need for this module.

    Examples include Tk GUI for some of the module's functionality

The resulting entry would be:

GSM::
::Gnokii          bdhOp API to libgnokii                             HMBRAND
