REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
I am  Dr. Tunde Cole the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal 
government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review 
existing ones. 

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential 
transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. 
There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry 
in favor of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original  value of these 
contracts were deliberately over  invoiced to the sum of USD$25,000,000.00 
(twenty five million united state Dollars). 

This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that 
actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for 
subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau 
(civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, 
the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% 
of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) 
between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance 
to other accounts in due course. 

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central 
bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your 
satisfaction of the above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord 
this transaction the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval 
procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company 
you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that 
having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having 
my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy 
and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a fax 
on my confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) so that I can brief you further. I want to assure 
you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite 
believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still 
in government service, which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind 
schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the second 
quarter payments for the 2003 financial year. 

Thanks and God bless. 

Dr. Tunde Cole.
