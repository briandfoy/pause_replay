Hi,

While looking for the Net::Telnet module I found that the link to the
author is wrong. The page at
http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#Part2-ThePerl5M gives
the author of the module as
http://www.cpan.org/authors/00whois.html#MAHEX. I believe this should be
http://www.cpan.org/authors/00whois.html#JROGERS.

Reagrds,
Alasdair MacGregor
