Sold! So let's create interface style "p" for pragma. Any objections?

You give me the right cue, problem solved: authors can withdraw their
modules from the module list when the life cycle is over. We had
DoWhatIWant on the module list from the very early days for maybe 3
years, then I felt like the fun was over. Maybe others will follow
that fate.

Chapters are much more rigid, they propagate to too many places. This
makes any change more difficult.
