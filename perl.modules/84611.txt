The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       P
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: simplify formatting+printing
  userid:      LAWALSH (Linda A Walsh)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)

  similar:

  rationale:

    It was intended to take the place of printf, sprintf and say in
    most of my code. It just works, 99% of the time, unlike sprintf,
    handles arrays, IT DOES require a comma after a file handle as the
    first argument, so that's 'different'. I had to use the Pa/Pae forms
    to correctly handle arrays, but it is rare I passed an array, so
    that wasn't an issue, but the form P qw( %s-%s test this); correctly
    prints "test-this\n";

    It's runnable as a program that tests and demos it's various
    formats that it handles. include array refs '["a","b","c"]', (it's
    NOT intended to be Dump), but it does handle simple tasks .. hash
    refs '{"a"=>"b","b"=>"c"}'. Appends NL on output, but not to a
    string. Even handles a questionably useful print directly from a
    file handle.

    Run it and see! or do a perldoc on it... both work.

    I have RSI to the point of disability, so saving typing in
    programming useful... commonly used things, I want to be short.
    having to remember or deal with newlines... a pain. if my a 'die'
    arg evolves to a format die P "File not found %s", $_; Doesn't have
    a cow on "undef" -- (that was 1st item on list). perl -e 'use P; P
    "a=%s", $a;' a=undef

    I realize is a top and short name, but it was available and
    multiple people asked what it was and why it wasn't included in CPAN
    as I use it often in my test an demo programs...

    Only design flaw I know of is preventing it from printing a newline
    -- which I added in (*embarrassment*), a check for the 'NO-BREAK'
    character (in utf8 or latin1) at the end of a string-- if found,
    then doesn't issue a new line.

    Else, if something is receiving the value of 'P' like my $a=P
    "string " . P "same line"; P "a=%s", $a; string same line(\n) can go
    to STDERR w/either P STDERR,"a=%s,$a; or I prefer Pe "a=%s,$a";

    people did ask I submit this to CPAN... (submit any work to CPAN
    for that matter...).. so tried to make it something useful.

The resulting entry would be:
