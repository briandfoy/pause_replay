Ah, that's a different aspect, thanks. This leaves me with a foolish
face because I now wouldn't suggest Win32::IniFile anymore but still
dislike IniFile as a name because of the two slots in the root
namespace for the same thing.

New question: would it make sense to take over IniConf for you? If so,
have you talked with the author of IniConf if he would let you take
over? If not, could we find a name that expresses the relation of
IniConf and your module somehow, e.g. IniConf::Wizard or
IniConf::Simple or IniConf::Parser or IniConf::Handler or something
like that?
