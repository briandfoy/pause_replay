Well, at the risk of making "yet another suggestion" for how to get 
feedback, let me ask:  Have you posted your code on github or a similar 
site?  Or could you make available the SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION part of

It may turn out that Text::TemplateLite is the best available name.  But 
it would be nice to see a bit more before making a final recommendation.

(And names can always be changed.)
