Well, its as much an app as a module.  What does Perl do?  How about Erwin
(a commercial data modelling tool).

Not that this is nearly as good as either of those yet.  But I'm sure you
get the point.  The namespace matches the name of the app.  Also, CPAN is
not really intended as the primary distro mechanism, unlike my modules.  
In this case, I will still probably point people towards the Sourceforge
site since it has docs online and such.

I don't know how this type of thing is normally handled.  As I said, I
don't know that it would even be appropriate to list it on the to page.
