The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       P2P::Transmission
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to Transmission BitTorrent client
  userid:      BGILMORE (Brandon Gilmore)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    n/a but uses Convert::Bencode

  rationale:

    [a short thread regarding this namespace was started on
    modules@perl.org]

    In summary, this module offers an IPC based Perl interface to the
    open source BitTorrent client Transmission. However, it doesn't
    implement a generic IPC or Network transport, so I'm hesitant to
    place the module under the IPC:: or Net:: namespaces. Likewise, I
    can't justify creating the root namespace Transmission:: since it
    has a slightly ambiguous name. I stumbled upon P2P::pDonkey via
    search.cpan.org, and I figured P2P:: would be a good fit.

    At present, the protocol used by the module is well defined and
    well documented. No API exists (in any language) with those same
    traits, so this will be the first.

The resulting entry would be:

P2P::
::Transmission    adpOp Interface to Transmission BitTorrent client  BGILMORE
