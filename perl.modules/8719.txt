The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::DBIAgent
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: POE Component for non-blocking DBI
  userid:      RDB (Rob Bloodgood)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    POE mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    After working with another POE developer on the POE mailing list, I
    took his starter ideas, refined them, and packaged them into a
    bundle that functions independantly of any implied program design. I
    had originally called it just QueryAgent, then POE::QueryAgent.
    After discussing it on the list, we decided
    POE::Component::DBIAgent, as Po:Co is the preferred namespace for
    POE add-ons, and DBI in the name will allow this module to appear
    when searching on CPAN for i/dbi/;

    The component itself uses POE's Wheel::Run facility to fork off
    helper processes, each of which can run DBI queries and then pass
    the query results back to the main process via two-way pipe (or
    however Wheel::Run manages it). What's nice is, since POE's event
    loop is select-based, the DBI calls don't hang the program up
    waiting for a query to return.

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::
::DBIAgent        bmpOp POE Component for non-blocking DBI           RDB
