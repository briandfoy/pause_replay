Its come up that there are other related technologies which would probably
best be served if the common root was Xerox::. The potential module names
would be Xerox::DJDE:: but wouldn't fit correctly under Metacode. Oops! So
that was a poor choice on my part to not use Xerox:: from the start.
Unless I hear objection I'll be switching to Xerox::Metacode::Reader (and
later Xerox::DJDE::Reader).
