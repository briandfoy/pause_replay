The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Workflow
  DSLIP:       adcfl
  description: Interface to the wftk workflow toolkit
  userid:      MICHAEL (Michael Roberts)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html and wftk.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm completely open to the namespace choice, but I don't see
    anything workflow-related. I'd (naturally) like to be able to say
    "use Workflow" -- but that's up to you. I suppose chapter 23 is also
    appropriate, but again, feel free to change it if it makes more
    sense elsewhere.

    The wftk toolkit (http://www.vivtek.com/wftk.html) is an
    open-source, library-based workflow toolkit which has an existence
    independent of Perl. I'd like to start integrating with scripting
    languages, so ... there you have it.

    Thanks
