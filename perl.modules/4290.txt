Hi.

I've been working on a new module, tentatively called Mail::ListDetector
which takes Mail::Internet objects and attempts to work out what, if
any mailing list they represent a post to - if they do represent a 
post to a list, it returns an object containing some guessed data about
that list.

It can be downloaded at:

http://www.etla.org/Mail-ListDetector-0.07.tar.gz

The module is currently alpha with a dsli rating of adpo.

I've talked to people on #perl on irc.rhizomatic.net, where there was
tentative interest.

Is this a reasonable name and the right sort of thing for CPAN?
