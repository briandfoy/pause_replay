The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAP::WSDL::Generator
  DSLIP:       adpfb
  description: Generate a WSDL file for a perl SOAP service
  userid:      VITROTH (David Nolan)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    I'll post about it to the SOAP::Lite mailing lists, once available.

  similar:
    WSDL::Generator

  rationale:

    As far as I can tell, the only existing module which is designed to
    generate a WSDL to describe a perl (SOAP::Lite) based SOAP API is
    WSDL::Generator. Unfortunately it relies on features which are not
    available in perl 5.8, and requires a lot of extra work by the
    developer to use.

    This module, which I already have working in our environment, can
    be run with minimal extra effort on the part of the developer. You
    just need to add one additional method to your existing OO module,
    'wsdl', which when called needs to return a simple structure
    describing your SOAP API, its location, methods, and any custom type
    definitions.

The resulting entry would be:

SOAP::WSDL::
::Generator       adpfb Generate a WSDL file for a perl SOAP service VITROTH
