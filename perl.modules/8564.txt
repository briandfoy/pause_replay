Um, I sent an RFC there too.

Um, I talked with Graham about it too. He said: "The module seems fine,
but I don't think it belongs under Date::Format. Maybe just Date::MySQL"

This is just supposed to be a tool to do one thing cleanly and
easily. I'm well aware of the Date::Parse and Date::Format modules, and
made mention in my post that I am aware there are multiple ways to do
this. 

In my experience it has proven much more convenient to encapsulate these
routines in their own little package that can be used throughout multiple
applications, etc. I believe that others may find the same thing to
be true. Not all others, and evidently not you. Just some others.

Um, did you bother to RTFM before slamming this proposal? The module
allows you to specify several format options (e.g. like this: $md =
Date::MySQL->new(format=>'euro') ...), and if you prefer to have
the year at the beginning you can always not use the code at all.

Yes, well, unfortunately as a programmer I find that, suprisingly, 
non-programmers often use my applications. Therefore I make the interface
convenient for them.
