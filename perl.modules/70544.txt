I'd love to see any changes you've got. (Especially if they fix any of  
the bugs that are causing me grief.) We've also got a forked version  
that is partially working here and my latest project is to fix the  
locking code. If we pool our changes, we might both get done faster.

I've forked the current project on GitHub (from the GitPAN version)  
under the user id cpanelWade, if you'd like to see what's there. (I  
haven't committed anything but a couple of unit tests so far.) If we  
can coordinate our changes, that would avoid gratuitous wheel re- 
invention.

I don't have enough changes to need commit access yet, but I will  
before long.
