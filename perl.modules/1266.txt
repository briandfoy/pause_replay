I have been working on a new module to replace my Convert::BER
module. In doing so I have created a module with a very different
API, so I would like it to have a different name. The new module
will also support encoding methods other than BER (eg DER and PER)
so I would like to call it Convert::ASN1

Convert::
::ASN1    adpO  Standard en/decode of ASN.1 structures      GBARR

Also the plan is that there will eventually be both perl and XS implementations
of this, in that case what would the `p' be ?

Graham.
