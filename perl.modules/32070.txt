MAHWAH, N.J., May 18, 2004 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX) --
Communications Research, Inc. (CRHI) announced that it will
begin marketing TeleWRITER 3.0, the upgraded version of the
TeleWRITER product line, at InfoComm June 9-11, 2004 in
Atlanta, Georgia. TeleWRITER is a premier product in the
collaborative computing market, which is pegged at in excess
of 3 billion this year.

"We have been receiving numerous requests for the upgrade
and are on the verge of being able to supply the pent-up
demand for our product," remarked Communications Research
CEO Carl Ceragno. "InfoComm affords us the opportunity of a
huge industry event at which to make a big splash and to let
the industry know we're back with a vengeance. TeleWRITER's
feature rich software, low price point and ease of
interoperability should make it a huge hit in the burgeoning
distant learning and tele-commuting markets. We anticipate
quickly re-capturing former clients and rapidly developing
new sales to catapult the company."
