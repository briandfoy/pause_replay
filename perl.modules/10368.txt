I have a modularized tool that reads FidoNET Hudson (QuickBBS), BlueWave
(QWK), and JAM messagebases (remember those?) and extracts mail from
them into the more widely readable RFC822 format. It was is designed 
for offline work (i.e., scan existing files, not translate messages
on-the-fly), but if there's demand support for it might be added. The 
tool currently uses a namespace that doesn't make sense for public
consumption, and before I put it on CPAN I'd like to find it a better
one. Any recommendations?

I could not find a "natural" place to fit it in, but how about Mail::FTN?

Thanks for your time,
Gaal
