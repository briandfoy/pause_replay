Subject: Module submission DBIx::Lite
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Lite
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Chained and minimal ORM
  userid:      AAR (Alessandro Ranellucci)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    IRC and GitHub repository (pull requests)

  similar:
    DBIx::Class

  rationale:

    The well-known DBIx::Class provides a powerful way to abstract
    database queries, but it requires full table definitions and a bunch
    of .pm files in order to define a schema. My DBIx::Lite provides a
    similar abstract, OO, chained interface but it follows a different
    approach: most of its functionality does not require any schema
    definition at all, nor a particular module layout. It uses AUTOLOAD
    to build accessors. It supports SQL::Abstract syntax, table
    relationships, paging and custom packages. It's supposed to be a
    simpler replacement for DBIx::Class. Also, it allows to handle
    particular situations where DBIx::Class can't be used, such as
    databases whose schema cannot be hard-coded and must be loaded or
    changed at runtime.

    I was expecting criticism for publishing yet another ORM, but I got
    none and I got very positive feedback from users, along with code
    contributions (see GitHub). People are also building other modules
    on top of DBIx::Lite.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Lite            RdpOp Chained and minimal ORM                      AAR
