The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Event::RPC
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Transparent Client/Server OO RPC framework
  userid:      JRED (Jörn Reder)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    perl-loop@perl.org

  similar:
    RPC::pClient RPC::pServer RPC::XML RPC::Simple

  rationale:

    Hi,

    I've chosen this namespace because it simply describes what the
    module does best: event driven RPC. I didn't find any modules on
    CPAN which does this in a similar fashion: Event::RPC implements it
    completely transparent to the client.

    Also other modules doesn't follow the event driven paradigm, but
    fork() or threads, or need a complex environment, like XML::RPC, or
    are targeted to a specific framework like RPC::Simple, which depends
    on Tk.

    Event::RPC is very small and has only few dependencies and can be
    used with arbitrary mainloop implementations.

    The namespace was recently discussed in the perl-loop mailing list
    without objections. Event::RPC currently can use Event or Glib for
    the mainloop stuff (and POE or others, once the corresponding glue
    is implemented), but at any rate it's event driven, so the Event::
    namespace is appropriate here.

    Regards,

    Joern
