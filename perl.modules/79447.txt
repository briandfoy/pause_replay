The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Plack::Middleware::JSON::ForBrowsers
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Turn application/json responses into HTML
  userid:      MSTOCK (Manfred Stock)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    PrePan: http://prepan.org/module/3Yz7PYrBQk

  similar:
    Catalyst::Action::REST::ForBrowsers Plack::Middleware::HTMLify

  rationale:

    Plack middlewares usually live below Plack::Middleware::*, which
    also facilitates their use with Plack::Builder. In a way, the module
    is similar to Plack::Middleware::HTMLify, but it parses and
    pretty-prints JSON and is only intended as a development aid. The
    module and its name was inspired by
    Catalyst::Action::REST::ForBrowsers, which also tries to detect if a
    request came from a web browser - it has a different goal though and
    is Catalyst-specific, while my module simply converts JSON to HTML
    if it thinks the request originated from a web browser.

The resulting entry would be:

Plack::Middleware::JSON::
::ForBrowsers     bdpOp Turn application/json responses into HTML    MSTOCK
