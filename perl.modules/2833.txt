I have a new module that I am preparing to include in CPAN called 
Monkeywrench. I expect to be able include Monkeywrench in the HTTP 
namespace, but here is a description of it for your review:

Overview:

Monkeywrench is a test-harness application to test the integrity of a 
user's path through a web site.

Monkeywrench works by letting you create 'test scenarios' which can 
be run against the site over and over. Test scenarios closely mimic a 
user going through your site performing specific actions like filling 
out a registration form, or ordering a product. It can then make sure 
the next page had the desired results.

Monkeywrench supports such features as:
* Basic Authentication
* Cookies
* GET and PUT requests
* Redirects
* Email reports

Thanks,
-=Derek
