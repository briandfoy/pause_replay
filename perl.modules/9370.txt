Syndication::NITF, a Perl module supporting the NITF news article format 
was released to CPAN on 19 December 2001. It should be available from 
your local mirror via
http://cpan.perl.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

This is version 0.02, the first public release.

Here is an excerpt from the README:

 >>>>
Syndication::NITF -- a NITF v3.0 library for Perl

Syndication::NITF is an object-oriented Perl interface to NITF
documents, allowing you to manage (and one day create) NITF documents
without any specialised NITF or XML knowledge.

NITF is a standard format for the markup of textual news content (eg
newspaper and magazine articles), ratified by the International Press
Telecommunications Council (http://www.iptc.org).

This module supports the version 3.0 DTD of NITF. It makes no attempt to
support eariler versions of the DTD.

You can find out more about NITF at http://www.nitf.org/ or
http://www.iptc.org/

LATEST VERSION AND WHAT'S NEW
The latest version is 0.02, released 19 December 2001.

Download: http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/B/BQ/BQUINN/

What's New in 0.02:

  * Example Parser

    Simple example parser added that outputs information about an NITF
    file, handling most types of tag.

  See the Changes file for previous releases.
<<<<

At the moment it's fairly basic, and doesn't allow you to create NITF 
files. Other plans for the future include better support of IPTC subject 
codes, integration with my Syndication::NewsML module, and automatic 
handling of updates, corrections, embargoes etc.

Hope this helps someone out there.

Brendan.
