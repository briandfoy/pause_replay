Hi Reini, hi Malcolm, hi Andreas, hi modules@,

since, IIRC, nobody objected on p5p to Reini taking up the B::C suite of 
modules, and Malcolm has been away from all things Perl for a long time 
now, I gave Reini co-maintenance permissions for the following of 
Malcolm's namespaces. Malcolm, in the unlikely case you object, this is 
reversible.

Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Asmdata.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Assembler.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Bblock.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Bytecode.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::C.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::CC.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Debug.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Disassembler.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Disassembler::BytecodeStream.
Added RURBAN to co-maintainers of B::Stackobj.

However, on the list of required namespaces, there's two which I could 
not find in the PAUSE database at all. Maybe I wasn't looking straight 
or there might be a problem with the database. Andreas, could you check 
the following namespaces?

ByteLoader
B::Stash

Best regards,
Steffen
