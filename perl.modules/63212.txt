that would generally be preferable. It's really quite simple. Neil,
here's the step-by-step procedure:

1) Login on pause.perl.org using your PAUSE ID and password.
2) In the menu on the left, select "Change Permissions"
3) Under point "3) Making and un-making co-maintainers, select one of
the namespaces you want to add a maintainer for and click "[Select] 3.1
Make somebody else co-maintainer".
4) In the text field, put Rob's CPAN ID (SISYPHUS).
5) Select all namespaces you want to give Rob co-maintenance for and
click "Make Co-Maintainer".

Done.

Let us know if you have any trouble.

Best regards,
Steffen
