Hi

I have just uploaded a new version of this module to my Pause account.

Account - Twibbler.
Module  - PDFREP   Version 1.01.

(OK so I missed something obvious in the module).

Also I know that you are all extremly busy but me being the inquisitive type wanted to see the module meta data on my acocunt.

Could you let me know how long this normally takes please.

Thank you.
