Hi,

It looks like Carl Franks (PAUSE id CFRANKS, aka Fireartist) has become
uncontactable - I've had a couple of reports of people attempting to
contact him re HTML::FormFu related modules, and I have also tried
recently without response.

I was hoping to add Dean Hamstead (PAUSE id DJZORT) as a Co-Maint for
all the FormFu modules (basically everything I am co-maint for and
CFRANKS is owner.  This is obviously impossible without assistance from
Carl.  Dean and myself are maintaining the FormFu modules within the
github FormFu org (Carl previously transferred the github repos to this
org) - https://github.com/FormFu/
Having both of us able to release would make life less complicated.

I would like your advice as to the best way to proceed - I would prefer
that any ownership transition was managed with Carl's permission, but
since he currently appears to not be in circulation this is impossible. 
Maybe for now adding an additional co-maint and if, in the future, Carl
is still offline then we should transfer ownership?

Regards

     Nigel.

[Unhelpfully I am away through some of August, but should respond to
email within a day or two unless it gets buried in a spam box]
