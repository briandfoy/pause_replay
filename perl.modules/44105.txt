     why:

    Based on the Net::LDAP::Control::Paged, it was created a module for
    DirSync control, allowing to synchronize application data with MS
    Active Directory via an incremental search.

    perl-ldap team has objections to using Net::LDAP namespace, because
    this control is a proprietary, non-RFC based.

    I was suggested to use something under Win32::AD. Maybe
    Win32::AD::Control::DirSync and appropriate constants will be in
    Win32::AD::Constant? Is it OK?
