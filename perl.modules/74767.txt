Hi
My module is the same thing as Net::Telnet but can also handle SSH and 
Serial connections.
So it differs from Expect in the same way that Net::Telnet does.
Expect is all about spawning an "external" command/binary and 
controlling that.
Expect lacks portability as the target machine for your script needs to 
have that external command/binary installed. Expect also does not work 
on Microsoft Windows, or maybe it does with Cygwin but again that 
hampers portability.
The scripts I write with perl (using my module, like Net::Telnet) I can 
bundle into a single exe file and they work on any target machine (and 
99% of the time I need them to run on Win32).

I emailed the module authors distribution list some 6 month ago for 
advice on module naming.
Originally I had named it Net::CLI, but I changed it to Control::CLI 
based on the only advice I got:
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2010/07/msg8681.html

If you have a better suggestion it is welcome.
Best regards
Ludovico Stevens
