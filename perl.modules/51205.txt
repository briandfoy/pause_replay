I disagree. The more things that are CPAN-installable the better, if you 
can make it fit into the CPAN model, then other things like automatic 
conversion to debian .debs become easier, and you might want to add 
plugins or whatever later on, and that gets easier too.

And yes, you have an uppercase, which is fine.

So I'd take a branded namespace wApua:: if I were you, but if any of the 
sub-modules can be used standalone and potential reused in other 
programs, then break out those into not only seperate module names, but 
seperate distributions.
