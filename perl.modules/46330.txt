As a (2nd year drop out) Mech Eng myself, there's no way in hell you are 
going into Acme :)

I'd say Eng:: is probably the best location for engineering, especially 
given Geo::

ArchNav is iffy, simply Naval will suffice. Getting cute with names is bad.

So I propose Eng::Naval::ITTC

Unless someone has any negative opinions on introducing Eng:: for 
engineering modules I'll approve the module if you reapply as 
Eng::Navel::ITTC (I think adding Power is probably going too specific, 
since ITTC is a known scheme and identifies it cleanly).

And welcome to CPAN! :)
