The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Number
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: handling Perl's diverse numeric types
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are several different numeric data types available in Perl:
    in addition to the native scalar numeric part, CPAN offers
    Math::BigInt, Math::BigRat, Math::GMP, Math::Pari, and others. I'd
    like to write library modules that will accept any of these types as
    arguments and perform the same numerical operations in whichever
    type the caller has chosen. This is difficult, because the interface
    to the same numerical operation varies between types. For example,
    "%" may truncate its arguments to integers or not, "/" may truncate
    the result or not, and many operations require method calls when
    using non-native types. Data::Number is meant to provide a
    consistent interface for numerical operations, to make it easy to
    accept any (known) numeric data type.

    I also intend it to allow mixing of these various types in
    expressions. Most pairs of non-native types are incompatible by
    nature; Data::Number will perform conversions as required.

    I call it "Data::Number" because it's about handling the various
    data types, treating the numbers as data. There's a top-level
    "Number::" namespace, but that doesn't have much to do with ordinary
    arithmetic numbers.

The resulting entry would be:
