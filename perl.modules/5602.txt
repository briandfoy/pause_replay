Modules,

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a newly developing markup language
that is optimized for human readability, parse speed, and interaction
with scripting languages like Perl and Python. It is being developed by
Clark C Evans and myself. See http://www.yaml.org

YAML is surprisingly close to my Data::Denter format. That's how I got
involved. Clark will do the Python implementation and I will do the Perl
one. We may share a common C library. Data::Denter will have a YAML
compliant mode.

YAML.pm will have a complete interface for serializing and parsing YAML
documents. It may later also package tools for converting between YAML
and other markup languages.

I would like to secure the YAML namespace for further development.
