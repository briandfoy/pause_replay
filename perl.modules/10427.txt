The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Reliable
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Reliable subprocess management, many options
  userid:      DGOLD (Dan Goldwater)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Proc::Short

  rationale:

    The core functionality of Proc::Reliable is to execute subprocesses
    with a timeout and configurable termination conditions, while
    collecting all output produced by the subprocess. When writing
    high-reliability software, it is essential to have this
    functionality when running subprocesses in order to manage 'problem'
    subprocesses which are likely to fail, hang or behave badly. <p>
    Proc::Reliable implements a convenient and easy-to-use interface
    which includes all the functionality of the backticks operator and
    system() functions, plus many common uses of fork() and exec(),
    open2() and open3(). Proc::Reliable incorporates a number of
    options, including sending data to the subprocess on STDIN,
    collecting STDOUT and STDERR separately or together, killing hung
    processes, timouts and automatic retries. <p> Proc::Reliable module
    is an enhancement and rewrite of the well-intentioned but not well
    implemented Proc::Short. <p> Thanks! <p>
