Its forked.  Same feature set, different internals, yet passes
all of the core base.pm's tests.  5.8.0's is more recent than 
Class::Fields' base.pm since I haven't worked on it in a while.  I think 
the last time I worked on it was between 5.6.0 and 5.6.1.

The bug fixes usually flow the other way.  Class::Fields' base.pm is
fixed from bleadperl.  Its there so people can upgrade base.pm without
reinstalling Perl.

There was discussion a while ago of merging Class::Fields into the core,
but it was rejected as its base.pm takes a bit longer/more memory.
Its sort of irrelevent now as "use fields" isn't used much anymore.
