The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Reaction
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: perl MVC application development platform
  userid:      MSTROUT (Matt S Trout)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    none as yet

  similar:
    Catalyst Jifty

  rationale:

    Reaction is intended to be a layer atop Catalyst that provides a
    single way to do things; it will rely heavily on conventions and
    interfaces to provide a more integrated development experience for
    fast development within the boundaries of the design. It will also
    extend into providing command-line, GUI (X and probably Win32) and
    IRC bot interfaces to the application metamodel using a set of
    complementary libraries that use and understand the same conventions
    as the core Web UI modules.

    The reason for requesting a separate namespace is that it is
    expected a substantial number of modules and distributions will be
    released within this namespace over time, and to clearly separate
    the one-true-way approach of the Reaction libraries from the more
    general components of the Catalyst:: namespace.

    Jifty is mentioned as similar since it also provides a
    one-way-that-works approach; however the underlying web framework
    and libraries are embedded directly into the Jifty package whereas
    Reaction will re-use (and the developers thereof will contribute
    general code to) the contents of the Catalyst:: namespace in order
    to maximise the usefulness of the code produced to the wider
    community.
