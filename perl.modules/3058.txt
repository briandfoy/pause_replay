I finally got around to uploading my Alzabo program/modules to CPAN
(alzabo.sourceforge.net).  It occupies the Alzabo & Alzabo::* &
Alzabo::*::* namespaces.  I figure I have a good claim to it (and nobody
else wants it).

I don't know if this is the kind of thing that would get listed on the
modules page anyway since its as much an app as modules.
