The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Pyzor
  DSLIP:       iupOg
  description: Interface to Pyzor collaborative spam block
  userid:      THEDEVIL (Ian Zimmerman)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.moderated

  similar:
    Mail::Razor

  rationale:

    The collaborative approach to spam blocking, where a server keeps
    track of messages that have been confirmed as spam by humans, is
    IMHO the most promising in the long run. It is analogous to the
    GroupLens system for Usenet. The best known implementation is Razor,
    written in Perl. However, Razor has the apparent disadvantage that
    the server code is not open, which diminishes people's trust in it
    and also makes the server a single point of failure. This led to the
    development of Pyzor (http://pyzor.sourceforge.net) which is written
    in Python; it would be nice to have a Perl library interface to it.

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::Pyzor           iupOg Interface to Pyzor collaborative spam block  THEDEVIL
