You're right. I hadn't checked the last release from the module's 
author. It's from 2001. Given that others failed to contact him a while 
ago, it's safe enough to give you co-maintenance permissions.

I just gave you co-maint permissions for all modules within the ParseLex 
distribution. Let me know if I missed any.

Best regards,
Steffen
