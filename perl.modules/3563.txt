Achim and Jonathan,

please give me your OK to that plan, I do not want to interfere with
your plans. Apache is done, I'd like to work on XML and Tk soonish.
Are these URLs for the two module lists up to date?

CPAN/authors/id/E/EI/EISEN/perl-xml-modules.html
http://mysite.directlink.net/gbarr/PerlTk/tk-modlist.html

Thanks & Regards,
