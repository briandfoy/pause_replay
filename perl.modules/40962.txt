     why:

    A command-line perl script that descends recursively through a
    directory tree (starting at the root) and replaces a Javadoc author
    tag its content with a substituted Javadoc author tag and its
    contents. For example, an application would be to change a Java
    package with lots or all Java classes listed as authored by one
    person so that these Java classes were listed as authored
    collaboratively by several people.
