Hrm.  The News:: namespace is mostly for NNTP stuff.  This might cause
some confusion.  

Is there any relation between NewsML and the existing XMLNews::*
modules?

Just looking at what's out there at the moment, I'd suggest putting
NewsML under the XML namespace.

XML::NewsML
XML::NITF

(similar to XML::RSS for instance).

Nope, everything currently under News::* is NNTP.  The only thing
currently under NNTP is NNTP::Server.
