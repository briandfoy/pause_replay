The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::MICR::LineParser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: validate and parse a MICR code from a string
  userid:      LEOCHARRE (Leo Charre)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    newsgroups, perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is pretty specific to finance. It is tailored to check
    strings if they contain a valid MICR code the likes found in bank
    checks.

    There's no specific uniqueness to this approach. There's simply
    nothing on cpan that works with MICR. I haven't found anything out
    there which is open source that does this kind of thing. And I
    *needed* it really bad. I want to share it because I know others
    will find use for it, may contribute to it and send bug glitch
    reports.

    I use gocr (open source ocr software) to read in checks, and with
    this module i deem if it was done right, i try to see if the paper
    scanned had a MICR.. and to extract some data from the MICR check
    number ... etc.

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::MICR::
::LineParser      bdpOp validate and parse a MICR code from a string LEOCHARRE
