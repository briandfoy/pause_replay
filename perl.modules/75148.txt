The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ox
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: An object system inspired by Perl 6
  userid:      KJM (Kyle McCurdy)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    none as of yet...

  similar:
    Moose

  rationale:

    This name isn't very generic, so I shouldn't really have to defend
    it. As for the functionality, yes, it's another object system kind
    of like the others, but isn't registering and uploading to CPAN the
    only way to protect my namespace from being stomped on by CPAN? If
    not, please let me know.

  enteredby:   KJM (Kyle McCurdy)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 13 02:10:11 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Ox                cdphp An object system inspired by Perl 6          KJM
