Greetings,
  I would like to register 3 modules.  Here's the information:

MPE::QeditAccess   cdhh   Access to Robelle's Qedit files under MPE/iX
MPE::Suprtool      id     Allows calling Robelle's Suprtool under MPE/iX
MPE::IMAGE         id     Access to the TurboImage intrinsics under MPE/iX

All three will run only under the MPE/iX operating system (HP e3000 platform).

Thanks,
Ted

The story was told that the young Dirichlet had as a constant companion all
his travels, like a devout man with his prayer book, an old, worn copy of
the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss.
