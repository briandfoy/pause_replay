The name Net::IaaS is totally opaque to me. For me as an uninitiated, I 
can attach no meaning to it at all.

I wouldn't be opposed to registering a top-level "branded" namespace 
like Annelidous for this. Alternatively, something in the Net:: 
top-level that conveys the idea a little better would make sense to me.

If you insist on Net::IaaS, I'll register that, too, but I suggest 
either trying to come up with something that describes the purpose 
better or using a branded namespace.

Cheers,
Steffen
