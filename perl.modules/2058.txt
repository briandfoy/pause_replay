PPM            Rdpf  Perl Package Manager

For the past 2 years or so, PPM has been available to users of
ActiveState's binary distributions (MS Windows, Linux, Solaris) of Perl
to install pre-compiled Perl extensions and modules.

PPM primarily benefits Perl users who don't have access to the software
tools (e.g. make, cc, etc.) usually required to build and install Perl
extensions and modules, but it is also useful as a method of quickly and
(usually) painlessly installing pre-compiled Perl extensions and modules
from a trusted local or remote source.

Thanks,

Murray
