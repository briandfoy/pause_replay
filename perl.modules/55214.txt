The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Report
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Mixed Columnar Formatted Report Generation
  userid:      DAVIDIUS (David Huggins)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Text::Report is a module that will allow you to create neatly
    formatted, text based reports that contain any number of tables of
    various dimensions replete with configurable & optional titles,
    column headings, decorations, sorting, column alignment and more.

    Output can be a formatted report suitable for formal presentation
    and/or you can produce comma delimited data either by individual
    tables or the entire report.

    I've tried to keep the interface simple and flexible. There are
    three components to configure.

    The 'report' component includes the width of the report itself, the
    way that the 'blocks' of data are ordered within the report (either
    automatically or by explicit indexing) and the way that table titles
    are printed for each 'block' or data set.

    The 'block' component is manipulated by its name and can contain
    either free-form string data, a decorative separator, or columnar
    data as a table or footer. Columns in each block created can be
    automatically sized or the size (width) and alignment can be defined
    by the user either globally or per column.

    The 'column' component is manipulated by the block name that
    contains it and the column position in the table. Columns can be
    addressed individually to tweak the alignment, width and the column
    header.

    The output is currently available in formatted text or comma
    delimited text. Plans are being made to add html and xml output as
    well.

    I've also incorporated a feature that allows you to save the
    defined report as a template (using Storable store() & retrieve())
    for reuse.

    More detailed information and the most current build can be found
    at http://www.full-duplex.com/svcs04.html under "Perl Libraries",
    "Text::Report".

    To access the pod and the build for the version being submitted
    now, they can be found at:
