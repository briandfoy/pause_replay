My first CPAN/PAUSE submission, so if anything appears wrong, *PLEASE*
let me know what you find.  Includes detailed pod, some tests, readme.

Data::Binder (v1.00)
     bdpOp
     map of keys to potential values for simple unification
     HALLEY

A Binder is a special map of keys to potential values; it supports
non-conflicting unification against other Binders or terms.  Each key
term in the Binder may be unbound (associated with an undef value), or
bound to a defined scalar value.  Unbound keys may be bound to anything,
and bound keys may only be bound to identical values.  Attempts to bind
a new set of values succeeds completely or fails without changes.

This module is of general usefulness, but will be a dependency for
upcoming HALLEY modules to be submitted later.
