     why:

    I'm working on WWW::AlbumArtDotOrg::CoverFetcher which will allow
    you to download album covers and set the APIC flag in an MP3's ID3v2
    tag. This will be useful for those people who have an mp3 collection
    where they would like to automatically add the album art, or for
    people working on music players in perl that can then have an option
    to automatically get the CD cover artwork.

    I have it mostly working (it can fetch the url off the site, it can
    set the APIC) but I just need to piece the loose ends together and
    once I'm done - have mst have a look over the code (he has been
    mentoring me).

    Thanks,

    - Mick
