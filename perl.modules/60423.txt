Subject: Module submission SRCE::Client
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SRCE::Client
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Perl package for the SRCE client interface
  userid:      CORMANDER (Corey Henderson)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://srce.echoreply.us/

  similar:

  rationale:

    As far as I know the only client for SRCE is written in C and it is
    a utility, not a library.

    I wrote a module in perl that uses the SRCE protocol to communicate
    with the server, authenticate, and run commands.

    The SRCE website is at: http://srce.echoreply.us/

    There are currently no namespaces in SRCE, and "srce" or "SRCE"
    return zero results on search.cpan.org so I would think it would be
    ok for the name SRCE::Client

  enteredby:   CORMANDER (Corey Henderson)
  enteredon:   Fri May  9 19:48:47 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SRCE::
::Client          bdpOg Perl package for the SRCE client interface   CORMANDER
