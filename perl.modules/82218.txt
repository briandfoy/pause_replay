     why:

    Dears, during the last years i've developed some Perl stuff for
    productive environments which i did not found on CPAN, but even
    still targets more or less "generally" problems/apps.

    Will spend some time to clean up and doc it for others as "usual"
    to make it pushable to the public.

    Perl rocks!

    thank you and cheers,

    Niels.
