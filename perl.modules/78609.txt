Hello,

I've got a problem while using URI or Rose::URI.

When I process URL addresses automatically (e.g. through webspider), they
often can't deal with damaged fragments of a URL and I cannot find a way to
validate their correctness. Even if I add the implementation of validation
to URL and/or Rose::URI the problem still won't be solved, as they parse
the addresses differently =E2=80=93 they are URI-oriented and should be bes=
t redone
from scratch, which is pointless. These modules are great for URI
addresses.

I've got a module with a number of tests ready and it works well for URL
addresses. That's why I suggest setting up a new namespace, e.g.
URLprocessor or URL.

Also, my aim is not to compete with other developers - I recommend them in
the documentation of my module anyway.


--=20
Best regards
Pawel Koscielny
