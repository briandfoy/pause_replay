Your examples nearly conviced me, but...

What if your module depends on version 2.102 of Data::Dumper? How many
users will come and ask us where to find 2.102?

Also consider the effect of a module that's in the core and not
maintained on CPAN anymore. After a while, somebody will complain that
CPAN is horribly outdated. Then either the author will delete the
outdated version (complicating the indexer's logic) or we will need to
adjust the indexer for that single module some other way.

I don't think your proposal will work very well. And I think we should
take every opportunity to encourage users to upgrade, otherwise they
are hosed anyway.
