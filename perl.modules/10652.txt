The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::RFC822::Address
  DSLIP:       Rdpfd
  description: Regexp based RFC822 address validation
  userid:      PDWARREN (Paul Warren)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    London Perl Mongers list, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    RFC::RFC822::Address, Mail::CheckUser

  rationale:

    This module provides RFC822 address validation. Email address
    validation is a very common problem, as witnessed by the fact that
    there are several other approaches to address validation already on
    CPAN.

    Functionally, this module is equivalent to RFC::RFC822::Address,
    but avoids the significant startup performance hit of using
    Parse::RecDescent by using regular expressions (see
    http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/2001-September/005034.html)

    Mail::CheckUser implements much weaker syntax checking, but
    provides other functionality.

    I am very much open to advice on namespace choice, but, I believe
    that this module should live under Mail:: rather than RFC:: as its
    purpose. The RFC822::Address reflects the fact that the purpose of
    this module is to check email syntax against RFC822, no more, no
    less.

    It is my opinion that this is the one useful type of address
    validation that can be done. Figuring out if an address is
    deliverable is the job of MTAs.

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::RFC822::
