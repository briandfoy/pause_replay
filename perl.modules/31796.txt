The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Authen::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: WWW Session, authen, authorization library
  userid:      UNRTST (Joshua I. Miller)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    module-authors

  similar:
    Averist.pm CGI::Session::Auth

  rationale:

    WWW::Authen::Simple provides authentication via database, session
    handling (cookie based), and group based authorization with optional
    read/write bits on each group. It's also compatable with normal CGI
    scripts, mod_perl (1 and 2), and likely compatable with any
    webserver.

    It's goal is to provide a very simple API to handle sessions and
    authentication.

    I wrote it because I needed something simple to handle sessions,
    authentication, and authorization. Apache::Session just does
    sessions, and is tied to apache. CGI::Session is very flexable, but
    only does sessions. CGI::Session::Auth I probably could have worked
    off of, but there isn't much there at all, and I'd probably have to
    subclass it, and override just about every method. And there are
    others.

    I hadn't released it before because there are so many other modules
    in the same realm. However, it has matured, and I think it offeres a
    unique way of doing things that others might find useful.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Authen::
