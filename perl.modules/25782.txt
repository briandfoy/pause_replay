The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Options
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Parse/validate opts from ARGV, env, files
  userid:      SPADKINS (Stephen Adkins)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    p5ee@perl.org

  similar:
    AppConfig Getopt::Long

  rationale:

    App::Options was chosen as the module name because (naturally) it
    allows for options to be set for perl applications. It allows
    command line options, environment variables, and configuration files
    to be used to set these options. It is a prerequisite for other
    pre-alpha modules being developed in the App::* namespace for the
    P5EE project.

    It is different than most of the Getopt::* modules because it
    integrates the processing of command line options, environment
    variables, and config files.

    It is different from AppConfig (to which its description bears the
    most resemblance) by its ability to configure a suite of programs
    with a cascading set of configuration files. This allows for a large
    number of programs in a large software system to share a small set
    of configuration files. Some of the option values may be shared, and
    some may be targetted at a single program or a pattern-matched set
    of programs. Furthermore, its special treatment of the "perlinc"
    option facilitates the inclusion ("use") of application-specific
    perl modules from special places to enable the installation of
    multiple versions of an application on the same system (i.e.
    /usr/mysystem/version).

    App::Options is also the easiest command-line processing system
    that I have found anywhere. Then it provides a smooth transition to
    more advanced features only as they are needed.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Options         RdpOp Parse/validate opts from ARGV, env, files    SPADKINS
