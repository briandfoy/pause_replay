     why:

    This PAUSE ID It' s memonic for me, becouse it's the same of email!

    I'm doing a code for reading from an ascii graph and getting a
    stages and option. The module could be usefull when the number of
    stages increase and it's more easy read a graph than follow a lot of
    rows of code.

    I seached in cpan, but I didn't find nothing with option: these
    could use to "manage" errors or branch.

    Thanks in advance Giulio Bertani
