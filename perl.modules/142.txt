Hullo-

I want to solicit feedback for a new module I'm creating. Here's the
(hopefully short) background.

I've been developing a module for WDDX (see wddx.org). In a nutshell, WDDX
is a means to exchange basic data types between various languages by using
XML as the middle layer. WDDX has a DTD that includes elements which map
to basic data types like string, number, boolean, array, etc. Each
supported language then has a module that allows it to map its language's
data types back and forth to this intermediate format -- an XML document
called a WDDX packet.

The goal of WDDX is to allow web servers to become information servers 
by receiving and sending structured data that can then be easily
handled by other servers w/o language issues. It's been compared to SOAP,
but it doesn't try to do anything nearly so grand: no transport mechanisms
or OO interfaces are defined.

I have been discussing the module with a number of people on the wddx.org
site and the maintainer of the WDDX SDK. Because this technology was
created by and is promoted by Allaire, I have talked to lots of Windows
folks who primarily do ColdFusion and ASP but know some Perl. The hope is
that the Perl module will help it grow due to the large number of sites on
the web using Perl.

So there's the background. This module will be rolled into Allaire's SDK
and distributed on wddx.org, but I would like to distribute it via CPAN as
well. The module has heretofore been named WDDX.pm. I like that name
because it's clear what it does, there won't be any competing modules in
the WDDX namespace, and the module is easy for even novice Perl users to
find on CPAN.

I've reviewed the XML module list but didn't find any recommendations 
there for where to place this module. I have talked to Ken MacLeod some
and he recommended Marshall::WDDX but I believe this term would only
confuse people, and I'm not sure that it represents the proper category
given the intent of WDDX.

So ideally I'd like to keep WDDX.pm, but I'm writing to hear your
suggestions. Please let me know. Thanks. You can find the code at
http://www.scripted.com/wddx/.
