The thing is, the basic questions are:

(1) Will this make things better?

(2) Will we get sufficiently screwed by edge cases to make it not worth it?

I think the answer to (1) is a qualified yes, in that you've already
demonstrated that there are problems that would be solved by such a chance.

But I don't think there's any way to get an answer to (2) other than trying
to provide a working solution and seeing how sharp the edges turn out to be.

So, I think my personal opinion is "if you can provide a working solution,
I would in theory be in favour of it, but theory and practice are not always
the same so you need to prove that it works in practice too".
