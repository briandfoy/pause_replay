The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Passwd::Keyring
  DSLIP:       cdhOp
  description: Secure password storage via OS backends
  userid:      MEKK (Marcin Kasperski)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Source code published on bitbucket, issue trackers there, wiki if
    needed.

  similar:

  rationale:

    Scripts and modules fairly often need to use security-sensitive
    data, like passwords. In such a cases, they tend to either prompt
    for password on every run, or store passwords in insecure storage
    like config files.

    Operating systems nowadays provide numerous secure password
    storages (Gnome Keyring, KDE KWallet, OSX KeyChain, Windows Vault,
    ...), saving passwords there makes them reasonably secure, but at
    the same time leaves the user from burden of retyping them on every
    run.

    Passwd::Keyring:: is about (a) providing simplified, uniform
    interfaces to those APIs (for example Passwd::Keyring::Gnome stores
    passwords in GNOME Keyring) and (b) providing ways to automatically
    pick best possible backend.

    All this is heavily inspired by Python keyring library
    (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring), from which I plan to borrow
    some code or at least concepts which API to use.

    PS I just used cpan-upload script, wouldn't it be nice to have it
    save PAUSE password once for good, without being worried of
    accidentally loosing it?

The resulting entry would be:

Passwd::
