The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ClearCase::Base
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Interface with Rational ClearCase Base v2002
  userid:      THUNDERA (Mauro Ribeiro)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    ClearCase::Argv IPC::Cleartool ClearCase::CtCmd

  rationale:

    The idea of having a 'ClearCase::Base' module is to group several
    management functions of Rational Basic ClearCase v2002
    implementation. (not UCM).

    The Modules listed above as "similar functionalities" provide
    interactivity with cleartool command utilities and process its
    stdout and stderr for automations.

    Module 'ClearCase::Base' (and its childrens) tries to encapsulate a
    whole mature SCM process, tailoing CMM Activities of this KPA. So
    the "way" for executing and planning SCM activities could rely on a
    pre-determinate, Company-Specific desinged pattern.

    This system could be used by many other companies, promoting the
    same CMM implementation design patterns for all.

The resulting entry would be:

ClearCase::
::Base            cdpOp Interface with Rational ClearCase Base v2002 THUNDERA
