From: hightowe@10east.com (Lester Hightower)

I am considering contributing a module to CPAN that won't have very broad
appeal, but need some guidance on namespace selection.  The module is
currently named S918_T94.pm, and its purpose is to parse the T94 file
format, as defined in the Association of American Railroads' S-918a
specification document.  For anyone interested (unlikely) the S-918
specification can be read here: http://www.10east.com/pub/S-918.pdf and
the S-918a starts on page K-193.

So far, my best idea is Text::S918_T94, but that just "feels" wrong.

I am open to (asking for) suggestions.

Thanks,
