I registered on PAUSE as ASIMJALIS two years ago. I have since
lost my password and my e-mail address has changed (from
ajalis@twu.net to asimjalis@acm.org). So I have no way of
recovering my password. 

I realize the circumstances are rather odd. Is it possible for me
to get the password to my login ASIMJALIS?

I had a chance to work on the unit testing module mentioned in
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-11/msg00138.html
and wanted to upload it to CPAN. Any help would be appreciated.
