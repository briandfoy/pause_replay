Duh, sorry, I had to sent this again since my exim/mutt configuration got screwed up somehow so that a mere reply to my previous mail would produce a bogus reply-address.

Hi,

I would like to share the PAUSE-community and thus be able to share (as for yet) one module and perhaps some scripts.

Name: Tassilo von Parseval
Email: tassilo.parseval@post.rwth-aachen.de
homepage: http://www-users.rwth-aachen.de/tassilo.parseval (not yet Perl-related)
Preferred id: VPARSEVAL

Intended module to share:
Mail::MboxParser -
	A very simplified access to messages in a UNIX-mailbox. On the resulting
	Mail::MboxParser::Mail objects all header-fields plus body can easily and
	comfortably be accessed. Most methods act as a wrapper for the MIME::Tools
	to get straigt to the point of handling MIME::Entity's and attachements
	in particular. More refined things can still be done by invoking methods
	from MIME::tools directly.

Thanks for your patience,
Tassilo
