I specifically suggested that Benchmark::OO would be a terrible name.

Benchmark::Object appears to be free and would fit with the common
naming conventions.

The PAUSE index currently shows 237 modules in 78 distributions whose names
match /-Object/ and 83 in 23 distributions whose names match /-OO/.

If you want to maximise your distribution's findability and make a good
first impression, using the common naming convention rather than a more
obscure one would seem the better choice.

Sorry for missing this email until now.
