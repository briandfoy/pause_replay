     why:

    I've written some modules based on Finance::Bank::Schwab for
    Fidelity and BankOfAmerica. I write a bunch of general perl code
    that may or may not be useful to people. Mainly automating various
    processes, but I've always considered them too "special-use" for
    CPAN. I'm trying to get organized and actually contribute some of my
    stuff back to the community now :)
