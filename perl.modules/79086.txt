Subject: Module submission IPC::Concurrency::DBI

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Concurrency::DBI
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Parallelization control with DBI as IPC
  userid:      AUBERTG (Guillaume Aubert)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    IPC::Concurrency, IPC::Semaphore::Concurrency

  rationale:

    IPC::Concurrency and IPC::Semaphore::Concurrency provide similar
    functionalities, but with memory and files respectively as IPC.

    However, due to restrictions on production systems files/memory
    access may not be available to the developers while database access
    will be (which appears to be a common situation with Sarbanes-Oxley
    restrictions), so using DBI as an IPC in those situations make sense
    to allow complete control of the concurrency management.

    This new module is technically closer to IPC::Concurrency, so I
    went for IPC::Concurrency::DBI rather than
    IPC::Semaphore::Concurrency::DBI.

  enteredby:   AUBERTG (Guillaume Aubert)
  enteredon:   Wed Jan  4 05:17:28 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::Concurrency::
::DBI             RdpOa Parallelization control with DBI as IPC      AUBERTG
