Hi,

Config::Properties lets you make config files with properties like

   foo.bar=blech
   foo.bar.boz=blah
   foo.bar.buzz=bly

I have a module that lets you extend this like

   foo {
     bar = blech
     bar.boz = blah
     bar.buzz = bly
   }

and so on. Nesting is unlimited.

Main accessor is a config routine:

  config("foo","bar")

would return "blech" using the above examples.
When called in list context, it returns ("boz","buzz"), a list with
all subkeys of "bar" in the order they appeared in the file.

Would this module provide appreciated functionality?
How should it be called?
