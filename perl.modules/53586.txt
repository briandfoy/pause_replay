As mentioned, the use of a company-specific namespace is something that 
generally isn't done, except for cases where you are implenting 
functionality which itself is directly related to the company (via 
devices of protocols and so on).

The use of a top level namespace simply for the convenient grouping of 
all modules by a single author/company is something we strongly discourage.

If Tie::Dir is not available, how about something like Tie::FileSystem?
