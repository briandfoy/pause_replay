The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BPM::Engine
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Business Process execution engine
  userid:      SITETECH (Peter de Vos)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    bpmengine.org (project/community site) and
    github.com/sitetechie/BPM-Engine (development)

  similar:
    Class::Workflow Workflow::XPDL BPM::XPDL

  rationale:

    The module is an execution engine for workflow processes specified
    in XPDL (and in the future, BPMN). Mark Overmeer's BPM::XPDL module
    was a child project (and thus, a current requirement) of this
    workflow engine. The BPM (Business Process Management) namespace
    should serve as the logical placeholder for all modules pertaining
    to the BPM field. This module is the only standards-based open
    source Perl workflow execution engine in existence (the field is
    dominated by Java), hence the name. I've been working on it for
    years, and feel it's now mature and stable enough to hit CPAN.

    Thank you.
