Subject: registering my name spaces

From: darren@DarrenDuncan.net (Darren Duncan)

Hello, I would like to clarify the name spaces that I wish to 
register, so they appear on the module list.  If you have any 
suggestions for using a different name for the modules, then please 
say so.  All of these would go with the user id DUNCAND.

In particular, I have questions about [HashOfArrays, SequentialFile, 
EventCountFile].  And that is, would they go best under 'Hash' or 
'IO' respectively, or would they be better to go under 'CGI'?  They 
are all designed for use in CGIs (and HashOfArrays can do all kinds 
of url or cookie or html encoding that I know about), but I think 
they can be used in non-cgi applications as well.  I just want a name 
where those people who are most likely to use them will find them 
intuitively.

Name                     DSLI   Description
----------------------   ----   --------------------------------------------

Class::ParamParser     - bdpO - complex parameter parsing for subclass methods
Hash::OfArrays         - bdpO - data (text,bin) store/parse/url-encode, subset
IO::SequentialFile     - bdpO - store prefs,logs from HoAs/hash as 
k=v text file
IO::EventCountFile     - cdpO - for storing event counts and dates (usage)
HTML::TagMaker         - bdpO - make single,groups of HTML tags, head/footers
HTML::FormMaker        - bdpO - predefined persistant forms, reports, validate

CGI::WPM::Content      - bdpO - store/assemble web page parts, search 
and replace
CGI::WPM::Globals      - cdpO - stores/parses web site globals, 
utils, user input
CGI::WPM::Base         - cdpO - defines API for WPM modules, stores local prefs
CGI::WPM::MultiPage    - adpO - wpm resolves nav in page hierarchy, makes menus
CGI::WPM::Static       - adpO - wpm for displaying static html pages
CGI::WPM::MailForm     - adpO - wpm for implementing private e-mail forms
CGI::WPM::GuestBook    - adpO - wpm for implementing a complete guest book
CGI::WPM::SegTextDoc   - adpO - wpm displays static single/multipart text pages
CGI::WPM::Redirect     - cdpO - wpm for issuing a redirect header
CGI::WPM::MessageBoard - cdpO - wpm implements a threaded discussion board
CGI::WPM::Password     - idpO - wpm for securing parts of a site with 
a password
CGI::WPM::FormMaker    - idpO - wpm to make form defin used with 
HTML::FormMaker
CGI::WPM::Usage        - cdpO - track site usage details, log, e-mail to owner

Some of the above are renamed since earlier messages were posted to 
modules@perl.org.  Please disregard the earlier names if they are 
different.

My questions now are:

Do I have to upload my modules to PAUSE for them to appear on the 
module list, or will this e-mail suffice to have it done?

Second, do I have to upload for my modules to appear in a CPAN 
search, or will this registration suffice?

Third, what are the proper command line options and syntax to the 
"tar" and "gz" programs on a Linux system in order for files to be 
archived the way PAUSE expects them.  I haven't created these before, 
so help is appreciated.

Fourth, is it okay for each module's revision history to be inside 
that module, or should it be in a separate document.

Fifth, if no one replies to my e-mails on registering name spaces 
that are sent to modules@perl.org, do I get the names by default?  On 
a related note, what kinds of things do I have to say to get a reply 
(other than registering a new developer).

Thanks for everything,

// Darren Duncan

P.S.  The modules on my web site still have their old names, but will 
be updated and their internal code updated any day now.
