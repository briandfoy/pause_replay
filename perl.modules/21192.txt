Sorry for that.

Yes, we know that Ted cannot be reached via email. We know that since
2003-03-04, which is not a very long time.

I suggest that we make you a co-maintainer so that you can upload the
bugfix, but leave Ted registered as the owner. Only if Ted remains not
reachable for a longer time we should consider a switch of ownership.

That said, consider yourself co-maintainer now.

Thanks for your help,
