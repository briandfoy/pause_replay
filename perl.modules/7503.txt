The reason for that was the "our" declaration of $VERSION. At the time
5.6.1 was uploaded, PAUSE was running under 5.005_something and could
not understand the "our".

You need to be owner of base.pm in order to convince the indexer to
accept it. Shall I make you the owner?

I just gave you an account on PAUSE so that you can look around. Pause
code is in ~k/PAUSE. I'm not in favor of publishing the code, but I'm
very open to your suggestions. But please, do not make too many
suggestions at once, I fear I cannot digest them all.
