Hi Yamashina-san and Taku-san,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

MIKAGE owns the Tripletail::DB::STH namespace (HIO has co-maint), which =
was include in the H/HI/HIO/Tripletail-0.49.tar.gz release. This =
conflicts with the Tripletail::DB::Sth namespace, which HIO has =
ownership of, and which is in the later H/HI/HIO/Tripletail-0.50.tar.gz.

To resolve this permissions situation I propose to do the following:
 - drop the permissions on the older Tripletail::DB::STH package
 - schedule older releases for deletion

Looking at the CPAN Index, I can see the following entries from older =
releases:

    Tripletail::DB::_scope          undef  =
H/HI/HIO/Tripletail-0.49.tar.gz
    Tripletail::DB::STH             undef  =
H/HI/HIO/Tripletail-0.49.tar.gz
    Tripletail::Filter::Redirect    undef  =
H/HI/HIO/Tripletail-0.31.tar.gz
    Tripletail::SMIME                0.06  =
H/HI/HIO/Tripletail-0.34.tar.gz

These look like modules that were either dropped, refactored away, or =
renamed, in subsequent releases. The danger of keeping these on CPAN is =
that someone could try to install one of these, and end up =
unintentionally installing an older version of Tripletail.

The safest thing would be delete version 0.49 and all earlier releases, =
unless there=E2=80=99s some reason why you want to keep certain older =
versions on CPAN? (Remember that all releases are always available on =
BackPAN).

Are you happy for me to drop the permissions on Tripletail::DB::STH, and =
would you like me to schedule deletion of all the older releases?

Cheers,
Neil
