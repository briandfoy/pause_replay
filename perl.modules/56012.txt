The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sendmail::M4::Mail8
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Simple ANTI SPAM & FAKE MX, sendmail module
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module used to be our standard ANTI SPAM and ANTI FAKE MX
    sendmail HACK written to be included as is within the sendmail cf
    file, as the script became more complicated and required better
    tuneable support, we decided to convert into a Perl script. Early on
    we realized that we needed to break the testing part from the main
    code, resulting in "Sendmail::M4::Utils" which has just been
    uploaded, and was tested by a very early version of
    Sendmail::M4::Mail8. A lot of work needs to be done on Mail8 and it
    is bound to drive improvements to Utils, hopefully adding HTML which
    has been omitted for now. At the very least this will provide a good
    working example for others to write their own hacks using
    Sendmail::M4::Utils. Or at least provide a simple effective and
    quick anti spam module.

The resulting entry would be:

Sendmail::M4::
::Mail8           cdpfp Simple ANTI SPAM & FAKE MX, sendmail module  CML
