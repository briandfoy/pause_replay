The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Tmojo
  DSLIP:       bmpOo
  description: Dynamic HTML and Text Generation Engine
  userid:      LABZERONE (Will Conant)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tmojo/

  similar:
    HTML::Mason Template

  rationale:

    While Tmojo is a complete solution for generating any sort of text
    document, it is most likely to be used for producing HTML.
    Consequently, I've decided to put Tmojo in the HTML:: namespace.

    Tmojo is similar to, and in fact somewhat inspired by Mason.
    Tmojo's primary advantage comes from it's pure Object-Oriented
    processing model in which Tmojo templates _are_ actual Perl classes,
    not just similar to Perl classes. Tmojo does borrow some of the
    clever whitespace handling mechanisms from the Template Toolkit, but
    it does not aspire to be a complete programming language and relies
    instead on embedded Perl for template behavior.

    Tmojo also provides a mechanism for "lite" templates that cannot
    run arbitrary Perl code and, thus, can be safely provided by
    untrusted 3rd parties.

    Tmojo has no dependencies and is not tied, in any way, to mod_perl
    or CGI and is well suited to text generation needs outside of
    HTML/CGI. Consequently, the Tmojo interfaces have been designed to
    be easy to use from any Perl application. Tmojo does, however, come
    with a mod_perl handler for quick deployment into an Apache
    environment.

    Tmojo has proven useful in several of my company's commercial
    projects, and, recently, a small number of developers outside of my
    company have been effectively deploying Tmojo in their projects as
    well. Having Tmojo listed on the module list would be a good step
    toward wider distribution of what I hope will be a powerful tool for
    the Perl community.

The resulting entry would be:
