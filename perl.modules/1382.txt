I'd like to become a registered CPAN contributor:

Name: Jay Jacobs
email: jay@lach.net
homepage: http://www.securetty.org   # not currently up, but soon.
preferred user-ID: JAYJ

what I'd like to contribute, and how I came to want to register:
I've been working with perl for years, and always considered becoming a
contributor.  I recently took Lincoln Stein's new Apache::MP3 Module and
enhanced it, and made a ton of changes.  I contacted Lincoln Stein who
recomended that I register and put it up on CPAN.  My enhancements are too
many to name here, but I've made the listing and organization of mp3's
much easier, and enabled streaming of multiple albums.

I also have several "Infobot" modules, which the infobot-dev group has
been talking about putting on CPAN.  These modules were discussed on irc
in #perl, in the infobot-dev mailing list, and in personal emails with
folks.

I also have a system monitoring package I wrote last year that is built on
various "test" modules.  If I can clean that up for public release it'll
be on CPAN.  This was part of a joint effort between myself, a very smart
co-worker and a pile of requests from users.

Lemme see if I can get this Dsli thing down:

Name:
Apache::MP3Playlist

DSLI:
Rdpf

Description:
Enhanced Apache::MP3, allowing streaming of multiple albums

Info:
JAYJ

I think I did that right, it should be pretty similar to whatever Lincoln
Stein put for Apache::MP3

Is that all you'd need?
