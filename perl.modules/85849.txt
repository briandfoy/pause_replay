The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Prove::Plugin::TraceUse
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Easily list modules used during testing
  userid:      TORBJORN (Torbjørn Lindahl)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is (in my humble oppinion) a great extension the the very
    useful prove script.

    The namespace goes well in line with the other plugins to
    App::Prove. The final bit, "::TraceUse", reflects that it invokes
    Devel::TraceUse when it runs the tests.

    It uses Devel::TraceUse to keep track of all modules invoked during
    testing and then compares this list to what prereqs are listed in
    Makefile.PL and/or Build.PL, also considering module versions.
    (Requires the source code in these two files to be in a "standard"
    formatted way)

    Thus it motivates you to test all bits of your code, so that the
    dependency list reported will be as complete as possible.

    There is similar functionality somewhere in Dist::Zilla:: , but I
    couldn't easily find it now when searching, and for peaople using
    prove in their daily perl coding, it would be nice to have this
    extra tool easily available.

The resulting entry would be:

App::Prove::Plugin::
::TraceUse        RdpOa Easily list modules used during testing      TORBJORN
