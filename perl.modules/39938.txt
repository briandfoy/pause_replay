Hi,

I'm the current maintainer of Text::CSV_XS.  I often get mail about 
Text::CSV.  I've written to Alan Citterman (the maintainer of Text::CSV) 
but have never had a response.  He hasn't touched the module since 
1997.  I'd like to take over maintenance of Text::CSV if that's 
possible.  I'd like to add some of the things people have requested 
(e.g. handling embedded newlines) and keep T::CSV's interface in sync 
with T::CSV_XS's interface as was originally the case.

I don't at all like the idea of re-assigning a module without the 
maintainer's input, but after seven years with no word, perhaps it's time.
