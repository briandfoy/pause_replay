Cplusplus, C_plus_plus, Cxx, ...

For bigger projects it is quite often helpful to choose a name that
comes from a different domain. I wouldn't apply this rule to your
project, but I also have considered HTML::Tree already taken by Sean
although his module is really called HTML::TreeBuilder. Sure, we have
135 items in the HTML:: namespace, it is crowded there, but please do
what you can to avoid mental namespace pollution.

You say *a* windshield wiper control and you're right. When you buy a
windshield wiper control there may be several to choose from and they
will have to have classifying names to make clear which one you and
your dealer are talking about. All I would suggest is to classify
HTML::Tree deeper, maybe HTML::Tree::Cxx.

Please avoid letting polite arguments degenerate into a flame war.
