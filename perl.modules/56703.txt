Hi,

You are right gameclock has not been uploaded where are thought or
I would wished to. But gameclock has been uploaded under:
CHESSKIT/GameClock-0.01
I have an updated version to upload soon and I 'll try to do things well 
now.
So, perhaps you can tell or help me on what  perhaps  seems the best to do ?
Continue as the  the things happened or make the changes ?
Regards.

Charles.
