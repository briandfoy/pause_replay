This has happened way too often and I take the responsibility on that.

                             W A N T E D

               Unsuccess Stories like the one from Paul

     People who have made a similar experience like Paul, that is

             - have requested a namespace
             - got approval
             - do not find the modules in the module list

  Please send a mail to modules@perl.org with the following details

             - When was a consensus about the namespace achieved
             - Which chapter of the module list do the modules belong

             - for each module complete lines in module list format
               (no TABs please and formatting according to current
               format, that is, e.g.

Term::
::ReadKey       Rdcf Read keystrokes and change terminal modes    KJALB
::ReadLine      Sdcf Common interface for various implementations ILYAZ

                So there are 44 characters for description and only 13
                or 15 characters for the name)

                             R E W A R D

    Your modules get published in the module list within 24 hours.

                   This offer valid through Oct. 31

That is correct.

No. In the future this will change, but not before we have a
satisficing alternative.

Tuits. I have had a few "free" days now to hack on PAUSE full time.
Module list maintainance work is much easier now. I hope till the end
of the year I have a fully working setup that makes CPAN not only the
most excellent repository but also the one with the lowest frustration
factor. Sorry that the latter wasn't true all the time.

FFI is in Version 2.63 of the module list and uploaded to CPAN.
