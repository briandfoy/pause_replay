Here is a misunderstanding on your side. Here you should only insert a
mail address you actually own. You can't simply choose an @cpan.org
address and hope that it magically starts working. But read on...

This looks correct and you should get mail that is sent to
SRANDALLS@cpan.org at your srandallsawyer@gmail.com address. But please
note, that google is your big brother and does not send you mail that is
originating from yourself. So while it should work, you cannot test it
yourself.

> What should I do?

(1) change the publicly visible email address, it is bogus.

(2) ask a friend to send a test message to SRANDALLS@cpan.org for you.

Good luck, let me know when you need further help,
