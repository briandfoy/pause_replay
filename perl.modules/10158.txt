Evening all

I need help naming a module.

The code in question is a pure perl standalone framework for parsing, 
modifying, manipulating, converting and analysing perl source code.

The perl parser and syntax highlighter are complete, a perltidy type 
function is somewhat working, as is obfuscation.

So far, I have developed the code under Perl::  since it does work with 
perl source... but now it's ready to go into CPAN, it's obviously a 
terrible place to put it, especially since I noticed recently that there 
already is a Perl.pm for holding an interpreter.

Details on the module and examples of it's work at http://ali.as/PSP/

So far, I have tentative ideas for Parse:::Perl (which step's on Damian 
Conway's feet a bit), or since it's a freestanding framework for doing 
multiple things, I was thinking of PSP::* ( Perl Source Processor ), ala 
POE. But I'm a bit loath to put yet another module into the root...

Can anyone offer potential (and preferably not too ugly ) namespace ideas?

Bear in mind that the framework will eventually support such things as 
code rewriting, API documentation generation and possibly a refactoring 
editor...\

Thanks all, fire away.
