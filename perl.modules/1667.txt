friends--

I have just uploaded an update to my software construction framework
project, called 'Perl Conjury', to the CPAN.  It's in my author's
directory.  Here is the profiling information for the module list,
should the maintainers think it worthwhile to list:

Module Name:  Conjury::C
Author Name:  James Woodyatt
Author Email: jhw@wetware.com
Author Home page: http://www.wetware.com/jhw
Author ID on CPAN: JWOODYATT
Module DSLI Entry: adph
Module Concise Descript: Conjury w/ C/C++ compilers and linkers

I have tried to carry on a discussion about this software with folks on
the module-authors@perl.org list on and off for the last few months. 
There has been what should honestly be described as "at least a little
bit of interest" in this software.

I know of at least one software project that plans to use Perl Conjury
as its replacement for 'make'.

There is a companion module, described in a separate email, called
'Conjury-Core', which implements the core functionality of the system. 
This module is an extension in the framework for working with C/C++
compilers and linkers.
