The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::SimplePermutation
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: SimplePermutation
  userid:      JNQUINTIN (Quintin Jean-Noël)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Permute::List Algorithm::Permute Algorithm::FastPermute

  rationale:

    This module generates a permutation of an array. Any permutation
    could be access quickly and directly.

    I didn't compare the efficiency to the other package. I just know
    the complexity of my function (O(n) to generate a permutation (with
    n the size of the array)). I just saw that the interface using by
    the other provide only: next_permutation. Or in my case, I required
    to be able to get access to any permutation. Moreover for me it was
    nice to be able to index a permutation with a number.

    Like this, if I want the n^{th} permutation I could get access to
    this one in O(n) (without having to generate all previous
    permutations).

    The last but not the least, this module doesn't required a huge
    memory (I don't store all the possible permutations).

    I call it SimplePermutation because I don't take into account the
    fact that there are some identical variable inside the array. This
    is the only limitation.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::SimplePermutation cdphp SimplePermutation                            JNQUINTIN
