Thanks, Brian, for your reply.  I started wondering whether I was talking
to myself. ;-)

The Messaging::Courier stuff doesn't really seem to have anything to do
with the Courier MTA.  The README is empty, and the Messaging::Courier pod
says:

| The message queue that Courier currently uses is Spread
| (http://www.spread.org/). This must be installed before using and
| testing this module. The module assumes that Spread is installed and
| that the spread daemon is running on the local machine.

I don't know what this "Spread" thing is, but it certainly doesn't have
anything to do with the Courier MTA either.  Messaging::Courier appears to
be some special application of this Spread thingy, but I can only guess.
A Google search for <courier spread> turned up nothing relevant except for
what was already obvious.

About putting Courier::Filter under Mail:: -- I thought about doing that.
But I have the impression that the Mail:: namespace mostly contains
generic mail utility modules, not interfaces to established software
products, perhaps with the exception of Mail::SpamAssassin and
Mail::GnuPG.  Mail::Sendmail for instance isn't an interface to the
"Sendmail" product, but a platform independent abstraction layer for
sending mail.

Courier::Filter in concept much more matches what Sendmail::Milter does,
so I thought "Courier::Filter" would be an appropriate name.  Am I wrong?
