Subject: Trying to come up with a name for a DTrace Consumer XS module
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed

From: gmarler@gmarler.com (Gordon Marler)

I've written an XS module that implements a DTrace Consumer, and after 
some reading, need to ask for your collective wisdom on where it should 
go in the CPAN namespace.

I don't see any other CPAN modules that remotely implement this 
functionality.

I initially named it Devel::libdtrace, which in hindsight seems 
completely wrong, since it's not meant to be used to debug Perl itself.

DTrace::Consumer seems nice and descriptive, but may be too far up in 
the name hierarchy.

Any other suggestions?  Thanks for any feedback.
