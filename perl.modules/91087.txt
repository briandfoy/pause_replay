Adam,

The ownership of IPC::Run in PAUSE is a little murky, but the
consensus from past authors is that you are the current official owner
of the module. It's my understanding you're inactive on CPAN at the
moment. If you're OK with it, I'd like to be designated owner of
IPC::Run to help get the module more attention than it's currently
getting than from just myself.

Are you OK with switching the owner of IPC::Run to PAUSE user toddr (me)?

Thanks,
Todd
