The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Set::Toolkit
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Provides sets with lots of utilities.
  userid:      SIRROBERT (Sir Robert Burbridge)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Set::Object Set::Array

  rationale:

    This module is intended to enable users to manipulate sets in ways
    that are not normally available, as well as provide some level of
    introspection.

    Some examples of manipulation capabilities are: * switching between
    ordered and unordered views of the list without damaging the
    underlying set. * The ability to toggle element uniqueness
    non-destructively, including getting a "proper" (read: unique)
    element set from a non-unique set, ordered and unordered. * the
    standard unions, differences, etc.

    Some examples of introspection: * Some fairly powerful searching;
    e.g. the following would return any elements in the list with a
    property (or hash value) "location", which also contained a property
    (or hash value) of "zip_code" with the value "27707": $resultset =
    $set->search(location=>{zip_code=>27707}}); This kind of searching
    does not complain about mixed sets that contain both scalars and
    objects/hashes ("a", "b", {location=>{zip_code=>27707}}). *
    context-sensitive self-examination; e.g. for the set
    ('a','b','c','c','d') the value of $set->size will be 4 if
    $set->is_unique and will be 5 if !$set->is_unique.

    Thus, the idea is to provide a broad and robust toolkit for dealing
    with sets of data. Especially, I'm not interested in requiring a
    strict mathematical interpretation of what a "set" is; Toolkit sets
    *can* be used that way, but other things can be done with them as
    well.

    I'm open for a better name, if this one is no good =)

The resulting entry would be:

Set::
