The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Exchange::Mailbox
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Exchange Mailbox maintenance
  userid:      SMANROSS (Steven Manross)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I want to Move Win32::Exchange to Win32::Exchange::Mailbox because
    the functions in this module are strictly related to mailbox
    maintenance and the name makes a better fit.

    Some searching functions will be left behind because they are
    useful to all of the sub-modules that I am envisioning, but for now,
    there is only one more sub-module on the horizon
    (Win32::Exchange::SMTP::Security).

    Win32::Exchange will "use" these sub-modules:

    Win32::Exchange::Mailbox, and Win32::Exchange::SMTP::Security

    by default, and will include them in it's package.

    Thanks, Steven
