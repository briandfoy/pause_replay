I'd like a PAUSE account, please.

  Name:  Jay Lawrence
  Email: jlawrenc@infonium.com
  URL:   http://www.infonium.com
  REQUESTED ID:    JLAWRENC

  I intend to contribute several modules I have written:

    Apache::Tie::Request - tied access to Apache request data
    Apache::Tie::Cookies - tied access to Apache cookies

  I have preannounced these modules on modperl mailing list and have 
been encouraged to use the Apache::Tie::* naming structure to parallel 
Tie::* modules found in CPAN. These modules are strictly releated to 
running under the Apache server.

Below is my messge of 2 weeks ago. I am resending to follow up with my 
more concrete module naming proposal.

Thanks for your consideration,
Jay
