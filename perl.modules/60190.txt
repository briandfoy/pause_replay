     why:

    Tk Composite Widget for File/Directory Selection. Basically the
    composite consists of a (Lab)Frame a Button and a (Hist)Entry. It
    should handle directory/file selection and automatically insert it
    into the (Hist)Entry. Labframe will be used if a label is specified,
    HistEntry if a history is specified. Makes use of slightly modified
    getOpenFile getSaveFile and chooseDirectory.
