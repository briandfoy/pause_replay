The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::ShowWarnings
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Redirect STDERR to web page for debugging
  userid:      MIKO (Miko O'Sullivan)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)

  rationale:

    When writing CGI's I frequently find it cumbersome to run a test of
    a CGI, then check my error logs for any warnings. Even if I keep an
    SSH session open and tail -r errorlog, I still have to alt-tab back
    and forth between the browser and the SSH window, then figure out
    which of the errors were caused by the latest run of the CGI.

    CGI::ShowWarnings gets rids of most of that issue by displaying the
    warnings directly in the web page. CGI::ShowWarnings is very simple
    to use:

    use CGI::ShowWarnings; my $warnings = CGI::ShowWarnings->new();

    When the $warnings object grabs STDERR and stores up everything
    sent to STDERR. When $warnings drops out of scope it returns STDERR
    to its normal functionality. It then checks if anything was actually
    sent to STDERR during its reign. If anything was, then the object
    outputs all the errors to STDOUT (ie, to the web browser) in a nice
    neat <PRE> box.
