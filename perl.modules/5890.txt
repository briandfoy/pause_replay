Planned modules:

I have developed a module (Note.pm) which is well-suited for debugging Perl
scripts and modules. I have also written a package which I call Test::Debugger,
which is very similar to the standard package Test.pm, but which logs test
failures to a flat file.

Note.pm is ready for immediate release. I will discuss the possibility of
adding functionality to Test.pm before releasing Test::Debugger.

Thank you,

-Nathan
