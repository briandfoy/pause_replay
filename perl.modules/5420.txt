I suppose you mean Comp.Lang.Perl.Modules ?  I did a post to there but got 
no replies.. Should I assume that there is no issue?

>The module looks very nifty.

Thank you.  I still have to finish getting it into a releasable form.

Um, Actually I havent even applied for an user name or anything.  Things are 
pretty busy at work just now and the instructions page was a bit on the 
menacing side so I figured I'd wait for when I had more time.

Urgh.  Yes well.  I can see Ill be spending some hours with the Blue Camel. 
:-) To be honest I havent even thought about how to implement this, but when 
I do try it will be ex::caution that I will work with....
It'll be an interesting challenge. (Actually having just done some minor 
research I suspect that unless you point me to some info then its going to 
be a loooong time before I do this one.  I mean, an (admittedly) quick 
glance in the camel came up with nothing.  Is there any difference between a 
pragma and a package outside of naming conventions?)

Anyway, back to the good/bad old boring for-pay programming... Sigh.

Ps What part of Germany are you based in?  I'm in Frankfurt.
