Planning to contribute:

Well, I have one module, although super simple, already to be peer
reviewed and tested for usefulness, style and so on.  It is nameless,
although on my machine it is Getopt::Simple.  Since I know this name is
already taken, I am open to suggestions.

I also have a patch available for Net-IMAP-Simple, but I am in a heated
discussion with the modules author about whether or not his module is
really compliant with the RFC.  A patch may be released to fix it or an
entirely different module may be released, depending on the results of the
discussion with the author.

There are a number of other things I would like to upload to PAUSE in the
future, but I think I can only handle one module at a time.  :)

(I am unsure if the following is necessary for uploading things to PAUSE)

Getopt::Something::Simple DSLI: cdpn

Description: Popluates %ARGV using simple rules and @ARGV

As far as public discussion, there is a local mailing list I have posted
this module to and the comments are documented in the pod information.
No major issues have come of the discussion so far.  I fully intend to
put the module in PAUSE and then announce its location for discussion.  If
it is found to be useless, I have no intention of releasing it to CPAN.
If my ideas are wrong about all this, please do let me know.

Basically, I don't know if all the above info was necessary, but all I
want to do is upload something to PAUSE so that I can announce the modules
availabilty.  If the response is positive I will then resubmit the info
contained in this mail (?) for general release.

Thank you,
