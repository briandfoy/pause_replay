Hello.  My name is Robert Bedell, my email address is zen@tischer.net,
my homepage (torn down, really) is http://i.want.more.disorder.com/
My preferred user id is ODDFELLOW, or RAKANUJ if that is not available.
Of course, RBEDELL is fine as well :P ;)

I've implemented several mod_perl modules under Apache::* I would like to
share.  Some of them, unfortunately, are proprietary.  The first I'll
contribute is Apache::XMLRPC, binding for the XML-RPC (xml-rpc.org/)
specification under mod_perl.  I also have an interest in Net::ICQ,
though I'll be contacting that author first.

I've asked the mod_perl mailing list about it, and contacted the xml-rpc
development team.

The appropriate module listing would be:
Apache::
::XMLRPC	bdpf	mod_perl binding for Frontier::RPC2 impl. of XML-RPC	ODDFELLOW

I would appreciate a PAUSE ID.

Sincerely,
--Rob
