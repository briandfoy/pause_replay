Arthur,

I fear that names like Text::RFC2426 and Text::RFC2445 are=20
counterintuitive.

All user agents refer to the data as a "vCard". You'll often see them=20
shown as an attachment like this. Address books will manage, export and=20=

import vCard files. Calandar programs manage and import vCalandar,=20
iCalendar, or iCal files.

We feel that this format is comparable in significance to entries in:
	=
http://search.cpan.org/modlist/String_Language_Text_Processing/Text

What we are proposing is a trio of modules:

	Text::vFile 		base file format parser
	Text::vCard	API to data in RFC2426 fromat
	Text::iCalendar		API to data in RFC2445 format

End users will be using one of Text::vCard and Text::iCalendar in their=20=

code with Text::vFile as a pre-requisite. Perhaps Text::vFile need not=20=

be registered?

Thanks for your consideration - and please advise us of specific names=20=

that would be preferred in lieu of this submission. As of now - from=20
our correspondence with early module adopters and the Module authors=20
the above is the closest we have to consensus.

Jay
