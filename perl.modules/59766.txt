The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Spectrum
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: A stylish color dialog with a spectrum
  userid:      KIRSLE (Casey Kirsle)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tk::chooseColor

  rationale:

    Tk::Spectrum is an alternative to the standard Tk::chooseColor
    method. It provides a stylish, user-friendly color picker dialog.

    Specifically, Tk::chooseColor is alright on Win32 as it uses the
    native color dialog, but on X11 the chooseColor dialog is very ugly,
    difficult to use, and definitely not very user-friendly.
    Tk::Spectrum is a module that provides a friendly color selection
    dialog including a click-to-pick spectrum of color, a list of preset
    colors, and a form to manually alter the RGB and Hex values of the
    color you want. A much better solution than the X11 chooseColor, and
    is cross-platform, too.
