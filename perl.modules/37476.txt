Hi,

I have some files in a kit that I do not want to be processed
separately. Currently the files (all .html files) appear in the index
page (see http://search.cpan.org/~jv/Template-TT2Site-0.91/, "Other
Files").

I seem to remember there was something you could do with META.yml, but
I forgot the details. 
Can anyone refresh my memory?

Thanks,
	Johan
