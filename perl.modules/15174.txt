Hi Maintainer,

I have a new module named tux_perl to released at CPAN. Following is the 
infomation about this module and the package.

Name: Yale Huang
Mail Address: yale@sdf-eu.org
Homepage: http://tux-perl.sourceforge.net
Preferred User ID: yale
Description about tux_perl:

tux_perl is a Perl extension for Tux. Tux is a high speed web server from
Redhat. With the non-blocking event loop structure and the zero copying
technique, Tux can provide static content at very fast speed. Tux also
provide an interface to develop user space extensions. tux_perl works as
an user space module of Tux, and interprets Perl scripts to provide
dynamic contents.

This library is released under the GPL; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the term of GPL.


Thanks a lot.

Best Regards
Yale Huang
