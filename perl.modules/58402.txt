Subject: Module submission Fukurama::Class

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fukurama::Class
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Pragma to extend the Perl-OO in native Perl
  userid:      TOBIWAN (Tobias Tacke)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://www.fukurama.org

  similar:
    interface Object::Interface Attribute::Constructor
    Attribute::Context Attribute::Final Attribute::Protected
    Attribute::Signature Attribute::Static

  rationale:

    This module combines and extend the behavior of similar modules
    given above. Every of the modules has a single functionality but to
    use it together and to check all definitions for the
    completeinheritation path theyx are hard to use. So this module put
    this all together to simplify it.

    It doesn't use the similar modules because of their rought behavior
    with overwriting UNIVERSAL methods.

    I choosed this namespace because this is a base functionality for
    the intendet Fukurama framework.

    PS: the module is already uploaded to cpan so you can easy access
    the detailed POD.

The resulting entry would be:

Fukurama::
