There are already a number of CPAN ids which are company/organisation
accounts, so I suggested doing the same with the MITEL account. This
makes transfer of group work easier when the work is performed as an
organisation (as these tools are).

If it is not possible to create another company account, please create:

your name:				Gordon Rowell
your email address:			cpan@gormand.com.au
your homepage if you have one :		www.gormand.com.au
your preferred user-ID on CPAN:		GORDONR
