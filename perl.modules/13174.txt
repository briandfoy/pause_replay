Hi,

I tried to upload a new version of SAP:Rfc using the a nominated UIR,
and the Lynx browser.  It seems that it may have gone wrong and even
over written Ken Williams' module AI-DecisionTree-0.02.tar.gz.

Can you please confirm what has happened, and my apologies if I have
accidentally broken something (Lynx is not very compatible with the
pause site so it would seem ).

Cheers

Piers Harding.
