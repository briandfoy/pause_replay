Subject: Module submission BeeSQL

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BeeSQL
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Creates beeSQL javascript object
  userid:      SCOTTA (Scott Adams)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    unknown

  similar:
    I didn't find any

  rationale:

    Hello. This is my first attempt/try at adding a module to CPAN.
    Therefore, I'm not exactly sure how/where the module should be
    located. So... forgive my ignorance.

    The module I have created uses LWP to communicate to a private
    server/script. Successful authentication returns a javascript object
    that can communicate with the BeeSQL server.

    This is still beta, but I've got momentum on this and it's coming
    to life.

    I suppose this could be called LWP::BeeSQL if I understand the
    namespace conventions correctly.

    Let me know how to proceed please.

    Thank you so much.
