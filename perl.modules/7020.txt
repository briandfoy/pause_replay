The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SysConfig
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Class for describing system configuration
  userid:      PATRICK (Patrick Devine)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    Designing an operating system installer can be a fairly daunting
    and complex task. There are a myriad of ways to install a computer
    including installing a set of packages, a set of files (such as from
    a tarball) or even straight bit-for-bit disk imaging. Ultimately,
    however, each one of those installation methods have a number of
    different pieces of common configuration data, such as network
    address settings, mouse and keyboard settings or even file
    partitioning schemes. SysConfig.pm is not a system installer, but
    rather it is an object class with methods which provide a uniform
    way of describing how to install a system. Ultimately you can use
    one of the SysConfig classes such as SysConfig::Kickstart or
    SysConfig::XML which will describe all of the bits of system
    configuration necessary to get an installer up and running.
