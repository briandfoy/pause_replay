I think this is a pretty good idea, but please make sure you check out 
the various modules that implement Newton-Raphson minimization, too.

What I really don't like is "NR" for Newton-Raphson. That could well be 
"Numerical Recipes" - which certainly have something to say about 
optimization :)

May I suggest using slightly more descriptive names like

Math::Opt::Genetic(Algorithms?)
Math::Opt::NewtonRaphson

Math::Opt::Ant seems fine to me.

Please note that I'm just giving advice. One of the PAUSE admins has to 
approve the registration.

Cheers,
Steffen
