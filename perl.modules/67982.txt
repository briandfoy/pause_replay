Subject: Module submission Date::Pcalc

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Pcalc
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: pure-Perl drop-in replacement for Date::Calc
  userid:      STBEY (Steffen Beyer)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org, STBEY@cpan.org

  similar:
    Date::Calc

  rationale:

    Date::Pcalc has been around since 1999/2000, but was never
    officially registered, as it seems. Now that I have updated the
    module to the latest version of Date::Calc (6.0), of which
    Date::Pcalc is a 1:1 pure-Perl drop-in replacement, it seems like a
    good idea to finally apply for the namespace. I hope you don't mind
    the delay. :-) Thank you very much in advance! Best regards, Steffen
    Beyer STBEY@cpan.org

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::Pcalc           Rdphp pure-Perl drop-in replacement for Date::Calc STBEY
