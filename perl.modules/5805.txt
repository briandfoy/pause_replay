Hi,

I'd like to register as a author for CPAN.

name:         Michael Jacob
email:        jacob@j-e-b.net
homepage:     j-e-b.net
preferred ID: JACOB

a short description of what you're planning to contribute: I'm working on 
some source filter modules to allow programmers to shorten some lengthy 
declarations notably. That's nice when you have to force them do that 
lengthy rubish (like parameter checking :-))...

cu
Michael
