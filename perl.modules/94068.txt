Hi Hagen,

Just over six months ago I wrote to you about the chart/Chart namespace =
on CPAN:

Finance::Quant namespace rather than using toplevel package names.

I have transferred ownership of the chart package to CHARTGRP, and =
dropped your permissions for the package entirely.

I realise this is a pain, and I=E2=80=99m sorry that we=E2=80=99ve had =
to remove the permission, but I=E2=80=99m fairly sure it was the right =
way to move forward in an imperfect world. As before, I=E2=80=99m happy =
to help out in any way, with respect to refactoring of Finance-Quant.

Cheers,
Neil
