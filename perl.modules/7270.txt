That should also search section groupings. Or at least list the names
of sections that match and how to then search or list those sections.

Likewise. But if wanting to explore GUI modules I'd be much more likely
to start by clicking on the relevant section link on the front page.

The description of a GUI module should include GUI.

There is (or should be) a by-section tree just like by-module and by-author.

I don't know, but I'm not very convinced.

Thing is, GUI is a too-easy example. There are pleanty of other modules
that cover more than one area of functionality. It would be impractical
to try to put every aspect of the functionality into the module name.
The section groupings in the module list and the module descriptions will
always be needed to provide sufficient information.
