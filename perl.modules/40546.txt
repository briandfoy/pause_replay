     why:

    Three modules, the most immediate a Dynamic Programming Algorithm
    solving the Knapsack problem. This is finished and I want to use it
    to get familiar with the procedure of publishing in CPAN.

    Another is a module Threads::Pipe (or whatever name you suggest)
    mapping (cyclically) a pipe of N "virtual threads" on the P
    available processors on your SMP. This one is finished but being
    tested.

    And a third it is to extend Parse:Yapp "a la RecDescent" with
    autoactions, autotrees, etc. You can see some of the ideas
    (unfortunately in Spanish) in my web notes on Perl
    (http://nereida.deioc.ull.es/~lhp/perlexamples/). The thing is that
    easier to modify the code of Parse:Yapp than to write a module using
    Parse::Yapp. I contacted F. Desamernien one year ago and after his
    initially encouraging answer, I sent to him the "very alpha" code,
    but from then on I haven got any news. I still want to deliver the
    module extensions and so I appreciate any advice you can provide
    about what is an acceptable conduct in cases like this.
