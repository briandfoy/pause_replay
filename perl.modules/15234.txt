Any idea ? I suggest Net::SMTP::Server::Base, not so bad is it ?

Nice, but does it mean I have to make my modules' API backward
compatible with this old one ? This shouldn't be easy, because my API

Actually a single beta version of my module is already uploaded to
CPAN, is it easy to rename it ?

Yes, you're right :)
