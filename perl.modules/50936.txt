Dear Brendan,

we (modules@perl.org) have received an inquiry about the licensing terms 
of one of your modules:

Your DateTime::Cron::Simple module, which you uploaded to CPAN, 
unfortunately lacks an explicit license. It is customary to release 
modules to CPAN under the same terms as Perl itself, but that is not the 
only choice an author has. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to add 
a statement of your module's license to the distribution and 
particularily to the module .pm file. Adding an explicit license (here: 
same terms as perl itself) is as easy as adding the following paragraph 
to your module's documentation:

=head1 COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself, either Perl version 5.6 or,
at your option, any later version of Perl 5 you may have available.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Steffen Müller
