Hi,

I've updated the Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet module for the
current version of the Authorize.Net service.  They've shut down the
interface implemented in the currently-distributed B::OP::AuthorizeNet
module some time ago.  The listed author is Jason Kohles
<jason@mediabang.com>; the web page and email address listed no longer
work.  A google search turs up www.jasonkohles.com, and the
listed addresses www@jasonkohles.com or email@jasonkohles.com; I emailed
and have had no response for several weeks.

My CPAN id is IVAN.  Do you suggest this module be uploaded as
Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet, or
Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet3 ?  (The Authorize.Net interface
version is version 3)

Thanks for your time.
