The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::BaseClass
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Base class with property, flag, and events
  userid:      CORLISS (Arthur Corliss)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows a subclassed module to describe it's properties
    and flags (with each flag optionally tied to an event hander), and
    exposes all of them directly via the AUTOLOAD mechanism. Registered
    event handlers are automatically called with any manipulation of any
    flag in the flag register. It also provides tracking for
    parent<->child relationships and clean destruction of those
    resources.

    In sum, this is really a small & simple module, but having it
    available would increase my code reuse significantly, since many of
    my other modules on CPAN will be using this functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

Object::
