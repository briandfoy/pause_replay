I'm hoping this won't be too controversial.

I've been trying now for 7 (ish) months to get a new incremental release 
of Template Toolkit that has one tiny fix to one test script so that 
Template Toolkit (and thus catalyst, jifty, and any number of other 
applications) will work on Win32. Currently it does not.

I have emailed Andy a number of times over this period, even offering to 
pay for the release. In this time I've received one response in 
September saying the new dev release would be out "in a few weeks".

In more recent times I've gotten no responses, as recently as a week 
ago. He seems to have gone AWOL for a bit.

I've already taken over AppConfig to add Win32-compatibility, and with 
the File::HomeDir upgrades, this all now works perfectly.

So I'd like to request a co-maint bit on Template Toolkit.

My intent is to do an incremental version with ONLY the version change 
and a small change to the tests to allow them to pass properly on Win32.

Otherwise I have no intent to touch the module in any other way, in 
recognition of the importance of this module.

Rather than add it to myself, I would of course like someone from here 
to approve it.

I think at this point I've done all I can to get it fixed by the author.
