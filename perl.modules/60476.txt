     why:

    I plan to contribute several modules for working with digital
    computer tape images (manipulation, mastering, and conversion to
    audio streams for use with real 8 bit computer equipment), and also
    have offered to take over maintenance of Net::Pownce, which the
    original developer no longer has the free time to maintain.
