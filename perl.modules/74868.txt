Greetings,

I'm a Perl-Catalyst application developer and author of Authen::UserVerify and
Catalyst::View::PNGTTGraph. Way back in Feb 2008, I was looking for a chart
generation Catalyst view module and found Catalyst::View::SVGTTGraph. It is a
Catalyst wrapper around the excellent SVG::TT::Graph module.

The only change to it's functionality I needed was to convert the output to
PNG, since SVG wasn't (and still isn't) supported by Internet Explorer. So I
wrote to the author of Catalyst::View::SVGTTGraph discussing whether he wanted
to add this (SVG and other alternate formats) support or we should have a new
module for the job. I recevied no reply even after a couple more mails so I
later released Catalyst::View::PNGTTGraph for the purpose.

Now it's been 5 years since Catalyst::View::SVGTTGraph's initial release. Since
it's a wrapper module, frequent releases would not be necessary unless the
default behaviour of the underlying module changes.  However, the author of
SVG::TT::Graph changed his module to generate Gzip compressed SVG's by default
in version 0.13 and after.

So now web applications using Catalyst::View::SVGTTGraph will face an issue:
The browser will get a gzipped SVG and hence won't render it, unless the
Content-Encoding=gzip header is set. I had reported this bug last week and
submitted a patch, but still not got a reply.

    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65740

I've not been able to contact the author. The CPAN id bounces, and from the
alternate id shot[at]bindstorm.jp I've not got any replies yet. Could you
contact the author or can I co-maintain/take over this?
