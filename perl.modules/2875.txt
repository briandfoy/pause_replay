I was just thinking about this this morning (before I found out there
already was an HTML::Tree module): I don't want to change the name of the
dist, since the name of the dist has been mentioned so often.  So, all
things being equal, I was actually thinking of putting an all-POD module
(i.e., providing no functions) in HTML-Tree, called HTML::Tree, that would
be a roadmap to using HTML-Tree -- since currently TreeBuilder and
Element's POD contents are okay for reference, but offer little in the way
of explanation for the new user, especially one unacquainted with
tree-shaped networks of objects.
That way, good things all around: HTML-Tree would be aptly named; there
would be a module in it called HTML::Tree, from which a description for the
dist could be derived; and people naively typing perldoc HTML::Tree after
installing HTML-Tree would get exactly the introductory information that I
think they need -- a doc that gives an overview of TreeBuilder and Element,
and explains basic concepts.
