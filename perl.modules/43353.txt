Hi,

I got told that this is the correct address to send this to...

I've got a module in CPAN, ldapsh, that requieres Parse::Lex, which in
turn requires (and I believe includes) Parse::Template.  Unfortunately,
Parse::Template has been syntactically broken for something like three
years -- it doesn't pass its own tests and it doesn't even parse.

It's two very small edits to fix the library:  The initial 'use strict'
is missing a semicolon, and one of the variables is not declarated with
a 'my' statement.  Everyone who's talked to me directly about ldapsh has
been able to easily fix the library, but if they never contact me
directly they usually just give up and assume it's a problem with ldapsh
or something.

I've emailed the author of Parse::Lex multiple times in an attempt to
get a new version of the library posted with those errors fixed, but
I've had no luck.  My first email to him was at least 18 months ago, and
was probably further back than that.

There are outstanding bugs addressing these two problems dating back 11
and 6 months, respectively, on rt.cpan.org
(http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=ParseLex, #11807 and #7880).

Is there any way to get a small patch applied to the library and then
post a new minor revision, so people can just use CPAN to install a
working version?

I don't have a patch to fix the library, but it's very easy to find the
problems, and if a patch is required I should be able to make one just
by reinstalling the library.

Thanks,
Luke (loosifer)
