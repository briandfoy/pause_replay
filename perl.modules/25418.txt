V and H stand for Vertical and Horizontal. It's a weird geographic
coordinate system used by phone companies rather than latitude and
longitude. I don't know why they use it, but they do. (I think it had
something to do with mileage calculations being easier, but I don't know
that that's true either)
I might have chosen Archiving and Compression by mistake rather than
Conversion, which is what I intended to choose.
To quote a few definitions of what V+H is:

V & H MILEAGE:

A representation of the vertical and horizontal mileage between two
points based on a geometrically computed approximation of the actual
airline miles between two points. Carriers (Telephone Companies)
normally keep a set of V & H coordinates in the local offices. 

V & H COORDINATES:

The Vertical and horizontal grid points used to determine straight-line
mileage between locations. And this information is normally used for
mileage-sensitive product pricing.

Explains how the system works graphically.
