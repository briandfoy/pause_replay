No procedure but smoke and mirrors (with some reason and trust thrown
in for good measure). In this case it is easy, because the last release is indeed 4
years old. I've made you the owner of XML::Writer for the time being
and hope that David will accept my decision. You can now complete the
"Edit Module Metadata" form on PAUSE for XML::Writer and can make Ed
Avis co-maintainer if he wants.
