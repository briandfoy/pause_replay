Subject: Module submission Rose::DB::Object

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rose::DB::Object
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Extensible, high performance RDBMS-OO mapper
  userid:      JSIRACUSA (John Siracusa)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, perlmonks

  similar:
    Class::DBI DBIx::Class Class::DBI::Sweet Alzabo Tangram

  rationale:

    Rose::DB::Object is an RDBMS-OO mapper. That's a well-known thing,
    so let's move on to the real issue: why Rose::*?

    Rose is the "brand name" for an in-progress web application
    construction kit. Pieces that are useful in isolation have been
    separated out, but are still within the Rose:: namespace because
    they all build on, and depend on each other. For example,
    Rose::DB::Object requires Rose::DB which requires
    Rose::DateTime::Util and Rose::Object.

    When all the pieces are released, it will be even more clear how
    they work together as a coherent whole. I didn't plan on trying to
    "register" any of the Rose modules until then, but apparently I
    can't edit their metadata and get them categorized on
    search.cpan.org unless I register them. So I'd like to start
    registering them now.

The resulting entry would be:

Rose::DB::
