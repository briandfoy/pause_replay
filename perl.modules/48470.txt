Subject: Module submission Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: DBIx::Class model for Catalyst
  userid:      MSTROUT (Matt S Trout)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    catalyst and dbix-class mailing lists and IRC channels

  similar:
    Catalyst::Model::DBIC and ::DBIC::Plain

  rationale:

    Requesting registration as part of the planned Catalyst namespace
    cleanup since the original author is too busy with work to maintain
    the module.

    The similar modules mentioned above are both direct ports of
    Class::DBI models and are deprecated by this module, which is
    explicitly designed for DBIx::Class

  enteredby:   MSTROUT (Matt S Trout)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 26 16:10:52 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::Model::DBIC::
::Schema          RmpOp DBIx::Class model for Catalyst               MSTROUT
