Subject: Module submission Time::Clock

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Clock
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Twenty-four hour clock object
  userid:      JSIRACUSA (John Siracusa)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I needed an object representation of a TIME column for use with
    Rose::DB::Object. Time columns have no concept of date, so all of
    the existing Time::* CPAN modules which do deal with dates were
    inappropriate. Time::Clock represents a time only, and does so to
    nanosecond precision (which is also required by some databases' TIME
    data types).

  enteredby:   JSIRACUSA (John Siracusa)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 30 18:11:57 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::Clock           bdpOp Twenty-four hour clock object                JSIRACUSA
