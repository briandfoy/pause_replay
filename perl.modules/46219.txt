Abe,

   I've tried reaching you before about the status of the Net::ParseWhois 
module but with no success. So I'm sending this anew as well as to 
modules@perl.org.

   The copy of Net::ParseWhois on CPAN hasn't been updated for many 
years. I've done a lot of updates and fixes in the past month and restored 
pretty much all the functionality of the module, as well as added some new 
registrars. I'd be more than happy to provide all the modified source to 
you so it can be integrated with the module.

   Otherwise, if you are no longer available or don't have time for the 
module, I'd like to volunteer to adopt the project. Please let me know. 
Thanks for your time!

Usually, this works is to send mails to the author of the module and a copy to 
this list. Also, using the request tracker at rt.cpan.org is a good idea. Once 
the author hasn't answered for several weeks, one of the CPAN (or PAUSE?) 
admins can change ownership.
