My group recently agreed, unanimously to transfer twenty-five million,five hundred thousand United States dollars only ( US$25.5m)into a foreign based account for our personal use and benefits and I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues on board to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$25.5mlegally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.
