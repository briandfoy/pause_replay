The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lyrics::Fetcher::Google
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: Uses google to fetch song lyrics
  userid:      NEBULOUS (John Lifsey)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lyrics::Fetcher::LyricsOnDemand Lyrics::Fetcher::LyricsNet
    Lyrics::Fetcher::AstraWeb Lyrics::Fetcher::LyricsTime

  rationale:

    Originally designed this as going in the www space, but adapted it
    to fit with the Lyrics::Fetcher module since there were already a
    couple different methods under that.

  enteredby:   NEBULOUS (John Lifsey)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb  4 15:09:54 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lyrics::Fetcher::
::Google          adpfg Uses google to fetch song lyrics             NEBULOUS
