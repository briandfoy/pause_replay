Request to register new user

     why:

    Hello, We recently used PERL to implement a two-way excel
    conversion routine where we used a module for reading Excel 2007
    from CPANs site. This seems to have a minor problem that our
    application would want to have fixed - the author's notes on the
    "View/Report Bugs" page suggest creating a PAUSE account to proceed
    - hence the request.

    If you could oblige, I would truly appreciate it!

    Leon
