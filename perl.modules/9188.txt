Hello everyone,

I'm trying to cycle through a list of servers using Net::Telnet and run
some commands.  My problem is this:  half the servers use one pair of
username/password's and the other half use a different pair of username
and password's.  My question:  how can I get my code to default to a second
pair of username/password's if the first set fails.  I am trying to use the
following:

   $prev = $t->errmode("return");
   $t->login($first_user_name, $first_password) or print "Login failed:
         @{[ $t->errmsg() ]}\n";
   $t->waitfor(String => 'login: ', Timeout => 30);
   $t->login($second_user, $second_password) or print "Login failed:
        @{[ $t->errmsg() ]}\n";

The above does not seem to work.  The second login attempt yields the
errmsg:   Logging failed: Timed-out waiting for the login prompt.  What I
can't
understand is (login: ) is the login prompt (yet it still doesn't work).
I'm using the
dump_log method ($fh = $t->dump_log($logfile)) to verify that 'login: ' is
the
correct prompt.

I've also tried using Match but it yields no success:
 ex: $t->waitfor(Match => '/login:\W*/i').

Am I using the waitfor call incorrectly?  Does someone know of a better way
to accomplish what I'm trying to do?

Any help/direction would be very much appreciated.

 Thanks

 Chris
