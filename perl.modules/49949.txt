I have no plans to add further QuickTime related modules so
Video::Quicktime::* is less attractive particularly given the Quicktime
format already seems moderately well served by the Video::Info::* namespace
and Video::OpenQuicktime.

I can imagine that other's may add modules to a Video::Dumper::* namespace
however which may add weight to the argument for Video::Dumper::Quicktime.
