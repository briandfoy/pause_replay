hi there,

  i wrote a thin perl wrapper aournd the /dev/phone API used by quicknet
telephony cards. i named it Phone.pm and would like to submit it to CPAN as
well and thus become a PAUSE developer. 

my Phone.pm module can be downloaded from http://mond.at/perl

DSLI:  adcO

eventually i would also like to develop some H323 stuff for perl. maybe a
Phone:: hirarchy would be nice.. the linux telephony thing is really taking
off. people could write interfaces for cellphones, sms, PBX-access there
etc.. maybe then i should name the module Phone::dev.pm or Phone::ixj.pm or
something like this.

prefered user-ID: MOND

my email: schaefer@mond.at

greetings,

   franz.
