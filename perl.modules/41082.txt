Who-licks-the-ass-of-its-admin?

I say. The module list is... well... just a list. It has some extra 
metadata, and being on it at least means the module (in namespace terms 
at least) has been checked by SOMEBODY, but that's about it.

I've got about 75 CPAN dists, and after a couple of failed attempts 
_years_ ago, I've never really felt the need to get them on the module list.

It has no real impact on a day to day basis that I'm aware of. As long 
as the modules are indexed and I get the namespace first, I couldn't 
care less.

And for the record, I get MORE suspicious when people submitting modules 
start acting all high faluting or gushing praises.

If they ask for help, or are nervous about their choice of namespace 
(more common than you might think for first timers) we help with advice.

That's about it really.
