     why:

    I've been working on a module to do algebraic (symbolic)
    differentiation. It can be found at:-

    http://www.jwcs.net/~jonathan/perl/Calculus.pm.txt

    At the moment. I've already been informed that it needs a good
    re-write before it is up to going on the module list, but have been
    advised I should put up early versions as well.

    Hopefully in the future I'll be able to contribute or help with
    other modules too. :-)
