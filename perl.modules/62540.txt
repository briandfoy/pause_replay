The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Query
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: jQuery−like queries for HTML::Element
  userid:      ABW (Andy Wardley)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    In my kitchen. Although I was talking to the coffee machine so I'm
    not sure if that counts.

  similar:
    pQuery - similar goals, different approach

  rationale:

    This module sits alongside HTML::Element (and HTML::Tree modules in
    general) and provides a simple query mechanism.

    It does not include any pictures of cats, nor does it have any
    bacon taped to the side of it. But that can be arranged if you think
    it would make it more popular on the Internetz.

  enteredby:   ABW (Andy Wardley)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct  7 16:41:06 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Query           bdpOp jQuery−like queries for HTML::Element        ABW
