Hello,

I have tried to contact the author of the Fortran::Namelist module but his
email is not longer valid. I have not seen any signs of progress in a long
time, so I wrote the module and I would like to upload and register it under
my name .
I would like to know what is the appropriate procedure for this.

Thanks.
