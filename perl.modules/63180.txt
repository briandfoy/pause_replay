The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::Detect::CJK
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: detect charset of EastAsia string
  userid:      FOOLFISH (錢宇/Qian Yu)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Encode::Detect

  rationale:

    This module is used to detect charset(encoding) for any binary
    string,optimized for web text and EastAsia( Chinese ,Japan,Korea)
    language. The accuracy is up to 99.94% much better than
    Encode::Detect in EasyAsia language.

    It has been published as CharsetDetector
    (http://search.cpan.org/~foolfish/CharsetDetector-1.0.0/) for two
    years,works perfectly well.

    As it was not well named and document is poor,I want to rewrite the
    document and re-publish it as new name "Encode::Detect::CJK"

    Thanks very much

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::Detect::
::CJK             Mdpfp detect charset of EastAsia string            FOOLFISH
