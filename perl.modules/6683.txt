The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::HTML2Results
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Parses arbitrary html to an array of arrays
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://cpan.spack.net

  similar:
    none I know of that are really this easy to use

  rationale:

    Very nice for sort of screen scraping. Can take a page like this

    http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/all_time_stats/rosters/american_league/bal/1970_bat_avg.html

    or

    http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?group=conference

    or

    http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=tyc+aol+tenf+orcl+msft+intc+witc+jdsu+t+a&d=v1

    or soon this

    http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=tyc+aol+tenf+orcl+msft+intc+witc+jdsu+t+a&d=t

    or say an inbox page from Yahoo! or hotmail or wherever,

    and return an array of arrays of the data set you request. Requests
    can be made based on number of columns in said set.

    Should pretty well solve parsing problems for most anything that
    can be mapped to an array of arrays.

  enteredby:   EARL (Earl Cahill)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 23 20:16:29 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::HTML2Results    adpOp Parses arbitrary html to an array of arrays  EARL
