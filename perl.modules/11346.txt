I have since realised that I should have mentioned 
  Text::Fillin
  Text::SimpleTemplate
  Text::FastTemplate 
  Text::Template
  Text::Substitute
  Text::ScriptTemplate

All the above modules (except ::Substitute that appears not to
exist) use their own syntax - they don't just implement the Perl
interpolation syntax.  This means users have to learn another syntax.

Seeing all the similar modules are in Text:: perhaps this one should
be too.

Actually I think it would make more sense if all the above templating
modules were gathered under Text::Template,

  Text::Fillin          -> Text::Template::Fillin
  Text::SimpleTemplate  -> Text::Template::Simple
  Text::FastTemplate    -> Text::Template::Fast
  Text::Template        -> (no change)
  Text::Substitute      -> (seems not to exist)
  Text::ScriptTemplate  -> Text::Template::Script
  String::Interpolate   -> Text::Template::PerlInterpolate
 
Could someone please comment on this?
