Hi. I'd like to register for a CPAN user ID.  Here's the relevant info. Best 
Regards,

--Rhet

your name:  Rhet Turnbull

your email address:   rhettbull@hotmail.com

your homepage if you have one:  http://rhet.turnbull.net

your preferred user-ID on CPAN:  RHETTBULL

a short description of what you're planning to contribute:
Win32:: module(s) for raw IO access.  Includes a Win32 kernel mode driver 
for access to raw memory (e.g. peek and poke) as well as port access (e.g. 
raw I/O with the parallel port).  Code is currently in use to control 
stepper motors, etc.  Will make a nice complement to Win32::SerialPort, etc.
