This will never work.  The indexer (just like ExtUtils::MakeMaker and 
Module::Build) uses a regex to extract the $VERSION assignment itself 
and executes only that code snippet (with no external code called at 
all).  There is no way that this module's $VERSION will be anything 
except 'undef'.

Moreover, it is bad design to make one module's $VERSION depend on some 
other module, or other external value.  For the reasoning, you only have 
to see that any module that has an interpreted $VERSION will report only 
the current value of the module it depends on.  I was bitten by this 
myself before I Saw The Light, when I upgraded the "parent" and the 
matching "child" module wasn't upgraded because the existing installed 
version "looked up to date."

I would urge you to install PPI::PowerToys to do all of your mass 
$VERSION updating, but Adam has released another broken version to CPAN 
without full $VERSION support.  I'm going to go off and write him a 
nastygram urging that he stop being so silly and just apply my patch to 
support _all_ normal $VERSION assignments... ;-0
