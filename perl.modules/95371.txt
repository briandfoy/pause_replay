Hi Manish,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

You have ownership of the package name =E2=80=9Cbest=E2=80=9D namespace, =
and have a =E2=80=9Cbest=E2=80=9D module as part of your =E2=80=9Cmanish-d=
b=E2=80=9D release. But the best module appears to be accidentally =
included in the release, given it=E2=80=99s location and contents:
    https://metacpan.org/source/HUGHES/manish-db/best.pm
This is conflicting with the =E2=80=9CBest=E2=80=9D module, which is =
part of the =E2=80=9CBest=E2=80=9D distribution: =
G/GA/GAAL/Best-0.15.tar.gz

Similarly, the manish-db distribution contains a module =E2=80=9CMyTest=E2=
=80=9D, which is conflicting with =E2=80=9CMytest=E2=80=9D, owned by =
user STELLAR.

Given that the rest of the release isn=E2=80=99t indexed, and isn=E2=80=99=
t structured as expected for a CPAN release, I=E2=80=99m going to drop =
your permissions on the =E2=80=9Cbest=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CMyTest=E2=80=9D=
 package names. If you want to know more, or would like help on this, =
please let me know. If you=E2=80=99re no longer interested in the =
release being on CPAN, just let me know and I=E2=80=99ll schedule its =
removal from CPAN entirely (which I suspect is the right course of =
action).

Cheers,
Neil
