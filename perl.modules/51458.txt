The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Auth::Auto
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Auto cookie for CGI::Auth::check(), more.
  userid:      LEOCHARRE (Leo Charre)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    perlmonks, newsgroups

  similar:
    CGI::Auth

  rationale:

    CGI::Auth is a nice tool, it's a bit of a drop in
    authorization/securing mechanism for cgi scripts. A basic thing that
    CGI::Auth leaves to the developer is how to keep track of the
    authorization once it is granted.

    This automatically creates a cookie when an authorization is
    granted. So that a developer could simple plug in an implementation
    at the top of the cgi and forget about the rest of the code.

    I presently use CGI::Auth::Auto across applications that I want to
    secure.

    Something nice about this module is that the interface is the same
    as with CGI::Auth, if someone currently uses it, they can have the
    auto session id tracking mechanism without changing much of their
    code.

    The namespace choice. I want CGI::Auth::Auto to be automatic. That
    is, you drop into the top of a cgi and it secures, authorizes,
    prompts.. etc. The only thing it does not do yet is give a
    cgi_session object automatically. That comes later or in another
    extension of CGI::Auth.

    This module makes life a *lot* easier for me whilst developing
    secured web applications for clients.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Auth::
::Auto            bdpOp Auto cookie for CGI::Auth::check(), more.    LEOCHARRE
