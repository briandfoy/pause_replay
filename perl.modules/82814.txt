Hi Jim,

sorry in the delay in getting back to you.

modules@perl.org is really purely an administrative list for dealing 
with namespace-permission matters and other PAUSE administrative things. 
We occasionally still give feedback to new authors on module naming, but 
using the module-authors mailing list instead is better for that.

In order to contact the author/maintainer of a particular contribution 
to CPAN, I would suggest checking the distribution of contact 
information or the metacpan.org page for the given author. Additionally, 
applying a healthy dose of Google usually doesn't hurt. :)

The main point is that it's highly unlikely that the author of the 
particular module you're looking at is reading modules@perl.org.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
