The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::SPC
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Calculations for Statistical Process Control
  userid:      EMORISSE (Erich Morisse)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)

  rationale:

    Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a method of calculating error
    thresholds of normally distributed data from historical data. It has
    been used in manufacturing for a long time to tell whether a
    particular process is in control, and is now starting to be used in
    software development, IT infrastructure monitoring, etc.

    I was not able to locate any modules related to creating these
    calculations.

    I chose Statistics:: as a root because while SPC more a use of
    stats than a set of functions, it is a statistical discipline.

    For some descriptions of SPC in use, please see any of the
    following:

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic_Process_Control
    http://www.sei.cmu.edu/str/descriptions/spc.html
    http://www.goldpractices.com/practices/spc/index.php
    http://www.morisse.com/spc/

    or some more detailed example of use SPC in software development,
    if you happen to have an IEEE membership:
    http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/52/26915/01196321.pdf

The resulting entry would be:
