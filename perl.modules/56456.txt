Hi Lincoln,

I'm removing it from the deletion list. The reason it got on there was
because the distribution doesn't actually include an
lib/Openview/Message.pm file with the corresponding "package
Openview::Message;" statement. That's the reason clicking on the
search.cpan.org "Registered Modules" link on your author page will yield
a "no matches" error page. It's also not installable as "cpan
Openview::Message".

Whether or not you want to change that is up to you. You keep the
namespace registration regardless.

Best regards,
Steffen
