The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sort::ArrayOfArrays
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: sort an array of arrays by arbitrary methods
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)

  similar:
    none I've seen for an array or arrays

  rationale:

    Was written to help make html pages displaying data, where column
    headers could be clicked to sort on the respective columns. Headers
    can be clicked twice to reverse the sort. A couple of simple
    conventions are used.

    1. To sort on column 1, column 4 reversed and column 0 reversed,
    simple pass the structure, the string '1,-4,-0' and any special sort
    methods. Returned is the sorted structure.

    2. For each column, a different sort method may be used. The
    default is 'aa', and I try to intelligently figure out if I should
    switch to 'na' on the fly. A code ref may also be passed for each
    column for a special sort, though there are a couple of tricks that
    circumvent the need for passing a code ref.

    'na' - numerical sort ascending, 'nd' - numerical sort descending,
    'aa' - ascii sort ascending, 'ad' - ascii sort descending, 'ra' -
    regex sort ascending, 'rd' - regex sort descending, 'la' - link sort
    ascending, 'ld' - link sort descending,

    For the regex sort, a regex is passed, with parens around the chunk
    to sort on. For example, I needed to sort on a column with either
    the line a script was on (85), or a range of lines (23 to 72). The
    regex I passed for the respective column was /^(\d+)/, which would
    get the number that started the cell and sort accordingly.

    The link sorts are just wrappers around the regex sort with the
    regex being @^<a\s+href.+?>(.+?)</a>@.

    Made doing "ORDER BY" functionality for some sql stuff I may later
    open source near trivial. Will be used for soon to be released
    Data::html2results and Data::results2html if I can ever figure out
    where to put them. Descriptions of these modules are here

    if you have ideas for a good namespace suggestion, I would like to
    hear it. The Data maintainer thinks they belong somewhere else,
    though I don't really know where.

    Module is very easy to use, and I think very useful.

    Thanks, Earl
