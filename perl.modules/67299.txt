(Please keep my CC'ed in your replies, I'm not subscribed to the
modules@ mailing list)

On #perl6 we're currently discussing the problem of distributing Perl 6
modules, and let me also say that we have real need for it; we have
about 30 Perl 6 modules that a provisional installer [1] can handle,
numbers rising.

We'd like to use parts of the CPAN infrastructure for module
distribution. This is my current vision, optimized for being simple and
being the least work for the fine CPAN folk:

1) Module authors upload Perl 6 modules via PAUSE.

2) The uploaded modules have a flag in their META.yml marking them as
Perl 6. The indexer ignores such modules, so that they don't appear in
modules/02packages.details.txt.gz or modules/03modlist.data.gz  (in
order not to disrupt the work flow of anything that deals with Perl 5
modules

3) A new list is being created that contains all Perl 6 modules

4) I (or somebody I can motivate) will write  a searching interface for
Perl 6 modules similar to search.cpan.org

5) We'll teach our provisional installer how to download modules from CPAN.


So my questions are:

1) is this the right place to discuss? if not, where should I go?

2) does it sound sane? Do you see things that need to be different, or
that could be even simpler?

3) do the responsible parties agree to such a scheme?

4) whom do I need to contact about what? For example PAUSE will surely
need some small changes - is the source code somewhere available so that
I can try to contribute patches?

Thanks for your attention and answers,
Moritz
