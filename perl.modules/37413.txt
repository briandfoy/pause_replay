The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Number::Delta
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Test absolute difference between numbers
  userid:      DAGOLDEN (David Golden)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org -- under the prior submission Test::Float

  similar:

  rationale:

    Rationale for namespace has been extensively discussed on
    modules@perl.org.

    Rationale for module is as follows:

    Most programmers at one time or another are confronted with the
    issue of comparing floating-point numbers for equality. The
    canonical idiom is to test if the absolute value of the difference
    of the numbers is within a desired precision. This module provides
    such a function for use with Test::Harness. Usage is similar to
    other test functions described in Test::More. Semantically, the
    "delta_within" function replaces this kind of construct:

    ok ( abs($p - $q) <= $precision, â$p is equal to $qâ ) or diag
    "$p is not equal to $q to within $precision";

    While thereâs nothing wrong with that construct, itâs a pain to
    type it repeatedly in a test script. This module does the same thing
    with a single function call. The "delta_ok" function is similar, but
    uses a global default precision so even the precision need not be
    specified repeatedly.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Number::
