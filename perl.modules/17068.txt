Hmm...

I've not run into this before, and I don't know what CPAN is thinking, but 
the
way I see it is that (at least numerically) 1.0 > 0.009. Since 1.0 is the 
latest
version, I don't see anything I'd consider 'retrograde' about the release
order and version numbering of the Perl Shell (psh).

A quick scan of some google results on "retrograde" shows you pointing
out things I do see as retrograde, such as moving from 0.8 to 0.11 (since
0.11 < 0.8):

 
http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-01/msg00036.html

If you can help me identify the way in which I've sinned in releasing 
psh-1.0
as the version to replace psh-0.009, I'd be happy to take appropriate 
remedial
action (I did a quick grep for leftover references to 0.009 in the code, 
but didn't
find any...).


Regards,

psh-0.009.tar.gz and psh-1.0.tar.gz have "version retrograde" problems
which cause CPAN.pm to want to install first one, then the other.

Please delete the older version from CPAN, or release a new version
that supercedes them both.
