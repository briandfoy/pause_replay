Hi again Alexey,

Have you had a chance to look at this and think about which approach =
you=E2=80=99d like to take?

In addition to the suggestions above, you could just =E2=80=9Chide=E2=80=9D=
 the Text package from PAUSE, by changing the line:

    package Text;

to

    package
        Text;

Then I could drop your permissions on the Text namespace.

Cheers,
Neil
