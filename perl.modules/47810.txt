OK, I'll keep it in mind.

OK.

That's OK. My problem was that the module had a critical issue and was not 
corrected to fix the problem, despite the fact that a bug and a patch (by me) 
were placed in the Request Tracker of the module. Today, the author uploaded 
a new and corrected version, which fixes the problem. That was not the case 
over a month ago when I first contacted modules@perl.org.
