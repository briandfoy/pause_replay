That's been standard for as long as I can remember - the first cc to
modules@ is what starts the clock to 'when can I ask for forced adoption?'

I've been arranging such things for over half a decade now and basically we'll
let it slide that people didn't if it's a clear cut case, but it's strongly
recommended.

Right. Please do remember to do so in future.

I'm probably coming across as being more of a hard-ass about this than I
actually want to, but it's really annoying having to punt granting your
request because I had to cross the i's and dot the t's for you when what
I really wanted to do was click the 'add co-maint' button. Please take my
frustration in that light and my apologies if I've not made that clear.
