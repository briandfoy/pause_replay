The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Comparator
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: contains general tools to transform, merge,
  userid:      CORNELIS (Hugo Cornelis)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::More

  rationale:

    These modules do intelligent things with nested perl data
    structures. The transformation engine is a general simple
    transformation engine and can run in a selective mode or a
    constructive mode. In the selective mode, it behaves like a database
    query engine. In the constructive mode it constructs a result based
    on the structure of the original data. Transformations can be
    cascaded. The merger also deals with general nested perl data
    structures. The Comparator generates structured differences that
    mirror the structure of the compared data structures.

  enteredby:   CORNELIS (Hugo Cornelis)

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Comparator      cdphp contains general tools to transform, merge,  CORNELIS
