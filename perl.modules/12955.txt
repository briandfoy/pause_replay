The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       StateMachine::Gestinanna
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: provide context & state machine for wizards
  userid:      JSMITH (James G Smith)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    modperl@perl.apache.org

  similar:
    POE, Wizard

  rationale:

    StateMachine::Gestinanna is designed to make creation of web-based
    wizards almost trivial without any preconcieved notions of how the
    interface is implemented (html, xml, gui, ...). The module supports
    inheritance of state information and methods so classes of wizards
    may be created. This module doesn't itself drive the application.
    The application uses it as a consultant to figure out what to do
    next.

    This module is used by but does not require the Gestiannna web
    application framework, thus its name. Feel free to suggest a
    different, perhaps more-descriptive name.

    The StateMachine namespace is needed because there is no good fit
    elsewhere, and the module does implement the core of a statemachine
    (though it is driven by the app instead of it driving the app, at
    some level).

The resulting entry would be:

StateMachine::
