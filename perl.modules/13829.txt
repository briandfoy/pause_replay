The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Quicktime::Info::MOOV
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Extract meta info from Quicktime movie files
  userid:      SHOGE (W. Scott Hoge)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Video::Info, RIFF::Info, Image::Info

  rationale:

    This module is designed to give fast, OS independent, access to the
    meta (header) information in Quicktime Movie files.

    The motivation for the development of this module was to aid in
    thumbnail generation for HTML index files. Thus, only a limited
    amount of information from is returned. This includes: + the
    height/width (in pixels) of the movie in 'Normal' display mode + the
    length (in seconds) of the movie, + the features (sample rate, bits
    per sample) of the audio track (if any), + and most significantly,
    the extraction of the preview PICT image (if any).

    The code is based on the module template provided by the
    Image::Info package.

    As for the name space choice, it follows the RIFF::Info model.
    Plans are in place to include access to this new modules from
    Video::Info. The motivation for the root 'Quicktime' is that it
    should be easy to expand the module to include Quicktime::Info::QTIF
    for the Apple Quicktime Image Format, as the header infomation
    format is similar.

    Suggestions for other namespace locations are welcome.
