Hi Paul,

I approved those of your Math::Business::* requests which have somewhat 
descriptive names after the last double colon.

Math::Business::RSI    Relative Strength Index
Math::Business::ATR    Average True Range 
Math::Business::DMI     Directional Movement Index (aka ADX)

However, I'd suggest spelling those three letter abbreviations out. 
There's nothing wrong with long-ish namespaces if they are a win in 
terms of descriptiveness.

So I'd suggest:

Math::Business::RelativeStrengthIndex
Math::Business::AverageTrueRange 
Math::Business::DirectionalMovementIndex

Though maybe -- just maybe -- the names also make sense without the 
"Index" suffix.

If you entirely insist on the abbreviations, because they're widely 
understood by the financial people, I'd also approve those for you 
(unless brian objects more strongly).

Cheers,
Steffen
