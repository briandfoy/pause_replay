This was my first idea when I read this thread. It was my first idea
too, when the first user came across whose name didn't look like a
person's name. And it is the reason we allowed Eryq, Abigail, and Tels
to register and later

ASTEAM     "ActiveState development team <dev@ActiveState.com>"

Basically, we don't care, but we do not support it. People may change
their names, companies may change their names and we have a form for
that. But if they believe their ID must match their name, we have no
form to submit. So they can request the new name, let the permissions
for uploading for their portfolio of namespaces change, and upload
their next uploads to the new ID.

What you probably really want is a mailinglist ID and an association
of the modules with the mailing list as the contact address. Mailing
lists have an ID but no directory, like

LWP               RmpO Libwww-perl                                  LWWWP
LWP::
::Conn            ampO LWPng stuff                                  LWWWP
::MediaTypes      Rmpf Media types and mailcap processing           LWWWP
::Parallel        RmpO Allows parallel http, https and ftp access   MARCLANG
::Protocol        RmpO LWP support for URL schemes (http, file etc) LWWWP
::RobotUA         RmpO A UserAgent for robot applications           LWWWP
::Simple          Rmpf Simple procedural interface to libwww-perl   LWWWP
::UA              ampO LWPng stuff                                  LWWWP
::UserAgent       RmpO A WWW UserAgent class                        LWWWP

The concept is old and still supported but it didn't really fly.
