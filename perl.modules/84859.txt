The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LightWaveRF
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Integration with LightWaveRF modules
  userid:      GRIM (Graeme Lawton)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    X10::Home

  rationale:

    LightWaveRF is a home automation system used to control various
    devices around the home. For more information see
    http://www.lightwaverf.com/.

    I've no particular requirement to put this in a root namespace but
    I'm not really sure where it should go otherwise. Net::LightWaveRF
    is perhaps an option? I'm happy to move it to any namespace you
    thing suits.

    The similarity to X10::Home isn't huge as obviously X10 is a
    protocol in its own right rather than a series of devices but you
    get the idea.

The resulting entry would be:
