See https://metacpan.org/release/App-perlbrew.

You could, say, install Perl V 5.18.4 or 5.14.4 and test under them, to 
refine prereqs. I love perlbrew, but I confess I rarely test under an 
older version. Recall the 5.*.$odd are dev versions and the 5.*.$even 
are prod versions. I run 5.20.2 and am waiting for 5.24.2. Just run:

perlbrew help
perlbrew available
perlbrew list

To get oriented.
