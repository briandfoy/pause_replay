The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Expect::Angel
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Build up a robust connection to your DUT
  userid:      MINGZHANG (ming zhang)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Angel is built on Expect.pm module, but hides the complexity of it.
    With Angel.pm one can easily build an object-oriented module that
    meets a specific need with the most useful methods inherited from
    Angel.

    Angel is just like a messenger between the testing machine, where
    everyting is perfect like heaven, and DUT (device under test), where
    exists right and wrong like earth. The messenger must tolerate the
    errors and disasters occuring on DUT and faithful deliver
    information to and from the DUT.

  enteredby:   MINGZHANG (ming zhang)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar  4 01:38:39 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Expect::
::Angel           bdpOp Build up a robust connection to your DUT     MINGZHANG
