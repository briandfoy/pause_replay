Hi Perl module people,

I'd like an ID for PAUSE, please.

My name:           Brendan Quinn
My email address:  brendan@clueful.com.au
My home page:      http://www.clueful.com.au/brendan/
Preferred user ID: BQUINN

What I'm planning to contribute:

News::NewsML, a module that subclasses XML::DOM to read and write files 
in the open NewsML standard for the syndication and distribution of news 
content (articles, images, PDFs, video, etc), created by the 
International Press Telecommunications Council (http://www.iptc.org)

FWIW I have no relationship with IPTC, I just saw the standard, thought 
it was cool so I wrote the module :-)

I'm considering writing some related modules, eg News::SportsML 
(currently being designed by IPTC), News::NITF (another news markup 
language), possibly News::Syndication::ICE -- hence the News:: prefix. I 
figured it wouldn't clash with Usenet modules as they use NNTP:: as 
their prefix. Please let me know if you have any better ideas.

Regards.

Brendan.
