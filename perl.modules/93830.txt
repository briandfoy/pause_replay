Hi

I take it no-one had time to read the thread
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=85686
to see the author of this module has not responded to bug reports going 
back to at least May 2013, so I've made myself co-maint.

I'll fix the pod errors and put the module on github.

I'm not guaranteeing to fix all or even any other of its bugs, but of 
course I'll gladly accept patches.
