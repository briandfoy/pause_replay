      <pre wrap="">Hi Roman,

I’m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I’m working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now considered the same.

You have ownership of the “Mt” namespace on PAUSE. This module is no longer on CPAN, but your ownership of the namespace conflicts with SHERZODR’s ownership of the “MT” module, which is on CPAN, indexed as part of the Net-MovableType distribution.

To resolve this conflict, I’d like to drop your permissions on the “Mt” namespace. From looking at your releases, I don’t think this will cause any problems, but wanted to check with you. Are you ok with this?

PAUSE will no longer let situations like this occur, so I’m cleaning up historical cases like yours.

Cheers,
Neil
