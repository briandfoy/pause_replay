I would suggest a different syntax for that functionality, which I think
has several advantages.  Something like this:

use alias qw(Really::Long::Package::Name Name);

which would require Really/Long/Package/Name.pm, call its import function,
and then alias Name to the long package name.

Most of my objections to your module come from the wildcard inclusion of
arbitrary modules from a directory.  Although my proposal would mean a use
statement for each module to include, it would still save you from the long
package names in the rest of the program.  It also forces you to explicitly
name the modules, which I think is good, and it allows you to specify
arbitrary aliases for the packages, so that you don't have to worry about
clobbering packages that share the same rightmost part.
