The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shell::POSIX
  DSLIP:       cmpOa
  description: a posix command language interpreter
  userid:      PARDUS (Jaap Karssenberg)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    both mailing list and cvs -
    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/zoidberg/>

  similar:

  rationale:

    We (myself and RLZWART) are currently working on a posix command
    language interpreter module. It should be able to parse and execute
    shell (bash/sh) scripts following the posix standard for the shell
    command language. Possibly there will be subclasses for several
    language extensions, like those implemented by bash. We try to
    follow the posix 1003.1-2001 standard as closely as possible, not
    only in the parsing of script syntax, but also in the implementation
    of pipelines and jobs.

    This module would provide a compatibility layer, allowing perl
    programs to interact and use shell scripts, and creating bindings
    between the perl and shell script languages. One could for example
    make the "export" built-in in a shell script export variables to the
    perl program sourcing it. The use of this module while creating a
    shell like perl program should be obvious.

    Although there are some perl shell projects, none of them supplies
    real compatibility with shell script. This module is being developed
    within the Zoidberg project to create a general purpose perl shell,
    but it's interface will be independent of this project. It should be
    perfectly useable for other shell projects or interactive programs.

    The Shell::POSIX namespace seems logical to me for a implementation
    of a posix command language interpreter and AFAIK there isn't yet a
    module which is able to run shell script natively. Also I believe it
    provides a functionality with a general use, so it belongs in the
    module list.

The resulting entry would be:
