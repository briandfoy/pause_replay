The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WIS
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Web information system - components
  userid:      MILSO (Milan Sorm)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    With my friend Darena we want to build component based system for
    building web information system - WIS:: namespace. We try this in
    some modules and out idea works. I can compare this idea with
    Borland's Turbo Vision components for building nice IDEs in DOS many
    years later - but now for web. Object-oriented of course. Many
    modules (now tens, but early hundreds) in new namespaces WIS::.
    Thank you for registering.
