As you=E2=80=99re suggesting, you should change the name of the =
distribution to HTML-Formatter. This will resolve your problem with =
PAUSE, and for most tools things will just work.

You have existing open issues in the HTML-Format bug queue in RT. After =
you=E2=80=99ve released with the new dist name, you could email the RT =
support address and ask them to do some behind-the-scenes to rename the =
queue to the new dist name.

Cheers,
Neil
