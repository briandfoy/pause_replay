The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::XMLHelp
  DSLIP:       Rdpfn
  description: Simple Tk help menu system based on XML
  userid:      BAGARRE (David M Ros)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    No where yet.

  similar:
    Tk::Help

  rationale:

    Tk::XMLHelp is a little misleading as it provides no help in using
    XML in Tk but I couldnt think of a better name as Tk::Help is being
    used.

    It's inspired by Tk::Help but much more usable as your content is
    stored in an XML document, you can nest topics as deep as you like,
    control formatting (a little) and include images in your text.

  enteredby:   BAGARRE (David M Ros)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar 23 17:56:01 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::XMLHelp         Rdpfn Simple Tk help menu system based on XML      BAGARRE
