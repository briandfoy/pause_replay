     why:

    I would like to adopt the abandoned name space: String::LCSS, and
    provide a pure perl module that actually works and finds either
    Longest Common SubSequence r the Longest Common SubString.

    The code currently in name space: String::LCSS, finds neither and
    has not for more than 7 years.
