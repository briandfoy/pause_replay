The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Wireframe::2D::Vector2D
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Implements 2D Vector objects
  userid:      CECALA (Russell B Cecala)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?lastnode_id=481&node_id=143718

  similar:
    Math::VectorReal

  rationale:

    Vector2D is based on Leendert Ammeraal's VEC.CPP as presented in
    his book 'Programming Principles in Computer Graphics'. I feel many
    might find it easy to use and useful for writting "wireframe" 2D
    video games. I demonstrate how to use Vector2D in the script
    LunarLander.pl.

    I am new to PAUSE and you probably know better than I what would be
    a good name space.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Wireframe::2D::
::Vector2D        bdpOp Implements 2D Vector objects                 CECALA
