I'd like to be added to PAUSE/CPAN.  This is my first
module (of hopefully many)... 


Module:

name: Iff
DSLI: cdpO
description: "Read/Write Iff files (aiff/riff/wave)"

long desc:  provides an object oreinted way of reading
and writing any Iff file.   for an overview of IFF,
see: http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/tech/aboutiff.htm

I know this may conflict with RenderMan, but I was
hoping to either incorporate the Iff portion of
Renderman, or maybe Glenn can use my modules...

The reading is done, but the writing isn't.  I've
started writing the Write portion, and that may
require me to rewrite the reading portions... not sure
yet...

I'd like to know what the next step is...
