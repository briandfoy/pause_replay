	Hi! I have a set of modules I'd like to submit; the question
is, where in the Perl module namespace should they go?

Background:
	These modules allow one to read, manipulate, and write the PDB
database files used by the Palm family of PDAs (e.g., PalmPilot et
al.).
	There is a small number (two, currently) of modules that
provide the framework for reading and writing PDB files. Other,
application-specific modules can inherit from these base classes;
there can be a large number of such derived classes. (I hope this
makes sense.)

Question:
	The obvious place to put these modules would be
PDA::Palm::PDB.pm, PDA::Palm::PDB::AddressBook.pm, etc., but this
seems rather cumbersome, plus none of the other palmtops are in the
PDA:: hierarchy.
	I'd like to put my modules in Palm:: or maybe Palm::PDB:: .
Does this sound reasonable? What would you recommend?

PS: Yes, I'm aware of PDA::PilotDesktop. But that's listed as just
being an idea. I have code.
