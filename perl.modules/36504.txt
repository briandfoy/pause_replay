Subject: RFC: New module Chart::Plot::Simple

I have developed a scientific plotting module that is nearly ready to
put on CPAN.  I've been calling it Chart::Plot::Simple for now, but
I'd like to ask community for advice on that name.

My module distinguishes itself from the existing plotting/graphing
modules in the following ways:

    * Data sets with unevenly-spaced x-data are handled trivially
    * Residuals between two y-data sets can be calculated and plotted,
regardless of whether they are plotted against the same x-data
    * Errorbars can be specified, and are correctly calculated for the
residuals, if applicable
    * Log-lin, lin-log, and log-log plots can be created simply
    * Plot data can be read in from a file, or fed in via arrays or
PDL piddles.

In addition, there are standard axis- and title-labeling, line/point
options, and other features one would expect in simple
scienctific-style plots. It uses PDL and PGPLOT.pm under the hood.

Thanks,

Kester
