Module:
    CGI::Safe

Description:
    CGI::Safe - Safe method of using CGI.pm.  This is pretty 
    much a two-line change for most CGI scripts.

    This module is a subclass of CGI.pm.  The intention is to
    make the CGI programming environment safer.  By default, it
    sets $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS to 1 and $CGI::POST_MAX to 512k.

    Additionally, it deletes @ENV{ qw/ IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV / }
    and $ENV{ PATH } to '/bin:/usr/bin' and, if it exists,
    $ENV{ SHELL } to '/bin/sh'.

    All of these behaviors may be overridden if needed.

Note:
    I am releasing this module after consulting with Lincoln Stein.
