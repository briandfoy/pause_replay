This is a pretty obvious one, and I thought that someone would have
already created a Perl module to access (Linux) RPM databases, but if
noone has then I volunteer.  I've thrown a skeletal XS file together
and have the RPM docs in front of me...

What about a package name?  Is RPM OK? or should it be Linux::RPM, or
Unix::RPM or even System::RPM?
