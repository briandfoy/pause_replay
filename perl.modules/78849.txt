Subject: Module submission Net::Inspect

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Inspect
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: layered inspection of network traffic
  userid:      SULLR (Steffen Ullrich)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Sharktools, Sniffer::HTTP, Net::Analysis

  rationale:

    This module provides ways to inspect traffic starting with a low
    layer like pcap oder tcp stream and ending with a higher layer like
    HTTP request with uncompressed content.

    Currently implemented are the pcap, tcp and http layers and tools
    to extract tcp flows and uncompressed http requests from pcap and an
    inspecting HTTP proxy.

    Rationale for the library is to provide a way to inspect stored or
    live traffic with deeper inspection than the usual IDS do and to use
    perl for a faster implementation of ideas in protocol inspection
    than the usually used C,C++ or binpac give.

    Rationale for the namespace is to provide a way for me and others
    to have a unified namespace for these protocol inspectors (e.g.
    Net::Inspect::DNS, Net::Inspect::SIP...)

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Inspect         adpOp layered inspection of network traffic        SULLR
