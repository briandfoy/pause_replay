The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Debian::Package::Make
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Perl modules for autobuilding Debian package
  userid:      HBENGEN (Hilko Bengen)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Youri::Package::RPM::Builder Youri::Package::RPM::Generator

  rationale:

    Namespace: My modules deal with *Debian*-specific (as far as the
    toolchain and the package format is concerned) aspects of *Package*
    generation.

    During my time as a Debian developer, I have seen quite a few
    attempts at creating make-*-package scripts that generated .deb
    packages from sources that weren't allowed to be distributed
    directly via our archives. Those scripts had a lot of functionality
    in common, yet every author found it necessary to reinvent the
    wheel, each time with different quirks. I hope that my module will
    make much of that reinventing unnecessary in the future.

The resulting entry would be:

Debian::Package::
::Make            bdpOg Perl modules for autobuilding Debian package HBENGEN
