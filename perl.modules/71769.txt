The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::CLI
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Command Line Interface with nested commands
  userid:      JEZRA (Josef Ezra)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2010-06/threads.html

  similar:
    Term::Shell, Term::Shell::Enhanced

  rationale:

    I wrote this module for a CLI application with a big number of
    commands, where I've wanted commands to be nested like a directory
    tree. The tab completion and uniqueness identifier works through the
    whole chain, and the help can show a single layer (default), one
    layer dept, or all layers recursively.

    I've also added a convinced way to add options for the command
    (also with tab completion for both key and parameter). This feature
    makes it very easy to create a sophisticated command in the main
    script.

    If this suggestion accepted, I intend to expand this object with
    the dynamically loaded modules Term::CLI::Prompt (ask/warn),
    Term::CLI::Completions (collection of common completion functions -
    for file, directory, users, etc.), Term::CLI::Pager (for built in
    pager), and probably more in the future. Would I need to register
    each name space individually via pause?

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::CLI             bdpOp Command Line Interface with nested commands  JEZRA
