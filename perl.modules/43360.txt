It's the right place to email, but the wrong request. :)

modules@ doesn't provide a service for making changes to other people's 
modules. However, if you need changes made to the module, and the author 
is AWOL, then you may want to take over maintainership of the module.

This would let you apply the necesary patches and upload new versions of 
the module yourself as needed.
