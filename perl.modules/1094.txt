hi guys,

We need to rework something here, I'm sure we're missing quite a few
things to reply to, modules and users to be added and so on and so on.
Maybe it doesn't happen that often, but everytime we do I'm afraid there
is a pretty good chance we lose a contributer.

We should get the modulelist in CVS or such so more people can edit it
when Andreas is busy, and we should make some tracking system for ID
requests. Maybe having the users register at a webinterface so we just
have to press "approve" or such.

It would also scale much better by allowing more volunteers to help if we
streamline the procedures.
