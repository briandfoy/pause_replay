Planning on contributing:
An interactive Perl Tutor. The tutor is designed for newbie programmers;
it allows eval'ing of commands as typed in from a prompt and also gives
some nice commands, such as undo, redo, dumping the values of all
variables, and so on. The tutor is in alpha presently; all that's
left to implement before I go beta on this are actual tutorial scripts.
For now, though, it's a decent program to allow people to tinker with
Perl in a hands-on environment. The perl tutor has been discussed on
perlmonks.org, where it has attained a rating as one of the Best Nodes
of All Time, so I would say there's at least a fair number of people
who've shown interest in the program.

Thanks!
