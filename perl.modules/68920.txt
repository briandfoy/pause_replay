The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Compete
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO wrapper for the Compete SiteAnalytics API
  userid:      CMILLS (Chris Mills)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    I was unable to find any other modules that integrate with Compete.

  rationale:

    I think this module is useful because it allows easy access to
    traffic statistics, ranking, and trust ratings from www.compete.com.
    The module is a simple OO wrapper around Compete's API.

    After browsing through CPAN, and also reading perlnewmod, etc. I
    made the choice to place this module under WWW::.

    (I admit to being a little confused about the difference between
    WWW:: and WebService:: however.)

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Compete         bdpOp OO wrapper for the Compete SiteAnalytics API CMILLS
