The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::GOST_PP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Pure perl implementation of GOST algorithm
  userid:      SIFUKURT (Kurt Kincaid)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    Crypt::RC4, Crypt::RC5

  rationale:

    Crypt::GOST_PP is a pure perl implementation of the GOST encryption
    algorithm. It is important to note that there are (or have been)
    several other GOST encryption modules for perl. This version is in
    no way intended to supersede any other such implementations,
    specifically Crypt::GOST. The purpose for writing this module was
    that I do a great deal of work on Win32 systems, and I have been
    unsuccessful in my attempts to get Crypt::GOST to install correctly
    in that environment. A previous version of Crypt::GOST, v0.41, was
    also a pure perl implementation, but it lacked documentation, and as
    such it was more difficult to use than one would prefer. As a result
    of these two things, I wanted to write a pure perl implementation,
    with requisite documentation, that will run regardless of the OS.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
