The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Compress::Gzip
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: CGI with automatically compressed output
  userid:      CLOTHO (Clotho Advanced Media)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Apache::Compress Apache::GzipChain

  rationale:

    This drop-in replacement for CGI.pm adds smart Gzip filtering of
    program output based on the browser-reported Accept-Encoding header
    value and the outgoing Content-Type header.

    Similar functionality is often provided by the mod_gzip module for
    the Apache webserver as well as by the Apache::Compress and
    Apache::GzipChain modules. However, those are all strongly connected
    with the server configuration and are not controllable by individual
    scripts. CGI::Gzip works at the script level, thus may be more
    portable and more flexible (the latter because the programmer can
    choose to turn it off when compression may not be advantageous).

    It is listed as "beta" because it's broken on Windows, but it
    reports show that it works well on all tested Unix-like platforms,
    including Linux mod_perl.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Compress::
::Gzip            bdpOg CGI with automatically compressed output     CLOTHO
