Hello --

The AFS::Command module is maintained by Morgan Stanley. I believe its
last upload predates the namespace registration system. The previous
maintainer (who was also the module's creator) has left the firm and
transferred ownership to me. It's correct that there have been no
uploads recently; since taking ownership of this module, I haven't had
any reason to release a newer version. Should it become necessary
though, I would be the one to upload any newer release, so my name on
the registration is correct.

Let me know if you have any additional questions. Thank you!
