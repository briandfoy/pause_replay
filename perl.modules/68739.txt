Request to register new user

     why:

    I would like a PAUSE ID so I can contribute a collection of classes
    I have written which simplifies the distribution of any kind of
    message.

    I have some other projects that I have written (including an
    interface to inter-tel/mitel telephone systems) which I would also
    like to tidy up and submit to CPAN.
