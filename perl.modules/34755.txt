Nop.
Let me try another way...

If there's a sentence is including some substituted to "named"
HTML entities.
When we'd like to convert the included named HTML entities in the
sentence to "numbered" HTML entities,
HTML::Entities doesn't have any way to do it. 
But, HTML::Entities::Numbered has it.
It also has functions to convert to backward direction.

It is convenient to feed some valid XML from some assorted sentences.
Because the most "named" HTML entities aren't allowed to including in
XML.
We should convert them to "numbered" HTML entities.
Perhaps there is any other necessity of this module. ;)

In the simplest terms, a functions of this module works like an
XML::RSS::encode_text() function.
Maybe the function of XML::RSS does NOT work correctly.
But this module works correctly.

I hope that you can understand my clumsy English...
