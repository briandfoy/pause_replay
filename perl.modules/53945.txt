Subject: Module submission Carp::Once

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Carp::Once
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: never repeat yourself when carping
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    none that I saw which is why I made it :)

  rationale:

    use Carp::Once;

    for (1 .. 1000) { Carp::Once::carp('We hates odd numbers') if $_ &
    1; }

    In stead of hundreds of redundant 'We hates odd numbers' lines you
    get a single 'We hates odd numbers' line

    Will have utilities to get a count of how many times a given
    message has been sent so far among other things.

  enteredby:   DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 11 23:57:54 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Carp::
::Once            Rdpfp never repeat yourself when carping           DMUEY
