From: rjray@tsoft.com (Randy J Ray)

I have just uploaded the first alpha version of RPM bindings in
Perl. The package names in the kit are:

      RPM
      RPM::Constants
      RPM::Database
      RPM::Headers

There will likely be more as development continues. This should have
the DSLI code of:

      adcO

Based on the current categories, this module probably best fits under
17, Archiving, Compression and Conversions. Since RPM is a package
management system, this seems to be the closest match.

If you need any more info, please let me know. I will be out of town
most of this week (with no e-mail access), but back on Friday.

Randy
