The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Validate
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Lightweight data validation and untainting
  userid:      SONNEN (Richard Sonnen)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::FormValidator CGI::Validate Attribute::Params::Validate

  rationale:

    While quite a number of data validation toolkits have been
    contributed to CPAN, most are either very narrowly focused (only
    validating email addresses, for example), or are very task-specific
    (eg CGI::Validate). The goal with Data::Validate is to provide a
    lightweigh, extensible set of validation functions that can be used
    in any application.

    The base module (Data::Validate) contains some very general
    validation tools (is_numeric, is_printable, etc.). Modules below the
    base will hold more specialized tools. As an example,
    Data::Validate::Email holds email-specific functions like is_email,
    and is_domain. Data::Validate::IP will have functions like is_ipv4
    and is_ipv6.

    These sub modules are what provide the extensibility I'm going for.
    I can add new modules to cover specialized areas without making any
    one module unnecessarily heavy or complex. Other authors can also
    add to the heirachy without colliding with each other.

    Thanks, Richard Sonnen
