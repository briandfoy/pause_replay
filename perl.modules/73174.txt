The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Include::DontRun
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: 'Include' without running file scoped code
  userid:      CCOLBOURN (Charles Colbourn)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module attempts to 'include' (i.e. require) code without
    executing anything in file scope. So for instance you can include a
    script which 'does stuff' without it actually doing the stuff. This
    is handy for writing test scripts for scripts and modules that have
    run time dependencies on infrastructure.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Include::
::DontRun         adphp 'Include' without running file scoped code   CCOLBOURN
