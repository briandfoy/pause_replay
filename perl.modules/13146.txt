The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Reporter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: sends test results to cpan-testers@perl.org
  userid:      AFOXSON (Adam J. Foxson)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #perl and the CPANPLUS crew

  similar:
    CPAN::Test::Reporter cpantest

  rationale:

    Test::Reporter provides a programatic interface by which CPAN
    Testers or users of CPANPLUS are able to submit distribution test
    results to the CPAN testing service. This distribution provides
    functionality similar to that of the cpantest script and is intended
    for use in situations where using cpantest is not appropriate, or
    ideal. This distribution is released with the blessing of Kirrily
    "Skud" Robert, who is the author of the non-functional
    CPAN::Test::Reporter distribution.

  enteredby:   AFOXSON (Adam J. Foxson)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 12 07:45:13 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Reporter        bdpOp sends test results to cpan-testers@perl.org  AFOXSON
