Hello,

My name is David Dowse. I am the Director of the Arthritis and Glucosamine Information Center at http://www.glucosamine-arthritis.org/. We have been looking for partners to exchange links with. I have taken a look at your site and it seems like it would be a resource that people (or pets!) searching for Arthritis or Glucosamine might also be interested in seeing.

I propose that we exchange links. If you will link to the "Arthritis and Glucosamine Information Center" at http://www.glucosamine-arthritis.org/ (our website) and send me an email listing where the link can be found on your site, I will add a reciprocal link within 24 hours. If you would like to include a short byline for your site, please include that with your email. You would get free traffic to your site and we would get a database of quality sites to offer our viewers.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience where your link is located so we can add you to our links page. 

Warm regards,
David D. Dowse, Director
The Arthritis and Glucosamine Information Center
