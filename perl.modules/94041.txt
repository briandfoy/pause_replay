Hi Spikes,

>>> Apologies for the bother, but could we get Net::AMQP version 0.06 =
(~CHIPS) reindexed on MetaCPAN. No new upload or anything, just looks =
like there may have been a permissions issue.
>> You=E2=80=99re right, it looks like he has all relevant permissions. =
I=E2=80=99ve triggered a re-index on it, which would be done in about an =
hour.

> Thanks for the reply and aid. I took a look just now, and it appears =
that the packages still show up as unauthorized on MetaCPAN.

Turned out their were two different issues going on, and in my first =
attempt I only addressed one of them.

The 0.06 release is now correctly indexed in 02packages, and CHIPS has =
all the right permissions. CPAN clients will now do the right thing, but =
for the moment MetaCPAN will still report it as unauthorized.

I=E2=80=99ve requested a re-index on MetaCPAN, as it doesn=E2=80=99t =
automatically spot changes in 02packages that require a re-index on =
MetaCPAN.

Neil
