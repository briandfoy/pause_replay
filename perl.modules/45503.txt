To whom it may concern -

    I'd like to register the following names:

Distribution:
    Forest

Modules:
    Forest
    Tree
    Tree::Null (contained with the Tree source file)
    Tree::Fast
    Tree::Binary
    Tree::Persist
    Tree::Persist::Base
    Tree::Persist::File
    Tree::Persist::File::XML
    Tree::Persist::DB
    Tree::Persist::DB::SelfReferential

These are all in the distribution named Forest I just uploaded to
CPAN. The version is 0.99_01 (developer release).

Purpose:
    For work, I need to have transparent backing for trees to an
arbitrary datastore, specified at runtime. None of the existing Tree
modules lent themselves to the necessary patches. As the author of
Tree::Simple and Tree::Binary (STEVAN) is a coworker, he recommended
that I start from scratch, in order to provide the API he wished he
had when writing his tree modules.

Conflicts:
    * There is a Tree::Binary currently registered to STEVAN (Stevan Little=
).
        - As he is a co-author for Forest, he has said that he's
willing to move the name over. This would be considered an
incompatible API upgrade, requiring a new major version number.
    * There is a "Tree" distribution by MSCHWERN.
        - There is no "Tree" package anywhere in the distribution.
        - It was last updated October, 1999.
        - It doesn't actually implement a tree - it reimplements
hashes using a self-balancing tree.

    As such, I do not feel that there are any conflicts to granting us
the names I have requested.

Thanks,
Rob Kinyon
