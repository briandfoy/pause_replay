The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Wait
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Make tests wait for manual testing purposes
  userid:      BENH (Benjamin Hare)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)

    Test::More Test::Builder Test::Simple Selenium::Remote::Driver

  rationale:

    Hello,

    This module is a test library, originally written to pause selenium
    tests so that one could check what was happening in the browser
    while the test was still running, eg; to check the name of a form
    field.

    It can however be used in any test script in order to pause it and
    inspect it's output to the terminal and / or use the test output
    data to perform manual tests on an application for example.

    I find myself copy and pasting this code to the test library of
    every new project I work on so thought I would suggest it here.

    Cheers,

    Ben.
