Hi,

I have been programming a module to wrap the pngwriter library in perl. 
pngwriter (http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net) is an easy to use C++ 
graphics library. The audience is mainly people who need an intuitive 
way to plot images, like astronomy, physics and chemistry students who 
just want a straightforward way to work with their images.
A lot of our audience uses perl for other academic purposes and we have 
been working on the perl module version that is almost ready (we are in 
the documenting phase and about to release the first test version).
I am working closely with Paul Blackburn (the original author of 
pngwriter, copied in this email) to release the perl version and we need 
to decide on a package name.
We have been thinking about naming the module "PNGwriter". Is this 
possible?

Thanks,
