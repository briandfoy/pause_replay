Don't be bitter, p5p is a tough place :-)

This could be an option, but I'm afraid it might be confusing to anyone
looking for CSS parsing modules. I've written to Steve to expose my current
work on CSS::Parser and how I am extending it. If we can't merge our work
somehow, I'm open to renaming CSS::Parser to CSS::SimplerParser or
something of the kind. From the amount of feedback I've had, I know that it
has been used but not extensively and apparently not in production. I've
committed the latest version of CSS::Parser to CPAN tonight so that Steve
(or anyone else) can look into it.

I expect to work on CSS::CSS2 before I go into CSS::CSS1 because it is what
I need most urgently, thus CSS::CSS1 is unlikely to be produced here before
I have spare time to do so, which is likely to take a while.
