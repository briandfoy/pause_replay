Hi,
Do you know a nice guy who's looking for a bride? The Mediterranean's
auction site, 15minutesauction.com, is offering the chance to bid for a
bride (well, the chance to meet a prospective bride with a view to
marriage).  Also, if you've got any unwanted Christmas presents, why not
auction them off and use the money to buy what you really want?  Visit the
Med's auction site at: www.15minutesauction.com start trading and have a
happy and prosperous new year.


Mary, 15minutes support
