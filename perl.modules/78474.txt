Subject: Naming question (module that interacts with Lumeta's IPsonar)

Hello, I'm putting together a module to interface with an application =
called IPsonar.
IPsonar is written by a company called Lumeta.  I work there but this =
module is a personal project rather than company sponsored. =20

My initial idea was to name the module "IPsonar-<version>", but in =
looking at the namespace registration form it looks like registering a =
new top level namespace is discouraged.

The module is a relatively thin wrapper around the IPsonar API.

I've looked through the existing module list and I don't see any =
existing root namespaces that this seems to fit under, I do see some =
that are application specific (though I'm not sure if they reflect the =
current naming strategy).

I'm completely new to all things PAUSE so I'd be grateful for any advise =
on naming.

Thanks, George Budd=
