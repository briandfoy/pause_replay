Subject: Module submission Pod::InComments

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pod::InComments
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: extracts POD hidden in comments
  userid:      ANDREWF (Andrew Ford)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module was inspired by the LaTeX "docstrip" utility. It
    removes comment characters from lines containing Pod documentation
    and indents bare lines so that they are regarded by the Pod tools as
    verbatim text. I use this for documenting configuration files (e.g.
    Apache, exim, etc) with Pod.

  enteredby:   ANDREWF (Andrew Ford)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep  5 11:24:22 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Pod::
::InComments      cdpOp extracts POD hidden in comments              ANDREWF
