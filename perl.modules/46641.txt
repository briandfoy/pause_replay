Hi,
	I've uploaded to CPAN:

	$CPAN/authors/id/C/CR/CRAKRJACK/Test-CPAN-0.002.tar.gz

	This includes the 'cpanemu' command, which interactively tests how
CPAN will interact with your module once it's been downloaded from CPAN and
unpacked. Take a look and let me know what you think.

	Thanks,
		Tyler
