I hope the authors notice wrong DSLIP statements and correct them. The
widget is just about 6 months old. What I need to do next is write
them authors about it.

This widget isn't complete yet. I'll change it as I described in a
recent posting to P5P ("Registering Licenses of modules, take II").
The caveat in the license fortunately does not apply to distribution,
so there the module is freely redistributable. But I doubt it is
listed on www.opensource.org as an open license:-)

So it will be 

     d   - Not approved by www.opensource.org, but distribution allowed
               without restrictions

Very unfortunate. Email::Valid was never posted to modules@perl.org.

Good grief, that's real stupidity by the guy running the module list.
That must have slipped through somehow, don't know how. Well, back in
February, we had several people comment on the module but nobody
noticed the spurious E.

That's certainly what you get for not playing by Mail:: which would
have gone to the correct chapter automatically.

I'm in favor of a rename.
