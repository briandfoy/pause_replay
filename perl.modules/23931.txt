The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Maker
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Module for generating XML
  userid:      VADIMT (Vadim Trochinsky)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=296796

  similar:
    XML::Writer

  rationale:

    XML::Maker has been choosen as a short and simple name for a module
    that produces XML. The module has also a make() function.

    This module was made because I didn't like a few characteristics of
    XML::Writer, for example, XML::Writer produces output as soon as it
    can. It also requires error-prone steps like closing tags and making
    sure there's just one root element, which I thought weren't
    necessary.

    The main advantage of the module is that it doesn't produce output
    until told to do so. This makes it possible for example to generate
    XML, then remove part of it, and replace it with an error message.
    This should make XML::Maker much more optimal than XML::Writer for
    writing servers.

    Another characteristic is that it's based on a tree of objects
    (parent objects know about their children), which makes it possible
    to pass a child to a function. The function will then have full
    control over the child, but won't be able to change the parent,
    which should add some security and make debugging somewhat easier.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Maker           bdpOg Module for generating XML                    VADIMT
