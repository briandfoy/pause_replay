Dear pause maintainers,

This email from Ingy indicates we need some kind of improvement along
these options:

- a posting explaining what this thing is about

- a less opaque process to resolve these conflicts than emails behind
  the scenes

- a way to quickly and reliably sort out false positives: in the
  case we have here, FGLOCK/v6-0.044.tar.gz occupise the namespace
  "Perl5" but the package lives in Perl5/Emitter.pm.
  INGY/perl5-0.20.tar.gz occupies the namespace "perl5" and it lives in
  perl5.pm which is not conflicting with the former

Here are the records involved:

mysql> select * from primeur where lower(package) = 'perl5';
+---------+--------+
| package | userid |
+---------+--------+
| Perl5   | FGLOCK |
| perl5   | INGY   |
+---------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.13 sec)

mysql> select * from packages where lower(package) = 'perl5';
+---------+---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+------------+------------+---------+--------+
| package | version | dist                        | file                                  | filemtime  | pause_reg  | comment | status |
+---------+---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+------------+------------+---------+--------+
| Perl5   | undef   | F/FG/FGLOCK/v6-0.044.tar.gz | v6-0.044/lib/Perlito/Perl5/Emitter.pm | 1319658328 | 1319658559 |         | index  |
| perl5   | 0.09    | I/IN/INGY/perl5-0.09.tar.gz | perl5-0.09/lib/perl5.pm               | 1340117841 | 1340118199 |         | index  |
+---------+---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------------+------------+------------+---------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.12 sec)


For now I (incorrectly!) removed the disturbing record to make room for
the indexing of INGY/perl5-0.20.tar.gz and the indexer has since picked
it up.

This whole problem would come back to us when a new version of v6 would
be released that would again use the package name "Perl5" internally. Or
when somebody decided to reindex this v6. Maybe the namespace in the v6
distro could some day (as a workaround) be changed to something like
"Perl5::Base" or so?

Maybe a better solution would be that the indexer would look at filename
conflicts, not at package name conflicts?

Hi Andreas,

This looks like a bug. Can you fix it?
