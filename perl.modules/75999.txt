The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weather::TW
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Fetch weather data from www.cwb.gov.tw
  userid:      DRYMAN (陳仁乾)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    git

  similar:
    Weather::Com

  rationale:

    Weather in taiwan is quite complicated to predict. Though
    www.cwb.gov.tw offer a good prediction, but the website is built in
    table form which is hard to fetch data. The purpose of this module
    is to translate the html table to xml, json, or perl hash which is
    meaningful to other programs.

  enteredby:   DRYMAN (陳仁乾)
  enteredon:   Mon May  9 03:29:37 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Weather::
::TW              cdpOp Fetch weather data from www.cwb.gov.tw       DRYMAN
