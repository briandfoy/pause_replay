Request to register new user

fullname: Rick Delaney
  userid: DELANEY
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Object::I18n - Internationalize object attributes.
    optimize::accessors - rewrite optree so accessor methods are hash
    accesses.

    I also have a nice templating class (of course) which I wrote
    before I'd heard of HTML::Seamstress. They are very similar but I
    like mine better. :-)

    I probably have some fun Acme-type stuff I would dig up.
