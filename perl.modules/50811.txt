In addition to Brian's comments, I'd add you are missing the "similar" 
section, which for what you are proposing seems quite significant.

There's already dozens of database framework modules out there, what 
makes yours different, unique, and needed in comparison to all the others.

I'm not being negative here, just noting that it's good to have some 
idea of why nothing that currently exists fills your needs.
