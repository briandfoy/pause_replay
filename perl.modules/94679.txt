I have scheduled Jack Shirazi=E2=80=99s CPAN distributions for deletion, =
after discussing it with him and getting his agreement.
These were all more than 20 years old, didn=E2=80=99t have any =
downstream dependents, and most of them hadn=E2=80=99t worked for a long =
time.

I first considered this nearly a year ago =
(http://neilb.org/2015/04/30/curating-old-releases.html =
<http://neilb.org/2015/04/30/curating-old-releases.html>), but left it a =
while to see if I still thought it was the right thing. I checked with =
Jack both then and just before doing it now.

I will free up the permissions once they=E2=80=99ve been converted from =
=E2=80=98m=E2=80=99s to =E2=80=98f=E2=80=99s by ANDK.

Thanks to Jack, who I=E2=80=99ve copied on this.

Neil
