The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::UNLreport
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Formats delimited data into uniform columns
  userid:      JASALOMON (Jacob Salomon)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data:Report

  rationale:

    This was not conceived as a general purpose report writer. The
    intent is to find the maximum width of each columns and pad it with
    spaces on the left or right or zeros to right of a decimal point to
    keep all columns aligned and the data readable.

    The original purpose is to beautify the output of an UNLOAD command
    in an Informix database. It is also equipped to handle the
    non-delimited BLOB data that gets unloaded together with the
    delimited data.

    Only now that it has been made into a class have I realized other
    potential enhancements, not normally part of a standard report
    writer. e.g. Setting the maximum width for selected columns; data
    would continue to output to that column only, leaving blank the
    completed columns of that row. (Then again, with 5,000 Report
    modules out there, it might have been done by someone.)

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::UNLreport       RdpOp Formats delimited data into uniform columns  JASALOMON
