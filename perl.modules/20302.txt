The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::vCard
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: read and write RFC 2426 vCard files
  userid:      JLAWRENC (Jay Lawrence)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    module authors mailing list; direct input

  similar:
    Net::iCal operates on a similar file format but does offer the
    ability to process vCard data

  rationale:

    vCard files are a common format for importing and exporting from
    many contact management tools including Apple's Addressbook which
    prompted me to write this module.

    There was some debate over the approprate top level domain to put
    this module in. I decided that the most logical is the Net:: since
    it follows along side its cousin Net::iCal. The authors of Net::iCal
    informed me that their choice of the Net:: prefix was because this
    it is based on RFC file spec ... therefore the Net:: hierarchy is
    the place for that.

    I do not want to debate that logic - but - upon looking around CPAN
    it seems that there is no appropriate top level for well know data
    file formats; usually they carve out their own top level (XML; MARC;
    etc.)

    The other contender was for Data::vCard but I have decided that it
    is preferable to follow the lead of Net::iCal. I am not stuck to any
    name space would be happy to accept a counter proposal.

    Thanks

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
