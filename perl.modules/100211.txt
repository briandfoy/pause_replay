Thank you for responding, That is completely fine.

I had started this as I had heard from other community members that you had
no longer been contactable.  Your domain and email no longer being valid
supported this to me.
That's why we have this process to announce to the broader community who
may have be able to contact the author before anything like a take over
will happen.
