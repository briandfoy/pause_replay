The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Router::IPDR
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: IPDR Collector/Receiver
  userid:      SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    IPDR is a protocol used to transmit information. It stands for
    Internet Protocol Detailed Record and has in the past mainly been
    used in relation to Telephony however does have a variety of
    implementation relating to routers.

    As Router is a base namespace, Router::IPDR seemed appropriate for
    the functionality of the module I have in mind as it will
    concentrate on Cisco and Motorola CMTS ( cable modem termination
    system ) hardware.

    Further information can be found at

    www.ipdr.org/public/DocumentMap/SP2.3.pdf

    Different vendors interpret the specification in different ways and
    the module (s) will try and consolidate the different methods into a
    single presentation interface so making it simpler to deploy.

    Andrew.
