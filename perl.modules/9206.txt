I figured it out - it was due to a change in Perl 5.6 that caused
numbers when converted to strings by Perl to have the current locale's
decimal separator inserted.  In other words, the number 123.45 in the
German locale is "123,45" in string form.  Prior versions of Perl
would convert it to "123.45" no matter what locale.  I was using
split(/\./) to separate the integer from the decimal parts, and
converted that to use int() to get the integer, and substr() to get
the decimal.  It works, and version 1.44 is now on my website and soon
to be on CPAN.
