One solution that may or may not apply in your case: upload one more
"version" with the old name whose README and/or Makefile.PL (probably
both) state that "This module has been superseded by New::Module::Name,
which has the same interface. Please use that."

Then people looking to upgrade will automatically be informed. And
people auto-installing new module versions (which is risky anyway) will
not overwrite their existing version since the Makefile.PL will not
actually create a Makefile so nothing will be installed over the
existing one -- so if they want to keep on using Old::Module they will
be able to.

Cheers,
Philip
