From: autarch@urth.org (Dave Rolsky)

I wrote to the two folks listed as authors, Michael Hendricks and Andreas 
Fitzner, in early April. Michael replied back immediately saying he wasn't 
working on it any more and he was happy to give me comaint, but he didn't 
have PAUSE perms on it.

Andreas has never responded. The email associated with his PAUSE account 
(andreas.fitzner@fv-berlin.de) is dead. I also emailed the one in the 
File::LibMagic docs and didn't hear back from him. The web page his PAUSE 
account links to is _also_ dead. I'm not really sure how else to contact 
him, but based on the fact that the module hasn't been released for 4 
years and the list of bugs (including a total failure to install with 
5.18+), I think it's safe to say he's no longer working on it.

I'd like to at least fix it up enough to keep it working with newer Perls, 
as I used it with Courriel and other software.

And clearly, I need another module to maintain!


Thanks,

-dave
