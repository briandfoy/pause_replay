Hi Neil,

I'll do my best to fix this but I can't get to this immediately. I made an
issue which I'll resolve once I have a bit more time:
https://github.com/rvosa/bio-phylo-beagle/issues/1

Cheers,

Rutger

You have ownership of the =E2=80=9Cbeagle=E2=80=9D namespace, as a result o=

This now clashes with the Beagle module, owned by SUNNAVY, and part of his =

<br>
The best solution would be for you to rename the =E2=80=9Cbeagle=E2=80=9D m=

Would you be happy to make this change? Once you=E2=80=99ve released a new =
