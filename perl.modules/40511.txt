The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::Image::CopyIFS
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: fractal-based image copying and resizing
  userid:      RKOBES (Randy Kobes)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    GD

  rationale:

    This module adds a method, copyIFS, to GD::Image, which enables one
    to copy and resize an area of one image onto another. It is used
    analagously to the copyResized and copyResampled methods of GD. The
    algorithm uses a fractal-based Iterated Function System (IFS), and
    as such, it can give good results when used for images of natural
    objects (which typically have a fractal nature). The package
    contains some tests which allow one to compare the results of
    enlarging a portion of an image using copyIFS, copyResized, and
    copyResampled.

The resulting entry would be:

GD::Image::
::CopyIFS         adcOp fractal-based image copying and resizing     RKOBES
