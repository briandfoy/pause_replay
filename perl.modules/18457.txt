Dear,

With regards and honor do please consider this proposal.
I am from Zimbabwe but currently i and my brother is in Netherland.You 
might be worried how i got your contact address, I got it from
Netherland Chamber of Commerce and trade e-mail directory.

Dear friend during this crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our
President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he
ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party
members and their followers

My father was one of the best farmers in the country and knowing that he did
not support the presidents political ideology, the presidents supporters 
invaded my fathers farm burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of
the wounds sustained, he became sick and died after four
days.And after his death,I and my younger Brother decided to move
out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives to South-Africa.from thier we where able 
to enter into a ship and travel to the Netherland.

But, before he died he wrote his will, which reads (MY BELOVEED SON ,I WISH
TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SUM OF ($7.5,000000). MILLION U.S 
DOLLARS
WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG
(SOUTH-AFRICA)and i have ask them to transfer it to thier branch in the netherland.
and secured it.IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY".You
should solicit for reliable foreign partner to assist you to transfer this
money out of South Africa for investment purpose.

I deposited the money in your name and it can be claimed by you alone with
the deposit code. your mother has all the documents.Take good care of your
mother and brother."

From the above, you will understand that the lives and future of my family
depends on this money as much, I will be grateful if you can assist us.
I with my younger brother are now living in the Netherland as POLITICAL
ASYLUM SEEKERS and the financial law of the Netherland does not allow ASYLUM
SEEKERS certain financial rights to such huge amount of money .


In view of this, I cannot invest this money in the Netrherland,
hence I am asking you to assist me transfer this money 
out of South-Africa for investment purposes. 

For your efforts, I am prepared to offer you 10% of the total fund, while 2% will
be set aside for local and international expenses and 88% will be kept for
me and my family.

Finally modalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to you
once we establish trust and confidence between ourselves. Looking forward to
hear from you For detailed information. 

NOTE:THE KEY WORD TO THIS TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY 
AND SECRECY.THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. YOUR URGENT 
RESPONSE WILL BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

BEST REGARDS,
