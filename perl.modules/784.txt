MP3Info's main function is to get information out of the MPEG Frame
Headers. It has some limited tagging capabilities, but it is not
its core functionality. We have been using this perl OOP implementation
to tag every single file and feel it is more mature then the extensions
added to MP3Info by Chris Nandor.

On top of that, we have had discussions with Chris in regards to extending
his module to provide more ID3 support (such as complete v1 and v2) in an
OOP fashion. Chris would rather stick to a function based module and we
would like to provide an OOP alternative that has been tested extensively.

We do not need to add this particular module (got others on the way), 
but there seems to be some interest.
