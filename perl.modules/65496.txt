The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Abilities
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Ability based authorization for Catalyst.
  userid:      IDOPEREL (Ido Perelmutter)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Catalyst-dev mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is an authorization plugin for Catalyst, based on the
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles model but using an entirely
    different approach. The reasoning about the namespace choice should
    be obvious, it is simply a Catalyst authorization plugin.

    As for the rationale behind the module itself, well here it is: The
    Authorization::Roles plugin allowes the developer of a Catalyst
    application to decide which roles are able to perform certain
    actions, and users are assigned to these roles. This plugin, on the
    other hands, takes this decision from the developer and passes it to
    the end-user. The developer sets actions in the application and just
    checks that a user has the ability to perform them. The ability is
    granted by the end-user (at first the user installing the Catalyst
    application).

    I believe this module should be in the module list because it
    provides a strong mechanism for Catalyst authorization not yet
    available through the existing modules.

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::
::Abilities       bdpOp Ability based authorization for Catalyst.    IDOPEREL
