See above :)

$_ is an alias to the original values inside map and grep, so your code
above would have modified @bar. An equivalent using map might be

    @foo =3D map { my $x =3D $_; $x =3D~ s/\s+/ /g; $x; } @bar;

, but that's more typing. As Brian said, it's possible to provide the
same functionality already; 'apply' just saves you some typing.

Cheers,
