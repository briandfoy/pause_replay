Subject: [PROPOSAL] Graphics::Colorspace

Since the Image::Colorimetry module is no longer available, and since it
makes sense to have a module that can convert between RGB, HSL, 
CMYK and other color space schemes (as well as translate standard color 
names to useful codes) I'd like to propose a Graphics::Colorspace module
name.

I think Graphics::Colorspace is better than Image::Colorspace since this
deals more with computer graphics abstractions than it does with specific
images. I am welcome to better name suggestions.

(If such a module already exists, please let me know so that I don't 
duplicate work.)
