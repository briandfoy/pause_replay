That was not all together accidental.  It was suggested as a lark when I =
asked for suggestions on IRC.

I've brought it up with the authors.  It may get merged but the module =
will likely coexist as well, at least in the near term.  My need for the =
module is in a very large cluster of machines with Perl 5.8.  There, =
IO::Zlib, Package::Constants, and I believe a couple of other modules =
that are core in 5.10 aren't in core.  I'm not an anti dependency guy, I =
use and love Moose, Catalyst, etc.  Now that the work has been done to =
write the module and some basic tests, I figure others may be in a =
similar position, that the fewer dependencies are another plus if =
compression isn't necessary.  Ideally, streaming support can make it =
into to Archive::Tar eventually, as well as making some of the =
dependencies, like IO::Zlib, optional if the features it provides aren't =
necessary.

> Do you also have stuff to untar big files in the same way?

It will likely come eventually, Andy wants me to write an Ack plugin for =
searching Tar archives and it could likely benefit from a streaming mode =
as well.  I'd also like to write a quick tar header dumper similar to =
/usr/bin/stat in Linux, giving the complete information for each Tar =
header in an archive for which streaming would be ideal.=
