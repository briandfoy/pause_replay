Dear Philip,

Thank you very much for your response. I've already 3 times ordered those
names through the online PAUSE form. Nothing happens. I recall that I've
already sent a message to modules@perl.org a couple of months ago with no
real luck. I was wondering how to reach guys if the service is alive.
Otherwise, I can not edit the information about those modules (and they are
not indexed as far as I understand). This is extremely important especially
for my Apache::CompressClientFixup handler which is supposed to accomplish
every content compression on mod_perl enabled Apache-1.3.

All that stuff was discussed many times on mod_perl mailing list. See for
example
http://perl.apache.org/docs/tutorials/client/compression/compression.html .

Please, help me to finish the namespace registration, or to contact somebody
who is really eligible to do that.

Thanks,
Slava
