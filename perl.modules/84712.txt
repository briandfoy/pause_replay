The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fuse::TagLayer
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: tag-filesystem overlay for hierarchical fs
  userid:      CLIPLAND (Clipland GmbH)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://github.com/clipland/fuse-taglayer

  similar:

  rationale:

    Fuse::TagLayer offers all the tags found in one subdir/volume as a
    tag-based file-system at the mountpoint you specify. This is in
    addition to the real filesystem which is considered to be
    'canonical', with the tag-file-system being just another "layer" to
    access these files (thus the name).

    Proposed as "Fuse::TagLayer", as the Fuse:: namespace seems to have
    settled for modules using the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)
    functionality. Please, in case there's a move going on to rename all
    these modules to the Filesys::Fuse:: namespace, just drop us a note
    and we rename this module to "Filesys::Fuse::TagLayer".

The resulting entry would be:

Fuse::
::TagLayer        bnpOp tag-filesystem overlay for hierarchical fs   CLIPLAND
