The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OOP::Perlish::Class
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Perl5 OOP base class
  userid:      JBEVERLY (Jamie Beverly)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    Moose, Class::Accessor, OOP, Class::Value, Class::Simple,
    Class::Singleton, Class::Scaffold, Class::Mixin, Class::MethodMaker,
    Class::Meta, Class::MakeMethods, Class::Init, Class::Frame

  rationale:

    There are dozens of other OOP base classes, however all that I have
    tried either try to be too much, or don't really save me from
    code-reuse or extra typing. Moreover, they all try to do things in
    perl that perl5 wasn't really meant to do. What I wanted was a base
    class that was robust, powerful, simple, similar to the object
    orientation described in perlboot and perltoot, and would save
    keystrokes, duplication discrepancies and drift. This base class I
    believe is somewhat unique in its design goals and implementation (I
    haven't been through every single base-class implementation out
    there, however.) and fulfills my needs, and perhaps will be of use
    to others as well.

    I elected to use this namespace because there already exists an OOP
    package, and while this is a class implementation, there is so much
    noise in the Class:: namespace, I felt it would just lend to
    excessive clutter to add another package there.

    The name also most clearly conveys the utility of this package; it
    provides an Perlish (it looks like perl, not some other OOP language
    re-implemented in perl) OOP Class.

    I'm not at all averse to renaming, should that be preferable.

    I have no particularly compelling reason why I feel this should be
    listed in the modules list other than that the registration of
    namespace is a recommended practice 8-)

The resulting entry would be:

OOP::Perlish::
::Class           cdpOp Perl5 OOP base class                         JBEVERLY
