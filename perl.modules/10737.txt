To whom it may concern:

I would like to request a CPAN ID.  Here are the answers to the
questions:

*   your name

Ken Y. Clark

*   your email address

kclark@logsoft.com

*   your homepage if you have one

Not really.

*   your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9
    characters long, all uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed.

In order of preference:

1) KCLARK
2) KYC
3) KYCLARK

*   a short description of what you're planning to contribute

SQL::Translator - a group of modules for converting database schemas
(e.g., MySQL create syntax to Oracle).

Thank you,

ky
