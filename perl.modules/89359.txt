The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::WxPoeIO
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Simple signaling sys between POE and Wx-Loop
  userid:      SEBASPER (perry sebastian)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    POE::Component::Wx::Loop POE::Component::SimpleLog

  rationale:

    Simple IO signaling system for POE and Wx Loops. This module is
    very similar to the POE::Component::SimpleLog logging system. It
    uses the same type of register/unregister structure. It was
    partially inspired by the POE: Cookbook - Broadcasting Events and a
    long bloody fight of trying to make Wx events talk with POE
    sessions.

  enteredby:   SEBASPER (perry sebastian)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb 25 14:48:35 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::
::WxPoeIO         bdphp Simple signaling sys between POE and Wx-Loop SEBASPER
