The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Natural
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Natural syntax configuration files
  userid:      SAPER (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Config::Simple Config::General

  rationale:

    Config::Natural is a module created for parsing configuration files
    with a simple and easily readable syntax and present the result as a
    Perl object. The OO interface proposes a param() method as CGI.pm
    and HTML::Template objects.

    Why creating Yet Another Configuration Module? Simply because I
    began to write this module three years ago, before Config::Simple,
    Config::General or any other configuration module were published on
    CPAN (AFAIK. I may be wrong, of course :-) At this time it was still
    named Data::Config, but after asking for advice on module-authors, I
    renamed it to Config::Natural.

    Aside reading "key=value"-type configuration files, Config::Natural
    also offers features that seem to be unavailable in others modules,
    like nested lists or the possibility to change the symbols of the
    syntax, in order to allow the user to adapt it to its own needs. I
    think it's interesting for the user because he or she is not bound
    to the choices I made concerning the syntax and has a degree of
    freedom to adapt Config::Natural to its own config syntax.

    I am unable to evaluate the current popularity of this module but I
    have implemented some features upon users requests and have also
    provided support to a few others, so I guess I'm not the only guy to
    use it :-)

    Thanks for reading
