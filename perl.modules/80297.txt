     why:

    As part of my job at a University Bioinformatics facility I develop
    perl code for training and to support research. I would like to
    contribute some of these modules through a PAUSE account to more
    conveniently distribute them to my end users. Also I wish to allow
    training materials requiring these modules to be more easily
    implemented by other institutions.
