That would be a good suggestion except that Test::Unit is already a module
by Christian Lemburg. The Test::Unit module is a literal translation
of JUnit into Perl. The author maintains the same class structure and
uses inheritance to accomplish relationships which can be more easily
accomplished with Perl's rich data structures.

My rendition of JUnit is much more in the spirit of Perl and is much
easier to use.

I would like to put this out there as a simpler alternative to Test::Unit.

Makes coming up with a name difficult.

How about Test::Punit or Test::PerlUnit?
