this is just to note that Steve replied to me in private and has given me
COMAINT for Class::Generate and I published some new releases:

* https://metacpan.org/release/SHLOMIF/Class-Generate-1.12

* https://metacpan.org/release/SHLOMIF/Class-Generate-1.13

I have dealt with the open issues as well.

One can find the repository for Class-Generate here:

* https://github.com/shlomif/perl-Class-Generate

Steve, thanks again.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
