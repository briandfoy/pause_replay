Andy Lester has recently assigned the following modules to my CPAN id:
	Apache-AxKit-Language-XSP-ObjectTaglib
	AxKit-XSP-Minisession


See
	http://use.perl.org/~petdance/journal/21820
	http://use.perl.org/~petdance/journal/21260
for further details.

It's been a week, and it doesn't look like permissions have made the 
switch. The modules are still assigned to SImon and they don't show up 
when I log into PAUSE [user: CLACO].

Thanks,
-=Chris
