The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Symantec::PCAnywhere::Profile::CHF
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Manipulate pcAnywhere connection profiles
  userid:      KULP (Darren Kulp)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parse::Binary

  rationale:

    This class descends from another class I have created,
    Symantec::PCAnywhere::Profile.

    I am not familiar with any sufficiently general modules with which
    this could be associated; please let me know where to put this
    module if a new root namespace is not justified. I am not certain
    whether Parse::Binary is intended to be a namespace for this sort of
    thing; at the moment, this module is not compatible with
    Parse::Binary.

    This module is, as far as I know, unique; no other Symantec- or
    pcAnywhere-related modules can be found on CPAN. It is based on
    public-domain code (referenced in the documentation), to which
    several key features have been added.

    I have found this module to be useful in my own (rather
    specialized) work, and would like to make it available to others.
    This is my first CPAN module, and indeed my first real contribution
    to the F/OSS community; I consider it my "foot in the door," and as
    such, I would like as much advice as you are willing to give in
    order to make this a good experience for everyone. :-)

    Thank you for your consideration.
