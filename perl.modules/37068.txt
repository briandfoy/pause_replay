The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::ReportWriter::PagingAndSorting
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Paging/sorting logic for HTML::ReportWriter
  userid:      OPIATE (Shane Allen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Paging, HTML::Paging::SQL

  rationale:

    I am in the process of creating HTML::ReportWriter, whose namespace
    I will request separately. This module handles all the paging and
    sorting functionality required by HTML::ReportWriter. It can be used
    stand-alone as well.

    The related modules don't quite do what mine does, in that none of
    them seem to be a complete solution that handles both paging and
    sorting, nor do they handle all the components of paging/sorting.

    For example, they may draw the HTML, but won't generate the SQL
    clause to limit the result set. By not handling that aspect of
    paging, they add complexity to the task of the developer who is
    using their module.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::ReportWriter::
::PagingAndSorting RdpOp Paging/sorting logic for HTML::ReportWriter  OPIATE
