Subject: Module submission Business::CCProcessor

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::CCProcessor
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Pass transaction off to secure processor
  userid:      HESCO (Hugh Esco)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    PerlMonks.org

  similar:
    Business::OnlinePayment

  rationale:

    Business::CCProcessor, as I envision it being called right now,
    would permit a script to collect non-financial data locally and then
    using an http POST call, hand that data off to a secure credit card
    processor which then collects the credit card parameters, and
    processes the transaction between the credit card owners account and
    the script owners account. This is a poor man's variant on
    Business::OnlinePayment for clients who cannot afford the video
    camera watched locked cages around their server, to collect credit
    card payments from their buyers or donors, in a real-time
    interaction with the credit card owner.

    Business::OnlinePayment allows a script to accept credit card data
    from an end user or other source and process a transaction of funds
    between the account represented by the credit card data and the
    account owned by the merchant which deploys the script.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::CCProcessor     adpOg Pass transaction off to secure processor     HESCO
