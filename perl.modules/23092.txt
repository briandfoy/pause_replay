The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Java::Build
  DSLIP:       bdhhp
  description: Controls Java builds from Perl
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    None I could find

  rationale:

    Ant is the usual tool for building Java projects, but it is not a
    scripting language and is certainly not as useful as Perl.
    Therefore, my boss asked me to write a Perl based build system. By
    using Inline::Java, I have solved the key problem Ant was meant to
    solve: launching too many Java Virtual Machines for compiling. Using
    Java::Build::JVM you have exactly one JVM for compiling.

    I had previously requested a different name for this module, but
    never received confirmation. I like this name better.

The resulting entry would be:

Java::
::Build           bdhhp Controls Java builds from Perl               PHILCROW
