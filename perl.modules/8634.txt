I recently found out that CGI::Session module has been regestered,but
nothing has been done yet (by Zed)

But at the same time, i recenly uploaded my CGI::Session series and would
like to take over the regestered CGI::Session. Or could you recommend any
other namespace for this library?

I tried to contact Zed, but could get in touch with him.

And frankly, Perl is a blue-collar language, and a bit into populism,
and so I'll tend to favor blue-collar words over white-collar, all
other things being equal, which they never, ever are, for a language
designer.
