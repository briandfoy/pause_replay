The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ensure
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Ensures no undefined subroutines or exports
  userid:      GMCH (Chris Hall)
  chapterid:   27 (Pragma)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, Perl5-Porters, PerlMonks

  similar:
    B::Lint strict

  rationale:

    The module package is available at:

    <http://www.highwayman.com/perls/ensure-1.05.tar.gz>

    The module creates a CHECK block, which looks for undefined
    subroutines, as best it can. It also exports an 'import', which
    looks for exporting undefined things before handing off to the usual
    Exporter::import. Almost tangentially, the 'import' also recognises
    some special tags: :ALL, :NONE and :IMPLICIT. Stuff which is known
    not to be defined at compile time may be declared so by 'no ensure
    ....'.

    This module does something which might be expected to be done by
    'strict'. It is intended to be used much like 'strict' -- that is,
    be permanently included in all programs/packages.

    This indicates that a pragma name is appropriate.

    If this sort of extended compile-time checking proves generally
    useful, one could consider moving it into the Perl compilation
    system. The existing checking cannot help with undefined methods,
    which could be an avenue for development.

    B::Lint is more wide-ranging, and expected to be an occasional
    check, to be remembered during development.

The resulting entry would be:
