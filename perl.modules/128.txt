Hi.

I'm wondering if I should upload template processing module
which is similar to existing Text::Template module.

Major differences are

  1. It's seems to be 20-30% faster.

  2. It has simpler API.

  3. It has more strict syntax for importing/exporting
     data from/to template namespace (though Text::Template
     compatible method is also supported).

  4. It lacks quoting mechanism which Text::Template provides.
     It's already in as a source, but I've commented it out
     since it seems to make things slower by 2-3%.

Yes, I know people don't want to see yet another template
processing module, so I did think about contributing the
diffs instead. But internal implementation seems to be very
different (my module was already there before I knew of
Text::Template - I've been using this for nearly a year),
it's probably hard to merge two together.

If there's no problem to upload module which has similar
feature to existing one, I'm planning to upload with the
name Text::SimpleTemplate.

Any suggestion (on module name, upload policy, or anything) is welcome.

P.S. By the way, how do I do discussion here? It seems this list can't
     be subscribed, but then, where should I register to receive email?
     Do I have to do copy-and-paste from web browser?
