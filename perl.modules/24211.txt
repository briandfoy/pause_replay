The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Petrophysics::Units
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Units of measurement as used in petrophysics
  userid:      STEINSBO (Bjarne Steinsbo)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    ospetro-discussion@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Math::Unit, Physics::Unit

  rationale:

    Namespace choice: Difficult to defend "Petrophysics" since I'm not
    a 100% certain myself if this is the best choice. The choice has
    more to do with traditions in the old, big, rich, specialized
    science/engineering-based petroleum industry than logic and a desire
    to define it as "just applied geophysics". Additionally, handling
    units of measurement is more fundamental than petrophysics, so the
    two parts of the name should perhaps be reversed...

    Maybe "Physics::Geo::Applied::Units::Petroleum_industry" is a
    "better" choice, but as far as I know there is no accepted
    classification for the different sciences. I do know that quite a
    few chemists will get upset if you try to argue that chemistry is
    "just applied physics".

    Uniqueness of my approach: The other unit manipulation modules are
    mainly doing just that, manipulating the units of measurement. This
    module will work off an existing database of units (ca. 2000 units
    defined by POSC), and only do conversion of measured data from one
    unit to another. It's not able to do manipulation of the units as
    such at all.

    It's the difference between saying that a speed is a length divided
    by time, and converting between miles/hour and meters/second. OK, it
    must be admitted that Physics::Unit also do limited conversion, but
    its algorithm for doing this is so "primitive" that it can't work
    with a unit like "degrees Fahrenheit". It's only using a conversion
    factor (y = Ax) (and it's not a trivial change to fix that) whereas
    this module is converting using four different factors by the
    formula y = (A + Bx)/(C + Dx). So where Physics::Unit is failing to
    convert between Kelvin and Fahrenheit because there is an offset,
    this module will even allow you to convert between "meters per
    second" and "microsecond per foot" (note the reciprocal).
    Extravagant/stupid (and should not be allowed)? Yes, but exactly
    that conversion is needed by the petroleum industry for acoustic
    logs.
