The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::PObject
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: presistent object framework for Perl
  userid:      SHERZODR (Sherzod Ruzmetov)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://author.handalak.com/

  similar:
    Class::Struct

  rationale:

    Class::PObject works very much like Class::Struct, but created
    objects can store themselves into disk using either of 'file', 'cvs'
    or 'mysql' drivers. Approach of Class::PObject for solving object
    persistency is different from other alternative solutions - major
    difference is its interface - simple and intuitive.

    You can refer to its online manual for details.

  enteredon:   Mon Jun  9 02:53:09 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::PObject         bdpOp presistent object framework for Perl         SHERZODR
