     * a description of what you're planning to contribute

Mail::Audit         adpO  Tool for building mail filters a la procmail 
CTAN                cmph  CPAN-like installer for TeX Archive Network
String::Tokeniser   RdpO  Tokenising tool for building parsers
Lingua::EL::Inflect cdpf  Inflections for Greek nouns and verbs

     * It would be very nice if you could also send a note about where
       you have discussed some or all parts of your contribution
       publicly, and if there was at least a little bit of interest. 

Mail::Audit has been discussed on Efnet #perl, where there was some testing
and desire for release; CTAN (also known as TPM, the TeX Package Manager) has
been discussed in depth on comp.text.tex and is also the subject of a busy
mailing list. String::Tokeniser and Lingua::EL::Inflect just came straight 
out of my head.
