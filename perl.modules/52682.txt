The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JE
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) Engine
  userid:      SPROUT (Father Chrysostomos)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    JavaScript JavaScript::SpiderMonkey

  rationale:

    This module will be a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine. I
    was originally planning to call it JavaScript::Engine. But since it
    will have many modules under it, I thought a shorter name, "JE,"
    would be better, following the example of PPI. That would save
    people (or just me?) from having to type
    "JavaScript::Engine::Object::Error::ReferenceError".

    This differs from both other JavaScript modules in that it is
    implemented in Perl, and consequently does not require the
    installation of a separate library, or a C compiler.

    Objects (not just strings) will be able to be passed between Perl
    and JS with this module.

  enteredby:   SPROUT (Father Chrysostomos)
  enteredon:   Sat Jan 20 00:35:46 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

JE                cdpOp Pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) Engine     SPROUT
