Confirmed. ftp.funet.fi, the CPAN master site, has a RAID problem
since over a week and is running in degraded mode. Apparently they
have decided to not run the mirror process anymore until the problem
is fixed.

I don't know how long it will take to recover the disks in Finland. I
guess we should better wait another few days before we start
redesigning the whole CPAN mirroring tree.
