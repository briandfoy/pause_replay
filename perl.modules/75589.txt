As far as I know, there is no known-good solution to this dilemma. In 
the end, we've almost always gotten a Yay/Nay response from the original 
author on issues like this.

Some general considerations on the topic that were written by Andreas, 
brian, and myself (IIRC) can be found in the "takeover" section of 
04pause.html.

Personally, I support what you intend to do. As a PAUSE admin, I have to 
say it would be really important for the general practice in these 
matters to get an ack from Matthijs.

In the end, I guess it comes down to the notion of ownership of a 
namespace, not the code. The code's licensed under the same terms as 
perl itself, so as long as you acknowledge the copyright of the original 
author and keep the license the same, I see no *legal* issue with your 
doing pretty much anything else with the code. As for the namespace, I 
believe the ulterior responsibility lies with the people who run the 
whole PAUSE system. That would be Andreas and a few others. "Ownership" 
of a module == namespace is a very fuzzy thing, probably with little to 
no legal interpretation. The policy of the PAUSE/CPAN admins has been 
explicitly vague with the motivation to protect the authors of modules 
without closing all loopholes to do (something close to) the right thing 
if somebody disappears. This is what the aforementioned 04pause.html 
tries to convey.

I realize that this does not provide a solution for your (or our) 
dilemma. But maybe it helps you make some sense of the hand-waving.

Finally let me say that yes, primary maintainership also comes with a 
notion of being somewhat less restricted than "let's keep things 
minimally invasive", but it does not mean complete disregard of the work 
of another contributor (to the CPAN or perl).

Best regards,
Steffen
