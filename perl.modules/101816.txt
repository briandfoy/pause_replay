Hi Jochen,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m sorting out situations w=
here CPAN distributions have split ownership, or missing permissions. The=
re are a number of these situations involving your account.

The quick version of this email: if you are no longer maintaining your CP=
AN distributions, you can just tell me that, and I=E2=80=99ll sort things=
 out. Read on for the details.

Msql-Mysql-modules=C2=A0has 15 modules in the index. You have the first-c=
ome permission on one of them, Andreas has first-come on one other, and t=
he rest have no indexing permission. Two of the modules are indexed again=
st an old release, because they were dropped in more recent releases. Thi=
s distribution hasn=E2=80=99t been released in 19 years, so I suspect you=
 don=E2=80=99t plan to do any more releases. To resolve this, I propose t=
hat we (a) delete the old releases on CPAN, leaving just the most recent =
one from 2001, and (b) either give you first-come on all modules, or ANDK=
, or just mark it as available for adoption (essentially marking it as ab=
andoned).

SNMP-Monitor=C2=A0is similar: you have first-come on one module, and ther=
e are no indexing permissions on the rest. Again, I propose that either w=
e mark it as available for adoption, or I can give you back all permissio=
ns.

Wizard=C2=A0was first released by user AMAR, in 1999, and then you did tw=
o releases, also in 1999. I suggest the best thing is to give AMAR all pe=
rmissions, as the originating author, unless you=E2=80=99re planning a co=
meback, 21 years later=3F ;-)

Wizard-LDAP=C2=A0is similar to Wizard: you and AMAR have permissions, but=
 there are some modules with no permissions. Having seen both of these, I=
=E2=80=99m guessing that neither you nor AMAR have any plans to do furthe=
r releases, so again marking them for adoption is perhaps the best plan=3F=


I=E2=80=99ve copied Andreas (ANDK) and Amarendran (AMAR) on this email, s=
o they can chip in if they would like permissions given to them.

Otherwise, my guess is that you dropped your permission some years back, =
having decided you won=E2=80=99t be maintaining your CPAN distributions a=
ny more=3F If so, then the right thing to do is to mark all for adoption,=
 and delete all releases that are causing conflict. How does that sound=3F=


Cheers,
Neil
