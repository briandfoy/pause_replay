Description of first planned contribution:

This module will solve "cryptoquotes" very efficiently.  Cryptoquotes are
puzzles in which every letter in a quote is substituted for another letter.
These can typically be found in newspaper puzzle sections.

DSLI entry:

Games::
::Cryptoquote bdpf Solves cryptoquotes BOB-O

Discussion:

There has been no public discussion of this module, however I think the
Games:: namespace could use really cool things like this. :)
