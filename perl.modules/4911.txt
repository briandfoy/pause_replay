	I've got two modules that I'd like to contribute to CPAN.
I've sent a couple of emails about them to modules@perl.org in the past,
but never got any response, so I'm trying again.  (I tried just=20
uploading them to PAUSE, which worked but didn't accomplish much, I now
realize; is there any way to delete those files from my directory
(S/SW/SWETH)?)

	Anyway, these are the two modules:

	* The first is one that I have been calling Parse::Syslog;
it's a fairly simple OO module that defines some methods for parsing
syslog files by converting each syslog record into a data object with
vaguely canonicalized structure.  I also have a bunch of submodules
like Parse::Syslog::Snort and Parse::Syslog::Named, which does the same
thing for syslog messages from specific applications; I'm still waiting
to get the appropriate paperwork taken care of by my former employer so
that I can release those modules, however.

	* The second one I've been calling Net::Address:IPv4; it's
a set of functions to validate, convert, and manipulate IPv4 addresses
in different formats, so that scripts can do tests like
`if (IsValidIP ($ip_address, 'hex')' or
`if (IsValidMaskDottedQuad ($ip_address)', conversions like
`$decimal_ip =3D DottedQuad2Dec ($ip_address)', or things like
'@subnet_ips =3D EnumerateSubnetIPs ($network_address, $netmask)'.

	Are those namespaces appropriate, or should I change them?
