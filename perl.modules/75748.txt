Hi Robert,

In 2009 you registered with PAUSE the name WWW::RottenTomatoes but
there's nothing on CPAN right now. Casey Vega would like to upload an
implementation with that namespace.

Unless there's an objection from you (and some code shows up), the
PAUSE admins are going to transfer the namespace to Casey.

Thanks,
