That=92s what=92s happening. I just put the dummy module there so that I =
=20
could type =91install App::Anarch=92 at the cpan prompt. (I might move =
the =20
code into a real module later.)

I would suggest that you either change the part that writes the =20
02.packages.details.txt file (which, unfortunately, would slow down =20
module installation considerably for everyone because the file would =20
be significantly bigger) or provide a warning message in the pause =20
indexer report.

Also, is there a way to run a =91trial indexing=92 on a distribution, =20=

either before uploading it, or on a dev version?
