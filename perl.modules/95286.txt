     why:

    A set of modules described on comp.lang.perl.modules on 30 May
    2016:

    Archive::MultiSplit Archive::MultiSplit::Interactive
    Archive::MultiSplit::ZfsDR

    The first (base) module provides the majority of the functionality,
    which is to provide split(1) and cat(1) like behavior, but with the
    ability to not only split the input stream into multiple files, but
    also distribute those files across multiple filesystems, where we
    might have only one target filesystem mounted at a time. It defines
    hooks to be invoked when such a volume/filesystem change is
    required.

    The second module provides hooks necessary (and a driving script)
    necessary to run the first two in a pipeline, something like: tar
    -cf - /some-big-filesystem | multisplit multicat | (cd
    /some-big-filesystem; tar -xpBf - )

    The third module provides additional functionality, on an OS that
    has ZFS, to take very large ZFS data sets (ie: filesystems) and
    produce a set of disaster recovery volumes on removable hard disks,
    as well as the inverse operation.
