IO::Socket::INET::Server would be fine, too, but I'd rather like to have
IO::Socket::INET::Daemon if that's possible, since I plan to add some
demonic features (forking the daemon to background, forking new
processes for incoming connections (optionally), probably more...). Do I
need to file another namespace request or can I "reuse" this one for the
other namespace?

Best wishes,
Jonas
