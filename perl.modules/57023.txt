Dear sir,

I have re-written the File::Compare module into a more robust program. It
seems the module on cpan is quite old, although I know there is a newer
version, 1.003 I believe. I am interested in uploading my newer version of
the module and would be very interested in any feedback you may have on
the issue.

I will wait for your reply before doing anything.

Sincerely,
Mr Kevn Ruggles
