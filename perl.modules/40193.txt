Subject: Module submission Class::DBI::Plugin::DeepAbstractSearch

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::DBI::Plugin::DeepAbstractSearch
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: deep_search_where() method for Class::DBI
  userid:      SRIHA (Stepan Riha)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    cdbi-talk@groups.kasei.com

  similar:
    Class::DBI::AbstractSearch

  rationale:

    An existing CDBI::AbstractSearch module provides an SQL::Abstract
    interface for searching based on fields in a single table.

    The new CDBI::Plugin::DeepAbstractSearch also uses the
    SQL::Abstract interface, but allows for searching (and sorting)
    based on fields in tables related through 'has_a' relationship
    chains. The module generates SQL with the appropriate joins required
    for the query. For example (using the sample CDBI example classes)
    you could search for a list of CDs based on their artist's name like
    so:

    my @cds = Music::CD->deep_search_where( { 'artist.name' => $name },
    { order_by => 'artist.name, title' );

    Although it provides a proper superset in functionality, IMO, this
    module is not really suited as an enhancement of the existing
    CDBI::AbstractSearch, since that module is more efficient for
    searching based on a single table. Also, the new module requires
    Class::DBI 0.96 while CDBI::AbstractSearch only requires Class::DBI
    0.90.

    The CDBI::Plugin namespace is the proper place for plugin modules
    such as this one, at least according to Tony Bowden.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::DBI::Plugin::
::DeepAbstractSearch bdpOp deep_search_where() method for Class::DBI    SRIHA
