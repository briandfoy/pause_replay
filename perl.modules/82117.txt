Robert,

   I packaged Net::Citadel for Debian, and while doing so found a
documentation bug (#71743 at rt.cpan.org), which apparently has not yet
been responded to.  (I may have found another documentation bug as well,
but I want to verify it before reporting it.)

   Besides issues like that, I would very much like to see additional
functionality added to Net::Citadel, directly in Net::Citadel and/or in
additional modules in the same name space.  Do you have plans for doing
anything like that?  I plan to work on functionality for the MRTG
command as well as at least something for messages.

   If you are not planning to do any updates to it in the near future,
I'd be hap[y to work on it myself more directly, perhaps as a
co-maintainer of the module.  Please let me know what you think.

   Thanks!
