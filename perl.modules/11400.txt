After browsing a bit I think PCL::Simple might be best.

I say this because PCL is an alternative to Postscript, and Postscript is a
toplevel namespace.  If a programmer is browsing modules by name it would be
best for him to see both Postscript and PCL choices at the top level.  While
there is nothing yet in Perl, there are commercial packages that churn out
whiz-bang formatted documents entirely in PCL.  This toplevel namespace would
explicitly make room for more robust alternatives to Postscript.

Also, there is a Postscript::Simple module, so this module would provide a
direct alternative (though Postscript::Simple does more :-).

No, and the only module it uses is Exporter.
