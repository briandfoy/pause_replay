First, let me say that we're not deleting *any* files from CPAN. This is
just about the appearance in the modules list.

Now, more importantly, you're among those who received the mail in
error. Since your package doesn't contain a .pm file with "package
PDL::NetCDF;" in it, the indexer can't index it correctly. Thus my
script thought, you never uploaded an implementation. It doesn't know
that PDL auto-generates the .pm file on installation.

This isn't a great state to be in since the link under "Registered
Modules" on your search.cpan.org authors page points to nirvana and the
cpan shell might have problems installing the module as "cpan
PDL::NetCDF" since it can't find it in the indexes.

I'm not sure how to fix this. Other PDL authors are in the same spot.
I'll think about this some more, but currently, we're swamped with
replies :)

You'll keep your registration, that's for sure.

Best regards,
Steffen
