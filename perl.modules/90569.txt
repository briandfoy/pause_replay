     why:

    I've been working on a GCode Interpreter that understands Ultimaker
    Gcode and tells you how the state of the (simulated) printer, how
    long it takes to execute etc. This can then be used to work our how
    long jobs will take to print, and how much filament they'll need to
    do it. I've got a rough script that can be used to do this on the
    Unix command line, which also serves as an example of how to use the
    library.
