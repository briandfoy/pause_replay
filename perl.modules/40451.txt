Subject: Module submission Net::OpenSoundControl

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::OpenSoundControl
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: OpenSound Control client and server
  userid:      CRENZ (Christian Renz)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Discussed on U of Berkeley's OSC mailing list, modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a follow-up on the recent discussion about Audio::OSC.
    Based on feedback by brian d foy, I changed the name to
    Net::OpenSoundControl (from the old name Audio::OSC). An updated
    distribution has already been uploaded. I also changed the category
    to Networking/IPC.

    As soon as the module has been accepted, I will inform the users of
    the module of the change (at least those that I know) and remove
    Audio::OSC from CPAN.

    old rationale follows: OpenSound Control ("OSC") is a network
    protocol on top of TCP or UDP that allows audio applications to send
    commands to each other for e.g. sound synthesis. (Actually, it could
    be seen as a generic RPC mechanism, but in practice is used for
    audio and video control.) It was developed at U of Berkeley and is
    used both in commercial (MAX/MSP, Reaktor, ...) and non-commercial
    (Csound, SuperCollider, ...) software.

    Audio::OSC implements the OSC standard in pure Perl. It has
    superseded the previously used (buggy) XS Perl modules that directly
    linked to a (buggy) C library. It was discussed on the OSC
    mailinglist and is used by several artists and composers for their
    performances.
