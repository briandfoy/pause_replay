The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Pngslimmer
  DSLIP:       bmpfp
  description: Slim down on the fly generated PNGs
  userid:      ACMCMEN (Adrian McMenamin)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    The mailist pngslimmer - email pngslimmer-join@transpero.net

  similar:
    Image::Magick

  rationale:

    I needed some perl to make some PNGs I was generating smaller, so I
    wrote this code and I am using it myself - I thought it would be
    good to make it available to others and I think the chosen namespace
    makes the basic purpose of the code relatively clear.

    Modules such as Image::Magick generate PNG images on the fly and
    these may be used in applications such as J2ME where even small
    savings in file size can make a difference to cost and user
    experience. Image::Pngslimmer is not the most effective code to cut
    PNG size but seems to be the only pure perl solution out there at
    the moment. It currently has just one active function to slim PNGs -
    Image::Pngslimmer::discard_noncriticial($blob) - which cuts
    non-critcal chunks from a stream as well as two supporting/debigging
    functions - ispng($blob) which tests for basic PNG compliance of the
    supplied stream of bytes and analyze($blob) which returns an array
    of strings describing the PNG represented by the byte stream.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::Pngslimmer      bmpfp Slim down on the fly generated PNGs          ACMCMEN
