     why:

    Tk::WidgetTag - allows you to tag widgets much like tagging canvas
    objects.

    Tk::SmartBind - provides an alternative to Tk::bind that allows you
    to bind multiple callbacks to one event. It also works with
    Tk::WidgetTag, allowing you to easily bind and unbind groups of
    widgets at one time. This results in simpler, easier to maintain
    code.

    Tk::MWI (In Developement) - provides an MDI like environment for
    pTk

    And I'm sure there is more to come :-)
