The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Leapyear
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Is a particular year a leap year
  userid:      RBOW (Rich Bowen)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org

  similar:
    Many date modules implement this functionality

  rationale:

    I find that almost all of my Date:: modules implement an isleap()
    function. The alternative is loading an enormous module such as
    Date::Manip for this one function. Having a Date::Leapyear (or
    perhaps Date::LeapYear or Date::Leap) module that implemented just
    this one function would remove the need to have this function
    repeated so many places. So I suppose this is for purely selfish
    reasons.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::Leapyear        idpfp Is a particular year a leap year             RBOW
