Hello,
my name is Guido Socher. I have been using perl for many year
and I would like to give something useful back to the community.

My email is: guido (at) linuxfocus.org

I would be glad if you could create a PAUSE account for
me. Pefered Id is: GUS.

The module that I would like to start with is called Tagreader:

http://main.linuxfocus.org/~guido/index.html#Tagreader

It's an efficient way to process a html file by tags.
(just like while(<>) can process a text file by line.)

Regards
 Guido
