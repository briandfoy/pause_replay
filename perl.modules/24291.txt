Dear Friend,
Good day to you,firstly my name is Mr.Peters Mayoka.
My father was the chairman of contract review panel in my country before the =
problem of the land reform program in my country Zimbabwe. Before the
escalation of the situation in Zimbabwe my father recovered $28.500,000 =
Million US dollars from over inflated contracts by some government officials. =
But he was a member of the opposition party the MDC (Movement for Democratic =
Change), and the ruling Party, (ZANU PF) has been against us.
So he had to flee the country for Europe(THE NETHERLANDS)which I am
currently seeking political asylum.
Before the escalation of the situation in Zimbabwe he had not reported the
recovery of his findings to the panel. So this money was in his possession
and I lodged it in a security company in Africa and currently this
money has been moved to their security branch in Europe. I and my father have =
been trying to seek a partner,but it has been difficult for us it was in this =
proccess my decided to go to Africa where he was arressted and died in jail. =

So it is as a result of this I am seeking you to help me make claims of this =
fund($28.5m) in Europe as the beneficiary and transfer the money to your =
account or any account of your choice.
So that we can share this money.
I have agreed to offer you 20% of this money for your assistance, and 70%
would be mine and the other 10% would be set aside for any expenses that we
may incure during the course of this transaction. And part of my 60% would
be invested in your country in any profitable business proposed by you. We
have never met,but I want to trust you and please do not let me down when
this fund finally gets into your account. Please if you are interested, get
to me through the email address enable me feed you with more details and all =
necessary documentations.
Please treat this as confidential
Yours faithfully,
P.MAYOKA.
