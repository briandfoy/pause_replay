David,
 
Heres the link to that site you wanted,
 
http://www.evidence-eliminator.com/go.shtml?A654477

By the way, remember my mate Paul from London, well check this out.  
 
He knows one of the team at Robin Hood Software the makers of this product, now, if you click on the 
above link & when you get there, just add ++ after the A65477 bit in the address bar,
 it gives it to you for half price.
 
Pretty fucking good eh!.  You owe me for this one mate, OK

Anyway, about Anne-Marie's Birthday Dinner,  I can't make it as I will be away that week.  
Do me a favour will you, tell her I am sorry and we will have to go out for dinner when I get back.  My shout.
 
Ok, Got to go mate, catch ya when I get back,
 
See ya mate

Bazza
