Hello!

Let me apply for a right of co-maintenance.

I am writing a new version of Perl/Qt (for Qt4), but my modules have the same namespace as the first version does.
I have found out that Ashley Winters (AWIN) is the author of it. He is a modulelist of all Qt modules.
But his e-mail is not valid as my letter asking of co-maintainer granting failed.
Ashley Winters' last module on CPAN bears a date of 2003.

Would You be so kind to grant me a right of co-maintainer on all Qt modules?

Thank You beforehand.

    Looking forward to hearing from You,
