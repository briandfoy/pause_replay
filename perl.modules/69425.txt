Yes, I can get at CRITICRE fine.

It looks like s.c.o is no longer showing unauthorized for most of the modules that were having issues yesterday; I don't know what's different about those because the permissions shown in PAUSE haven't changed.  The three you mention here didn't have correct ownership until yesterday, but this was fixed prior to my initial email.

Just to clarify the way that mailinglist permissions are supposed to work, even though THALJEF is not listed as having co-maint on Perl::Critic::Policy::Objects::ProhibitIndirectSyntax, he should have full upload rights due to CRITICRE owning it, correct?
