Hi Alex,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m emailing you because =
I=E2=80=99m working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now =
considering package names case insensitively. This has left us with some =
situations where two or more people are owners of namespaces previously =
considered distinct, and now considered the same.

You have ownership of the =E2=80=9Csettings=E2=80=9D namespace, as you =
have a settings module in your =E2=80=9COpener_chat=E2=80=9D =
distribution. This now conflicts with the Settings module, owned by =
MARKPF.

There are a number of ways this could be resolved.
You could release a new version with =E2=80=9Csettings=E2=80=9D renamed =
to Opener_chat::settings, or similar.
Another option: this was last released in 2009, and isn=E2=80=99t =
packaged as a full CPAN distribution. If you=E2=80=99re not maintaining =
this any more, then we could delete it from CPAN, and then free up the =
associated permissions.

Which option would you like to go with?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more, so I=E2=80=99=
m tidying up the historical cases.

Cheers,
Neil
