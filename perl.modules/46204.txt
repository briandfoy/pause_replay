Hi, 

I'm just reporting what seems to be a minor bug parsing module versions 
in the CPAN indexer.

The module that was parsed incorrectly was DBIx::DBSchema::DBD::Pg.  The 
version was parsed as "1".  The actual version is "0.10".

>      module: DBIx::DBSchema::DBD::Pg
>     version: 1
>     in file: DBIx-DBSchema-0.28/DBSchema/DBD/Pg.pm
>      status: indexed

Perhaps the parser was tripped up by this funky code at the beginning 
of the file:

  die "DBD::Pg version 1.32 or 1.41 (or later) required--".
      "this is only version $DBD::Pg::VERSION\n"
    if $DBD::Pg::VERSION != 1.32 && $DBD::Pg::VERSION < 1.41;

Please let me know if there's a better place to report this (an 
rt.cpan.org queue for the indexer or something?) or if there's any other 
information I can provide.  Obviously its not a huge deal, just thought 
it might be useful to have this on record.
