     why:

    I have done considerable work on forking the Reddit api wrapper by
    Jon A (who appears to have abandoned the project in an unfinished
    state: http://search.cpan.org/~jon/Reddit-0.30.03/lib/Reddit.pm). My
    fork supports many more functions, contains clearer documentation,
    and sports a redone object oriented framework utilizing Mouse.

    Additionally, I have ideas for future modules and would greatly
    enjoy contributing to CPAN and the Perl community in general.
