  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Fix the memory leak bug of Thread::Queue
  userid:      RANN (灿烂微笑 / Ran Ningyu)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Thread::Queue

  rationale:

    There is serious memory leak bug in the Thread::Queue posted in
    2002. it is caused by the thread::share do not support shift & push
    func to shared arrays. Since i can't contact to the author, I post
    my solve here in the hope that the Thread::Queue could be fixed some
    time.

  enteredby:   RANN (灿烂微笑 / Ran Ningyu)

The resulting entry would be:

Thread::
