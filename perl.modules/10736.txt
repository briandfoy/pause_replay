Subject: Module submission Uttu

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Uttu
  DSLIP:       amhOp
  description: web application driver
  userid:      JSMITH (James G Smith)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modperl@perl.apache.org, mason-users@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    It can be considered a meta-content handler -- it uses HTML::Mason
    (and can use others, though the code hasn't been written) to manage
    content

  rationale:

    Uttu makes using HTML::Mason simple, especially in a virtual host
    environment. It also allows easy distribution of web applications.

    Uttu sits atop Apache. A framework is built on Uttu that provides
    an environment in which applications may be written -- the framework
    provides such things as authentication, authorization, session
    management, etc. Things that are not application-specific.

    Two packages have been placed on CPAN: Uttu-0.01.tar.gz which
    contains the Uttu.pm module and associated code;
    Uttu-Framework-Uttu-0.01.tar.gz which contains an example framework
    which is being developed for a website containing the documentation
    and information about Uttu-based applications and frameworks.

    This is the second request for a namespace (in January or early
    February, I believe). No response was seen to the previous request
    and development continued using the Uttu name.

  enteredby:   JSMITH (James G Smith)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 20 22:20:12 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Uttu              amhOp web application driver                       JSMITH
