Hi,

I got your name from Tanya Bibeau in the Industry 
Issues group. She said you were a top notch bulker,
and I'm looking for high-volume mailers to sell 
Pinacle, an herbal male enhancement pill.  Some guys
are making over $12,000 per week with this program,
and I would be happy to provide references if you
email me or call me.  I pay $20 per sale, payout is 
every day, and I provide complete stats.  I'd love 
for you to start mailing for me!  Just shoot me an 
email and I can set you up with the program right 
away. Thanks, and bulk on!

--Dave
