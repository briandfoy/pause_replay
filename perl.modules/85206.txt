The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SysConf
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Create/Read/Update files in sysconfig dirs
  userid:      LANDMAN (Joseph Landman)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Unfortunately, none, though there are some closely named modules for
    very different functionality

  rationale:

    In short, the Red Hat/CentOS /etc/sysconfig/* tree is full of key
    value storage in terms of files. This module is an attempt to
    provide a very simple interface to manipulating these files. Though
    the module is sufficiently general, and not specific to Linux OSes,
    that it could be used with any similar file type on any operating
    system that has them.

    The naming scheme is indicative of the use case. This is designed
    to be a very straight forward solution to handle programmatic
    manipulation of these files.

  enteredby:   LANDMAN (Joseph Landman)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 18 02:02:21 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SysConf           adpOg Create/Read/Update files in sysconfig dirs   LANDMAN
