I'm not sure this is the correct location for it.

You are creating not only a new top level, but a new second level 
namespace as well.

I'm relatively happy to see a new Schema:: top level to hold such 
things, with defined schemas of various types.

I'm not sure the RBDMS is necesary.

Schema::AUS may well be just fine. (Although as an Aussie it keeps 
making me thing, Australia?)
