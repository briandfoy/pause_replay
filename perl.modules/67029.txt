The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::DoubleClick
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Correct Tk Single/Double click handling
  userid:      JCNORTON (John C. Norton)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  rationale:

    Perl/Tk allows binding a widget (typically a button) to a single or
    double-click event. However, there is no native support in Perl/Tk
    for distinguishing the individual clicks of a double-click as
    different from two single-clicks. In other words, a double-click
    event will still trigger two single-click events IN ADDITION to the
    double-click event.

    This module provides a subroutine for binding mouse clicks for a
    given mouse button to two separate callbacks, a single-click and a
    double-click, by inserting waiting for a very short delay after the
    single-click occurs to see if it is followed by another
    single-click, and, if so, calling the double-click callback instead
    of the single-click callback.
