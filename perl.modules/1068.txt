It will become more common.

Tk802 (or whatever I decide to call that merge of tcl/tk) will _require_ 
perl5.6 in order to handle the UNICODE issues raised by core tk8.1+
(Note that recent perl5.5.640 is 1st perl that has right hooks in it
and that is still rather rough.)

But that may mean that Tk itself will "drag" folk to 5.005+  ;-)

In general nothing goes in TkXXX.XXX.tar.gz that needs more than basic 
perl to install. Which is why Tk::Pod and Tk::HTML etc. got un-bundled.
If I am breaking that rule anywhere let me know!
