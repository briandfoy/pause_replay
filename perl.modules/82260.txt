Actually, it has.

So we're fine.

Caelum, please either resume committing and allow some actual code review
or fork; I've done nothing abusive here, I'm simply attempting to bring
some structure to the development process.

I'm sorry you believe that I'm refusing to merge branches because I hate
you and am inventing reasons, rather than because I have genuine technical
concerns.

If you would like somebody else to review your work instead of me I'm happy
to discuss who would be acceptable to both of us.

The *only* use of PAUSE admin privileges I made was to switch to ILMARI to
modify Schema::Loader permissions, and I believe he told you he was happy
with my having done that.

I have not touched your account.

As such, this is not a matter for modules@perl.org and I won't be
replying here any further.
