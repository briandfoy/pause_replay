Hello,

The PAUSE FAQ (*CPAN*/modules/04pause.html) suggests that I ask here...

I have a Tk widget derived from Tk::Text, specifically for editing MARC
(bibliographic data) records, and I'm wondering what would be the most
appropriate namespace.

I have an older compound Tk widget for doing the same thing (much more
complex, and a maintenance nightmare, sigh), Tk::MARC, already on the CPAN.

There has been a (limited) discussion on this namespace question on the
perl4lib (Perl for libraries) mailing list; my initial thought is
Tk::MARC_Editor (as it is a Tk widget), but an alternate suggestion that ha=
s
merit is MARC::Tk::Editor (as it is MARC-centric).

In an ideal world, I could just call it Tk::MARC and pretend that the older
module doesn't exist, but the new module is *not* a drop-in replacement, an=
d
I wouldn't want to break any existing code out there.

Any help you could give would be... well... helpful.  :-)

Thanks,
David Christensen
