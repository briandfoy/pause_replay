     why:

    extention module to namespace of CGI::Application

    this is a graphing module that works as a 'CGI::Application'

    it is called

    CGI::Application::GDGraph::lines

    and is in ALPHA stage currently, I would like to publish it as such
    or BETA if that is okay.

    Likely to be added to and ammended to include

    CGI::Application::GDGraph::mixed

    once the 'lines' part of the module is stable

    I will be doing a short presentation on the above for the
    Birmingham PM group this coming wednesday (24th March 2004)

    If any is in this area of the UK, please come and visit.

    btw, my other email addresses that bigfoot alias to:
