The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Tagreader
  DSLIP:       bdcOp
  description: process html files by tag
  userid:      GUS (Guido Socher)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Parser

  rationale:

    Tagreader is a perl extension module which allows you to read
    html/xml files by tag. That is: in a similar way as you can read
    textfiles by line with "while(<>)" you use
    HTML::Tagreader::getbytoken to read a file by tag (and text).
    Although this module is also suitable to read xml code it is
    probably most useful for processing web pages in an efficient way.

    I have included a number of application programs that use Tagreader
    to modify/process html. Therefore I think that HTML::Tagreader is a
    good choice.

  enteredby:   GUS (Guido Socher)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul 16 12:41:58 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Tagreader       bdcOp process html files by tag                    GUS
