Hi,

Nope. Thompson group F is a very special case of what mathematicians
call a group. But there isn't a namespace Math::Groups.

Maybe is better to create Math::Groups since in the future new modules
for this area of the mathematics can be developed. For example, a
Math::Groups module can provide OO methods that let a developer create
mathematical groups and operate with the elements of that group, for
example:

# Create the free group generated by the letter A,B and C (all the
words that can be written with A,B,C,A^(-1),B^(-1),C^(-1) and identity
element)
my $free = Math::Groups->free('A','B','C');

or this other example

my @gen = ('A','B','C');
my @relations = ('AB');
# Create the free group generated by A,B and C modulo the relation AB
= BA (A and B commutes)
my $group = Math::Groups->presentation( GENERATORS => \@gen, RELATIONS
=> \@relations );

This hypothetical module could provide functions that allow to compare
elements with groups, or groups with other groups, for example

# if $w = 'ABA^(-1)B^(-1)AAAAC' then we can determine if $w is in
$free or $group
if(is_in($w,$free)) { # Returns true, because $free is the free group
of A,B and C

if(is_in($w,$group)) { # Returns false because on $group, A and B commutes

# Check if $group is a subgroup of $free
if(subgroup($group,$free)) { # Returns true because $free is the free
group of A,B and C

There's many properties of groups that can be translated easily to OO methods :D

Thinking about this I want to develop this Math::Groups module !!!.
But by now I have almost finished the Thompson module, so you have to
decide, Math::Groups::Thompson or Math::Thompson.

Bye
