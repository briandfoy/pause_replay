Subject: Module submission Net::Lite::FTP
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Lite::FTP
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple FTP client with TLS support
  userid:      EYCK (Dariush Pietrzak)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    module-authors

  similar:
    Net::FTP

  rationale:

    Net::Lite::FTP is working but extremely trivial and easy to modify
    implementation. Useable, but definitely not-complete, and
    completness is not a goal. Net::Lite::FTP has minimal dependencies,
    linecount is and is supposed to stay low, primary design concernes
    were TLS support and embedding (think PAR). Net::Lite::FTP is
    expected to help develop new firewall-piercing features of ftp.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Lite::
::FTP             adpOp Simple FTP client with TLS support           EYCK
