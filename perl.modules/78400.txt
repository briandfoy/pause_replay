No, that's the pumpking table and there RJBS has been put a long time
ago when he released some 5.11.something. perl-* distributions are
treated specially in the indexer, kind of "perl is always right".

Being in the pumpking list

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=3Dwho_pumpkin

means that you are allowed to upload a distribution that has a name like
perl distributions have. Not being in this list means that indexing on a
file like perl-5.12.5.tar.gz will fail.

Once a pumpking has uploaded a perl distro the indexer treats the
contained modules as belonging to P5P. That's because P5P has a
hardcoded role in the indexer.

The idea to treat perl releases specially predates the idea of group
permissions. I think it was there from the beginning. But > Since 'P5P'
is a userid that has the 'isa_list' property set it should have all the
properties of group permissions. But this has never been tested because
nobody has ever been put into the 'list2user' table for 'P5P' until
today.

So maybe it actually makes sense to put Ricardo in the list. I suppose
that he now can log into pause and choose to become user P5P for giving
away permission bits or doing some other stuff.
