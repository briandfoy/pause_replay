     why:

    There is a simple music format, called ABC. It lets you enter text
    very simply in a simple ASCII format. There are numerous renderers
    to convert the ascii to publishable quality postcript. See:

    http://www.gre.ac.uk/~walshaw/abc/index.html

    for more details.

    I built a website with a perl frontend that parses out those ABC
    song files, so there is a nice user interface:

    http://www2.redhawk.org/irish/index.pl -- While at Tom
    Christianson's Intermediate Perl course, I showed the instructor
    (paul@kooros.com) the site, and he encouraged me to develop perl
    modules for the ABC music archive files.

    And so here I am. I propose 2 perl modules (which I have up and
    running, mostly POD-ed.

    Music::ABC::Song -- object oriented module to encapsulate
    information for a song.

    Music::ABC::Archive -- object oriented module which handled the
    archive files themselves, dependent on Music::ABC::Song.

    These 2 modules provide "read-only" access to ABC archive files.
    There are a couple of places where I need to tighten up the error
    trapping, but the modules are 95% complete.

    I eventually plan to write a Music::ABC::Render module, but that
    depends on an external C program, and it will have to wait :-)

    Cheers, Jeff Welty
