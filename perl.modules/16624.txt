Matt:

Hello, I was looking for a perl package to draw corporate org charts like:
[this was done manually for illustration purposes. I can send PNGs upon request]

                                Gary
                             Home Owner
                                 |
              +------------------+------------------+
              |                                     |
             Tex                                 Dudley
          VP Backyard                          VP Frontyard
              |                                     |
        +-----+-----+                     +---------+---------+
        |           |                     |                   |
     Ophelia     Cinnamon                Jax                Maisie
   Gate Watcher  Deck Sitter       Bay Window Watcher    Door Watcher

I first looked at yours, which would produce something more like:
         Gary
          +-- Dudley
          |     +-- Jax
          |     +-- Maisie
          +-- Tex
                +-- Cinnamon
                +-- Ophelia

So, I sat down one weekend and wrote one myself.  (Actually took almost a
week of spare time to get it _working_, but...).

The primary difference I needed was to have a manager centered above his/her
subordinates.  In addition I wanted to be able to put arbitrary text in
the boxes so that a title could be included, etc.

I then picked up a book on submitting modules to the CPAN (_Writing Perl
Modules for CPAN_ by Sam Tregar) and followed the guidelines there and
tried to register the module namespace as "GD::OrgChart".  I did
upload it, however, so it is available at:
     http://search.cpan.org/author/GALGIER/GD-OrgChart-0.01/

I have since then received some feedback and the latest is:

So, here I am.

The primary differences I see between our modules are:
     Image::OrgChart                     GD::OrgChart
     ---------------                     ------------
     One line per box                    Multiple lines per box
     Drawn along left edge               Drawn with subordinates centered below
     No limit on drawing depth           Simple maxdepth argument
     Only can use GD built-in fonts      Only can use GD truetype fonts
     The box is as it is                 A call-back is available to augment
     Sorts the input                     Draws it as presented
Also, the "tree" as submitted to your module uses a different structure
from mine.

Do you want to work on combining these two modules?

Personally I see the following issues:
     1) Your data structure won't support my needs.  I want to allow
        the user to store arbitrary data in the structure in addition
        to the node names.  We would need two different sets of method
        calls.
     2) The algorithm to draw your chart has different needs as to calculations
        of spacing, box size, etc. from mine.  Again, this would need two
        different sets of methods.

Do you have any comments or suggestions?
