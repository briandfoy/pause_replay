Subject: Mirroring and/or indexing problems? (Problem finding latest Devel::ptkdb)

Hi,

I'm having a problem trying to get the latest Devel::ptkdb using 
CPANPLUS-0.049:

    CPAN Terminal> m ptkdb
    Your search generated no results

I was using the ftp.demon.co.uk mirror site, and the problem turned out 
to be that Devel::ptkdb is not listed in the 02packages.details.txt.gz 
index file from that site, even after forcing an update of that source 
file using "x --update_source".

Looking into it more closely, I find that Devel::ptkdb does actually 
exist in

    ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/CPAN/authors/id/A/AE/AEPAGE/

so why doesn't it get listed in the index file?

Looking into it more closely, I find that ftp.demon.co.uk's latest 
version of that module is 1.1087, whereas other mirror sites have more 
recent versions, e.g.

    ftp://ftp.mirror.anlx.net/CPAN/authors/id/A/AE/AEPAGE/

has 1.1090.

Both mirror sites look good according to 
http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/henkp/mirmon/cpan.html, although only 
ftp.demon.co.uk is listed on http://mirrors.cpan.org/status.cgi.

Is ftp.funet.fi the master site?  If so then then I'm even more confused 
because

    ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/A/AE/AEPAGE/

only has upto 1.1087, so where did ftp.mirror.anlx.net get 1.1090 from?

Furthermore, neither ftp.mirror.anlx.net nor ftp.funet.fi lists 
Devel::ptkdb in their index files either.

Can anybody explain what is going on here?

- Steve
