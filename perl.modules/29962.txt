Market Watch News Flash

Explosive short term trading profits in a new technology
issue (Ticker: SRGE) are being predicted as many 
significant news releases indicate strong contractual 
revenues with major Telecom firms. 

SRGE has been successfully working with Telecommunications 
giants (with five million subscriber lines) over the last 4 
years, but is now projecting "a banner expansion year with 
geometric growth in revenues" due largely to sales demands 
for their innovative patented products and expansion into 
International telecom markets.

Surge Technologies, Inc. (SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader 
that designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior 
patented outside plant electrical surge protection 
equipment for the telecommunications industry.
The US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion 
annually, with this figure growing rapidly as the 
expansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate 
the industry.

SRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest 
quality "protection element" for complex digital switches. 
Protecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to 
inclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions 
in voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus 
negating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.
Major Telecoms require this protection throughout their 
network in order to prevent the hazards of harming 
personnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive 
system failures.

How many times have you seen issues explode but you 
couldn't get your hands on them or didn't have the right 
information in time? We are alerting you now to a special 
Company with a unique technology that is on the forefront 
of a breakout! We are excited about SRGE's technology 
and expansion as they prepare to ink deal after deal with 
Major US Telecoms in conjunction with dramatic increases 
in revenue for 2004 and 2005. SRGE has made phenomenal 
advancements but may be one of the few stocks left in 
this industry group that is unknown and undervalued, 
therefore a 300%-400% jump may wind up being conservative.
