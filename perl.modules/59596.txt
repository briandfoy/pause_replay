LWP::UserAgent::ChangeProxies -- well, that IMO doesn't describe that it
is all done automatically. LWP::UserAgent::ChangeProxiesOnEveryRequest
-- hmr, too long, and I am already being mocked for having too long of
module names.

I thought about the name for a bit, and honestly I can't come up with
anything better than ::Proxify I'd love to hear suggestions. Although
past experiences tell me that this email will be ignored anyway. No
offence to anyone....
