Brian (and other list denizens),

There is already an "Objective-Perl" module, which is why I chose  
PerlTalk. I could not think of a better name, and PerlTalk is a homage  
to SmallTalk, which has inspired many languages, including Objective-C  
and now PerlTalk.

I do not quite have my module ready for upload, however, I am happy to  
resubmit when it is ready. I did not know how long before uploading  
that one should request the namespace as I have not submitted a module  
to CPAN as yet.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to uploading my work to the  
CPAN. :)
