Over the years riba and I have discussed more than once the extent to
which I enjoy mentoring way more than he does, and therefore am much more
comfortable investing time even though only a fraction of the people I
mentor will end up as full contributors because the perceived cost for me
is a lot lower.

I put quite a significant amount of thought into trying to find a way to
either make mentoring -Ofun for ribasushi too and/or to find a way for others
to do the mentoring part around/alongside his work as primary architect.

Needless to say, the last few years' commit history for DBIx::Class and
the current situation demonstrate quite clearly that the emphasis in the
above sentence is on 'trying' and that my efforts in that regard ended
in abject failure.
