Subject: Module submission Statistics::Sequences
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences
  DSLIP:       bnpOg
  description: Analyse data for sequential structure
  userid:      RGARTON (rgarton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules

  similar:
    Statistics::Burst

  rationale:

    This is a family of 3 children:

    Statistics::Sequences::Joins Statistics::Sequences::Pot
    Statistics::Sequences::Runs

    One "uses" either of these, which implicitly uses parent module
    Statistics::Sequences in constructing shared object. This parent
    also has the methods, used by all children, for:

    _loading data from different formats into forms suitable for
    testing sequential structure, e.g., a single list of various numeric
    values that can be split into dichotomous format according to values
    falling above/below median or other value. _ dmping stats to STDOUT

    As for children themselves, they have unique tests:

    _::Joins - included mainly for padding the family out, an old test,
    useful to compare with others

    _::Pot - a new test, of potential energy in data, see Thread for
    module submission Statistics::Pot last month

    _::Runs - familiar Wald-Wolfowitz test - only provides
    probabilities by table look-up, or approx. by "normal deviate",
    similarly to most other Statistics modules; will work on integration
    solution later

    rrrrrrrrr

    ** This submission incorporates previous one for Statistics::Pot.

The resulting entry would be:
