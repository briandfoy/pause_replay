The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Procmail
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Read procmail(1) log files.
  userid:      BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    CVS repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    Log::Procmail is a small module to read procmail logfiles. It is in
    development, and will soon be used in at least one script. :-)

    Finding the proper name is the main problem. After browsing CPAN a
    little, I have come up with several plausible names: - Log::Procmail
    - Mail::Procmail::Log - Mail::ProcmailLog - Logfile::Procmail

    But, each name comes with a different problem:

    - The Log:: directory looks like it's holding logging tools (like
    Log::Agent) and not log parsing tools.

    - Mail::Procmail is a procmail-like tool, while this module reads
    logs from the original procmail. They are not related, but the name
    similarity might confuse potential users. And Mail::Procmail::Log is
    quite long for such a small module.

    - Mail::ProcmailLog doesn't sound that good. Personal taste.

    - Logfile::Procmail should inherit from Logfile::Base, as most of
    the other Logfile:: modules do, which isn't the case for this
    module.

    I suppose then that the choice is really between
    Mail::Procmail::Log and Log::Procmail.

    Thanks for your help in finding the right name for this little
    tool.
