Subject: Module submission Apache2::AUS

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::AUS
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Authentication, Users & Sessions in Apache2
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modperl@perl.apache.org

  similar:
    Lots.

  rationale:

    There's lots of systems out there that supply the "authentication,
    users and sessions" functionality. But they also tend to do a lot
    more as well.

    This module is a thin layer on top of Schema::RDBMS::AUS.
    Apache2::AUS provides mod_perl2 hooks for providing a browser with a
    session, logging in and out of that session, and making access
    control decisions based on a user's permissions and group
    membership.

    All data is stored in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and session
    information is serialized in JSON using CGI::Session. The goal is
    complete interopability with other popular apache2 web development
    languages such as PHP, JSP, and Ruby.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache2::
::AUS             adpOp Authentication, Users & Sessions in Apache2  CRAKRJACK
