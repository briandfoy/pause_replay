The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Verilog::GetInfo
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Get info on Verilog design
  userid:      ROHITM (Rohit Mishra)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglists,newsgroups

  similar:
    Verilog::Parser Verilog::Netlist

  rationale:

    This module is a very effective database generator for a hardware
    design written in Verilog HDL ( IEEE 1364 ).

    Unlike other similar perl modules this module is capable of
    reading/parsing/processing more than one verilog file at a time.
    While parsing the design files it creates an extremely rich
    database, with all the information about the whole design. It
    creates the design hierarchy by itself, including information about
    each level of each of the verilog modules present in the design.

    Apart from the design files, this module is capable of parsing the
    verilog standard cells library models. It supports verilog like "-y"
    option to specify the library directory to be "cached".

    A very robust `ifdef...`else...`endif ( including nested `ifdefs )
    parsing is supported to incorporate the run time parsing of the
    options. Run time parsing of `define and `include is also supported
    for compatibility with any standard Verilog HDL compiler.

    Most of the standard verilog options are supported e.g -f, +incdir+
    etc.

    After parsing the verilog file list, the module returns a handle to
    the database hash. Commonly used information e.g port list,
    input/output list etc. can be retrived using the handle to the
    database simply by calling a method e.g

    @portlist = $handle->Getports( $module );

    This module can be very usefull for chip netlist integration
    purposes and for debugging a design with a huge database.

The resulting entry would be:

Verilog::
::GetInfo         cdpOp Get info on Verilog design                   ROHITM
