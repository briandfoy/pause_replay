Dear Mr. Neil Bowers,

I'm sorry for my disorganized archives.
I've just used the `clean-pause.pl` and then most of my old 
distributions are "Scheduled for deletion" status now.

Thank you for letting me know.

Regards,

nipotan

This is caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author directories. So we’ve identified the authors who can free up the most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

When marked for deletion, you’d have 3 days to check and revert anything you’re not happy with, before PAUSE would actually delete them.
