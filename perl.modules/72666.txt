The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences::Joins
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Wishart-Hirshfeld test of dichotomous seq's
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil at present

  similar:
    Statistics::Sequences::Runs

  rationale:

    Superficially, this test is very similar to the Runs Test. A join
    is a point in a sequence of dichotomous data where the values
    alternate; whereas runs concern continuing values. Also, while runs
    are tested on the basis of the observed distribution of breaks from
    continuity, joins are tested on the basis of a theoretically
    expected distribution. The Joins Test reports the statistical
    significance of the deviation (if any) of the observed number of
    joins from the expected number of joins, relative to the standard
    deviation of the number of joins from the average expected for the
    data at hand.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Sequences::
::Joins           bdpOp Wishart-Hirshfeld test of dichotomous seq's  RGARTON
