Subject: Module submission CGI::Untaint

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Untaint
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: process CGI input parameters
  userid:      TMTM (Tony Bowden)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Validate, CGI::FormMagick::Validator, Schwern's unreleased
    CGI::Verify

  rationale:

    Wanted to make a 'trivial' way for most people to actually approach
    the untainting and validation of incoming CGI data. Most people roll
    their own verison of this, and many of the other modules either make
    you jump through too many hoops (and often don't handle taintedness
    for you), or are too tied to other applications or frameworks. This
    makes the easy version trivial, but hopefully provides enough
    functionality for people to add their own recipes (as some people
    have already shown by uploading such to CPAN)

  enteredby:   TMTM (Tony Bowden)
  enteredon:   Sat Dec  1 13:28:54 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::Untaint         RdpOp process CGI input parameters                 TMTM
