While historically England has used both, the ise spelling dominates and 
is the version taught in schools, and used by government.

It is strongly favoured in Australia and New Zealand, and similar 
tendencies towards non-American spelling exist throughout the other 
countries of the Commonwealth, which includes India and so on.

The total number of English speakers with a preference of -ise is 
somewhere in the range of 1-2 billion, in comparison to American and 
Canada, with around 0.3 billion.

Thus my comment of "little-used".
