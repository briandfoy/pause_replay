Hi,

three weeks ago I've submitted a RFC Apache::SessionManager
new module to mod_perl list, then, after the thread, I've registered
this namespace to PAUSE.

This module is an Apache/mod_perl module and it uses Apache::Session
to track user's sessions over HTTP request. Apache::SessionManager
helps session management of a mod_perl web application.

The main problem was that another old RFC with the same namespace 
was been submitted.
However the original RFC is out of date (October 2000) and the
module hasn't been never registered and/or uploaded to CPAN.
I wrote to the author (Greg Cope <gjjc@rubberplant.freeserve.co.uk>)
in order to ask he some information about the status of his project.
He responded to me that his module development ended when he 
switched job and no longer had the time to do this.
Also he said "Go ahead, that's fine". BTW, these two modules 
do two different things!

I send this mail in order to notify you this.
Please, let me know if there are some problems before I send
it off to CPAN.

Thanks in advance

   - Enrico
