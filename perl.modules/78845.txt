The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Plumber
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: memory leak finder for C programs
  userid:      GNB (Greg Banks)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Devel::Plumber is a memory leak finder for C programs, implemented
    in Perl. It uses Devel::GDB to walk internal glibc heap structures,
    so it can work on either a live process or a core file. Compared to
    Valgrind, Purify, or various malloc debugging libraries,
    Devel::Plumber

    * is very slow, * does not provide stack traces * does not work on
    MT programs

    However it is much easier to use in a production environment
    (rather than a test environment) because the program

    * does not require any special building or instrumentation * does
    not need to be launched specially, * can already be running or even
    dumped a core, * if running, will continue unmolested after
    Devel::Plumber has finished

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Plumber         bdpOp memory leak finder for C programs            GNB
