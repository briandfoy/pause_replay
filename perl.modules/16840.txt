Well, Tim and Brian appear to see eye-to-eye, more or less.

It looks like "Rosetta" is what I will aim for then.  I like the name too,
even if there might be confusion for human language specialists.

To make this simple, I will submit a separate module registration request
under that name.  I would normally be able to do it right now, but I have
the feeling I should rewrite the Description included with it first, so it
may not be done until the weekend ... or this evening ... I will try for
at least a draft this evening, which should be enough.

Let me ask you this: Are there *any* other registered modules or
frameworks on CPAN whose names are the same as their author's names, or
derived from such?  I don't remember seeing any.  And I wouldn't want to
do that myself, since it seems silly in the same way as naming something
"Yet Another [something]"; it doesn't have anything to say about the
uniqueness of the work.

So, thank you (collectively) for all your help.  I will be back.
