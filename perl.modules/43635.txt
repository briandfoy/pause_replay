As the main Games-Sudoku dist itself is only extremely new, have you 
spoken to it's author about using or integrating your improvements into 
it instead?

Generally there's quite a lot of flexibility in changing APIs for dists 
in their first month or release. Authors are often quite open to doing 
things in different and better ways.

If he is protective of his version and doesn't want to change the way he 
does things or listen to ideas on alternatives, then I'd be much happier 
about approval a parallel module this early in the existance of the main 
one.
