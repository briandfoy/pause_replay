     why:

    The PatchIterator module that contains utilities for reading
    patches in most formats and doing other operations such as adding
    context from a CVS server, removing files from the patch, grabbing
    pertinent information such as lines changed and files affected,
    determining the patch root for "cvs diff"s and fixing them to be
    from the root, and outputting any patch in a standard unified diff
    format. The code can currently be found at
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174942 (see the
    "PatchIterator classes" attachment). This code is being used in
    Bugzilla.

    I am also considering submitting UserLogin.pm, an
    easy-to-use-and-administer set of utilities for managing users and
    user settings as well as user sessions (typically for web stuff).
    This code can be found at
    http://www.masonhq.com/user/Shalom/UserLogin/Index . I have not
    performed an exhaustive search for similar modules for this for
    about a year, however, so I won't upload until I am sure it is still
    unique.
