Now that you say that, it makes sense. I chose this address because
every time I upload a module I get two emails where I can read the
following:

"Please contact modules@perl.org if there are any open questions."

Since I had an open question... O:-)

Anyway, sorry to bother you and I'll bother the testers instead :-)

jac
