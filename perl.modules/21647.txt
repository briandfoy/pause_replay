These should not be here. If they're directly perl related, but only 
docs, they should be in something like Docs::US::DOD::*, but as they're 
not directly Perl related (and I assume available elsewhere on the net) 
they should not be included in CPAN.

If they are included, please do not allow them to be sitting at such a 
position that doesn't indicate that they do not hold any code.

Cheers!
