The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Proxy::Changes
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Keep track of changes in tied data
  userid:      MALUKU (Marc - Sebastian Lucksch)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wrote a datastructure using the TIE Interface, that converted the
    STOREd data. The code wouldn't be notified of changes to that data
    when it was in a subhash or subref:

    $tie{Foo}->{Bar}=1; #$tie->STORE not called.

    This is why I wrote a module that just needs to be put in the FETCH
    call and proxies all changes to the original tied object (by calling
    STORE). It is somewhat of a helper to other tied objects facing the
    same problem.

    Tie::Proxy::Changes seems like the right name for this, since it
    proxies changes for tied objects.

    It belongs also into the Tie:: namespace since it uses TIE to track
    the changes as well.

    There is already a Tie::Proxy::Hash module in the same namespace,
    but it is not registered (and has nothing to do with this at all)

    Tie::Track::Changes would also work, but it can be kind of
    misleading.

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::Proxy::
::Changes         RdpOo Keep track of changes in tied data           MALUKU
