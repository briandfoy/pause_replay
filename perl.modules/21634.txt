    This is potentially very useful, but I have two concerns:

        1. It's not *actually* using the official registry, as
        advertised; the port numbers are hard-coded.  Thus, if
        the registry is updated, I have no way of knowing that
        the entries I'm using are outdated, and no way of
        forcing an update.

        2. You leave out some ports "with no associated protocols."
        I'm not sure what the value of this is; as a naive user, I
        would expect that the module maps as in IANA's registry,
        not as in what protocols are actually known to be deployed
        in the wild.

    I would suggest that you either change the description or the
implementation.  FWIW, I favor changing the implementation.
