sorry for the super-long delay. modules@perl.org is *mostly* for 
administrative issues around modules and the CPAN. Though we do try to 
give advice, there's only a few of us admins. Generally speaking, you 
will receive more feedback on discussion lists such as 
module-authors@perl.org or forums such as Perlmonks or Stackoverflow.

That being said, since this sounds like an application rather than a 
module, you could use App::NMQual (with whatever casing of NMQual). In 
the CPAN distribution that you'd create for it, you would put the 
executable into the bin/ or scripts subdirectory and point the build 
tools at that directory. See the EXE_FILES option in the 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker documentation, for example. Those scripts will the 
be installed into some directory within PATH on normal unixlike systems.

Best regards,
Steffen
