Hi !

   I think at last I have something to contribute to the perl Community.
So, I would like to register myself as on of the developers and
contribute.

  Here's my info that you had requested for registering.

Name              : Arun Kumar U
Email ID          : u_arunkumar@yahoo.com
Preferred User ID : UARUN

Package: perlPOS
Description: A Set of Perl Modules that Implement ISO-8583 Protocol. This
modules is intended to provide the Perl Community with a financial
exchange/payment Framework. The iniital goal is to provide support for
client side applications to easily interface with ISO-8583 servers such as
ISO-8583 servers, switches etc. The package can also be modified to handle
ANSI X9.2 Protocol as well. 

   The inspiration for the package was derived from jPOS - A Java based
OpenSource library providing similar functionality. perlPOS is closely
modelled against the jPOS Project. The Home of the jPOS project is
at www.jpos.org

   Several design issues have been discussed with on of the core
developers of the jPOS project - Alejandro Revilla. A few of the new
ideas/features available in perlPOS have been accepted and incorporated in
jPOS by Alejandro.
