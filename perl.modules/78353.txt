The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Orignal
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple OO/Attribues for perl >5.6
  userid:      BYTEROCK (John Scoles)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The main goal of Orignal is to be light and easy to use, the codeis
    less than 20k and has no dependencies on other modules not foundin
    base perl.

    I created it out of frustration of needing some objectstyle code
    but stuck with Perl 5.6 and not being able to use C orC++ code but
    like Perl 5.14 attributes

    I plan to have a number of other modules under Orignal for
    extendedfunctionality some that I am working on are

    Orignal::YML Orignal::XML Orignal::Persist Orignal::Light

    Each extending Orignal in some way, or in the case of
    Lightshrinking the system down to only SCALAR attributes.

    In case you are wondering there is nothing specail about
    nameOrignal except it is Moose in French. Was going to call it ELK
    (EasyLight Klasses) but that name is used by Acme::Elk Also

    I have rewritten my other Mod Test::Class::Rig to use is so Ican't
    upload that till I get this one in CPAN

The resulting entry would be:

Orignal           adpOp Simple OO/Attribues for perl >5.6            BYTEROCK
