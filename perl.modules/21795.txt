And I suggest anything but Colorize.  Even if it were a real word, some
people would want to spell it Colourise.  I know its use as a computing
term dates back quite a few years, but that doesn't stop it grating on me.
 Highlight I can live with (but not Hilite).

Anyway, feel free to ignore that rant :-)  I really just wanted to point
