Subject: Module submission Slauth
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Slauth
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Apache 2 auth/authz module with plugins
  userid:      IKLUFT (Ian Kluft)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    previously discussed on private mail lists at stratofox.org, new SVN
    repository and public web site at http://www.slauth.org/

  similar:
    Apache::Auth*

  rationale:

    Slauth was named as a contraction for the "SBAY Local
    Authentication" system, with a tongue-in-cheek sounding like "sloth"
    but spelled with "auth". It is used by sbay.org, stratofox.org,
    svlug.org and aeropac.org.

    Slauth was originally written in 2004 for the Stratofox Aerospace
    Tracking Team to coordinate with two amateur rocketry groups who
    were each attemping the first amateur rocket launch to space. (One
    of them succeeded - CSXT launched an unmanned solid rocket to 72
    miles/120km on May 17, 2004 at the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, USA.)

    Other Silicon Valley site admins have expressed interest in
    Slauth's ability to tap into information from Mailman mail list
    subscriptions and allow users already subscribed to those lists to
    self-register for authenticated web site access.

The resulting entry would be:

Slauth            bmpOp Apache 2 auth/authz module with plugins      IKLUFT
