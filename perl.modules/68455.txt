Hiya

Your distribution File::MMagic hasn't been updated since 2006, and has a 
number of bugs in RT (20), including a fully built distribution with 
updated magic file waiting to be shipped.

Given that the current distribution can't recognise things like MPEG 
files, I think that updating it and fixing the bugs would be very 
worthwhile and I'm happy to volunteer to do so.

Would this be ok with you? And if so is there a source code repository 
anywhere that I could access?

Cheers
Tomas

P.S. I'm not sure that this is a currently up to date email for you, as 
you haven't uploaded anything to PAUSE for several years, and the web 
site linked from your PAUSE page also hasn't been updated in a couple of 
years + contains no additional email address. Therefore I've cc'd 
modules@perl.org in to see if anyone there knows another address for you.
