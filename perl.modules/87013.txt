Hi,

I've been looking at the ADOPTME and HANDOFF pseudo-user permissions, as =
described in the Lancaster Consensus. This is as part of my project to =
try and identify CPAN distributions that might be candidates for =
adoption.

There are two areas where things weren't entirely clear. First, here's a =
blog post about it:

http://neilb.org/2013/08/07/adoptme.html

And then my two questions:

If an author wants to mark a module as 'available for adoption', should =
they give co-maint to HANDOFF or ADOPTME? Using ADOPTME in all cases =
would be clearer I think, but given what the document says, and the =
existing conventions for ADOPTME related to deceased or unresponsive =
authors, it seems like HANDOFF is being slightly more encouraged?
What should the interpretation be if not all packages in a dist have =
ADOPTME? I think if the top-level / lead module has ADOPTME, then the =
dist can be treated as if it had ADOPTME, otherwise not.

Cheers,
Neil
