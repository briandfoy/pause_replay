The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       lib::App::Guiio
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Design User Interfaces Using ASCII Art
  userid:      JSIMPSON (James Simpson)
  chapterid:   27 (Pragma)
  communities:
    E-mail initially, will explore other communication channels

  similar:
    lib::App::Asciio

  rationale:

    This module is a fork of the Perl module lib::App::Asciio. The fork
    was needed because we are refocusing the work that has been done
    with ASCIIO, but to support designing user interfaces, rather than
    just general diagramming, which ASCIIO was designed for. We want to
    bring the ease of use of a UI Builder such as QT Designer or the
    GLADE Interface Designer to people who want to create UI designs in
    strictly ASCII. I have sent off an e-mail to the maintainer of
    ASCIIO to let him know about this fork.

    We feel that this module would be of use to many developers (Perl
    or otherwise) because Graphical User Interfaces are often designed,
    however there are few online mediums that support sharing UI design
    ideas as easily as ASCII in communication channels such as e-mail,
    newsgroups, or IRC. The fact that ASCII Art is a least common
    denominator in the digital realm means that not special tools are
    required to create, modify, share or view ASCII Art designs.
    However, having a tool that eases the difficulties associated with
    creating and modifying ASCII art representations of UI designs is
    clearly needed to the tediousness in editing ASCII UI Designs
    directly. This project could allow Open Source developers to quickly
    create UI design ideas are share them on many of the communication
    channels used in open source.

    The reason why we have chosen the name GUIIO is because designs
    created in this tool are rendered strictly in ASCII and our designs
    are for GUI (Graphical User Interfaces), so a logical name that ties
    these two ideas would have been GUII. We have decided to leave the O
    on the end of the project name to pay tribute to the work of ASCIIO
    for which this project is based upon.
