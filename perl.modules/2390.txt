From: crkohn@alumni.Princeton.EDU (kip)

Hoping to signup and establish a CPAN directory of my own:

name: Corbin "Kip" Kohn

email: crkohn@alumni.princeton.edu (personal) || kip@oreilly.com (work)

homepage: n/a

preferred user-ID: kip  (three letters seemed fine for LDS or MJD, but
if as the
               'modules/04pause.html' doc claimed, I need between four
and nine--'kip-')

planning to contribute: XML::Generation (generates XML, and in doing so
will help pave
                the way for the next generation Web); basically, it was
inspired by the HTML
                shortcuts of CGI.pm, but instead uses AUTOLOAD to read
the client's mind.

similar to: XML::Generator (which I didn't know existed when I wrote it,
but it probably
                wouldn't have mattered, since this has cleaner syntax,
and a superset of the
                functionality of XML::Generator.  For example, it has
support for a partially-
                instantiable form of curried function definition.)

future plans: getting feedback on the curried function implementation so
as to determine
                the best method of repackaging the code as its own
seperate 'Curry' module

thanks, reply to this email with any questions
