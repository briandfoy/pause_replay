The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::GXML
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: XML transformation and XML->HTML conv.
  userid:      JCARTER (Josh Carter)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    web site (http://multipart-mixed.com/) and a little on
    comp.lang.perl.misc

  similar:
    XML::XSLT

  rationale:

    GXML is somewhat similar in purpose to XSLT, but is far easier to
    use. Its scope is less ambitious, of course, but it's still very
    useful for many tasks. My original motivation for writing GXML was
    that I wanted to write web content in XML and convert it into HTML
    for publication, and XSLT was an amazingly huge standard that
    everyone argued over but nobody supported. (That still appears to be
    the case now, 2 years later.) GXML has been published since 1999 and
    I've maintained through several versions. I finally got around to
    making its core funtionality into a module, and thus feel it would
    be a good addition to CPAN.

    Note that GXML.pm also includes two other classes within it;
    XML::GXML::TemplateManager and XML::GXML::Util. I chose these names
    to ensure they wouldn't conflict with anything else.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::GXML            MdpOp XML transformation and XML->HTML conv.       JCARTER
