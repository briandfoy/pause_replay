What do yours do?

What about "Exporter::Java"?



That's fine. At this point you can call it
Some::Really::Long::Name::For::Importing::Modules::Like::Java's::import.pm

(Note the retro use of ' as a package separator!)


Then, all you will need to do is:

use Some::Really::Long::Name::For::Importing::Modules::Like::Java's::import qw( Some::Really::Long::Name::For::Importing::Modules::Like::Java's::import import ); # Alias this  to 'import' ;p

use import qw( ... );

It just seems odd to use a deeply nested name for a module whose purpose is to simplify the
deeply nested name problem. Note, I didn't say
I was against it, I just said I think it an odd decision by the powers that be.


As for modules being sort of a black hole, how modules@perl.org actually works and how things get on the module list is still somewhat of a mystery. I hope some freak accident doesn't wipe out the ability of CPAN and the module submission process to function due to arcane knowledge being held in too few hands.

Mike.
