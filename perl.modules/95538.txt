Hi Neil,

Thank you for the detailed explanation as to why this happens. I got a
little impatient yesterday and chatted with mst and kid51 who also pointed
out the resolution.

I'll work on what you suggested and release a new version.

I must say it's been a smooth ride starting as a co maintainer but I know
it's not a responsibility that is taken lightly.

Thanks again.

Charlie
