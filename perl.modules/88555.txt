Greetings:

I'd like to adopt Net::ICAP, a name space registered by Kevin Johnson in the
late '90s, but for which code was never released.  To date I've gotten no
response from his registered e-mail on CPAN, nor any other addresses I've
managed to dig up on various sites that looked like might be his.

While I did ask for any leads only this weekend on the module-authors list
I've decided to go ahead and ask for adoption now for a couple of reasons:

   1) The last code released by Kevin Johnson was in 1999
   2) I contacted another author who adopted one of Kevin's
      abandoned modules (Rob Brown, Net::Bind) who informed me
      that he was never able to find a valid contact for
      Kevin, either

In short, given that Kevin has been absent from the Perl community for
roughly 14 years, I suspect that his absence will likely be permanent.

I have an immediate need to produce ICAP functionality in Perl and I would
like to do so under the Net::ICAP name space.

If you feel I am jumping the gun, please let me know.  Thank you.
