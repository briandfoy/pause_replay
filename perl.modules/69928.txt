From: toddr@null.net (Todd Rinaldo)

I would like to do some cleanup on the module Business::UPS. There
are some minor outstanding RT bugs that need to be corrected, and I would like
to get a META.yml file associated with the module to help with indexing.

I notice that the module hasn't had any attention since 2003. If
you're open to it, I'd like to offer to be co-maintainer to help apply
the obvious pending patches in the RT queue and get the updates pushed
out to CPAN.

I'm not really looking to make any changes so much as apply low
hanging fruit fixes hanging out in RT.

If you're open to this, you can just add TODDR as a co-maintainer in
PAUSE and I will do the needful from there.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
