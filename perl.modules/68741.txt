Why not?

This is a one character fix for an issue which has been outstanding for 
_several years_. It fixes real problems for real people and I'd very 
much consider it worth a point release personally.

Especially given that the perl part of the FCGI project *just looks 
dead* right now, then I think that releasing _just this fix_ to CPAN 
would be totally worthwhile.

Righto.

When you say 'eventually' - I'm good with taking over maintainership 
_right now_ - the 'eventually' is, I guess, related to the fact that you 
don't trust anyone else to be releasing new versions of FCGI.pm..

Yes, indeed - working on non pure-perl fixes involves getting up to 
speed with the FCGI development in more general terms.

However, if you're neither paying any attention to the FCGI mailing 
list, _OR_ bugs in the perl module / through the CPAN bug tracker, then 
I think that the perl FCGI community would be better served by a 
maintainer who *wasn't* on the FCGI list _at all_, but was willing to 
take patches in rt.cpan...

I'm not suggesting that I _will_ ignore the fcgi list given that I 
actually start maintaining this, just that even if I _did_, things would 
_STILL_ be better given that you don't really care about either any more.

Cheers
