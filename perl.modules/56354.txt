Correct. And I have uploaded various versions of the module, so it is 
still on CPAN, and it is used widely in production. So, your records are 
faulty.

Just for the record, this is probably due to an old error with 
Module::Build, long since corrected, which allowed me, and many other 
authors, to generate a distro which could not be indexed properly.
