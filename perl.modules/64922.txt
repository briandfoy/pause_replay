The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Inspect
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: human-readable object representations
  userid:      OWL (Rich Daley)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Dumper

  rationale:

    Data::Inspect is inspired by Ruby's Object#inspect and Kernel#p
    methods.

    The aim is to provide something more useful to debugging/logging
    than Data::Dumper.

    Data::Dumper produces eval()able code that can often be pages and
    pages long if data structures are complex.

    Data::Inspect has no interest in producing eval()able code. Authors
    of classes are able to define how their objects look when they
    appear in Data::Inspect output by defining an inspect() method.
    Data::Inspect has knows how to handle most Perl built-in types
    itself.

    I chose the Data::Inspect namespace because it seems to be closely
    related to Data::Dumper in terms of functionality, and 'Inspect'
    from the Ruby function of the same name.

  enteredby:   OWL (Rich Daley)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar 14 17:22:02 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Inspect         adpOp human-readable object representations        OWL
