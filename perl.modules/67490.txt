The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unix::Mknod
  DSLIP:       Rdcfo
  description: Interface mknod, major, minor, and makedev
  userid:      PIRZYK (Jim Pirzyk)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Sys::Mknod, File::Stat::Bits

  rationale:

    There are 2 other perl modules that implement the mknod(2) system
    call, but they have problems working on some platforms. "Sys::Mknod"
    does not work on AIX because it uses the syscall(2) generic system
    call which AIX does not have. "Mknod" implements S_IFIFO, which on
    most platforms is not implemented in mknod(1), but rather mkfifo(1)
    (which is implemented in POSIX perl module).

    The perl module "File::Stat::Bits" also implements major() and
    minor() (and a version of makedev() called dev_join). They are done
    as a program to get the bit masks at compile time, but if major()
    and minor() are implemented as sub routines, the argument could be
    something as simple as an index to a lookup table (and thereby
    having no decernable relation to its result).

The resulting entry would be:

Unix::
::Mknod           Rdcfo Interface mknod, major, minor, and makedev   PIRZYK
