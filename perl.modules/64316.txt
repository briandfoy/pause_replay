Hi Mark,

I've added you as a co-maintainer to Apache2::Pod. You should be able
to upload new versions. I'm not sure how long it will take for the 
permissions to propagate to RT though.

Theron, you still have all the powers and permisisons youhad
previosuly. if this is not what you wanted, it's completely reversible.
If you re-emerge on CPAN, we can figure out what to do next. Or, if
you want to completely give up the module, we can make Mark the primary
maintainer.

Thanks, :)
