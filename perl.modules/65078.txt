Hi Darren, hi Matt,

Matt, I hope you're well and simply too busy to answer!

Darren, I've given you co-maintenance permissions via PAUSE.
Matt, please note that this is a reversible action in case you severely
object!

Darren, I only just realized that people have imported the current state
of DBD::SQLite into Adam Kennedy's SVN repository at
http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/DBD-SQLite/. Without looking at the
details, I see that there have been some commits. I guess it would make
sense of you joined that effort in order not to duplicate it. I am sure
Adam (see CC) will give you access to the repository in no time if you
don't have an account already.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
