Subject: Would you like to trade links?

Hi,

I found a link to your site, http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/00modlist.long.html at 
http://www.futurequest.net/Developers.php and I was wondering
if you might be interested in trading links with us.

I've found that by trading links with other websites
we have been able to increase our traffic significantly.

I'm sure we would both benefit if we were to reciprocate
in this manner.  If you are interested, please check out
my site at http://wwd.org and add a link to our links page.

Once you add a link to our site, instructions for linking
back to us will automatically be displayed.

Best regards,
