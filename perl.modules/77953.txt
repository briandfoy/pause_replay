Subject: PAUSE ID request (TREEKI; Jan A.)

Request to register new user

fullname: Jan A.
  userid: TREEKI
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I'm a new-ish Perl programmer who is learning fast. I've
    contributed some patches to existing code, but I'd also like to be
    able to upload any modules I write.

    Regarding my censored name - I'm under 18 and not comfortable with
    attaching my full name to my online identity, sorry. (I originally
    tried to use Treeki as my full name, since that's what I usually go
    by online, but it was rejected by the PAUSE interface.)

    Thanks for considering my request :)
