Hi,
I am working on a new module for GUI automation. It is going to be a OO
wrapper to Win32::GUITest. It is also going to provide a framework for
writing bigger set of maintainable automation scripts.
I am planning to name it Win32::LGT. These are the reasons:

* The full name of the project is LGUITest. This is were LGT came from.
* Making the module's name Win32::GuiTest::Whatever would make the class
name to long (IMHO). Since OO module would provide classes it would be
even worse. Example:
    $ref = Win32::GuiTest::Whatever::class1->new();

Do you have any objections against placing LGT in the Win32 directory?
