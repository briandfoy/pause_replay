The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::Ardour::Irc
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: infra red remote control of Ardour
  userid:      MCGRUFF (Noel Darlow)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  similar:
    Audio::Ardour::Control

  rationale:

    Ardour is a pro-level, multi-track audio recording program and the
    main linux DAW. Ardour can be controlled by OSC. This module
    receives input from an infra-red remote control and maps them to
    Ardour OSC commands allowing the program to be controlled by, for
    example, a tv remote.

    (1) The existing Audio::Ardour::Control provides similar
    functionality, but does not support the full list of OSC commands
    which Ardour recognises. This is an improved module.

    (2) I initially planned to suggest a patch for the existing module
    but I cannot contact the author's CPAN email and hence I assume
    Audio::Ardour::Control has been abandoned.

    (3) I intend to maintain a gentoo ebuild for Ardour remote control.
    It will be easier if I can create a CPAN module and use the standard
    CPAN distribution system for the perl part of the package, plus this
    makes the code available for other distros.

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::Ardour::
::Irc             bmpOp infra red remote control of Ardour           MCGRUFF
