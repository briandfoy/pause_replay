The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Translit
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: transliterates text between writing systems
  userid:      ALINKE (Alex Linke)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    pending

  similar:
    Unicode::Transliterate Lingua::RU::Translit Lingua::UK::Translit

  rationale:

    The module handles transliteration of (UTF-8) text from one writing
    system to another, uses only standard modules at runtime and can
    easily be extended as its transliteration tables are generated at
    build time using XML based definitions.

    However, there is a module on CPAN already that handles text
    transliteration: "Unicode::Transliterate", which is in fact a
    wrapper around IBM's ICU (International Component for Unicode)
    library. In contrast, our module is written in plain Perl only and
    doesn't depend on other third party software other than Perl and its
    standard modules, except XML::Simple is used to process the XML
    definitions once.

    Beside that, CPAN already holds some language specific
    transliteration modules like "Lingua::RU::Translit", while our
    module is language independant by design and already covers the
    complete ISO 9 transliteration of Cyrillic to Latin characters as
    well as the Greek transliterations according to ISO 843. Others will
    follow...

The resulting entry would be:
