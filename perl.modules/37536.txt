It finds the if its vertical, horizontal, or square,

$img->isvertical(1); # returns true if its vertical or square
$img->isvertical(); # returns true if its true vertical (IE not square)

has ishorizontal() and issquare() and one that returns a string 
'horizontal', 'vertical', or 'square'

print 'This image is ' . $img->orientation() . "\n";

I use it when generating HTML img tag or inserting META data about an 
image or thumbnail into a DB.

It doesn't modify the image at all at this point but I'll look into the 
rotate methods and add methods like

$img->horizontal $img->vertical to change its orientation if it's not 
already oriented that way already or square with a way to specify 
clockwise or counterclockwise

Thanks!
