I've written a new library, but don't know what to name it.  I was
wondering if one of you fellas had a suggestion.

This is a database library.  Its purpose is to allow you to write a
site-specific library that describes your database.  In the minimal
case, you can simply list the columns of your tables/views.  Each
table/view becomes its own class.

After that, my library provides all the generic methods you'd expect,
such as Foo->new, Foo->select, $foo->delete, accessor methods such as
$foo->mycolumnname, $foo->set_mycolumnname, etc.  These functions
generate all the SQL, perform all the join logic, take care of the
uniqueness issues, etc.

The basic model involves three coders:
  * Me, writing this library
  * A site librarian, writing classes that include view descriptions,
    and optionally any specialized methods they want
  * Site program authors, which use the libraries that the site
    librarian writes.
Naturally, these may not be separate people; where I use this library,
they're all the same.  But dividing it into three helps understand the
usage model.

In many ways, this is similar to Class::DBI, but differs in some
design philosophy aspects.  All the underlying database access is
through DBI.

The inspiration for this is provided by Harlequin Common Lisp's SQL
library, "Common SQL".  I lamented that Perl, which is such a great
language for database work, didn't have a library like Common SQL, so
I wrote it.

My current provisional name is DBIx::SeeCool.  This is an abridgment
of the conversation I had when showing this to a friend.  "See?" "Cool!"
Of course, the homophone is nice too.  But cutesy names aren't that
useful to somebody searching CPAN, so I'm looking for a better name.

So, I think that's plenty of information... to give much more detail,
I'd be pasting the PODs into this email.  So with all that said, any
suggestions?

Best,
joelh
