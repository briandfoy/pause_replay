The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Cath::FuncNet
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to the CATH FuncNet WebService
  userid:      ISILLITOE (Ian Sillitoe)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module aims to provide an user-friendly client/API to a unique
    Protein Function Comparison (FuncNet) WebService hosted at the CATH
    resource (http://cathdb.info), University College, London (UCL).

    We have currently only provided access to one operation of this
    WebService, however we aim to add more in the near future.

    The WebService::Cath::* namespace has been designed to allow more
    operations/webservices to be added as and when they become
    available. Also to provide a place for general objects (loggers,
    class templates, etc) shared by every other class in this namespace.
    Currently this is, e.g. WebService::Cath::FuncNet::Logable.pm,
    although it will probably be refactored to, e.g.
    WebService::Cath::Logable.pm, when the need arises.

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::Cath::
::FuncNet         bdpOp Interface to the CATH FuncNet WebService     ISILLITOE
