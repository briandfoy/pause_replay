The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Grid::Request
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Submit and monitor jobs to grid engines.
  userid:      VICTORF (Victor)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Schedule::DRMAAc

  rationale:

    Schedule::DRMAAc appears to be a thin layer over the C
    implementation of DRMAA and is used to allow perl code to talk to
    grid engines, such as Sun Grid Engine, LSF, Torque etc...
    Grid::Request is meant to make the submission and monitoring of grid
    jobs much easier for beginning users and to make the coding of grid
    aware Perl software easier and more fun...

The resulting entry would be:

Grid::
::Request         bdpOp Submit and monitor jobs to grid engines.     VICTORF
