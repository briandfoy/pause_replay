Can I pick this one up again?

The trivial fixes I've got in my repository[1] (specifically the  
FILENO one[2]) fix real issues in real applications[3] much better  
than hideous local patching[4].

I'd like to move further forward than that, but just doing this will  
fix things for people and make it look less like FCGI.pm is abandoned.

As previously noted, if we can get an 'official' public repository  
then I'm more than happy to work on release engineering and  
integrating/rebasing c fixes when they later become available..

Cheers
