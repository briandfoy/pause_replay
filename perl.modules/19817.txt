Possibly, though that just goes back to B::'s poor name. Perhaps Perl::
(because it deals with Perl the language). Devel:: would be odd though
because it isn't an aide to development - it encodes insight into perl
tokens and is useful for things that care how perl is parsed. As is, I
didn't want to start a new top-level category and since it was used by
B::Deobfuscate which is merely a subclass on B::Deparse it all seemed to
go together.
