I read the Naming Modules page before registering the namespace, and
shyed away from breaking new ground with a new top-level namespace.

Net::DNS::Sinkhole (alpha code, still under development on
github.com/warewolf/Net-DNS-Sinkhole) is mostly a purpose driven
customization of two Net::DNS modules, Net::DNS::Nameserver and
Net::DNS::Resolver::Programmable.

I opted to put my code under the Net::DNS namespace because those two
Net::DNS modules are what my code subclasses.  It seemed to fit together
in my mind.

This code is also largely specific to DNS, but I wouldn't be against
putting this under its own namespace, since the end purpose *is* to make
an application.

Take a quick look at the overview POD in wiki format on github
https://github.com/warewolf/Net-DNS-Sinkhole/wiki/Overview (still being
drafted) and tell me what you think.  I'm not stuck on the name, and I
realize that it's your responsibility to ensure namespaces don't get
polluted.

Thanks,
Richard
