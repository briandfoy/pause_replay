The trick is to think what what is more descriptive for the programmer
and the maintainer.  Initializations are really hard if they are not
ubiquitous.  Product names, such as Solaris::* and Oracle::* tend
to group things nicely if the modules deal only with those projects.
If OpenSound Control is a product like that, then spelling it out
is best.

I can see Net::OSC too.  

It's up to you, though.
