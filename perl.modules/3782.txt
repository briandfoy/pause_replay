Hi Kevin,

please note that in the namespace has already been uploaded something.
I have apparently missed to do the registration (sorry Richard) and
would like that you two find an agreement on the namespace:

cpan> m /speech/
Module          Speech::Dummy::Synthesiser (R/RC/RCALEY/speech_pm_1.0.tgz)
Module          Speech::Festival (R/RC/RCALEY/speech_pm_1.0.tgz)
Module          Speech::Festival::Synthesiser (R/RC/RCALEY/speech_pm_1.0.tgz)
Module          Speech::Synthesiser (R/RC/RCALEY/speech_pm_1.0.tgz)
4 items found

cpan> a rcaley
Author id = RCALEY
    EMAIL        R.Caley@ed.ac.uk
    FULLNAME     Richard Caley

In general, Speech:: is certainly the way to go, I'll register
whatever you come up with.
