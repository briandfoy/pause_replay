The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Say::Czech
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Output dates as text as you would speak it
  userid:      HIHIK (Jiří Václavík)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Date::Spoken::German

  rationale:

    I sought this module on CPAN, but did not find it. So I wrote new
    module.

    The module provides to developers new functions to easily convert a
    date to its representation as czech text

  enteredby:   HIHIK (Jiří Václavík)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug  2 20:19:54 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Say::
::Czech           bdpfp Output dates as text as you would speak it   HIHIK
