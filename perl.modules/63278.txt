Bobby,

I'm still not 100% on what method(s) I'm going to need to use. It
might end up being the case that a lot of tuning is needed to make
predictions usable. At the very least it should be able to note
regularities and flag them.

Right now this is just something that I need, and thought it would be
useful to others if it works.

Thanks,

Brian
