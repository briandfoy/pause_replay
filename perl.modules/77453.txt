There is a CVS repo in the petal-utils project in sourceforge: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/petal-utils/

I know it's CVS, but HG and git didn't even exist when Petal was 
developed.  If you don't want to work with CVS then I'm happy to 
migrate to something else so long as the history is preserved (or if 
you don't like sourceforge, github is ok too).

Actually I'm not the main author, but inherited it after he quit.

I've been away and I'll be on holiday for another week, so I'll be 
out of touch until 1st September.  I made you a co-maintainer in 
cpan/pause, if you get a sourceforge id, I'll add you there too.
