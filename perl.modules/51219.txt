I think this depends on the situation and the intended use of the
Application.

Still, users can install the application anywhere they like.  They
don't have to install it into the Perl library. Even if they do, I
don't see any problem with that.

As for CPAN, I'd rather stay neutral on these issues. I don't think we
should tell people how to do things, how to use Perl, or where to
install things. As Perl people we definitely have opinions about this,
but as PAUSE admins, I don't think we should.
