The idea comes up periodically, and I mention it to someone about
every six months, but it is always shot down, usually with some
comment having to do with inertia.

I think RT would be very good for this purpose.

The flow would look like this:

    1. CPAN authors use a form on PAUSE...
    2. Email gets sent to RT and placed in the modules queue
    3. RT sends a copy of the request to modules@perl.org
    4. RT tracks any discussion that happens on modules@.
    5. When it is approved/rejected/altered/etc, one of the modules@
       admins goes into the RT system and marks it as such.

    6. Status reports can be generated that show the status of the
       queue.
	 (5 in queue, 3 under discussion, 2 new)

We would be doubleplushappy to host this on the perl.org RT instance.

If you have any questions, or are interested in other ways this might
work, I'd be glad to answer/explore.
