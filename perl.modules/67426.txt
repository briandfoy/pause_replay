I think its the version missing for all the provided modules. Does this
line:

  generated_by: Module::Build version 0.34

mean that Module::Build did not provide the version numbers? Maybe
something to report to Module::Build?

I see that 0.03100 has this:

  provides:
    Bio::Chado::Schema:
      file: lib/Bio/Chado/Schema.pm
      version: 0.03100

and the indexing did not fail anymore. Seems to me a good solution.
Does it match your intentions?
