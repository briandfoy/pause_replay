Oh, right.  So how does one get a namespace proposal confirmed by an admin?

I have two modules currently on CPAN (Win32::SharedFileOpen and 
Win32::UTCFileTime).  I posted "Module submission"s for both, but I can 
only edit module metadata for the former.  Now that I search the 
archives, I see that only the former ever got a "New module ..." message 
from PAUSE, but I didn't do anything different.  Why did one module get 
confirmed but the other didn't?

Does somebody need to click one of the links at the bottom of the 
"Module submission" mail for Win32::UTCFileTime:

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2003-05/msg00472.html

If so, I'd appreciate somebody doing so. (It says the links are only 
valid for module list maintainers.)

Thanks,
- Steve
