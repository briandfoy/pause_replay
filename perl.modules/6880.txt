The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Passover
  DSLIP:       Rmpfp
  description: Calculate date of Passover or Rosh Hashanah
  userid:      RBOW (Rich Bowen)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org

  similar:
    Date::Easter, Date::Christmas, Date::ICal

  rationale:

    Calculates the date of Passover and Rosh Hashanah for any given
    year.

    This is related in concept to Date::Easter and Date::Christmas,
    which are in the listing already.

    Date::Passover is based on algorithms found at
    http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/BillInfo/ReligiousCalendars.html

    Additionally, this package contains Date::GoldenNumber, which
    calculates the golden number for a given year. This number is used
    in many other calendrical calculations, and may eventually end up in
    a package of related calendrical utility functions.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::Passover        Rmpfp Calculate date of Passover or Rosh Hashanah  RBOW
