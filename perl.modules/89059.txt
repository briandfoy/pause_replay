Heya,
  I'm writing to request co-maintainer status on Email::Address::List
for ALEXMV and FALCONE.  The current maintiner, RUZ, hasn't responded to
several requests for such over the last week and a half, and a new
release is necessary to close a denial-of-service vulnerability,
CVE-2014-1474.
  The module was also originally produced while Ruslan was working for
Best Practical, and the official repository for it
( https://github.com/bestpractical/email-address-list ) is still under
Best Practical's namespace.  As such, the ability to cut releases to fix
security vulnerabilities would be appreciated.

Thanks,
 - Alex
