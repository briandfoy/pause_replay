Hello,

I tried uploading a patch to my distribution. The original was version 0.01
and I decided that the patch should be version 0.01.1 (the diff is just one
line in one file). It seems as though CPAN isn't happy with that version
number...  A few questions:

1. Will the patch appear on CPAN?
2. If so, what version number will it have?
3. What versioning scheme(s) should I use to avoid this in the future?

Thank you for your time,

Jack Maney
