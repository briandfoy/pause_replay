From: rb@tertius.net.au (Ricky Buchanan)

I have two module which convert dates and times respectively to
words, there are a couple of different detail levels in each
module, example output for the different date functions would be
"May Fifth", "Monday the fifth of May" and "Monday the fifth of
may, nineteen seventy five", and analogously for time with
different levels of detail.  I use them for a bunch of stuff
that's output to a speech synthesizer which is crappy at
outputting things like "9:04am", myself, but I suppose there are
other uses too, not to mention other people who use speech synth
in their perl programs.

Example use:

my $date = new XXXX-modulename-XXXX time();
print "> " . $date->ShortDate . ".\n";
> Monday the third of May.

my $time = new XXXX-modulename-XXXX time();
print "> " . $time->LongTime . ".\n";
> A quater past three in the morning.


Two questions:

1.  One module or two?
There are currently two modules, one which deals with dates and
one which deals with times, but it would be trivial to combine
them.  Would you advise that this should be one module or two?


2.  What module namespace to use?
I have examined nodes already in CPAN and it seems most modules
related to dates and times are stored under Date:: namespace, but
on the other hand many modules that convert things to English are
stored under Lingua::EN:: namespsace ... and on the gripping
hand, I have also seen modules under the Text:: namespace that
deal with generating English text.

My gut feeling is (if 1 module) Text::DateTime or (if 2 modules)
Text::Date and Text::Time) perhaps?  I don't think it belongs in
the Date:: namespace because Date:: seems to be related to
manipulating dates and times rather than just outputting them.  

I don't know how you decide what goes in Lingua::EN:: and Text::
as namespaces, I have a previous module Lingua::EN::Gender whose
namespace was cleared with this alias, but IIRC at the time the
Text:: namespace didn't even exist!  Is the Lingua::EN::
namespace deprecated now, and if not how do you decide what goes
there and what goes in Text::?

In short words, I'm thoroughly confused!  Please advise :)


Please also remember, all of you modules@ people, that you hard
work is greatly appreciated by us half-educated Perl module
authors!  Especially ones like me who aren't totally up on what's
what and have writte a few modules a year.


Regards,
Ricky
