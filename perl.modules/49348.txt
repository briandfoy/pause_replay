Trying to hide your email address only brings pseudo-safety. Before
you know it leaks out to the net, and all efforts were spent in vain.

You're lucky. I get thousands per week. A good SPAM filter is the only
remedy. And no, I am *not* happy with that.

Having said that, I think CPAN does a good job at hiding addresses.
But, as I said, it's pseudo-safety.
