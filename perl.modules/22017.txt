Dear sir,
I live in Austria. While downloading some music ( How insensitive - in =
english )
I found an incredible version performed by an unknown artist ( for me at
least ) Her name is Dvox. Have you ever heard about her ?  
On the small resume that you get with the Kazaa downloads they say only a =
little 
about the song ( ...recorded live in Munich ) . I try to look for her  in =
Europe and America with no result... so I'm trying now in Japan....
You may help in some way to find out more about her as I have not been able  =
to track 
her down?=85.    I did send a few dozen mails a couple of week ago and got no =

response at all=85  This time I try to send  about 50  e-mails in Japan to =
find out=85  
I'm sorry to approach you in this way but she really blew me away and I'd =
like to find more about her.
with my best regards           Mike
