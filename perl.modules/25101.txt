     why:

    You don't know me. My project uses perl at all levels (embedded
    perl and perl modules). The latter is what I wish to contribute. I
    have written a Perl module that interfaces directly with the network
    server for my project. Both the module and the client/server
    software are under the GPL. I do not suspect I need my own
    namespace, I assume I would be able to list it under Net::Benson.

    Ancillary to the above, I also have a better NeuralNet and Genetic
    Algorithm perl module implementation that I have thought about
    cleaning up and making available.

    I am not sure I have come to the right the place. Although, it
    seems logical to me at the moment, I wish to discuss further if
    possible. Thank you for your time.
