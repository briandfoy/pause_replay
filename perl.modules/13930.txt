Lagos Nigeria

ATTN=3APresident=2FCEO

First=2C I must solicit your confidence in this transaction=2C this is
because
of its nature as being confidential and Top secret=2E I know that a
transaction
of this magnitude will make someone apprehensive and worried=2C but I
am assuring you that there is no cause to worry about=2E We have
decided
to contact you by e-mail due to the urgency of this transaction=2C as
we
are informed of it's swiftness and confidentiality=2E


Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you=2E I am
Mr=2ESANNI
AHMED=2C a Manager at thecapital international bank PLC=2C Lagos=2E I came to know
of you in my private search for a reliable and a reputable person who
can handle a confidential transaction which involves the transfer of
a huge sum of money to a foreign account =2E

THE PROPOSITION=3A

A foreigner=2C Engineer Johnson Creek =28deceased=29=2C an Oil contractor
with
the Federal Government of Nigeria=2C until his death three years ago in
a ghastly air crash=2E He was a client with our bank=2C capital international bank
Lagos=2C and had a closing balance of USD$18=2EM =28Eighteen Million=2C Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars=29 which the bank now
unquestionably
expects to be claimed by any of his available next of kin =28relations=29
or alternatively be donated to a war trust fund for weapon and
ammunition
at a military war college here in Nigeria=2E

Fervent valuable efforts had been made by the management of the Union
Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek's Family or relatives but
all this effort have proved to no avail=2E


I am reaching out to you because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of Engineer Johnson Creek's next of kin=2E =28he
had no known wife and children=29=2E The management of our bank under the
influence of the Chairman=2C Major General Kalu Uke Kalu =28Retired=29=2C had
come up with the idea to declare this fund as =22NOT CLAIMED=22
and this
will subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for war which will
generally
enhance further the course of war in Africa and the world=2E

In order to avert this negative development=2C myself and some other
trusted
colleagues in the Bank now seek your indulgence and permission to
declare
you as the next of kin of Late Engr=2E Johnson Creek=2E This will enable
the fund=2C =28USD$18=2E5M =29 to be subsequently transferred and be paid
into
your nominated Bank account as the beneficiary to the Estate of the
deceased=2E
All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been
carefully
worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free involvement=2E Your
share would be 30% of the total amount=2E 10% has been set aside for
expenses
while the rest =2860%=29 would be for myself and my colleagues for
investment
purposes in your country=2E

If this proposal is in order by you and you wish to take advantage of
the trust we hope to bestow on you as the beneficiary of this fund=2C
then
kindly get to me immediately via telephone call intimating me with
your
most
confidential e-mail=2C telephone and fax numbers so that I can forward
to you the relevant details of this transaction=2E




Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation=2E

Regards=2C
