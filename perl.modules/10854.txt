Hi,

I would like to contribute 'logo.pl' to the CPAN scripts. It is a single 
large script which implements logo turtle graphics, with many additional 
facilities, using Perl and Tk.

I've tested the program on a Win/ME machine, a Linux/386 machine and a Linux 
S/390 machine and except for minor changes on the S/390 it runs fine on all 
three.

The script includes a user function editor with the ability to save and load 
a file of functions. It also has simple logic (if/else) a for loop, a repeat 
loop and simple animation capabilities.

The details needed for PAUSE are as follows:-

your name
	Derek Pope
your email address
	derek@ideapot.com
your homepage if you have one
	www.ideapot.com
your preferred user-ID on CPAN
