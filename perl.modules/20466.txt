The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Exporter
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Export class methods as regular subroutines
  userid:      SPLICE (David James)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    NOTE: This module replaces Object::Exporter! Object::Exporter was
    renamed to Class::Exporter because the Class namespace is more
    appropriate for this module.

    This module makes it much easier to make a module have a hybrid
    object/method interface similar to the one of CGI.pm. You can take
    any old module that has an object-oriented interface and convert it
    to have a hybrid interface by simply adding "use base
    'Class::Exporter'" to your code.

    This package allows you to export object methods. It supports
    C<import()>, C<@EXPORT> and C<@EXPORT_OK> and not a whole lot else.
    Each package into which your object methods are imported gets its
    own instance of the object. This ensures that there are no
    interaction effects between multiple packages that use your object.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
