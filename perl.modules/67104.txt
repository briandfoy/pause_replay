Sorry to hear. Ah, I see: we were under tight timing constraints and
sent the first mail to 'riffer@cpan.org'. Because your setting in the
preferences for where to forward this alias is 'none' you did not
receive the mail. For the second mail we had a bit more time to
prepare it and so could pick your email directly from the database.

Please review your setup whether it does what you want. You may also
want to re-read http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html for general
overview on pause.

I can only speak for pause.perl.org and I can assure you we have never
stored any user password in cleartext. BTW, pause is open source so
you can review it to confirm my claim:)

Given that it is never a good idea to re-use passwords across
unrelated sites or to use cutesy passwords I must refrain from
commenting on the perlmonks screwup.
