The CPAN maintainers continually ask for previous releases to be removed =
from CPAN if they are not important or cause confusion. Every CPAN =
module ever uploaded is permanently available on backpan so removing a =
version from CPAN doesn't remove it forever.

If you feel that it's important to have a particular version of a module =
to stay on CPAN then that's fine. In many cases though people continue =
to upload new versions without thinking about the old ones that are =
taking up space for the people mirroring CPAN (I'm guilty of that as =
well).
