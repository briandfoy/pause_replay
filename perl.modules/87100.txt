The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Strict
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Strict values for core time functions
  userid:      ZARABOZO (Francisco Zarabozo)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Time::Strict transforms automatically core time functions to force
    the use of more precise values. Functions like time and localtime
    include milliseconds and localtime always refers to the year as an
    absolute value where it's never necessary to sum or substract 1900
    years, leaving no room for interpretation in any case.

    Time::Strict also imports by default a modified behavior for
    timelocal, which is compatible with time and localtime after
    Time::Strict has been called (e.g. timelocal also expects an
    absolute value with no room for alternate interpretation for 'year'
    and can work with fractional seconds).

    These behaviors are only altered where Time::Strict has been
    explicitly called.

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::Strict          bdpfp Strict values for core time functions        ZARABOZO
