The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Schedule::RateLimiter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Throttle the rate of events in tight loops
  userid:      DWRIGHT (Daniel J. Wright)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    POE

  rationale:

    This module is a lightweight solution to the problem of preventing
    events from happening too quickly in a loop. It works to maximize
    the number of times an event happens without going over set limits.
    The only other thing that I could find on CPAN that comes close to
    doing something like this is POE, which is more heavyweight has a
    higher learning curve.

    Schedule::RateLimiter is an appropriate name for this module.
    "Schedule" is an already established root namespace used for
    scheduling events, and "RateLimiter" does well at describing exactly
    what this module does with scheduled events.

  enteredby:   DWRIGHT (Daniel J. Wright)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 16 00:12:40 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Schedule::
::RateLimiter     bdpOp Throttle the rate of events in tight loops   DWRIGHT
