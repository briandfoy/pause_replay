The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SDP
  DSLIP:       adhfg
  description: Parse and generate SDP session descriptions
  userid:      WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will implement the Session Description Protocol.

    It will provide routines for parsing and generating SDP stream
    descriptions.

    I'm not sure if a single, top-level "SDP" package name is the way
    to go with this. Net::SDP is a somewhat-desirable alternative, as
    SDP is used in a networking environment just like MIME is, but, also
    like MIME, it doesn't actually do any networking itself, it just
    describes it. And the Net::* namespace is usually reserved for
    Internet clients and, to a lesser extent, Internet servers, so that
    name might be somewhat misleading.

    Any recommended alternatives?

The resulting entry would be:

SDP               adhfg Parse and generate SDP session descriptions  WGDAVIS
