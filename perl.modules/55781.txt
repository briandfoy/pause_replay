I did consider something along those lines, and I'm open to suggestions.

However, it doesn't share anything with Config::Any, other than using
its plugins to load config files. Wouldn't putting it under the
Config::Any namespace imply that it uses the Config::Any module?

The idea behind the module is that it just sucks a whole tree up and
presents it to you in a hash - so loader seemed appropriate.

As I say, I'm open to suggestions. Also, I'm in Perl Monks chatterbox
[clinton] if you want to talk further.

thanks

Clint
