apologize for the delay.]

This was discussed in the module-authors mailing list.  The document is a
PDF, significantly larger than the module itself, which affects the
download time.  The M::P::S::Doc solution was suggested on the
module-authors mailing list.

The full discussion starts here:
<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/4558>

My message that I was taking this suggestion is here:
<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/4645>.  It got no
reply, which led me to believe it was not controversial.
