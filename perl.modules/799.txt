Hi Sander,

Don't get me wrong. I was just curious and wanted to make sure that there
was not too much overlap. Sometimes people find that they're working on
the same thing and doing it the same way and benefit from joining their
efforts. From your description it surely sounds like you're not doing it
the same way or with the same goals so having the seperate modules would
be great.

happy new year! :-)
