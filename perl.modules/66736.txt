The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chinese
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Converting Arabic numerals into Chinese
  userid:      PANYU (PAN YU)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)

    Roman

  rationale:

    The function of this module: The function of this module is
    converting Arabic numerals into Chinese. In Chinese, there are
    characters corresponding with Arabic numerals from 0 to 9. However,
    when people express a larger number in Chinese, for example 120 or
    4500, there are much more trick things to convert these numbers to
    Chinese. Particularly, money expressed in Arabic numerals is quite
    different from the money expressed in Chinese for bank system. Here
    is a picture to show the difference.

    The Significance of this module: There is a spreading use of
    Chinese in bank system and it is difficult for even an adult to
    write bank related Chinese in a correct way. However, for some
    security reasons, bank system in China is still using these
    expressions. In every bank in China, tellers will help people write
    these numerals when transferring fund is needed. But for net bank
    software, using programs to convert Arabic numerals to Chinese is
    almost required.

    Current development stage: Actually, I have been using this module
    for a few years without distribution. Now, I think it is the time to
    share this module with others. I have re-written this module in
    OO-Perl and tested it for a while.
