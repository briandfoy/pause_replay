The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Enumeration
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: An enumerated class for Perl
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    RPI lily

  similar:
    enum, Object::Enum

  rationale:

    The essential feature of an enumeration is that it is a class whose
    instantiated objects can only hold one of a limited set of values.

    Existing enumeration modules on CPAN simply provide a way to
    enumerate sets of constants. While useful, that functionality does
    not group these constants into sets that can only apply to specific
    variables.

    My module allows authors to subclass Enumeration to provide
    distinct sets of enumerated constants for diverse purposes; does not
    pollute the end user's namespace (unless the end user wants it to),
    prevents enumeration name conflicts by loading the constants into
    the author's subclass's namespace, and provides overloads for the
    'eq' and 'ne' operators to make comparisons simple.

    I considered adding this sort of functionality to the existing
    enumeration modules on CPAN, but given these modules' interfaces,
    this does not seem possible to me.

The resulting entry would be:

Enumeration       bdpOd An enumerated class for Perl                 ROODE
