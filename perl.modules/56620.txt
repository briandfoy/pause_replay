Hi Lincoln,

yep. Boulder is going to stay. Sorry for the annoyance. If you want to
make it installable via "cpan Boulder" and make the link on your
search.cpan.org author page under "Registered Modules" work, you could
include a simple, almost-empty "Boulder.pm" containing a package
statement in a new release. That would make it indexable under
"Boulder". That's entirely up to you, of course. (Yes, I see it's from
2002.)

Best regards,
Steffen
