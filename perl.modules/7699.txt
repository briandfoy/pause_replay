Are you saying, you see no text between these headings? I cannot
reproduce that. Please try a different CPAN mirror. I just visited
ftp://ftp.uni-hamburg.de/pub/soft/lang/perl/CPAN/modules/00modlist.long.html

And there I see, e.g.

    Part 3 - Big Projects Registry

    This section of the Module List is devoted to listing "Big Projects". I don't want to define Big (or even Project) here. Hopefully the items below speak for themselves. Almost all are
    just ideas, though some have been dabbled with and some are active projects. 

    These are ideas for people with very strong skills and lots of time. Please talk, and listen, to Larry and the perl5-porters _before_ starting to do any work on projects which relate
    to the core implementation of Perl. 

    Ask not when these will be implemented, ask instead how you can help implement them. 

    1) Items in the Todo File

    The Todo supplied with Perl lists over 50 items in categories ranging from "Would be nice to have" to "Vague possibilities". 

    Contacts: P5P

    2) Multi-threading

    [...]

If you're missing text in between, I'm interested to hear more
details. Maybe it's due to an XHTML error that only manifests itself
on some browsers.
