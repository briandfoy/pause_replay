The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::FilterXML
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: E-Mail filtering using Mail::Audit.
  userid:      MATTMK (Matthew MacKenzie)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Discussion will be centered around a central development
    environment, such as a Sourceforge project.

  similar:
    Closely related to Mail::Audit in that it extends, or is an
    application of Mail::Audit. Mail::FilterXML is easier to use (at the
    expense of some functionality) because filtering rules are specified
    in XML. This means that one does not need to write some Perl to
    filter one's email, just an XML file containing some basic rules.

  rationale:

    Using Mail:: as my toplevel namespace is a no-brainer. I'm
    suggesting Mail::FilterXML instead of Mail::Audit::FilterXML because
    FilterXML is more of an application of ::Audit, and the Audit::
    namespace seems to be for "plugins" to Audit. If it is deemed
    apropriate to live under Audit::, I can deal with that.

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::FilterXML       bdpOa E-Mail filtering using Mail::Audit.          MATTMK
