Hi,

I'm asking this question from you^Wus naming czars on behalf of Tom C.
As you (hopefully) noticed, Tom put out the combination of a rewrite
of the perldoc idea AND pmtools, alpha version, out for further field
testing.  (see e.g. use.perl.org in case you missed the announcement).
Now, the namespaces of the modules.  Currently Tom is using PM::Tools,
which may or may not be a good name, and Tom wants our help.  Please
take a look at the thing and voice your opinions.
