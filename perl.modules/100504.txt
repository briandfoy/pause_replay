Hello! I would like to maintain or co-maintain Minecraft::RCON. The last 
release of Minecraft::RCON was in January 2013, and unfortunately lacks 
a critical feature (fragmentation support). I have tried to contact the 
author and current maintainer (DEMMY) at both his listed email, 
<frederik@webkonsept.com> as well as the <demmy@cpan.org> address, with 
no reply. Communication summary:


  * August 19th - Sent email asking about future plans for module, or 
willingness to allow me to work on it. No bounce, no reply.

  * August 26th - Filed RT #130381 regarding fragmentation support. No 
activity yet.

  * September 5th - Sent a follow-up email. No bounce, no reply.

(Emails with headers below)

I have been maintaining my own local copy of this distribution with 
several fixes and improvements (including tests, and frag support), so 
it would be nice to be able to make this module relevant again.

Thanks,
- Ryan <rjt@cpan.org>

Hi Fredrik!

I'm looking at the Minecraft::RCON
<https://metacpan.org/release/Minecraft-RCON> module you've written. It
looks great, and I would like to use it in a project of mine, but the
lack of fragmentation support is a problem. I notice you had some future
plans to implement that, but the last update to the module was nearly
seven years ago. Did you ever end up implementing fragmentation support?
And do you have any plans to work on the module anytime soon? If not,
would you consider passing the maintainer torch? I'd be able to keep it
maintained along with other ongoing work I'm doing.

Cheers,
- Ryan <rjt@cpan.org>

Hi again Fredrik!

I haven't heard back from you yet... and that's OK! I don't want to put
any pressure on you. I just wanted to let you know that I filed an issue
on rt.cpan.org (#130381
<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130381>) for the
fragmentation support. Do you have any desire to work on this module? If
so, great! Otherwise, I'd be happy to contact the PAUSE admins to get it
switched over. I don't have any other contact information for you, but
as the last message did not bounce, hopefully these are getting through.

Cheers,
- Ryan <rjt@cpan.org>
