Subject: Namespace for phonenumber lookup module

Greetings,

I've been maintaining a horrible application for a few years now to
lookup Dutch phonenumbers (using some LWP'ing on
http://www.detelefoongids.nl/).  I believe time has finally come to
rewrite the entire thing and make a Perl module for it (heck, why
not).

The problem now is that I'm not sure what to call this. I've looked
at similiar modules and found WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes. I could go
on with WWW::Search::Detelefoongids (or better
WWW::Search::DeTelefoongids ?), but it looks like the Pagesjaunes
module does _not_ follow the WWW::Search module, making it -IMHO-
useless to name it that way, for developers could assume it _would_
follow the rules of WWW::Search.

I'm not too fond of the WWW::Search setup. IIRC, it allows but one
scalar input which makes it cludgy to ask for 'lastname', 'city' and
optional 'street address'. Besides that, WWW::Mechanize seems
perfect for querying websites.

So, can anyone suggest a good namespace for my module-to-be ?
