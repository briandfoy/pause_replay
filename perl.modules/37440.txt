does "aka" work for those who don't prefer english?  I'd prefer
a whole world.

Just something to consider:

   use alias 'Namespace::Preferred::Customer' => 'Customer';

Or, I think this might (might...) make more sense with the 
actual alias closer to the word "alias".

   use alias 'Customer' => 'Namespace::Preferred::Customer';
