The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RTF::Tokenizer
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Module for Tokenizing RTF
  userid:      SARGIE (Peter Sergeant)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:
    RTF::Parser

  rationale:

    RTF::Parser knows too much about RTF - if you want to do something
    fairly different, it won't let you. RTF::Tokenizer does exactly what
    it says on the tin - it spits out tokens. There is a module (and
    more inside) that helps parse the RTF too if you feel so inclined.

  enteredby:   SARGIE (Peter Sergeant)
  enteredon:   Wed Jul  3 12:57:00 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RTF::
::Tokenizer       bdphp Module for Tokenizing RTF                    SARGIE
