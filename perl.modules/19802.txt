Hello !
=20
My name is Lars Lundberg, I have been working some time with a module
which I would like to contribute to CPAN.=20
=20
The preliminary name of the module is PDF::Reuse. It has good =
performance,
sometimes very good performance, and high capacity. It handles forms, =
images, text,
Acrobat JavaScript and graphics to create new PDF-files.
=20
"Forms" are ordinary pages from PDF-files transformed to "XObjects" (an =
internal
PDF-format), which makes it possible to reuse the page as a unit, create =
long but=20
compact lists, and to combine it with other elements.
Images can be taken from old PDF-files. Text is created with 12 of the =
14 standard fonts
of Acrobat. You can reuse fonts from imported pages also.
=20
You can do "low level" programming with the basic graphic operators of =
PDF. This is
an unusual and powerful possibility. You can mix your "low level" code =
with the=20
forms, fonts and other elements.
=20
You can merge JavaScripts from one included PDF-file with scripts you =
attach to
the document you are creating, and you can initiate the attached =
JavaSripts. These
"interactive" functions are experimental, but they work with Acrobat 5.0 =
and Acrobat Reader 5.1.
The other "graphic" functions should be fairly stable.
=20
You can have libraries of PDF-code, JavaScripts and "low level" modules =
written in Perl
and reuse most of it.
As the module has good performance, it is possible to mass produce files =
with it.=20
=20
My e-mail address is elkelund@worldonline.se
=20
If I get a CPAN Author ID, I would prefer it to be LARSLUND.
=20
Best Regards
Lars Lundberg
