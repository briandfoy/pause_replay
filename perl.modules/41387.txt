The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lemonldap::NG::Handler
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Web-SSO handler based on Apache::Session
  userid:      GUIMARD (Xavier Guimard)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=43370

  similar:
    Lemonldap::Handlers::Generic

  rationale:

    Lemonldap is a Web-SSO highly used in french administrations and
    based on Apache::Session. it was tested successfully under strong
    load (up to 1800 requests per seconds - tested by Compuware for the
    French ministry for finances).

    As Lemonldap has a monolithic design, we've decided to propose a
    new development branch named Lemonldap::NG. It's a complete
    re-design, object oriented and theoretically faster (but not yet
    tested). This is the Web-SSO used by the french "Gendarmerie
    Nationale" (first French administration to decide to replace
    Microsoft Office by OpenOffice.org completely for its 70.000 users).
    Version 0.02 contains the patches produced by this administration.

    In a few months, we will add an extension designed to be compatible
    with Liberty Alliance shemes (four developers work currently above).

The resulting entry would be:

Lemonldap::NG::
::Handler         bmpOp Web-SSO handler based on Apache::Session     GUIMARD
