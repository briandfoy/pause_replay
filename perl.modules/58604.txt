To me knowledge, there is none. Would you agree to using 
Statistics::Test::WolcoxonRankSum? Two reasons: In my opinion, adding 
the "Test" gives a slightly better idea what it's about. Second reason: 
There's precedence. I've been using Statistics::Test:: for other modules.

What do you think?

Best regards,
Steffen
