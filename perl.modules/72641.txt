The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       InterMine
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: InterMine datawarehouse webservice access
  userid:      INTERMINE (InterMine)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    www.intermine.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am trying to choose a good name for a very abstract module: the
    three choices I have are:

    InterMine, WWW::InterMine, and API::InterMine

    I was hoping for a bit of feedback about what an appropriate
    namespace is for this module: It is an interface to the webservice
    api for InterMine datawarehouses, which are primarily used for
    genomic information (although there is no reason this should
    necessarily be so). It is fairly feature rich, and extensible,
    allowing for queries to the service and results processing, with the
    facility to manage individual user profiles and private information.
    Clearly, being a webservice, the WWW namespace seems reasonable;
    yet, on the other hand, as access to the webservice API , API seems
    to make sense too (although I am aware of PAUSE's official
    disapproval of the API:: namespace). On the third hand, neither WWW
    nor API add much in the way of intelligible information to the name,
    and comparable modules in Bioinformatics such as BioMart and Ensembl
    (although not available through the CPAN) do use top level
    namespaces. Which of the three options do you feel is the most
    appropriate?

  enteredby:   INTERMINE (InterMine)

The resulting entry would be:

InterMine         bdpOp InterMine datawarehouse webservice access    INTERMINE
