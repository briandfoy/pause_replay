The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JSON::Simple
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Easy to use JSON producer and parser
  userid:      PRAMAKERS (Peter-Anders Ramakers)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Once it's a little more standard compliant (read: has documentation)
    I'lll make an RFC on PerlMonks

  similar:
    the JSON family, JSON, JSON::XS, JSON:PP. I found their interfaces
    too confusing for just churning out something simple as JSON so I
    rolled JSON::Simple.

  rationale:

    There are a lot of formats for data exchange. XML and YAML just to
    name two. A little while ago I found myself in a situation where I
    was facing the need for a configuration file syntax that allowed for
    things like hashes and arrays. Before I knew it I was almost about
    to write an implementation for something quite similar to JSON when
    it struck me that I could just as easily use an existing JSON module
    to fit my needs.

    Much to my dismay, I was met with confusing interfaces when I
    worked myself through the documentation of the JSON, JSON::XS and
    JSON::PP modules. All I wanted was something that could parse and
    produce my config files with support for hashes and arrays. It
    shouldn't have to be so difficult.

    But hey, this is Perl, with its unique community. TIMTOWDI. Using
    one of the existing JSON modules out there is not the only way to
    get my JSON parser/producer. I could always roll one myself.

    JSON is a simple format. Modules for working with the format should
    be simple to use. JSON::Simple is supposed to be one approach for
    that.

The resulting entry would be:
