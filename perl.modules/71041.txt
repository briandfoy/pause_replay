     why:

    I have a few modules which I think should be uploaded to CPAN. My
    projects live mostly on GitHub (http://github.com/andychilton) so
    take a look there.

    Out of interest, I applied for an account in December but didn't
    hear anything back. Sorry, I should have pinged you earlier. Hope
    that's ok to try again :)
