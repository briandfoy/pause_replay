In short:

I agree it is not ideal, but I thought that since Integrator::Module::Build is a Module::Build that knows how to 'ACTION_integrator_test' and 'ACTION_integrator_sync', I thought I had
to make the link to Module::Build stronger...


With more background info: 

The main usage I have for Integrator::Module::Build is to create modules
(with the help of Module::Starter) and to distribute them as standalone
test harnesses that are compatible with the XML API of Integrator (a
requirement driven test framework).

Then the ./t directory contains test cases, the ./lib may contain some
specific testing  packages and the whole thing holds-up nice and clean
with the capacity to 'ACTION_dist' 'ACTION_install', 'ACTION_help' and
the rest like any Module::Build based module would already quite well
do... On top of that such a module could 'ACTION_integrator_test' and
'ACTION_integrator_sync' as long as Integrator::Module::Build is
specifiec in the Build.PL file.

Moreover, any other module could be reporting test results into
Integrator by simply modifiying the said Build.PL file so that it uses
Integrator::Module::Build.

So, since the  work is done by the module itself, wether the testing
involves Test::Simple, Test::More ... or anything else, I went with the
module builder connection.

Let me know if you think this make any sense. This is my first post and
I certainly welcome any advice !

Regards,
FX
