The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Set::Files
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: routines to work with sets, one set per file
  userid:      SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.*

  similar:
    None that I'm aware of

  rationale:

    I wanted to be able to define sets of elements with each set
    definied in a separate file.

    By defining sets in separate files, it allows you to trivially
    delegate maintenance of one or more sets to other individuals
    without giving them write access to ALL sets, or without having to
    write SUID scripts to access the data.

    Sets may be defined in terms of other sets using a simple
    include/exclude mechanism making it easy to define hierarchies of
    sets.

The resulting entry would be:

Set::
::Files           RdpOp routines to work with sets, one set per file SBECK
