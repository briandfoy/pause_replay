Hello Christopher,

Are you still maintaining MooseX::Attribute::Trait::Lvalue?

I'd like to add support for it to honour type constraints, triggers and
other Moosey things.

If you're still maintaining it, then how should I submit the changes to
you? Do you have a source code repository for the module on e.g. github?
Or would you prefer a diff sent by e-mail?

If you're no longer interested in maintaining this module, I'd be happy to
take over. You can either log in to PAUSE and assign co-maintainer
permissions to me, or if you can't remember your PAUSE login details,
reply to this e-mail, copying in modules@perl.org and saying you're OK for
me to have co-maint should be sufficient.

thanks

-Toby
