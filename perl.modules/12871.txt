IMHO, the delaunay triangulation 
is a geometric algorithm,
but it isn't very used in mathematician way in computer science
(as long as you don't build an automatic theorem proover :-()

So I would suggest
Algorithm::Geometry::Delaunay  

or (as the algorithm is well known) 
Algorithm::Delaunay

or (as other triangulation algorithms are imaginable)
Algorithm::Triangulation::Delaunay
