Ooops, seems I missed that part of the "naming modules" article, sorry for
that! Just SAFT definitely seems like a good name (provided there indeed
is no appropriate rootlevel namespace I could fit in - but it seems there
isn't).

Can you (or someone else) change my namespace request from "SAFT::Simple"
to "SAFT", or should I start a new registration? (I hope I have not missed
the part answering that question as well...)

Thanks,
Martin
