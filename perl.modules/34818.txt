Subject: W3C::LogValidator - indexed but tarball not uploaded?

Dear PAUSE and CPAN maintainer(s),

I have been trying to upload the latest version of module  
W3C::LogValidator through PAUSE, but a glitch (or possibly a mistake on  
my side) appears to be complicating things.

Indexing worked fine, i.e I received the indexing mails from PAUSE  
system and the module info show up on search.cpan fine, however the  
link to the tarball[1] from the module's page[2] returns a 404 not  
found.

[1]  
http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/O/OL/OLIVIERT/LogValidator/W3C- 
LogValidator-0.4.1.tar.gz
[2] http://search.cpan.org/~oliviert/W3C-LogValidator-0.4.1/

Following instructions on the PAUSE site, I requested re-indexing of  
the file, but that did not seem to work either. I can not figure out  
whether this is an issue with PAUSE, the CPAN or something in my  
module.

Any help on solving this issue would be very much appreciated.

Regards,
