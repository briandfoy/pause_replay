Hello,
    My name is Luis.  I have been using a
module called DB_File::Lock for the past year on a
project.  I was asked by my employeer to develop a way
to remove data not associated with a hash in a dbm
file.  The objective was to streamline a dbm file
because using the remove function only removes the
hash and not the data associated to the hash.
    I was successful in creating the module and now I
want to prepare it for distribution.  Under the advice
of the PAUSE page, I am asking for your perspective on
a namespace.  I was think DB_File::GarbageRemoval or
DBM::GarbageRemoval.  What do you think?

thanks,

Luis
