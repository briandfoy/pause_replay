By the looks, while String::CRC does a CRC, it doesn't say the actual 
CRC algorithm it uses, which looks like a different algorithm to the Zip 
CRC algorithm.

The module also hasn't been changed in 9 years, which suggests it is 
defunct.

I'd take a look at an alternative methods. Either use the Archize::Zip 
method directly (if you need a Zip-compatible CRC) or perhaps another 
CRC module can handle Zip-compatible CRCs.
