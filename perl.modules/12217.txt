description:

I have written a perl module which is basically an interface for building
IDMEF messages.

IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format) is defined in a recent
rfc (http://www.silicondefense.com/idwg/) and is an XML format for
representing alerts produced by Intrusion Detection Systems. There exists
currently a couple of apis (in C and java) designed to help users to build
IDMEF messages in a convenient way, but there is no such facility under
perl. IDMEF apis are mainly used by translation daemons that parse the log
files from some security related softwares (ids, firewall, antivirus...) and
convert them to IDMEF equivalents. This is typically the kind of application
where perl is powerfull, hence the desire of having such an IDMEF api in
perl too.

The module was developed as an assignment from my employer, Proact Defcom, a
scandinavian managed security provider, who sees a lot of interest into
spreading this code to help partners to develop modules to export the logs
from their proprietary software into standard IDMEF. The code will hence be
distributed under BSD license, with mention of Proact's involvement.

From a programmer's point of view, the module is a wrapper around a
XML::Simple hash, plus a XML DTD loader which parses and loads the IDMEF DTD
at run time and derives the whole api from it. In this respect, this code is
actually independent from the DTD used, and could be adapted for other XML
DTDs. It additionaly provides a few IDMEF related functions that usage has
shown to be usefull to have...
