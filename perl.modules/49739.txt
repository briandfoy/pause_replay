Three of them might reasonably be described as "astronomical", but most
users of TT wouldn't think of it from that point of view, so I think
that would be a poor categorisation.  "These sorts of time systems"
are actually several sorts, as I said.  The only technical term that
covers all of them is "time scale", but that's an awfully broad term (see
<http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/timescales.html>).  Most things
under Time:: involve some kind of time scale, so I don't think that's
a useful categorisation.

I've occasionally used the term "precision time scale", but that's
a slight misnomer and not a technical term.  Whether there is such
a thing as an "inherently imprecise time scale" is a philosophical
issue: Universal Time, for example, is inherently imprecise, and at low
precision can be regarded as a time scale, but it may be better viewed as
a family of time scales.  I use the term mostly to indicate working with
a precision such that the differences between these time scales matter,
contrasting with the casual time handling that suffices (or, at least,
used to suffice) for ordinary civilian use.  It's mostly a feature of
how the scale is used, not of the scale itself.

Can you describe what feature of these modules it is that you want to
reflect in the name?  Do any of the already-registered Time:: modules
share this feature?
