Let's make this explicit statement opt-in. It bars us from ever touching 
the module if the author disappears.

No. That would be a disaster. The default must be "The author has not 
spoken on this matter" and we must be very clear on whatever page lists 
the various statements that choosing the above is a very serious 
problem. Or don't offer this kind of choice at all. Nobody forces us to 
provide the authors with an EXPLICIT mechanism to shoot themselves and 
the whole community in the foot.

If in doubt, we follow the 04pause.html#takeover procedure which I'd 
summarize as "take care and respect the author".

Fair enough. Though I'd like to see an intermediate like "the above, but 
please do send a note to the author".

Sorry, probably a language FAIL here. "The place where you mark an 
entire author as endorsing the covenant".

Cheers,
