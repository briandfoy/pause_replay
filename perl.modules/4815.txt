Hello,

AH>I'd like to register for a PAUSE account. The module I wish to submit is
AH>Time::Timer, a simple object-oriented timer which uses Time::HiRes and
AH>allows developers to simply benchmark portions of their code in a very
AH>nonintrusive way.

Just as an update, after some discussion on comp.lang.perl.modules, it's
been decided that the module I wish to submit would be better named
Benchmark::Timer as that describes its purpose much more accurately.

Here is the revised short module description:

    Name              DSLI  Description
    ----------------  ----  ---------------------------
    Benchmark::Timer  RdpO  Perl code benchmarking tool

You can find a newer version with some bugfixes and the new name here:

Thanks!

Humbly,

Andrew
