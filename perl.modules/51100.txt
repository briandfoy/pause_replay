     why:

    The maintainer of Net::vCard asked me to take over maintenance of
    Net::vCard and the associated Net::vFile. He says he hasn't worked
    on it in a while. I have no big plans for the module, just some bug
    fixes and making sure it's standard-compliant.

    I am trying to find information about how to get write access to an
    existing module. Any help in that regard would be appreciated.
