The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RNA::HairpinFigure
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Draw hairpin-like text figure
  userid:      SHENWEI (Wei Shen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    miRNA database miRBase maintains miRNAs and their precursors --
    pre-miRNAs which have hairpin-like secondary structures. They
    provide the hairpin-like text figure along with sequences and
    secondary structures in dot-bracket notation which could produced by
    ViennaRNA package.

    However, neigher miRBase nor ViennaRNA provide any scripts or
    programs to transfrom dot-bracket notation to hairpin-like text
    figure, which was needed in our miRNA prediction project.

    RNA::HairpinFigure draws hairpin-like text figure from RNA sequence
    and its secondary structure in dot-bracket notation. If the hairpin
    have multi loops, they will be deleted and treated as a big loop,
    the longest stem will be the final stem.

The resulting entry would be:

RNA::
::HairpinFigure   Rdpfp Draw hairpin-like text figure                SHENWEI
