The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Mimetic
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: crypt and camouflage a file with a mask
  userid:      ERICH (Erich Roncarolo)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows you to hide a file by encrypting it and then
    attaching it to another file of your choice. This mimetic file then
    looks and behaves like a normal file, and can be stored, used or
    emailed without attracting attention. Although this could be
    considered a steganography program, it implements a very very
    trivial steganography. A lot of steganography programs use smarter
    methods, but they can hide only few informations in big files. I
    wrote this module because it can be used to hide big files behind
    little ones; obviously a gif larger than 5MB could be souspicious,
    but a doc or a pdf with the same size should not attract attention.
    The Mimetic namespace is needed because the module has submodules
    that rule encryption algorithms.

  enteredby:   ERICH (Erich Roncarolo)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug  5 15:49:41 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::Mimetic         adpfp crypt and camouflage a file with a mask      ERICH
