Subject: First request: co-maint on Crypt::DES, Crypt::IDEA, Crypt::Blowfish
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: daoswald@gmail.com (David Oswald)

Crypt::DES, Crypt::IDEA, and Crypt::Blowfish are broken in a way that
became evident with the release of Perl 5.18.  Actually there were
early warnings in Perl 5.17, but Perl 5.18, being an official release,
is where it became critical.

Several modules depend on these three Crypt::* modules.  For example,
Authen::Passphrase.  These modules are also unable to be installed on
Perl 5.18, because of the issue with their Crypt::DES, Crypt::IDEA, or
Crypt::Blowfish dependencies.

On May 20, I created "Unauthorized Releases" to these modules that
apply patches to fix the problems.  I also emailed the author, Dave
Paris (dparis@w3works.com).  He responded on May 21st to say that he
would patch and upload official releases within 48 hours.

On May 30, noting that there had been no new releases, I followed up
with Dave asking if there has been any progress, and offering my
assistance if he's too busy to maintain them.  There has been no
reply.

On June 13, still with no new releases, I followed up again with Dave
offering to provide assistance in getting an official release uploaded
to CPAN.  There has been no reply.

It's now June 22, over 30 days since Perl 5.18 was released, and these
module are still broken.  I haven't been able to get a response from
the author since May 21st.

I understand that module authors become busy, distracted, lose
interest, and so on.  There's nothing wrong with that;  That's what
"co-maint" is all about.  I'm requesting co-maint access to
Crypt::DES, Crypt::IDEA, and Crypt::Blowfish so that I can get them
patched, and maintained to more current CPAN standards.  I realize
that granting co-maintainership can be a lengthy process, especially
when the original author is difficult to reach.

Please let me know what criteria you will need to have met before this
request can be granted.

Dave
