The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Git::Cmdr
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Command line to Git that makes it way better
  userid:      SBLANTON (Sean Blanton)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    mailinglists, chatrooms, github

  similar:
    ClearCase::*, SVN::*, CVS::*, Git::*

  rationale:

    This is for an ambitious project called "Git Commander" It is more
    for providing a new command line interface for Git, but of course
    the modules will be there as an API.

    I can't believe as popular as Git is, that nothing of sufficient
    scope and quality has been developed to make it easy to use, or
    extend it's functionality to more proper team SCM, or with a way to
    manage multiple Git repositories as part of a larger project. I aim
    to do all of that.

    Linus says Git needs an SCM layer, and with my 15 years of
    corporate version control, SCM and build experience, I guess I'm the
    one who has to write it.

    Re the 'Git::Cmdr' namespace: 'Cmdr' is an official abbreviation
    for the military rank of Commander and it is like the familiar DOS
    abbreviation for 'command', 'Cmd', but with and 'r' at the end for
    command-er. I actually prefer fully spelled out English words, but
    'Git::Commander' seems too long. If you guys think it better, I
    could go with that longer version.

    Thanks
