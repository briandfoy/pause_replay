It really is just for Apache logs, using the Apache extended log  
format. I suppose it could be used with other web servers that also log  
in the same format (as many do) but it reads and parses Apache's  
httpd.conf file format as well to determine how to process the logs.

I didn't see one that was similarly appropriate. What I did see were  
other similar utilities (that did different things with the logs) like  
Apache::Logs which were all found in the Apache namespace, so that  
appeared to be what others found was  the most appropriate place.
