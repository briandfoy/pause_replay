Not as it is programmed now. PAUSE would answer:

    ERROR: The submission didn't succeed due to the following reason:

      Dist C/CN/CNANDOR/AudioCD-0.20.tar.gz, current version 0.20 has
      been uploaded by CNANDOR. Please contact CNANDOR or choose a
      different namespace.

I believe this makes sense, doesn't it?

The only allowed procedure would be that you register both modules and
then change the owner.

Makes sense? Better suggestions?
