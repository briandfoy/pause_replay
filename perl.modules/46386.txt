No sorry, we do not have a better address.

Sure, please upload a new distribution to CPAN. It will not be indexed
by the indexer, but at least it is then public. If you do not hear
from Martien in the next weeks, let us know and we can make you
co-maintainer. Then you can trigger the indexer to reindex your distro.

Thanks for your initiative,
