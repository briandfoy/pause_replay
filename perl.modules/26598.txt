The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::HA
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: High Availability / Load Balancing for DBI
  userid:      HASSEILY (Henri Asseily)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    DBI mailing lists

  similar:
    DBD::Multiplex

  rationale:

    DBIx::HA is a high availability module for DBI, with
    load-balancing, multiple failovers, timeouts, configurable retries,
    etc...

    It is not a driver, but an overload of DBI's connect and execute
    methods. As such, it should be in the DBIx:: namespace as opposed to
    the DBD:: namespace.

    Compared to DBD::Multiplex, DBIx::HA has a very different
    philosophy. While DBD::Multiplex is excellent for read-write on
    multiple servers simultaneously, DBIx::HA is geared towards
    enterprise-level high availability, including integration with
    mod_perl and Apache::DBI.

  enteredby:   HASSEILY (Henri Asseily)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 29 19:59:21 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::HA              RdpOp High Availability / Load Balancing for DBI   HASSEILY
