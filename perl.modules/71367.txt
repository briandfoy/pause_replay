The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JSP
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: A bridge between perl and javascript
  userid:      SORTIZ (Salvador Ortiz)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl-javascript@perl.org

  similar:
    JavaScript JavaScript::SpiderMonkey JavaScript::V8 JavaScript::Lite

  rationale:

    JSP is a true bridge between the perl and javascript languages. It
    allows to use from javascript most CPAN modules. Some CPAN modules
    will require some "javascriptfication" wrappers packages and I'm
    planning to put them in the JSP hierarchy.

    JSP is based on Claes Jakobsson's JavaScript module but there are
    massive semantic changes and Claes suggested the fork. JSP uses a
    similar hierarchy of package names and add a lot more, so putting
    inside the JavaScript hierarchy will be confusing for both users
    camps. I think that using JavaScript::NG would be pedantic.

    The JavaScript hierarchy is currently being used for utilities that
    manipulate javascript source code and that is a different purpose
    than ours.

    The JS hierarchy is reserved for javascript code.

The resulting entry would be:

JSP               bdhOp A bridge between perl and javascript         SORTIZ
