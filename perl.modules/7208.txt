Welcome Skud,

great to have you on modules@. You are now both subscribed to the list
and you have admin status on PAUSE, so the next time there you'll see
another menu there that enables you to do some important things in the
process of registering people and modules. There is no howto for
admins, feel free to ask.

If you have gone through the archive, you already know who the other
members of the list are and you also know that we are all lurkers most
of the time. You know very well that this is a permanent source for
frustration among the authors. It would be really nice if that could
be improved in the future and any suggestion for a healthier
registration process are very welcome. About mailing list organization
Johan has written a few thoughts to the list in

Welcome new users messages help us to have a better overview about
pending registrations. If one of us runs a batch of registrations, the
others see that immediately and find out easily which registrations
are already approved.

User update messages have a security aspect.

For the New module submissions I the same thing should apply as above.
For module updates I'd agree that they can be directed to /dev/null.

I think this is quite correct.

I don't care if this is one or two mailing lists, I'd be subscribed to
both anyway. Please also consider that the confirmation mails from
PAUSE may contain a commentary field from the admin to the author, so
these messages *sometimes* have important content.
