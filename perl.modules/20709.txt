Sorry, the robot's mail could indeed be improved to be better
decipherable. I have a few suggestions on the table but couldn't find
the tuits to implement them.

You are KARASIK, not AWIN, right? It's about the namespace "Editor"
that you use in line 248 of Prima-1.10/Prima/VB/VBControls.pm.

You get the robot message for the first time because it was
implemented in February.

While I was looking into your directory it came to me that one of the
next important tasks on PAUSE will be to implement a quota and a
cleanup policy. Please delete old versions of your module. CPAN is not
a backup medium; but it does have a backpan, so old versions are not
completely lost.
