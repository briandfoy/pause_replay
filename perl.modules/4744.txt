INCList-1.0-tar-gz @INCLUDE-dir header display tool

for starters, a script that displays the headers of
modules in @INC, ports Windows and unix/linux

this module descends into @INC dirs and extracts and
displays headers. It will soon have optional searching
and display options.

I've seen this discussed on the newsgroup perl.misc
but the answer I saw was usually instructing users to
directory @INC manually. I don't recall seeing an @INC
reporter before in CPAN, and I searched all modules
today for INC and didn't see it. (maybe its there but
I missed it?).. 

I also have many other ideas I'm considering adding to
the repository.
