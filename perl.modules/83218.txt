     why:

    To submit bugs and help maintain existing modules; currently
    wishing to submit a bug for Net::SMTP::TLS.

    Currently the module looks abandoned (untouched in years and
    author's email addresses are invalid) so in the future I may be
    looking to the PAUSE admins for their help in getting myself added
    as a maintainer. (Beginning the process mentioned on
    http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_adopt_module)
