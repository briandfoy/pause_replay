Hi,

I would think Math::Ternary::Logic or better yet Math::Logic::Ternary 
would be the most appropriate name for this module. As far as I can 
tell, "ternary" is the correct word for what you're looking at. But then 
again, I am not a native english speaker. If you absolutely must have a 
two-level namespace, consider "TernaryLogic". But the first two 
suggestions are certainly more appropriate.
