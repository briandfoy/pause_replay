The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Pivot
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Transposes (pivots) a table
  userid:      MSICKEL (Morten Sickel)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module is transposing or pivoting a table. I.e taking values
    from the columns of a table and using as row and column headers in
    the new table, I have found the functionality in MS excel and a
    number of other properitary spread sheet and data base packages. I
    have been thinking about making this module for a while to avoid
    having to start up excel each time I need to 'pivot' a table, I have
    also seen several queries for this functionality on some of the
    postgreSQL mailing lists.

    For development, I have been using the namespace Table::Pivot, but
    to my surprise, no root level name space Table exists, I think that
    DBIx is the closest rlns, since (at least for me...) most of the use
    of the module will be in connection with DBI, although it is by no
    means limited to that.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Pivot           adpOp Transposes (pivots) a table                  MSICKEL
