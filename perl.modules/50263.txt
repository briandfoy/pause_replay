Hi all,

I'm writing a Perl module for sending SMS text messages using a
service provided by AQ ltd (www.aql.com) - the service is
www.sms2email.com.  (BTW I have no connection with them other than
being a user of their services).

I would like to upload it to CPAN for whomever else may find it
useful, I'm thinking a logical name would be Net::AQSMS, but I wanted
to check - it'll be my first CPAN module, so it's possible that it
should go in a different namespace or be given a different name.  I
also thought maybe Net::AQSMS::Send ?

On the same topic, I'm also working on a module which sub-classes
Net::IRC (which is fairly out of date now but still works well) to
provide basic IRC 'bot' functionality over and above that provided by
Net::IRC itself, providing an easy framework to extend.  I'm thinking
that should be Net::IRC::Simplebot, but would obviously be open to
suggestions/criticism/LARTs etc.

Many thanks

David Precious
