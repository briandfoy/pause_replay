     why:

    Modules and tools for manipulating router configurations.

    Over the past years I developed my private collection of Perl tools
    to work with Cisco and Juniper configurations. Some of those started
    off as adaptations of previously published scripts, some are work
    from scratch.

    I now want to publish some of them:

    - Parse Cisco IOS configurations to detect unused or undefined
    access-lists, prefix-lists, route-maps etc.

    - I plan to do the same for Juniper JunOS configurations.

    - Descramble Juniper $9$ secrets.

    - Descramble Cisco type 7 secrets.
