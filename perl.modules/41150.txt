My apologies,

I was submitting the form to register when I realized that the ID i  
chose was to be more than just a login name, and was part of the  
directory structure. I thought I hit stop in time, but apparently  
not, so you guys got two reg requests from me.

The ID i'd like to use is pchriste, not the initially submitted one  
of funkyblue...

Sorry about that, I hope it's not a problem...
