The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::LoggedAuthDBI
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Extended AuthDBI vs Bruteforce and PW Share
  userid:      SIMKIN (Sung-Hun Kim)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module im working on is an extension of Apache::AuthDBI. It
    uses an additional MySQL table to log login attempts and thereby
    gains some ability to repel bruteforce attacks and password sharing.
    I have chosen Apache::LoggedAuthDBI as its namespace since Logging
    is what sets this apart from AuthDBI. I retain the AuthDBI part
    because this is where the module is coming from and the task it
    fulfills is still the same as AuthDBI, only LoggedAuthDBI offers
    some additional protection.

    I believe this kind of functionality might come in handy for many a
    developer and by giving this module exposure it can be improved by
    way of suggestions and comments.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
