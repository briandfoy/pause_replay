 The API however allows it to be programmatically agnostic.

>> One quick question.  If the Zenoss namespace is registered by myself, am
I still able to call my package Zenoss::API? IE currently my package is
instantiated by 'my $api = Zenoss::API->connect();'. I dont know if it would
make sense to have it instantiated via Zenoss->connect(); - or maybe I'm
misunderstanding the namespace registration process. If you think just
'Zenoss' would be better I would just need to re-work some things, no big
deal. I've uploaded my current work to PAUSE, so you can take a look there
if I'm not explaining it correctly.
