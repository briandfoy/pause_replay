The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Speech::Google
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Use Google TTS services
  userid:      NIELSD (Niels Dettenbach)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Web: http://www.syndicat.com/open_source/google/perl/googletts/
    Mailing List: googletts@lists.syndicat.com

  similar:
    Speech::eSpeak, Speech::Synthesiser, Speech::Festival

  rationale:

    Hi all,

    The module or module set offers a optimized and flexible interface
    to remote Google TTS services (officially part of the Google
    Translator) to render high quality speech audio in many different
    languages, adjustable by many options, incl. caching and possibly
    fallback to local tts (like mbrola).

    We have an additional version of the module which offers a much
    more simple perl interface but is usuable with nearly any kind of
    local / console based TTS solution and by concept a much simpler
    alternative then the Speech::Synthesizer concept. It does not make
    any sense for us to go under the Speech::Synthesizer concept as it
    brings no more abstraction by having more classes / code to run (i
    assume that is a reason why there is no TTS module developer using
    that concept except the developer byself). On the other hand - a TTS
    is just one application of speech synthesis.

    From my view it would be more nice to have all these TTS modules
    within a

    Speech::TTS::*

    namespace (i.e. Speech::TTS::Google) but ther still are some other
    specialized TTS modules / scripts on CPAN within different
    namespaces or at the level of "Speech::". If you have a "better
    place" (namespace) pls let me know this too.

    many thanks and best regards,

    Niels.
