The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::Request::I18N
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: I18N extension to Apache::Request
  userid:      FBRIERE (Frédéric Brière)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module extends Apache::Request by adding support for encoded
    parameters, which can be a PITA when stepping out of the blissful
    world of ISO 8859-1. It inherits from A::R and tries to be as
    transparent as possible, so it should work as a drop-in replacement
    from the user's point of view.

    Enhancing Apache::Request itself would have been nice, but it is a
    mystifying hodgepodge of Perl modules and a C library, and
    development has moved on to Apache 2.x anyway. Hence a subclass,
    which is a quick and easy way of getting the job done.

    The name of this module was proposed on the modperl and
    module-authors mailing lists on July 17, 2005, and didn't garner any
    opposition.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::Request::
::I18N            adpOp I18N extension to Apache::Request            FBRIERE
