The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Validation
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Business rule validation framework
  userid:      STOCKS (Bob Stockdale)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://groups.google.com/group/business-validation-dev

  similar:
    Brick

  rationale:

    The Business:: namespace already exists and we are validating data
    against business rules so it seemed pretty natural to use
    Business::Validation.

    This module's approach differs from that of similar modules in that
    it follows the KISS method and is therefore very straight forward to
    use. It does not require a decent amount of reading to get started
    using this module. This module is also very flexible and can be
    adapted easily to many different systems.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::Validation      adpOg Business rule validation framework           STOCKS
