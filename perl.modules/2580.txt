Greetings,
I uploaded a new module File::Mode, It's a simple perl library meant to =
handle file modes in various formats and convert them
to other formats, as well it can store the files of a directory in a =
hash with the files being the keys and their modes in human-readable =
formats the values. (ie. -rwxrwxrwx), other methods are still in =
development.=20

I know the name sounds very major, But I think I did my best to check to =
see that it's not taken. However, If the name
is inappropiate, Please let me know and I'll be willing to correct it.

File::Mode (FileMode-0.05.tar.gz)
DSLI =3D bdpO

uses an Object-Oriented interface and blesses an object reference.=20
