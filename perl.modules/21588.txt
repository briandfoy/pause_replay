The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bot::CPAN
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: provides CPAN services via IRC
  userid:      FOX (Adam J. Foxson)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #perl, #cpan, #poe

  similar:

  rationale:

    Bot::CPAN is a POE based distribution that allows individuals on
    IRC to query the CPAN in a great number of different ways. Bot::CPAN
    will also automatically inform the channels of new uploads to the
    CPAN. It seems to have been received positively on the IRC channels
    it has been bound to.

  enteredby:   FOX (Adam J. Foxson)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun  6 04:47:41 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bot::
::CPAN            bdpOp provides CPAN services via IRC               FOX
