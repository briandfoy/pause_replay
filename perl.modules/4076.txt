Hey Andreas,

Happy New Year, and thanks for setting up the modules for me.

I'm slightly embarassed by my Bundle question. I figured out the
format from looking at some example bundles, so I'm sorry to make you
write it for me.

My real question was do I need to register a specific Bundle module
with CPAN? Or will it figure it out by itself? I have never noticed
the Bundles in the module list, so I figured it's just part of CPAN's
magic.

Thanks again,
jas.
