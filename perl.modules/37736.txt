     why:

    I am already wrote module AZ::Splitter and want to publish them.
    This is object-oriented class for fast and simple splitting big
    files or strings with using little memory. As the same can be used
    for searching data in files, but the main fuction is parsing big
    volume data.

    And right now i am working with AZ::CGI module. This is fastest and
    full securely CGI parser with full RFC support. The main part is
    full compete, but i have little problem with interface and right now
    working on this. Module based on AZ::Splitter.

    ps: Sorry my english..
