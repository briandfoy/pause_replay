The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Common
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Common utilities for networking
  userid:      BPORTER (Bryce Porter)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    IRC, web

  similar:

  rationale:

    I want to make a few modules that will assist in network
    troubleshooting and testing as well as some other small tasks, such
    as speed testing, link reliability, jitter detection, TTL exceeded,
    etc. I feel such things will be of great help to many people,
    especially if they want to see if a host is too far away to talk to,
    etc.

  enteredby:   BPORTER (Bryce Porter)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar 27 04:07:47 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Common          cdpfp Common utilities for networking              BPORTER
