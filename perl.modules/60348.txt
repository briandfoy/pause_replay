I haven't even noticed the Steffen's CC.
Here is the response I've emailed Steffen back.
------
Hey

I'm sorry for the long delay, and I appreciate your efforts to find my
idea a suitable place.

I've been considering your suggestions but I've figured that putting
it in DBIx::WebAdmin while there's DBIx::Web and DBIx::Admin could
create some confusion. And with all due respect (and hell, respect is
due!) to Maypold, Catalyst, Mason and any other named project on CPAN,
I prefer to use something that would:
1. give a feel as a module (because that's what I'm going for)
2. not scare anyone to think it's a completely separate application
and 3. provide people with enough warmth to feel like they could
extend and perfect it.

I was thinking of putting it as Web::DBI or Web::Interface::DBI.
That way people would understand the idea better and it might even
drive a few to write a web interface to something else or extend what
I'm doing.

What do you think? I'm promptly open to suggestions.

Also, I've gone over the Perl Foundation grant proposals and I saw
Grant Grueninger had proposed the following:
http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/05/2008q2_grant_proposal_dbeditor.html
I want to get in touch with him but it seems like he is looking for a
grant on this. I wouldn't want to get in the way of it.

Sorry for the hassle :)
----

Steffen then suggested to drop the redundancy in Web::Interface::DBI
and Web::DBI - which I concurred to.

I'm still more than open to any suggestions others may have. I
apologize for the mix up with the emails.
Sawyer.
