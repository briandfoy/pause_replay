The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::TNC
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A generic interface to TNCs
  userid:      RBDAVISON (R Bernard Davison)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    A TNC (Terminal Node Controller) is a device that interfaces packet
    radio to a user, commonly a computer.

    The Device::TNC and the subclassed modules (i.e. Device::TNC::KISS)
    can be used to interface with a TNC and read/write this packet data
    and make it available for use in Perl.

    TNC's are widely used by amateur radio operators but at present
    there is only one module available THD7 which only interfaces with a
    Kenwood TH-D7 radio and is not portable to other TNC's.

    It is hoped that this name space and the modules in it will go some
    way to correcting this situation and allow the development of more
    programs for use in Amateur Radio using Perl.

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::TNC             RdpOp A generic interface to TNCs                  RBDAVISON
