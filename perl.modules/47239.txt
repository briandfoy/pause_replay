Hello,

The CPAN module GSSAPI-0.13 is broken and does not compile.
We have fixed the bugs and added Heimdal support for GSSAPI-0.14

I know that this is an "unfriendly overtaking" of a module, but the
Author hav not reponded to emails since summer 2005 and the module
itself is unmaintained since 2001.

Am I (PAUSE id AGROLMS) now allowed to upload or do I have
to register the namespace 'GSSAPI' first?
(actually assigned to PGUEN)?
Problem is that Philip Guenther (Philp Guenther) does not respond to emails

What has to be done now?

Thank you, Achim Grolms
