The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::GPS::Data
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: GPS-aquired geographic data management
  userid:      NFMNUNES (Nuno Filipe Monteiro Nunes)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    First off a description of the package and its goal: This package
    (being prepared for upload to CPAN in a couple of weeks or so) will
    be useful for managing the geographic data collected with and being
    fed to a GPS unit. It does not provide any interface to a physical
    GPS unit, it assumes you can get the data and feed it to the module
    and vice-versa. It also is (as far as I could think of it) GPS-brand
    and -model agnostic. If it is not I *will* change it to be so! :)
    The package uses an object-oriented approach to the creation and
    manipulation of waypoint objects and waypoint collections (general
    collections, track logs and routes). The storage of these items is
    implemented in separate modules so that it will be possible (and
    hopefully easy) to write new modules to support different storage
    mechanisms. Initially I will provide an mysql storage module.

    Concerning the namespace: I am aware of two namespaces concerning
    GPS-related stuff: GPS: The top-level name used, so far, to support
    device-specific packages (GPS::Garmin and GPS::Lowrance); Geo::GPS:
    This namespace was discussed previously but I don't think it is
    being used right now by any package.

    I am somewhat divided about which namespace to choose (it could be
    either GPS::Data or Geo::GPS::Data with helper modules bellow any of
    these) but I tend to go with Geo::GPS::Data because while the
    package will provide a way to deal with data gathered from and used
    by a GPS unit but it's object of interest is the geographic data
    more than the GPS itself.

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::GPS::
::Data            cdpOp GPS-aquired geographic data management       NFMNUNES
