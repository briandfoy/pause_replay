Subject: Module submission Tk::StyleDialog

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::StyleDialog
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Stylish dialog boxes with custom icons
  userid:      KIRSLE (Casey Kirsle)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tk::DialogBox, Tk::messageBox

  rationale:

    Tk::StyleDialog is a new dialog/error box for Tk which supports
    custom graphical icons. It pops up dialogs like Tk::DialogBox and
    Tk::messageBox, but these two existing modules are limiting...
    Tk::DialogBox only allows you to use one of Tk's built-in bitmap
    icons for the dialog's emblem, and Tk::messageBox uses the Win32
    built-in MsgBox system, which limits you only to icons of "error,
    info, warning, and question", and limits your button choice to any
    of the built-in Windows button combinations (YesNo, AbortRetryFail,
    etc).

    Tk::StyleDialog allows the calling program to send its own
    Tk::Photo object to use as the icon, or use one of the many built-in
    icons, which were obtained from an online error message generator
    tool. It also allows any number of buttons, and to define certain
    buttons as disabled or "greyed out" (which no existing dialogbox
    widget allows you to do).

The resulting entry would be:
