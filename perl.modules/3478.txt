I was thinking more along the lines of MCrypt::CBC(), MCrypt::OFB(), etc.. for naming.  A search for "crypt" would on CPAN would still be a hit for me.

However, if this breaks naming guidelines, I will have to conform.

FYI: for those MCrypt fans out there, this module will be based on the 2.2.x series of MCrypt. 2.4.x/2.5.x support is not used by me personally, but if there is demand, I can work on it.

suggestions/feedback welcome.

Sounds great, the Crypt modules on CPAN definitely miss a common
consistent interface. How are you going to name this?

Crypt::Mcrypt would fit well, I'd say.
