Ahh! Sorry about that.

I have now marked those (and a few others) old releases for deletion!

Thank you for your work,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that we=E2=80=
=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master. This is caused by old (s=
uperseded) releases being retained in CPAN author directories. So we=E2=80=
=99ve identified the authors who can free up the most diskspace by deleting=
 old releases from their author directory.<br>
<br>
Deleting the old releases of your WWW-HtmlUnit distribution would free up a=
bout 139M, plus you have old releases of other distributions as well.<br>
<br>
Would you be happy to cull your old releases from your CPAN author director=
y please? All releases you=E2=80=99ve ever done will always be available fr=
om your BackPAN author directory:<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 <a href=3D"http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/A=

authors/id/A/AW/AWWAIID/</a><br>
<br>
There are at least 3 ways we can make this happen:<br>
<br>
1. you could use the script here: <a href=3D"https://gist.github.com/xdg/17=
39bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https:=
//gist.github.com/xdg/1739bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38</a><br>
2. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface<br>
3. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf<br>
<br>
The script mentioned in (1) was written by David Golden and Rik Signes. It =
keeps all developer releases later than a stable release, keeps up to 3 sta=
ble releases, and deletes everything else. Use at your own risk, of course.=
<br>
<br>
If you give me permission, I would delete everything other than the latest =
release for anything older than a year, and 3 releases of anything less tha=
n a year old. When marked for deletion, you=E2=80=99d have 3 days to check =
and revert anything you=E2=80=99re not happy with, before PAUSE would actua=
lly delete them.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t clear, =
or if you want to suggest something else.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
