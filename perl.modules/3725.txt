Just wanted to note that SAX2 modules should go in the namespaces
SAXDriver::*, SAXFilter::*, and SAXHandler::*.  This gives them a
consistent new home, and also helps to distinguish them from SAX1
modules already under XML::*.

Summarizing past discussion: the Perl module list maintainers
recommended multiple top-levels for this particular type of naming (so
populating the top-level namespace in this way is intentional).  And
they specifically recommended against three-level naming of modules
that go on a module list (thus deprecating any type of
SAX::*::ModuleName or XML::*::ModuleName scheme).

(XML specific notes follow.)

Otherwise the modules look great.  I didn't see mention of reference
to XML::Writer, which also has a nice script interface for generating
XML, and excellent well-formedness checking too.  XML::Writer with
SAX2 output would likely be what you're thinking of with
XML::Driver::Elemental.

A feature you might want consider, to more easily support namespaces,
is to let the caller register prefixes for method and attribute names
(like 'prefix_local_name'), then output the declarations on the first
element or as they are defined, and then substitute ':' for the first
underscore in the element or attribute name.

Cc'd to modules@perl.org just to make sure that's still the case ;-)
