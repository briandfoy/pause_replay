Subject: Module submission Text::QuickTemplate

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::QuickTemplate
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: A simple, lightweight text fill-in class
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    RPI lily, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Template dTemplate Text::FastTemplate Text::FillIn Text::Macros
    Text::MetaText Text::Template Text::TagTemplate Text::Templet

  rationale:

    There are a zillion templating modules on CPAN. I was hesitant to
    add another. But I do believe that this module offers something that
    the others do not.

    Simplicity.

    The overriding mantra of this module is "simple, not powerful". It
    does not interpolate variables. It does not require you to subclass
    something. It does not require that your filesystem be set up a
    special way. It has no executable content. It does not interpolate
    variables from your namespace, nor pollute your namespace with its
    variables. (well, okay, one). It does not require you to buy into
    any complex syntax.

    What it does do is allow you to create a template from boilerplate
    text, and then to use that template later on in your code. Or, you
    can do both in one step.

    I have found this module extremely useful for those cases where I
    want to use a string as a template, but I do not wish any of the
    overhead or complexity of the other, more powerful modules. The
    Template Toolkit and Text::Template are awesome, but when you want
    to do a little thing, they're way too much. I see people using
    printf() to do these simple templating tasks, and that's the niche
    that Text::QuickTemplate means to fill.

    Thank you.
