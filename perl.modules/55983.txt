Hi Clint,

you'll certainly have to upload under the new name - that's the only way 
to actually change it. About the namespace registration: we can 
theoretically use the old submission and edit it. However, it's more 
convenient for us to just use the one-click version if everything is 
correct :)

If you'd just wait another few days for possible objections from others, 
then upload a tarball with a changed module name and either send me a 
short notice or quickly fill in the registration form for the new name, 
I'd be grateful. That way, I can't lose track.

Best regards,
Steffen
