Subject: Module submission DBIx::Wrapper::VerySimple

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Wrapper::VerySimple
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Very simple interface to DBI.
  userid:      MATISSE (Matisse Enzer)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    I'll probably post a message to the perl-qa list.

  similar:
    DBIx::Simple and DBIx::Wrapper

  rationale:

    The existing wrappers for DBI are more complex, less simple than
    this one. This module, DBIx::Wrapper::VerySimple really is very
    simple - it provides three methods: FetchAll(), FetchHash(), and
    Do() that between them cover about 98% of the SQL calls I've seen in
    Perl code over the years: - Run a SELECT and get back an arrayref of
    hashrefs (one hashref for each result row.) - Run a SELECT and get
    back a single hashref (for one row.) - Run a non-SELECT statement
    such as CREATE or DELETE.

    DBIx::Wrapper::VerySimple will use bind-variables if you pass them
    as additional arguments to FetchAll(), FetchHash() or Do(). It also
    provides a get_args() method wich returns the arguments originally
    passed to new() so you can re-connect, etc. if need be.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::Wrapper::
::VerySimple      MdpOp Very simple interface to DBI.                MATISSE
