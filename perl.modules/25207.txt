The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Shipping
  DSLIP:       MdpOg
  description: API for shipping-related tasks
  userid:      DBROWNING (Dan Browning)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Business::UPS

  rationale:

    This module should be included in the module list because it
    performs many unique functions that are needed by many people.
    Business::Shipping can estimate the cost of shipping something for
    anyone that needs that kind of information, using:

    * Online UPS servers * Offline UPS table lookups * Online USPS
    servers * More planned.

    The namespace choice came out of a PerlMonks discussion.

    Business::UPS, a module with similar functionlity, uses a different
    interface (non-XML) to the UPS servers, and does not support offline
    rate lookups via rate tables.

  enteredby:   DBROWNING (Dan Browning)
  enteredon:   Mon Dec 22 04:18:24 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::Shipping        MdpOg API for shipping-related tasks               DBROWNING
