Hi!

When contacting Demetrius Paneras about porting his modules, he sent me 
the following reply.  It seems that he doesn't have a PAUSE account, so 
I was wondering if you can give me co-maintainer rights to his modules, 
so that I can take over for him?

thanks,
speeves
cws

PS His modules are:

Apache-AuthenNIS
Apache-AuthenPasswd
Apache-AuthzNIS
Apache-AuthzPasswd


<!---
I'd be extremely happy if you did. Since I have not maintained the code 
in over 4 years, I don't believe I should hold onto the modules any 
more. I would gladly turn them over to you, if you would care to 
maintain, expand, update etc.

Please consider this e-mail as proof that the code is now yours. If 
there is anything else I need to do to complete this, please don't 
hesitate to ask.

Happy coding,

Demetri.
