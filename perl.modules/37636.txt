The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MathML::Entities
  DSLIP:       bdpfa
  description: Convert XHTML+MathML named entities
  userid:      DISTLER (Jacques Distler)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000493.html

  similar:
    HTML::Entities HTML::Entities::Numbered

  rationale:

    HTML defines 251 named entities. Existing modules provide
    conversions of these named entities to/from numeric character
    references and utf-8.

    The XHTML+MathML DTD defines 2336 (2121 unique) named entities. A
    facility for converting them is needed.

    However, unlike HTML entities, two-way conversions are not
    possible. In the HTML case, each of the 251 entities corresponds to
    a unique Unicode character. In the case of MathML entities, there
    are many entities that correspond to the same Unicode character, and
    some entities correspond to a *string* of two or more Unicode
    characters.

    So it's not really possible to graft this functionality onto one of
    the existing modules, without breaking their two-way nature.

    Why a new root namespace? 1) Sticking it under the HTML namespace
    would be confusing and inappropriate. MathML is a distinct markup
    language, not a subset of HTML. 2) SVG (a similar XML-based markup
    language for the Web) has its own root namespace. MathML should,
    too. 2) I intend to contribute other MathML-related modules in the
    future.

The resulting entry would be:

MathML::
::Entities        bdpfa Convert XHTML+MathML named entities          DISTLER
