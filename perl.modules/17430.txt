The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UML::Sequence
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: draws sequence diagrams by running the code
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    ?

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are probably several people who would like to build tools for
    the production and manipulation of UML. I know I am one. There is
    not a UML top level now. I think there should be. When my boss wants
    UML, I don't want to have to use Visio to produce it. I don't even
    want to produce it manually from the command line. Perl should do
    this sort of thing for me.

    There is another CPAN user TEEJAY who has a package he calls
    AutoDia which draws other UML diagrams (class diagrams, etc.). So
    far as I could tell from the docs, AutoDia does not draw sequence
    diagrams. Further, it is not on CPAN.

    The module I'm ready to submit (UML::Sequence) runs a perl program
    of your choice under Devel::DProf and (together with other provided
    scripts and UML::Sequence::* modules) generates an svg picture of
    the sequence of calls which actually executed. You have control over
    which functions appear in the output.

    You can also produce a sequence diagram just by typing in an
    outline of the calls.

    If you're willing to write your own three function module, you can
    generate your own sequences for other languages or input formats.
    I've demonstrated this by writing the proper module for Java and
    supplying a Java program to feed it (I wish the Java debugger
    architecture had Perl hooks). This could be included in the
    distribution if the CPAN maintainers wouldn't be too offended by the
    presence of Java code on CPAN.

The resulting entry would be:
