I might have found the right name. How about Math::StochasticProcess as =
in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic .

  Math::PEA
  =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
  I have to admit I am stuck on the naming of this package but I am =
likely to be uploading this module first. All the concepts I search on =
seem to be to vague. "Probability" for example. There do not seem to be =
a lot of modules with this name, but there certainly could be. In =
particular I would search for "Bayes theorem", but a search for a Bayes =
shows that this tends to be used in a reverse sense of looking at a real =
data and testing a hypothesis about it. My module starts with a model =
and generates the data from it. Hence I actively avoided "Bayes". So the =
key concepts in the module are "Probability, Event and Analysis" hence =
the name.
