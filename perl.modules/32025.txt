do you want the Array::Heap namespace?  if it's a dead module, we can
transfer the namespacce to you.

you need to take the first step though.  Ask John if he is willing to
transfer the namespace to you.  If you don't or can't get a response
(i.e. he is missing in action), we'll try to get in touch with him.

if nobody can get in touch with him in a reasonable period of time,
we can transfer the namespace to you.
