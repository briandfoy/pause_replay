     why:

    Two modules for using Template conveniently were made.

    1. HTML::Template::AssociateForm. - CGI Form is generated. - It
    will be embedded if there is CGI Query. - At the time of
    HTML::Template object generation assoceate option is passed. - And
    it is embedded at a template body.

    2. HTML::Template::SimpleSyntax - It is a filter for enabling it to
    describe the syntax of the present template briefly. - In addition,
    some convenient functions are included.
