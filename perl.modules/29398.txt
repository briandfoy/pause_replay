There are already some phone number modules on the CPAN - a few
Number::Phone::*, also Parse::PhoneNumber.  There's also various
*::GSM::* modules, and no doubt some that I've missed.

Now, I'm intending to write a module for validating UK phone numbers as
well as extracting all sorts of information from them, such as whether
it's a mobile number, a toll free number, and so on.  My first thought
was to put it in Number::Phone::*.  But having discussed this with some
of the other authors, and also talked about agreeing on a common
interface for such modules, it was suggested that the mess that is
Number::Phone be deprecated, and we instead go for Phone::*.  Here would
live all sorts of modules for dealing with phone systems, similar to how
Net::* deals with data networks.  Within that there would be
Phone::Number::* for working with phone numbers, but there would also be
things like Phone::GSM, Phone::SS7 and so on.  If they ever get written.

Comments?
