Quite a while ago somebody on the mod_perl mailing list posted that he
was preparing an article for the Perl Journal about the over 20
template modules that have been published on the net. All in Perl :-/

I haven't seen the article yet and forgot who it was, but be prepared!

Understood.

No problem.

I have none.

Discussions are usually short on this list and any answer goes
directly to you. Should the need arise to discuss longer and publicly,
there will be a CC to a public forum. So there's really no need to
subscribe here.
