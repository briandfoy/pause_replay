The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AFS::Command
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO Wrapper APIs for the AFS CLI utilities
  userid:      WPMOORE (W. Phillip Moore)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    openafs-devel@openafs.org

  similar:
    AFS

  rationale:

    The existing AFS modules are XS wrappers for the low level AFS C
    APIs. These modules are powerful, and they provide an interface for
    the a subset of the administrative functions in AFS. However, this
    approach has some holes -- some of the most important administrative
    functions are coded not in any library, but in the command line
    utilities that manage AFS (namely the vos and bos utilities).

    My new API is an OO wrapper around these command line utilities,
    and they provide a complimentary set of modules that allow the
    development of systems management utilities for AFS. Since an XS
    implementation of the "vos" utility (by far the most critically
    important one) isn't feasible without a significant rearchitecture
    of the OpenAFS code, this module fills the existing gap by
    leveraging the parseability of the vos command output.

    This new suite of modules compliments and coexists with the
    existing AFS module(s), and fills an huge gap that exists in the
    current functionality available to AFS admininstrators developing
    management utilities in perl.

The resulting entry would be:
