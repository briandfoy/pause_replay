*** Planning to contribute:

"My" initial contribution would be "Mail::PerlTix", a module used in conjuction with qmail and mysql to provide ticketing/transaction capabilites and archiving for mail (RFC 822) messages.

*** Module description:

PerlTix flags incoming/outgoing mail which allows internal e-mail addresses to be reached through a single point of entry (i.e. support@). The Ticket-ID also allows the admin to cross-reference the ID with other sub-systems (eg. webserver).

Basically, inbound mail to "user@host" gets ticketed, future responses are then routed accordingly, and re-queued to entire "group" if necessary.

brief example: user@ mails support@, tech1@ replies, user@ replies to reply .. message is sent directly to tech1@. tech1@ on vacation? timeout after X and re-queue to support@

Some (additional) proposed features:
	* "triggers" to coordinate with other sub-systems
	* integration with versioning systems
	* integration with bug-tracking systems
	* Web interface for viewing/editing tickets
	* Web interface for modifying address "tree"
	    [ i.e. $support = qw(tech1@host tech2@host); ]

Yes, it has some similarities with the likes of certain mail pre-filters, ip filters/masquerding, mailing list managers, bug trackers, etc; however, we're convinced this is a (mostly) new animal.

*** proposed DLSI entry

Mail::PerlTix cmpO "Mail ticketing and transaction system"

I realize there are* references to "Perl-Tix" on the Web, referring of course to Tk. Also, CPAN i/tix/ responds with Tk::TixGrid, Tk::TixWidget. I have not contacted Nick Ing-Simmons (Tk::TixGrid) or Chris Dean (Tk::TixWidget), but I don't forsee any namespace confusion/conflict.

*** Public discussion

There is a thread on the qmail list. Since the public discussion, myself and H. Brauer have discussed the API and started coding. 

(start of public thread, about 10 messages):

Many thanks!
