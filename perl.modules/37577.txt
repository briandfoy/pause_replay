 The Grant Network to Hold Grant Writing Workshop in Providence, RI on March 7-10, 2005

 Providence, RI. --- The Grant Network will hold its first East Coast workshop of the year in Providence, RI.  The intensive 3-Day workshop will take place on the Providence campus of Johnson and Wales University.

 Since its inception, The Grant Network has helped individuals, organizations, and local governments raise millions of dollars through grant proposal writing.  There exists unprecedented competition for grants, creating an environment that requires superior grant writing skills.  The Grant Network offers unparalleled grant proposal writing instruction.  Through a combination of engaging instruction, practical application, personalized grant lead research, and ongoing grant writing support, The Grant Network has something to offer even the most seasoned grant writing professional.

 Educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and local governments depend largely upon grants for sustainability.  Many members of these organizations either write grants in their various roles or their continued employment is contingent upon successful grant acquisition.  The Grant Network is able to deliver innovative methodology for seeking and applying for grants, greatly increasing the productivity of the individual who must draft grant proposals in their professional capacity.  The instruction provided by The Grant Network is an absolute asset to any individual or organization seeking to develop or streamline a development program with maximum return.

 Workshop attendees engage in an intensive 3-Day course designed to enlighten, challenge, and motivate.  Enrollment is limited.  The outstanding instructors for The Grant Institute bring many years of education and practical experience to each workshop.  The Grant Network’s faculty is carefully selected for individual contributions to their respective fields and for their ability to efficiently convey their knowledge to others.  The instructors for The Grant Network are experts in their fields and experts at teaching The Grant Networks grant proposal writing system.


 In addition to three days of professional grant proposal writing instruction, workshop attendees will receive personalized grant lead research.  Other organization charge upwards of three hundred dollars for this research alone, but The Grant Network includes this research at no additional fee.  For graduates of the workshop, the instruction does not end on the last day.  Graduates are entitled to lifetime access to The Grantseekers Forum, an online forum reserved for clients of The Grant Network.  In this forum, grantseekers are able to exchange questions and ideas with other grantseekers.  


 Perhaps the greatest advantage of enrolling in The Grant Network’s Complete Grant Writing Workshop is the ongoing support graduates enjoy.  The Grant Network takes the position that learning to be a master grant writer is a process.  In order to assist graduates with this process, The Grant Network offers ongoing grant writing support that is simply nonexistent in the industry.  The Grant Network delivers the best quality and value and truly does make your mission their mission.
