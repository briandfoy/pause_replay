The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Colon
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Makes objects from colon delimited files
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBD::CSV Class::DBI::mysql

  rationale:

    Class::Colon converts colon delimited files into lists of objects.
    This is similar in spirit to what Class::DBI::mysql does for mysql
    tables. DBD::CSV could probably be used in place of Class::Colon,
    but at the cost of extra developer time. It is based on SQL, which
    is far richer than a colon delimited file can really use.

    Simply say:

    use Class::Colon SomeClass => [ qw(field names here) ] my $records
    = SomeClass->READ_FILE("input.dat");

    $records is an anonymous array of objects, one for each row in
    input.dat. Each object has three attributes: field, names, and here.

  enteredby:   PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct  3 19:18:15 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Colon           bdpOp Makes objects from colon delimited files     PHILCROW
