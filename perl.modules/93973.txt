Subject: Nagios::Plugin tombstone release shipped
Message-ID: <20150912224652.GI20998@newagaton.scsys.co.uk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.20 (2009-06-14)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

Since Nagios Enterprises decided to just ignore me completely when I asked
for information (bar some yelling about how they are the NPDT even though all
the original members have left), I gave up expecting sense and shipped -

  https://metacpan.org/pod/Nagios::Plugin

Since I was given co-maint to this distribution according to the normal
PAUSE rules, any further drama can now be directed straight to me and
shouldn't need to have any effect on the rest of the admins.

All donations of popcorn gratefully received.
