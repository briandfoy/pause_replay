Matt,

I gave some thought about your suggestion. While agreeing with you
that putting more modules under an "unsanctioned" name space might
give people a false impression of legitimacy and cause you guys
further grief, I'm not entirely comfortable with using my CPAN ID, for
the hubris factor we had previously debated.

So I'm proposing a compromise. Instead of "Util", I'd like to put
these modules under "MD" which is the acronym of a project I've been
working on.

I don't see any existing module under this name space yet. And I think
that to any regular user, "MD" is no more or no less meaningful,
relevant, or succinct (think of POE as an example) than "KAN", which
makes me feel like being a bit too brash.

I assume that once approved, I'll have some autonomy on the 2nd level
name space and module names. So I'd like to keep them the way they
already are. i.e. They are

currently,

Util-AsyncIO-RW
Util-Getopt-Menu
Util-LockFile-PID
Util-LockFile-Time
Util-SQLiteDB-UniSchema
Util-Thread-Logger
Util-User-Switch

proposed to be,

MD-AsyncIO-RW
MD-Getopt-Menu
MD-LockFile-PID
MD-LockFile-Time
MD-SQLiteDB-UniSchema
MD-Thread-Logger
MD-User-Switch

I hope this proposal can "do you by right".  And if you approve, I
will delete my modules under "Util" and repackage them as MD::*.

Sincerely,

-Kan
