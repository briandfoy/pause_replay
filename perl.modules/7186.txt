The Data:: category is okay for very abstract/generic data modules.
This one obviously platform specific so should should probably go into
the existing Mac:: category.

Good question. If you find out let us know :) Hopefully one of the others
on the list will give you their more reasoned and helpful perspective...

Yeap.

Er, I don't know. I've never done it. (I've not been very involved with
the modules list for some time now.)

Andreas can best answer that. It used to be that things were
semi-manually added.  It may be that everything in PAUSE is
automatically added now.

Probably :)

I'd strongly recommend going back through the archives. Look out
especially for any long threads that I was involved it. Quite a few of
them will address some of the subtle issues that we get faced with
occasionally. It's a bit like 'case law' that we evolve as we go along.

Tim.
