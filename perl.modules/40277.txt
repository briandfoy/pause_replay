The namespace should be "OpenSoundControl::" then, since that is the 
full name of the protocol and there are no other related "OpenSound" 
projects. However, I don't see the potential for many more modules 
under this hierarchy. Maybe another distribution that accesses the OSC 
C-library via XS, maybe a third one that handles service discovery. Not 
enough to justify a namespace of it's own, I think.

Also, note that OSC is not related to the Linux' OpenSoundSystem (OSS).

Another alternative I was pondering was "Net::OSC". I'm not sure which 
aspect to give the preference: That it is a protocol firmly used by 
audio/video software (and some hardware control devices), or that it is 
a networking protocol.

Greetings,
    Christian
