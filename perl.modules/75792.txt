Subject: Module submission Algorithm::SINumber::CAN
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::SINumber::CAN
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to Social Insurance number CANADA.
  userid:      MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I had initially requested for Algorithm::SIN which was refused and
    asked to add the country code. Later I requested for
    Algorithm::SIN::CAN, which again got refused because SIN wasn't very
    clear. I then suggested either Algorithm::SINumber::CAN or
    Algorithm::SocialInsuranceNumber::CAN. But never got any response
    unfortunately. Therefore submitting fresh request so that it catches
    the eyes of PAUSE admins.

  enteredby:   MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 25 00:05:59 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::SINumber::
::CAN             bdpOp Interface to Social Insurance number CANADA. MANWAR
