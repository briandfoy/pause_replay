Hello,
	I had mailed for a CPAN user ID on Feb 18th. Subsequently I mailed a remainder again.
After the remainder Graham Barr allocated me the CPAN ID 'KARTHIKK'. Then Kurt D. Starsinic
also allocated me an ID 'KARTHIK', possibly from the old mail. I have changed the password on
'KARTHIKK' and am using it. As such you can delete the ID 'KARTHIK' allocated by Kurt. Sorry for 
the trouble my remainder seems to have caused, and thank you for the time.

Regards
Karthik Krishnamurthy
