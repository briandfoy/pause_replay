The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::And::Output
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Capture output during other tests
  userid:      JANDREW (Jed Lund)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jandrew/Test-And-Output

  similar:
    Test::Output

  rationale:

    The goal is to capture output that is provided auxiliary to a test
    case for later testing. Rather that have to choose between testing
    for the output of a test case or the function of a test case, the
    function test can be run and then later output to STDERR or STDOUT
    from that function can be tested. Functions are provided to turn the
    capture of STDOUT and STDERR on an off so only certain tests are
    subject to output capture.

    Since the methods would also be handy to use for other directed
    reporting (such as logging) the methods are also built to use a
    global variable defined in the test module. Loggers would then be
    able to test for the existence of their logging global variable and
    copy to the buffer any data passed to logger output as well. (This
    functionality was added for a current darkpan module pending release
    to CPAN)

The resulting entry would be:

Test::And::
