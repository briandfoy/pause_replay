I emailed you a couple weeks ago regarding our site and was wondering if
you had time to get to it.  I see your link to wallstreetcity.com on your
page
http://search.cpan.org/author/MSISK/Finance-QuoteHist-0.29/lib/Finance/Quote
Hist/WallStreetCity.pm and am wondering if my site,
www.StockMarketYellowPages.com , would also be useful to your visitors. 
It allows you to search for public companies based upon their
descriptions.  If you want to link to us you can place your site in our
directory.  You also can put our search on your site and make it look as
if people are still on your site.

I won’t bother you again if you don’t get back to me.  Please email me if
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Dan
