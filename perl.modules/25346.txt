The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::CodiceFiscale
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: convert personal data to/from italian CF
  userid:      GIULIENK (Giulio Motta)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    no modules on CPAN yet

  rationale:

    This module converts personal data to/from codice fiscale. Codice
    fiscale is in Italy something like a social security number in US,
    but it has lots of differences. First of all codice fiscale should
    be used only for financial matters. Second, you can calculate a
    codice fiscale for a person given his surname, name, date of birth,
    sex and a special code for the town where he was born. There are
    exceptions (about 1 in 15000) where two people have really similar
    personal data which would result in identical codice fiscale. An
    example of codice fiscale is WLLLRY87T18Z404B (for Larry Wall, born
    on 1987-12-18 (Perl's birthday) in USA). BTW, calculating a codice
    fiscale is a really recurring task for italian programmers (or
    anybody who has to deal with italians) and tons of scripts exist
    already on the net. This module will try to organize the production
    and reverse engineering of a codice fiscale in a clear and rational
    way. The namespace String::CodiceFiscale is chosen because codice
    fiscale is a string of 16 characters.

The resulting entry would be:

String::
::CodiceFiscale   cdpOp convert personal data to/from italian CF     GIULIENK
