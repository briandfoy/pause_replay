Unfortunately, since the demo scripts do a 'use SimpleRadarControls;',
the perl namespace is indeed polluted.

You should:

- pack Wheel and SimpleRadarControls in a directory in the demo dir
  and do a 'use libs "./demo_lib" ' in the demo script (or something
  like that).

As general ideas, you should:
- avoid to pack tcl and python code into CPAN (it's not a religious
  matter, but to avoid confusing people who might want to peek at the
  module)
- use ExtUtils::MakeMaker to generate the Makefile. You will have
  better chance to produce a module that works with all (well most
  recents) versions of perl. That said, it's might easier said that
  done :-/. You should look at the way perl/Tk is built to get a
  better idea.

Bon courage

Cheers
