Subject: Module submission Log::Statistics

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Statistics
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: near-real-time statistics from log files
  userid:      VVU (Alex White)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    http://www.geekfarm.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LogStatistics

  similar:
    Algorithm::Accounting Logfile

  rationale:

    Log::Statistics and the included script logstatsd make
    near-real-time log file monitoring possible. logstatsd runs as a
    daemon parsing new entries as they enter the log, and storing
    statistics. The daemon can be signaled to export current xml reports
    or to update an RRD. logstatsd can also be used for offline report
    generation, and is an easy-to-use command line tool for slicing and
    dicing log files.

    I changed the name several times and did a lot of searching on CPAN
    before finalizing on this name.

    There are two other projects which perform some similar features:

    Algorithm::Accounting performs some of the same operations as
    Log::Statistics. The Log::Statistics algorithm adds handling for
    durations and response time thresholds, and is significantly more
    efficient than Algorithm::Accounting.

    Logfile is designed for offline file reporting, while
    Log::Statistics is optimized for near-real-time data collection.
    Log::Statistics adds handling for response time thresholds.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::Statistics      adpOb near-real-time statistics from log files     VVU
