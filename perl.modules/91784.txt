     why:

    I've written an update to ScatterPlot.pm. I've e-mailed Les Hall,
    but his e-mail address isn't valid. The date on ScatterPlot.pm is
    2007. It appears to not have been maintained since then. I would
    like to become CoAuthor of ScatterPlot.pm and submit my modification
    for approval.

    My modification includes a bug fix and an enhancement.

    Fixes in my mod: original ignored array values of 0 because it
    would test something like if($$xy_points[$i][0]). Which if evaluated
    to 0, would be read as "false".

    Enhancements in my mod: Adds the option of a regression line with
    regression equation in f(x)=mx+b format, as well as correlation and
    and coefficient of determination with a brief assessment of the
    regression analysis.
