Hello PAUSE admins,

I am the author of the "current" version of Net::Interface, however I 
am a co-maintainer. The "owner", Stephen Zander aka cpan SRZ, seems 
to have disappeared.

  ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
<gibreel@pobox.com>
    (reason: 550 5.1.1 <gibreel@pobox.com>: Recipient address 
rejected: User unknown)

SRZ created the original module back in 1997 and made one improvement 
in 2000.

I took over development on the module in 2006, re-wrote and expanded 
it and have been maintaining it ever since.

In the last year or so that have been smoker failures, bugs, and 
enhancement requests that I have not been able to adequately respond 
to because of a lack of system resources for development. There are 
several people more than willing to assist, however because I only 
have co-maintainer status I can not add them to the maintainer list.

I have been unable to contact SRZ and would appreciate it if you 
would remove him as the owner of the module so that it can be 
properly maintained and further developed.

Thanks,

Michael Robinton (MIKER)
