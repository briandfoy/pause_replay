Hello,

It has been one year and two months since the last CIM release.

There have been three developer releases adressing various issues at the beginning of last December, however the last of those ended up broken on Win32 despite being meant to fix an issue on that platform. This brokenness is not due to the code. That works fine. It is merely due to a quirk in the way the tarball was packaged and would be fixable by just plain repacking and reuploading the file.

This problem had been reported in early January on RT ( http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=63407#txn-878521 ) with a follow-up poke on RT two weeks later, and an email sent to the currently de-facto maintainer ( bdfoy@cpan.org ) another two weeks later. All three of those went entirely ignored for 3 months now.

This makes me wonder just what the status of CIM is and what i can do to get it out of stasis.

I am willing to do anything to get a new, actual release done; be this preparing a tarball for a person with the correct rights to upload, or flat out adopting the module. I do not care what it is, as long as it results in a release.

I just need to be communicated what it is that needs to be done.

With regards,
Christian Walde
