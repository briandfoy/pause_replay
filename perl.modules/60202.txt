This is highly unlikely, given that the Win32_Pipe_Source_980513.zip
doesn't even have a Makefile.PL.  Those sources were meant for "Perl for
Win32" build 110 (Perl 5.001m) or builds 3XX (Perl 5.003_07) if you
look at the Pipe.mak file included in the archive.

Anyone with Perl 5.005 or later will have Win32::Pipe from the libwin32
bundle, which is Win32::Pipe 0.022.

Cheers,
