The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Security
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Security manipulation for Win32 objects
  userid:      TEVERETT (Toby Ovod-Everett)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32::Perms, Win32::FileSecurity

  rationale:

    I feel a bit bold staking out this namespace, but I feel
    comfortable that the code I am currently working on will provide
    sorely needed support for Security manipulation on Win32 platforms.

    My current approach is based upon using Win32::API to access the
    underlying APIs, which means the module will be written entirely in
    Perl. As much as possible, I have tried to keep the interfaces
    exposed at multiple levels in order to avoid the "Monolithic Black
    Box" problem If other users don't like the interfaces I have
    developed, I want it to be easy for them to develop their own
    without having to reinvent the entire wheel. I have made use of
    memoization to improve the efficiency of the code when doing large
    scale permissions examination and manipulation.

    At the base level is Win32::Security::Raw, which provides
    minimalist wrappers around the Win32 API calls that have proved
    necessary. Win32::Security::SID provides for interaction with SIDs,
    conversion between string and binary forms and trustee names.

    The next level is Win32::Security::ACE and Win32::Security::ACL,
    which provide object-oriented interfaces to interacting with Access
    Control Entries and Access Control Lists.
    Win32::Security::NamedObjects provides an object-oriented interface
    for retrieving and setting permissions and ownership of NamedObjects
    (currently only FILE access is supported, but the code is
    architected to support all forms of NamedObjects).

    Finally, Win32::Security::Recursor provides support for recursing
    through hierarchical trees of NamedObjects (i.e. directory trees:)
    and examining and manipulating permissions.

    I look forward to releasing the code when it is in good shape:).
