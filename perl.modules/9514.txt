The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::BlackSch
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Black-Scholes option pricing model functions
  userid:      ANDERS (Anders Johnson)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    First of all, I'm not sure about the name. Since there is allegedly
    an 11-char portability limit, "BlackScholes" won't fit. Maybe
    "BlackSchole" is better than "BlackSch"?

    The Black-Scholes model is certainly useful, and it's nontrivial to
    code the functions, especially when you consider the corner cases.
    Seems like there ought to be a reference implementation.

    The module is already coded, tested, has a Makefile.PL, etc. I just
    need to know the best name for it, and to upload it.

  enteredby:   ANDERS (Anders Johnson)
  enteredon:   Wed Jan  2 18:43:57 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Business::
::BlackSch        bdpfp Black-Scholes option pricing model functions ANDERS
