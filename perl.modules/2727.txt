Well, the new author is me, Jesse Vincent. The module is SearchBuilder.
I've been hacking on a DBIx:: module as part of a trouble ticketing
system called RT that I'm the primary author of. A number of folks have told me
that it would make a good CPAN contribution, so here I am. SearchBuilder
has been discussed in its former life as DBIx::EasySearch on rt-devel@fsck.com.

Description:
SearchBuilder is a pure-perl abstarction layer on top of DBI which allows
programers to build complex select statements with multiple calls to
a couple fairly simple primitives.  This ends up being particularly useful
for "refining" existing searches.  It also comes with a class called 
DBIx::SearchBuilder::Row which allows simple OO access to the data from
a single database row.  SearchBuilder returns its results as a set of 
DBIx::SearchBuilder::Rows
