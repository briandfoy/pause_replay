My general inclination is to avoid getting involved in discussions of
this sort, but in this case, I do think that the views of at least one
third party might be helpful.

This is the point at which I feel my input might be valuable, as a
user of (and very minor contributor to) DBIC.

Peter, I think the work you have been doing on DBIC is excellent. I am
not aware of anyone who disagrees with that.

When you announced your departure, I was saddened both selfishly (in
that I think the DBIC codebase is better for your work) and on your
behalf (because this didn't seem to be the outcome you'd hoped for).
But I didn't want to risk emotionally pressuring you into changing your
mind =E2=80=94 any reason someone might have for stopping their involvement
with an open-source project is valid for them =E2=80=94 so I said nothing.

The consequences for DBIC were not clear at that point, but I was
confident that, sooner or later, things would work out, even though
there might be a period with no person (or team) at the wheel.

I have been continually surprised (and selfishly delighted) to see you
working on DBIC for the nine months or so following your self-announced
leaving date. My reasons for saying nothing (which may in retrospect
have been a poor decision) were along the lines of not rocking the
boat: since you've clearly been willing and able to do more work than
your public plans as of early December 2015 suggested, interrupting you
seemed pointless.

Nonetheless, that doesn't alter the fact that I *have* had a concern
in this period: nobody else has been able to step up and start working
on DBIC in earnest. That's because your public position has apparently
been that you'll be gone within a matter of weeks, and that you're
eager to merely finish off a few outstanding tasks before handing over
the keys to the project.

How much more concerning, then, to discover in the last few days
that you have seen your DBIC-related activities since December as
effectively winding up the project, rather than preparing to leave
it to others.

So please take this as someone who is broadly speaking *on your side*
coming forward to object to what looks from the outside like a major
change in your plans, and one that doesn't seem likely to lead to the
best possible outcome for the many people and companies relying on
DBIC.
