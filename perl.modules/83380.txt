Hello

I've released a module to unwrap obfuscated Oracle code
(DBIx::Oracle::Unwrap). But after Googling arpund about unwrapping, I think
I've violated Oracle's license. My response has been to schedule the
deletion of these modules from CPAN, but I would appreciate if you could
remove the files from BackPAN too. I would hate to think you guys might be
held responsible for hosting such code. I realise that some ways, it has
been mirrored and released in the wild, but I'd still like to minimise its
propagation

Regards

Dan Horne
