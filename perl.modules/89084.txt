I think you may be misunderstanding; I am writing on _behalf_ of Best
Practical, who would like to assume maintainership.  As I noted in my
previous email, we maintain the repository for the module in question,
in fact -- which was originally written when Ruslan was a Best Practical
employee.  As such, I don't see how "Best Practical responding to pull
requests" is relevant.

How long of a delay is the usual process?  As long as version 0.03
remains an unauthorized release, any code using Email::Address::List
will be vulnerable to a trivial denial of service attack.
