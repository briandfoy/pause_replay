Import is similar to Exporter in effect, but works very differently. Rather
than use @ISA to find 'import' in Exporter, Import directly exports an
'import' function into the namespace of the package using it.

There are many other differences, which essentially are embodied by the
"hook" features of Import. Rather than having special features for
interesting ways to export symbols, hooks are provided to intercept requests
for symbols and the symbols themselves. This makes it easy to create modules
which export dynamically valued symbols.

		But lets talk about the others.  Please provide some detail
on what
		they do, and also on how they work, to the extent relevant.

		And let's have a separate [sub]thread for each one.

		Thanks.
