separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Johan Vromans:
autobox-REST is a strange name, please discuss it on modules@perl.org.
