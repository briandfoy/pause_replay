Subject: Module submission Rose

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rose
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: The Rose web application framework
  userid:      JSIRACUSA (John Siracusa)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Rose.pm module contains the version number of the overall Rose
    suite, as well as the development policy for all Rose:: modules. In
    the future, Rose.pm will be the location for all data,
    documentation, and functionality that spans the entire Rose web
    application framework and is not specific to any given module.

    (Since Bundle::Rose is not actually installed when it's installed
    (that is, the Bundle/Rose.pm file is not installed) it's not a
    suitable location for all of this documentation, the suite version
    number, etc. See my comments in the CPAN ratings for this module for
    more details on my reasoning.)

  enteredby:   JSIRACUSA (John Siracusa)
  enteredon:   Sun Aug 14 04:30:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Rose              bdpOp The Rose web application framework           JSIRACUSA
