I just gave you an honest and forthright estimation of the problem, and an
explanation of why it doesn't belong on modules@perl.org.

The conversation still doesn't belong on there. Please re-send your module
registration under a more appropriate name and stop trying to play silly
political games with me because you didn't like my answer.

Further pollution of modules@perl.org with this topic will be escalated and
may result in your banning from here as well.

If you wish to reply to this email, do so off list.
