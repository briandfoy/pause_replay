The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Vim::Debug
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: Debugger support for VIM
  userid:      KABLAMO (Eric D Johnson)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/kablamo/VimDebug

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module I'm working on, Vim::Debug, is a library used in a Vim
    plugin which gives developers the ability to visually step through
    their code and set breakpoints.

    The 'Vim' namespace seems like a good place to put Perl libraries
    and tools that can be used with Vim and Vim plugins.

    There are currently 3 modules in the 'Vim' namespace and 2 modules
    in the 'VIM' namespace. I don't have a strong preference and the Vim
    project itself seems to use both Vim and VIM. Vim.sf.net seems happy
    to use 'Vim' rather than 'VIM' so I guess thats the direction I
    intend to go as well.

The resulting entry would be:

Vim::
::Debug           bdhOp Debugger support for VIM                     KABLAMO
