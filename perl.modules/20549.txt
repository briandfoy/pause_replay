Yes, in C::B::C-0.12 it did have a higher version number.
However, I discovered that CPANPLUS had some trouble when
the installed module reports version 0.38 while the latest
distribution version was 0.12. So I decided to "align" all
module versions with the distro version in C::B::C-0.13.

What exactly does it mean that the module is "not indexed"?
Can this be changed "manually"? I don't expect the versioning
to change once again... ;-)

Thanks,
Marcus
