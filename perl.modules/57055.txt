I very recently registered with PAUSE (KRUGGLE) with the intention of
updating an existing module, File::Compare, to include more functionality.
I just became aware through a google search of the authors name that he
passed away in 2006:

http://use.perl.org/articles/06/09/27/2215246.shtml

So I suspect my attempt to contact him will fail. Please advise.

Thank you,
Mr. Kevin Ruggles
