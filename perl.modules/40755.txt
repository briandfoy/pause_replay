Hi Adam (or **ANY** CPAN Admins),

	You were a big help in my getting set up initially on the CPAN.
But now, I'm wondering if you could just share some guidelines with me.
This will no longer work:

cpan> install Term::Menus

Nor does it show up any longer here:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html

It was indexed there at version Term-Menus-1.04.tar.gz.

Now it's up to Term-Menus-1.08.tar.gz but the indexer is either not
working for me, or there has to be some kind of manual intervention.

I've sent probably ten e-mails to modules@perl.org and have gotten
NO reponse whatsoever.

I know it's all volunteer, and that you can't expect instant attention,
but I've written an article for this module at the invitation of
THE PERL JOURNAL, and I **NEED** this issue rectified somehow - someway.

PLEASE - ANYONE - tell me what I'm doing wrong, and what I need to do,
and what my expectations for support *really* should be.

Thanks!
Brian Kelly

Does it work with anything other than a terminal? That would be
the major point that would force that one way or the other.
