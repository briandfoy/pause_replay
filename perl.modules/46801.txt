Underscores in module names are generally frowned upon. Please consider 
renaming that to something like ::Friend::Changes, ::FriendChanges, 
::ChangeFriend or whatever. (I don't know the context, so I can hardly 
suggest a good name.)

I'd go with WWW::Myspace. Alternatively, if you're building something 
not on top of HTTP/WWW, you could consider Net::Myspace (for stuff like 
SOAP, etc.) At least, this is about what Adam Kennedy recently suggested 
in a related matter and I think it's good advice.

As brian pointed out, "branded" module hierarchies are alright, too. 
Personally, I tend to miss out on branded modules when searching for a 
special purpose module on CPAN. (I have a general dislike of the idea, 
too.) If you feel that Myspace(.pm) is the right namespace to use, go 
forward with that. But please don't do that just because it's convenient 
to not change the namespace. ;)

All the best,
Steffen
