Hi,

I'm currently writing a wrapper around PyQt4 which is the Python bindings for 
the Qt 4 C++ library. I do this for two reasons:
* I'm the current Inline::Python maintainer and need a good example for a talk
* There are no current, usable Qt bindings for Perl

There seem to have been several attempts to create Qt bindings for Perl:
* Qt-0.03 from 1997 by Ashley Winters
* PerlQt-2.105 from 2000 by Ashley Winters
* PerlQt-3.008 from 2003 by Germain Garand using the namespace unauthorized.
* QtCore-4.004 and QtGui-4.004 from February 2008 by Vadim Likhota which would 
not install for me and only cover a subset of Qt. And QtCore contains a module 
named Qt, thereby using the namespace unauthorized.

While I'd personally prefer to have native Perl bindings for Qt, these 
attempts demonstrate the maintenance effort required to keep these up to date. 
Shoving off most of that work to the Python folks might be a more sustainable 
strategy.

So my first idea for a name has been PerlQt, but that name has already been 
taken twice, that might not be as good an idea. So I hope to be able to employ 
your wisdom to prevent further extension of the existing mess.

Any ideas?

Regards,
Stefan Seifert
