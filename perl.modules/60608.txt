The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MySQL::Log::ParseFilter
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Parse and filter MySQL logs
  userid:      DNICHTER (Daniel Nichter)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)

  rationale:

    MySQL::Log::ParseFilter expresses exactly what this module does:
    parse and filter MySQL logs. I chose to nest the name further than,
    for example, MySQL::ParseFilterLogs in the case that other MySQL
    log-related modules will be written.

    I chose one module (ParseFilter) instead of two (Parse and Filter)
    because MySQL log parsing and filtering are practically
    interdependent: to do one or the other efficiently they both must be
    done at the same time. It is still possible to do one or the other
    with the module: parse with no filters, or filter already parsed log
    data. Normally, however, parsing and filtering are done together.

    As best as I can search, no such module (in any language) exists
    for this purpose. There exist a handful of MySQL log parsers or
    filterers, but each is limited to its own purpose, therefore it
    cannot easily be reused for new scripts. MySQL::Log::ParseFilter is
    unique in that it is the only full-featured MySQL log parsing module
    that can be easily reused to suite whatever purpose a script might
    have for needing queries from a MySQL log.

    I believe MySQL::Log::ParseFilter should be listed in the module
    list because it is a unique module, fully documented both internally
    and externally, which fulfills a well-defined need: easy, reusable
    MySQL log parsing and filtering.

The resulting entry would be:

MySQL::Log::
::ParseFilter     Rdpfp Parse and filter MySQL logs                  DNICHTER
