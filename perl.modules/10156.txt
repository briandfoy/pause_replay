What you'll need to do is get yourself a PAUSE ID, make your changes to
the module and then upload a new version to your account. It would be very
good for the users to note in the documentation that you are the new
maintainer and Joao could also upload one last version to his account as
well with the same information.

The modules@perl.org list [ CC'ed for convenience ] is the correct place
to notify CPAN of these sorts of changes. There is also a section on the
CPAN FAQ [ http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html ] that covers this.
