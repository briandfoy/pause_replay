The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Canvas::Draw
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simplifies mouse drawing in a Tk::Canvas
  userid:      JCNORTON (John C. Norton)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    This has been discussed at Perlmonks in the following thread:

    http://perlmonks.com/?node_id=810494

    The idea is to abstract the low-level details of the capturing of
    drawing with the mouse in a canvas:

    1. Detect mouse-button N down 2. Track mouse movement while mouse N
    still down, handling optional 'action' callback, and displaying
    progress by drawing an optional shape 3. Detect mouse N released 4.
    Invoke registered 'result' callback, passing list of points saved
    during drawing, and list of IDs of any shapes drawn

    All feedback so far has indicated this would be useful
    functionality.
