The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::MakeIntrospecMethods
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: creates methods with introspection
  userid:      DDUMONT (Dominique Dumont)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::MethodMaker Class::MakeMethods

  rationale:

    Like Class::MethodMaker, this module provide an easy way to create
    accessors methods.

    On top of usual method creation, this module may add introspection
    methods. So the user may query an object for a list of methods
    created by Class-MakeIntrospecMethods. The list of methods may be
    organized in several catalogs at user's choice.

    This module can also be used to create a tree where each node or
    leaf is an object. So this module also provides methods to navigate
    up the tree of objects with a special "parent" method.

    Thus, this module provides special methods to enable the user to
    navigate up or down a tree (or directed graph) using introspection
    (to go down) and the "parent" method to go up.

    This modules does not provide most of the fancy methods of
    Class::MethodMaker. Only scalar, array and hash accessors (with
    their tied and objects variants) are provided.

    Originally, the introspection and "parent" functionalities were
    implemented in Class::MethodMaker. Unfortunately, they were not
    accepted by Class::MethodMaker's author since they did not fit his
    own vision of his module (fair enough).

    I've also looked at Class::MakeMethod, but this module is way too
    complex to add these navigations possibility. Furthermore, the code
    generation trick used by Class::MakeMethod (and Class::MethodMaker >
    v2.x) make programs very hard to debug, so I'd rather avoid them.

    I'm open to other suggestion regarding this module's name.

    Cheers

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::MakeIntrospecMethods cdpOp creates methods with introspection           DDUMONT
