It does and doesn't :P

The question is not, are you responsible - the question is, are you =
reliable.
Perl and CPAN have an active community. SNMP hasn't been updated since =
2007
and could need a lot of enhancements.

Further: SNMP should be a "meta-module" like JSON and switch to =
Alien::SNMP or
Lib::SNMP (in favor), Net::SNMP or any other XS binding or Pure-Perl =
module =85=20

Adopting the module would allow me to do such namespace cleanup, and =
having
created an own SNMP agent and wrote a lot of ASN.1 based communication
software (SNMP, SUPL, =85) makes me experienced enough to honor previous
authors contribution and improve for CPAN.

Make sense?
