Subject: Module submission Thread::Queue::Duplex
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Thread::Queue::Duplex
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Thread safe duplex (request/response)  queue
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    c.l.p.modules, perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Thread::Queue

  rationale:

    In order to provide a mechanism for client/server interaction in
    threaded applications (e.g., DBIx::Threaded), a means of
    identifying, and waiting for a response to, an individual queued
    request is needed. Thread::Queue::Duplex provides this mechanism, as
    well as providing some general Thread::Queue enhancements (e.g.,
    time-limited dequeue operations).

  enteredby:   DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  enteredon:   Sat Jul  9 18:48:55 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Thread::Queue::
::Duplex          adpOp Thread safe duplex (request/response)  queue DARNOLD
