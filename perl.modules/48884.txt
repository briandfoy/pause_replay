Apply for DBIx::Roma or DBIx::Romani, will certainly approve. Might be a 
good idea to consider resolving your naming issue _first_ though, before 
applying.

As for the latter, even though it's not a particularly great name IMO, 
I'm not terribly against Xmldoom if you _really_ want it, I don't want 
to be the arbiter of taste.

To be honest, the questions are there to make sure you are paying 
attention. If you want the name, and you've at least _considered_ the 
issues we raise, then as long as you are aware most of the time we'll 
still approve if it won't hurt anyone.

Are you ok with Xmldoom if he still wants it Brian?
