Hi Johan.

Sorry for the vast delay in replying to this!!
I appreciate this is tedious.  I've spent 2 years trying to get the BBC
laywers to agree to us releasing our modules Open Source, and the light
at the end of the tunnel is in sight...

We have to work within the following constraints:
1. The senior managers and lawyers in the BBC are not happy with the
same personal accounts being used for a mixture of work and non-work
purposes.
2. After one of my team set up the BBCIFL account, a decision was taken
that accounts should not reflect the internal structure of the
organisation (which changes frequently - IF&L has now been renamed L&I,
for example)

Either of the following would be fine for us:
1. Rename BBCIFL to BBC (and delete BBCSIMONF to keep things clean if
you want) - we can then use that for everything
2. Delete BBCIFL and create per-user work accounts such as BBCSIMONF,
BBCPKENT etc

Which would you prefer?

John.

If I recall correctly, Simon wanted a different ID since BBCIFL was not
appropriate for him (I may be wrong, though).

Yes, you can use your private ID or use the BBCIFL ID if appropriate.
