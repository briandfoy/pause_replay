Hi, Priyal.

You can't change your PAUSE ID.  You can register another account with
a different ID and then transfer your module permissions to that
account.

I can't help you on the installation problem -- it looks like the
distribution wasn't correctly packed. You should be using "make dist"
or some equivalent to create the tarball for upload. The resources I
emailed to you last time are still the best places to get help.

Regards,
David Golden
