     why:

    Primarily a couple of "ANSI-C programmers tools"... 1) htree.pl to
    reveal the #include dependancies... I recently had a hair-tearing
    problem with multiply defined typedefs during a migration, caused by
    the different system header files, but I had no idea which header
    file(s) were the problem... not as good as #indent, but you don't
    have to add it to other peoples proprietory header files either. 2a)
    callstack.pl creates and populates a mysql database describing your
    C-code function calls and definitions; and defines a bunch of useful
    queries on that db. 2b) callchart.pl generates a graphical structure
    chart (html with SVG) of your C-code function calls.
