The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::Urandom
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Using output from /dev/urandom. Simply conve
  userid:      MBROOKS (Marc S. Brooks)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Generate a truely random string.

  similar:
    String::Random

  rationale:

    The namespace choice was simple. Since this module is related to
    strings, I felt the name would be appropriate.

    The reason this module should be added is because String::Random
    uses a different approach when generating random strings.

    To my knowledge, I don't think there is any string modules
    available that use /dev/urandom. I looked throughout the repository
    and didn't find anything.

The resulting entry would be:

String::
::Urandom         RdpOp Using output from /dev/urandom. Simply conve MBROOKS
