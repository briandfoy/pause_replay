The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Linksys::Config
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Object to Configure Linksys SOHO Units
  userid:      JTAVARES (James Tavares)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    linksys-config@krontor.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    About 'Modules with similar functionality': I am not aware of any
    modules that configure Linksys devices in this manner.

    Module Description/Purpose: To configure Linksys "Instant Broadband
    Series" routers (BEFSR41 and the like). Currently, there is no other
    way to configure these units other than to manually navigate through
    HTML forms using a web browser such as Netscape. The routers lacks
    SNMP support as well as any method of exporting/importing
    configurations, which is useful when working with large quantities
    of routers. What was needed was a Perl interface to quickly perform
    firmware upgrades (via TFTP), import/export configurations, change
    passwords, and modify various settings.

    I believe the module will be helpful to those seeking a means to
    configure their Linksys SOHO Router units without being tied to a
    web browser. The module bridges the gap between Linksys's current
    HTML only solution and SNMP-like support, which these routers do not
    have.

    Bundled with the module is also "Linksys::Config:TFTP", a modified
    version of "Net::TFTP" that supports Linksys's proprietary extension
    to the TFTP protocol to support password authentication.

    I believe the namespace "Linksys::Config" accurately reflects the
    purpose and style of this module. The module's only purpose is to
    configure Linksys routers, using a series of POSTs over the HTTP
    protocol to specific CGIs on the Linksys router, and in specific
    order. The module also is written to interpret the specific HTML
    output of the Linksys router series.

The resulting entry would be:

Linksys::
::Config          bdpOp Object to Configure Linksys SOHO Units       JTAVARES
