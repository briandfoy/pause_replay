The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CatalystX::AuthNZ
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: AuthNZ via Roles, Groups, and Controllers
  userid:      ROGERHALL (Roger A Hall)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.iosea.com/, http://bioinformatics.ualr.edu/

  similar:
    none found in Catalystx; Catalyst tree includes a few smaller/core
    options

  rationale:

    AuthNZ is a complete package of Catalyst controllers and templates,
    Class::Std-style user and application objects, and sql
    initialization scripts to create a system for user authentication
    and authorization. The included interfaces allow the admin to define
    individual Catalyst controllers as either visible or invisible
    resources which are grouped within applications (named after
    Controller modules), enabling the system to generate personal
    portals for all users, displaying only the links to which they have
    access.

    Access is controlled through a combination of "application roles",
    "application resources", and "user groups". Application names become
    navigation headers, and application resources are links (unless they
    are marked "not visible"). The included methods for creating the
    navigation sum all possible controllers for all of a given userâs
    groups (which are mapped to the application roles, which are mapped
    to the application resources.)

    All data are managed within included Catalyst controllers (which
    rely on included Perl6-style objects). A default "Portal"
    application is pre-defined with standard portal features: login,
    logout, password reset, manage profile, and home. An additional
    "Sample" application is included with more examples, including
    "anonymous" access and AJAX.
