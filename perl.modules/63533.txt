The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Django::Template
  DSLIP:       cdpOb
  description: Django style templates for Perl
  userid:      MALUKU (Marc - Sebastian Lucksch)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template, Template, Text::Template

  rationale:

    I had to work with Python's django MVC-Framework and I really liked
    their template system and I wanted something similar in Perl. So I
    decided to implement it.

    The namespace choice is not my first idea, but since this module
    works mostly with HTML files of the Django flavor and only
    implements the Template part of Djano I thought it might be a good
    choice.

    I have searched for a template system similar to Django, but I have
    found none.

    This approach is quite unique because it provides compatibility
    with an already existing and established Template system in another
    programming language (Perl)

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::Django::
::Template        cdpOb Django style templates for Perl              MALUKU
