The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Validator::Schema
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: validate XML with a subset of W3C XML Schema
  userid:      SAMTREGAR (Sam Tregar)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-xml, my use.perl journal

  similar:
    XML::Schema, XML::Xerces

  rationale:

    I'm writing a piece of software which uses Xerces/C++
    (http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/ ) to validate documents against XML
    Schema schemas. This works very well, but I'd like to release my
    project to the world. Requiring users to install Xerces is simply
    too onerous a requirement; few will have it already and the Xerces
    installation system leaves much to be desired.

    On CPAN, the only available XML Schema validator is XML::Schema.
    Unfortunately, this module isn't ready for use as it lacks the
    ability to actually parse the XML Schema document format! I looked
    into enhancing XML::Schema but I must admit that I'm not smart
    enough to understand the code... One day, when XML::Schema is
    completed I will replace this module with a wrapper around it.

    This module represents my attempt to support enough XML Schema
    syntax to be useful without attempting to tackle the full standard.
    I'm sure this will mean that it can't be used in all situations, but
    hopefully that won't prevent it from being used at all.

    My orignal name for the module was XML::SchemaValidator, but I was
    persuaded by the perl-xml denizens to put it under XML::Validator::.
    Others on the list dream of the day when a multitude of XML
    validators are available and a compatible API can be worked out at
    the XML::Validator level.

  enteredon:   Tue Sep  9 01:37:55 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::Validator::
::Schema          adpOp validate XML with a subset of W3C XML Schema SAMTREGAR
