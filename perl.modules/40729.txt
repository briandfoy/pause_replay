in Texas: <STRONG><FONT size=2>"<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><FONT face="Times New 
Roman">Gentlemen: before I start, I'd like to know if Shawn from Washington sprays anything more 
than R-19 of Icynene at this point in time while awaiting a possible approval of Icynene's foam 
by the test folks? I think Kevin's point should be well taken: lot's of folks are telling the 
contractors to go ahead and not to worry. In my book, this is pure greed. Sell another set of 
foam, and let's hope nothing happens. How about the industry gets together, and works on well 
established and meaningful standards. As an example, why don't all the important suppliers ere 
team up and come up with something like an i-value (like insulation value) which would take 
airtightness into consideration. Or call it an f-value (like foam). Forget R-38, even conduction. 
It's all about convection, and that is controlled by foam and nothing 
else."</FONT></SPAN></FONT></STRONG></A></P><P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><A

fires, and foam does not kill people. In the Rhode Island disco they used the wrong foam. How are 
you going to protect yourself from that? Fact is that foams are generally really 
good."</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></A></FONT></P><P class=MsoNormal><FONT size=2><A
