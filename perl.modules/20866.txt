The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AI::Categorizer
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Automatic Text Categorization
  userid:      KWILLIAMS (Ken Williams)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-ai@perl.org, #perl IRC on rhizo

  similar:
    AI::Categorize

  rationale:

    This is the successor to AI::Categorize, the name was changed
    because the interface has changed a lot. This code is organized as a
    pluggable framework. The machine learning algorithm can be changed,
    the pre-processing and categorization behaviors can be changed, and
    more.

    On the perl-ai list, we tried to think of a better namespace than
    AI::, because some of the algorithms that are used here are hardly
    AI. They're pretty mundane. But Text:: doesn't work because this
    module can actually work on non-text data (i.e. protein or sequence
    biological data), and MachineLearning or ML:: namespaces don't exist
    yet (and wouldn't likely be the first places people would look,
    anyway).

    Because this code is being used in the wild already and has been on
    CPAN for several releases, I'd like to keep the name as
    AI::Categorizer.
