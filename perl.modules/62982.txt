I've updated the pod to make it clear that File::Find::Similars does
not depends on File::Find. Ref:

http://search.cpan.org/~suntong/File-Find-Similars-2.04/lib/File/Find/Similars.pm#DEPENDS

Moreover, are you sure that those File::Find::Xxx modules are all using
File::Find?

File::Find::Duplicates is by Tony Bowden,
File::Find::Iterator is by Robert Silve ,
File::Find::Match is by  Dylan William Hardison
File::Find::Object is by Shlomi Fish
etc, etc.

If you are still not confatable with File::Find::Similars being
related with find, how about File::Name::Similars?

In brief, neither File::Search::Similars or File::Name::Similars will
collide with any other modules.

Please comment. When can we resolve this issue?

thanks
