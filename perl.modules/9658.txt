Hello,

   I have a few modules that I want to name properly, in case we decide
sometime in the future to publish them.  Could you please help me?

   All these modules are related.  At the core of them is the Operation,
which is an abstract class representing some set of actions that have
preconditions and postconditions, that can possibly be undone, and which can
possibly be committed (a la DB).  I also have a Transaction class, which
represents a set of undoable Operations whose actions should be performed in
sequence, and which should be undone in reverse order should any of them
fail.  To make useful Operation objects, I have subclassed it into
file-related Copy, Move, and Remove Operations, process-related Kill and
Start Operations, an Inittab Operation, a Crontab Operation, and a Generic
operation that will execute arbitrary closures following the Operation
rules.

   My first thought was to name them somewhere near Chapter 4, "Operating
System Interfaces, Hardware Drivers," but these modules seem to be somewhat
higher-level than that.  I originally intended them to be used for
configuring applications during installation, if that helps.

   Do you have any advice for me?  Thanks for your help!
