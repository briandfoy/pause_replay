The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Unrotate
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: incremental reader of rotated logs
  userid:      MMCLERIC (Vyacheslav Matjukhin)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::LogReader

  rationale:

    We used this module in our production (http://blogs.yandex.ru,
    russian blog-search engine with several millions of users per month)
    for 3 years.

    It is similar to File::LogReader, but implements several unique
    features like "start" and "end" parameters, and includes thorough
    tests for many edge cases, .

    It *may* become part of our future distributed-processing framework
    of any streaming data; it is currently in active development, and i
    hope to publish it too, once it'll be stable enough.

  enteredby:   MMCLERIC (Vyacheslav Matjukhin)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep 10 14:37:19 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::Unrotate        RdpOp incremental reader of rotated logs           MMCLERIC
