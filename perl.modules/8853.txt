Description:  

OVERVIEW
--------

  I'm a PhD student working in the field of computer vision and recently
  used Perl for doing my research.

  I implemented a geometrical toolbox called SUGR[1] for constructing
  and testing points, lines, planes and transformations in 2D and 3D.
  The toolbox is based on projective geometry and a simple but effective
  uncertainty model, though one can use the tool without statistics,
  too. See BACKGROUND section for more details
  
  There is already a preview version of my library, it also
  includes a special shell (based on the pdlshell) and a simple markup
  language for offline computations. This is available from
  http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/SUGR.html


  Footnotes: 
  [1]  SUGR is an acronym for "Statistically Uncertain Geometric
       Reasoning"

CATEGORY
--------
  
  Currently, SUGR is not categorized to any toplevel name. IMHO there
  are several possibilities, I'd suggest (in this very order)
     1. AI
     2. Geometry
     3. Statistics

BACKGROUND
----------

  The difference to existing solutions is the fact that it uses simple
  statistical description (second moments). This is helpful if you are
  not 100% sure about the exact values of your points, lines and planes.
  For example if you measure the length of your notebook with a simple
  ruler, you will never know the length in - say - Angstrom (=1
  hundred-millionth of a centimeter), so you will always have some
  uncertainty about the correct length.
  
  Using simple statistics has several advantages: (i) you can propagate
  the uncertainty to new geometrical objects. (ii) you get rid of the
  "choosing-the-epsilon-problem"[2] when testing geometrical relations
  such as "Does point X lie on the 3D-line L?". (iii) you can do a
  weighted least-squares estimation to do _any_ kind of constructions
  involving points, lines and planes in 2D and 3D.


  Footnotes:
  [2] The "Choosing-the-epsilon-problem" appears for example when you
      want to test whether a number is zero. It is usually not really
      zero, but close to it - so you choose a special small number
      called epsilon and test if your number is smaller than epsilon.
