Hello,

Net::XMPP has not been updated in over two years and has bugs. I
received no response trying to contact author. I asked on the
jdev@jabber.org list and was told that the author was not maintaining
any of his projects at Jabberstudio.org, which is now closing.

Here is the change log for 1.02:
1.0.2
===
  - Fix bug in Stanza::_xpath_defined causing defined to pass when it shouldn't
    which broke GetTimeStamp and likely other things.
  - Added test get_time_stamp.t
  - Copied *X subs from Net::Jabber::Message to Net::XMPP::Message
  - added debugging in some Protocol subs that didn't have it, but not all
  - disabled CODE checking in Protocol-Callback subs to be POE compatable
    Should be put into registration, not on callback, but didn't do that yet
  - changed mytestlib.pl to output more concise test names
  - switched to Module::Build.

I've also included changes from a 1.01 versions that was on
Jabberstudio.org but were never uploaded to CPAN.

I have a module to upload soon that crashes sometimes without this bug
fix in 1.02.
