Hi, all,

I have some modules that are tightly integrated with Asterisk, and that
constitute a coherent product.  (It's a framework for programming IVRs,
those voice menu systems you get when you call, say, your credit card
company.)

I want to stake out a namespace under Asterisk.  The product is
called Dido, so I want to use Asterisk::IVR::Dido.  (There's no
Asterisk::IVR currently.)  Does this sound OK?

Best regards,
Quinn

PS:  I see a recent post in the archive suggesting that Asterisk
shouldn't really be a top-level namespace.  However, the fact remains
that it is, and there's a fair amount of code there.

I assume this means I should put my stuff in Asterisk::, but  please
correct me if I'm wrong!
