     why:

    I plan to contribute modules I create in the development of my
    filename standardisation script, so far this includes a module for
    the reading of a config file into a hash using a param = value
    format with semicolon denoting comments. It also includes a Longest
    common sub-string module that will take an array of strings divide
    them up into eather words or characters and then locate the longest
    common sub string that matches a user specified percentage of the
    sub-strings, the user can also specify a minimum length for the
    sub-string.
