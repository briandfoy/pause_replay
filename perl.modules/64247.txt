I'd like to be given the rights to co-maintain the
DateTime::Format::Strptime, as it has a number of bugs that are solved
in rt.cpan.org but have not been applied. I've applied some of these
locally, but would much prefer to fix it once globally and release a new
version.

modules@perl.org:

I've mailed Rick a month ago (December 23, 2008), but had no response.
Hopefully just a missed email in the holiday craziness.

My CPAN id is TURNSTEP. Thanks to all.
