I think that would suffice, but I don't think it's the right way to
solve this. Paul needs a confirmation from the pumpking anyway, so
hiding the fact that you're going to overwrite the user's core module
isn't exactly the right thing to do, in my humble opinion.

Personally, I think it's only a matter of waiting a bit for approval
anyway. Rafael has been busy with (positive) personal issues recently,
so let's give him some slack. :)

Best regards,
Steffen
