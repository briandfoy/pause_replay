     why:

    Module to produce well-formed XHTML headers which can include
    Dublin Core declarations, pointers to alternate content (RSS feeds,
    FOAF, EARL, etc). Also page footers with automatic links for
    XHTML/CSS validation, human pointers to EARL declarations, if links
    exist in header. Aim being to have a tool that makes it easier to
    produce accessible (WCAG/Sec 508) content.

    RSS+ATOM reader in the pipeline as well. (May extend XML::RSS, may
    do from scratch.)

    I hope this makes sense - I'm writing with a ding-dong of a
    headache and can hardly focus on the screen!
