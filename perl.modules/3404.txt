Good morning!

I think the POE::Component::* modules should be listed.  They do useful
things which aren't necessarily related to POE itself, and the whole
purpose of POE::Component is to let people publish POE modules without
waiting for me to include them in the main distribution.

POE::Component is evolving as it goes.  I've started putting my own
components into two main categories, ::Client and ::Server, with the
miscellaneous guts modules falling in the main namespace.  It's my
hope that establishing these buckets ahead of time will prompt people
to use them instead of putting their modules just anywhere.

By way of example, some of my modules (yet to be CPANned) are at
<http://poe.perl.org/poco/>.  There also is POE::Component::Server::TCP
in the main distribution.

None of this is written in stone.  If there's a better interface to the
CPAN's structure, I'll be happy to promote and use it.  If you would like
to see the namespace hold a certain structure (or even be dispersed), I
can document it in the POE::Component manpage.
