The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::CachingFind
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: cache multiple file searches done in paths
  userid:      DORNER (Thomas Dorner)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Find

  rationale:

    File::CachingFind is a Perl module to cache filenames and
    directories for multiple file searches so that your script only has
    to browse the appropriate directories once. To achive this, it
    mainly uses a hash containing filenames and their corresponding
    directories.

    I used this module for a script analyzing a big tree of source
    modules. After introducing this modul, the process of locating the
    scattered include files was notably faster than before. (The include
    statements of the modules didn't contain directory informations.)

    File::Find works the other way around, you must know before
    starting which files you are going to need.

    The proposed name of the module got changed from File::Locate due
    to request.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
