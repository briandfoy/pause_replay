Subject: Module submission HTTP::Daemon::Threaded

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Daemon::Threaded
  DSLIP:       cdpOo
  description: Apartment threaded HTTP::Daemon
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    perlmonks perl-ithreads@perl.org

  similar:
    HTTP::Daemon

  rationale:

    HTTP::Daemon::Threaded provides a threaded version of HTTP::Daemon
    via apartment threading (via Thread::Apartment). Some useful
    extensions are provided, (e.g., session mgmt classes), and a more OO
    approach is used: rather than coding to the primitive
    HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn i/f, apps create "content handler" objects,
    and provide a simple regexp to handler class map to which requests
    are dispatched. The module was originally developed for the
    Devel::Psichedb package, but seemed generally useful and thus worth
    extracting into its own CPAN-able package.

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::Daemon::
::Threaded        cdpOo Apartment threaded HTTP::Daemon              DARNOLD
