Please accept my apology for the inconvenience.   If you feel that you should have already been in my address book, I apologize again -- it's possible that I made a typo when I added you, or that my address book is out of date and you are using a new address now.

The automated process at the link I mentioned above is really quick, you should be able to send me email in just a couple of minutes.

Cheers,
Jonathan
