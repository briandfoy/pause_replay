I don't have a preference one way or another.  My original thought was =
to keep it consistent with the naming of the base module (Win32::Daemon) =
and Win32::* modules in general.  I'm open to suggestions.

(Cc'ing the POE people at poe@perl.org).

I was under the impression that POE::Component::* modules are =
categorized
by functionality, not by platform; so, maybe

    POE::Component::Daemon::Win32

is a better choice here, so there can be POE::Component::Daemon::Unix
in the future.  What do you think?

Thanks,
