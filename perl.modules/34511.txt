Subject: Module submission Oracle::SQLLoader

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Oracle::SQLLoader
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: object interface to Oracle's SQL*Loader
  userid:      EZRA (Ezra Pagel)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    #oracle @ freenode, CVS

  similar:
    Oracle::Loader

  rationale:

    Oracle's SQL*Loader is a commonly used utility to bulkload data. It
    offers a considerable number of options, and requires knowledge of
    its control file specific syntax to use. The Oracle::SQLLoader
    module provides an object interface to the most commonly used
    options. It also parses output and error logs and provides useful
    accessors to the summarized load status information and errors.

    One other CPAN module exists for this utility, Oracle::Loader. My
    module is very different from Oracle::Loader, both in philosphy and
    implementation. My goal is to minimize the amount of information a
    user needs to know about SQL*Loader or PL/SQL to be productive with
    the utility. This dwimmery is largely accomplished by generating
    sane values for defaults, while still allowing the user to override
    these at will. Where necessary, my module sacrifices a little bit of
    (rarely-used) functionality for the sake of API clarity and
    ease-of-use.

    This module should be included in the module list because it is
    useful and time-saving. It lets users accomplish common load tasks
    without knowing obscure syntax or option specifics; they can focus
    on their data, not the utility.

The resulting entry would be:

Oracle::
::SQLLoader       adpOp object interface to Oracle's SQL*Loader      EZRA
