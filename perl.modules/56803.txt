     why:

    Additional packages for the Net::SNMP module. Such as resolving the
    device vendor for every SNMP sysObjectID based on the IANA list as
    well as a module that uses Net::SNMP and XML::XPath to query
    SNMP-Agents. The OIDs and the rule set how the result of the OID
    queries are combined and sorted are to be described in a simple XML
    file. These files can be reused simply by defining XML entities. The
    advantage of the method is that regardless which set of information
    should be retrieved from a SNMP-Agent a simple XML file is
    everything that is needed instead of writing an extra module or sub
    for each query. Extra benefit is the reusability of XML files.
