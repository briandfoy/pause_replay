The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::CurveFit
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Nonlinear Least Squares Fitting
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    none that I know of

  rationale:

    [ This request was first submitted about a month ago. I'm resending
    it since I haven't received any feedback nor has been included in
    the modules list. --Steffen ]

    I'm not aware of modules with similar functionality. The algorithm
    is somewhat similar to that which gnuplot uses. (At least the
    results are comparable.) So you could say Chart::Plot::Gnuplot is
    related, but it doesn't work with gnuplot 4 and newer. (Plus, I
    don't think that module allows access to the data fitting related
    features of gnuplot.)

    The namespace was chosen because the module mainly implements a
    single algorithm, that is, a non-linear curve fitting algorithm.

    (The module documentation on search.cpan.org refers to a MathWorld
    page on this.)

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
