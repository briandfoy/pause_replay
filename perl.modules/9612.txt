The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::BancaSella
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Internet payment with Bnca Sella bank
  userid:      EBRUNI (Bruni Emiliano)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wish to replace my previous namespace registration request for
    URI::BancaSella. I look the modules list and now i belive that
    Business::BancaSella is a better namespace.

    Banca Sella is an italian bank which offer an integrated and secure
    online payment system using secure web geteway over SSL.

    This module is a wrapper that built web request and receive web
    response from this payment system encoding and decoding it in an
    object orientated environment.

    Use the URI module to build uri that loads the Banca Sella online
    payment pages and then decode the query string response from Banca
    Sella for committing transaction.

    Usually this module can be used in an e-commerce environment web
    site to support online payment via credit cards.
