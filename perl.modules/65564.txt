The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::API3
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: PDF::API3 next generation after PDF::API2
  userid:      OTTO (Otto Hirr)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    www.pdf-api3.org (coming soon)

  similar:
    PDF::API2

  rationale:

    After much time, effort, and with well received results, Alfred
    Reibenschuh is abandoning PDF::API2. see
    http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/perl-text-pdf-modules/message/3615

    However we have seen great progress in moving towards paperless
    methods.

    Furthermore the PDF specification is now an ISO standard.

    Now is the time to really push forward with the development of an
    even better perl pdf solution.

    This is a beginning toward that goal.

    This version starts with PDF::API2 0.73, creating a new one of
    PDF::API3.

    There are a growing number of PDF "quick solutions". It is hoped
    that PDF::API3 can coalesce many under one library. There is
    commonality that all "quick solutions" will need: find, open, read,
    write, parse files.

    The intent is to provide a universal library for which other
    "solutions" may utilize for lower level functionality. As such, all
    PDF::API2 modules have been re-named as PDF::API3::Compat::API2.

    The intent is that the interface at the API2 level will stay the
    same.

    As the library is refactored, a new API3 interface will be
    formulated. Low level functionality will be factored into
    PDF::API3::Lib. The typical programmer interface will be factored
    under PDF::API3. The typical programmer interface would utilized the
    lower level routines of PDF::API3::Lib.

    Other PDF libraries may be incorporated as
    PDF::API3::Compat::distA, PDF::API3::Compat::distB,
    PDF::API3::Compat::distC, etc. As these are refactored to utilize or
    generalize PDF::API3::Lib, their typical programmer interface will
    move under PDF::API3 if general, or may be spun off as PDF::API3x
    extensions

    The intent is to use git and encourage distributed development. A
    git and wiki will be put up soon.

    Development philosophy includes development of lots of tests,
    tidy'ing and critic utilities, and utlization of Moose and other
    libraries that will speed development and provide a clean, solid,
    easily maintained, production ready system. And to develop
    appropriate programmer and maintenance documentation. Yes -
    maintenance of how it works and why choices were made so as to ease
    maintenance of it by others.

    The intent of putting this release out is to inform the community
    of the effort, encourage others to participate, and to utilize the
    bug tracking system of CPAN for tracking bugs and new development.

    Consider this pre-alpha software.

    Thanks Martin Hosken for Text::PDF from which PDF::API2 was
    developed. Thanks Alfred Reibenschuh for PDF::API2 for taking it to
    the next level.
