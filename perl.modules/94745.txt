Subject: Regaining access to PAUSE (forgotten PW, expired email address)
To: modules@perl.org

Dear team,

I'm writing on behalf of CPAN author Steve McKay (MCKAY), who has not
used PAUSE since 2003 and is looking into adding licensing information
to one or more of his modules.

The email address linked to his PAUSE ID (steve@colgreen.com I think)
expired years ago. He now has no way of recovering his forgotten PAUSE
password to a working email address. I've CC'd Steve at his current
working address with this message.

Is there a documented process that he can follow to successfully
recover his PAUSE account and regain write access to his modules? I
haven't yet found anything detailing this process - the nearest is for
recovering a PAUSE password which is not going to work in this
instance.

Thanks in advance,
Nick Morrott
