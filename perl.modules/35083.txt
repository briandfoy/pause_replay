The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Yahoo::DrivingDirections
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to maps.yahoo driving directions
  userid:      KESTER (Kester Allen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules and modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've written a module, tentatively called
    WWW::Yahoo::DrivingDirections, that allows command-line interaction
    with the driving directions that are available from maps.yahoo.com.
    Especially, multiple-stop driving directions can be easily produces,
    e.g., a trip from Boston to Newark to Albany to Buffalo with a
    script as simple as:

    use WWW::Yahoo::DrivingDirections; my $ydd =
    WWW::Yahoo::DrivingDirections->new (); $ydd->add_stops ( @ARGV );
    $ydd->get_maps();

    The html output can either be saved to local files, or returned
    from the get_maps method.

    My namespace choice was based on the suggestion of Brian Foy, and
    the existence of other WWW::Yahoo modules, and the general logic of
    it (driving directions, from yahoo, off the web).

    I think this module would be useful in the list because it makes
    planning multiple-stop trips very easy (think: five open houses in a
    three hour period on a Sunday), and it has a relatively simple
    interface.

    Thank you for your time,

    Kester Allen
