    a description of what you're planning to contribute 

1) FCGI-ProcManager - A process manager that is implemented in perl rather
   than in mod_fastcgi.c.  Among other things, this will allow developers of
   FCGI to gain on the load-before-fork optimization enjoyed by mod_perl
   developers.

2) Stress - A stress-testing framework.  It was originally developed to
   log in and walk a path through a web application, but it is extensible
   enough to walk through any set of perl methods/subroutines.  It contains
   logic to manage multiple children performing those tests, and to
   calculate and display benchmarks from those concurrent processes.

3) PSP - 4 packages:
 a) PSP (base) - a servlet-like, object oriented CGI framework that provides
    a URI-to-object-method mapping mechanism.
 b) PSP-Field - an abstraction of an HTML display/input field which handles
    formatting and verification for various data-types and HTML elements.
 c) PSP-Tools - a set of classes which provide useful functionality to this
    framework.
 d) PSP-Parser - a ASP/JSP-like, embedded-html-to-class compiler which
    subclasses classes of PSP-Tools and PSP (base).

    for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry, which is:
	Development stage, Support level, Language used, Interface style
	(see the modulelist), and a 44 character description). 

FCGI
::ProcManager		bdpO A FastCGI process manager implemented in perl

Stress			bdpO base class for a system stressing framework

::FormParser		bdpO HTML::Parser subclass to get data from a form

(I don't have time right now to fill in all of these descriptions below.  I am
mostly concerned with releasing the two packages above, especially the first.)

    for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send a concise description
	that helps us to categorize the issue so we can forward your mail to
	the maintainers of the corresponding archive branch. 

stress - stress tester  (installed by Stress)

piler - compiler for PSP  (installed by PSP-Parser)

piledriver.cgi - CGI script which provides hooks into PSP (found in PSP)

piledriver.fcg - FastCGI variant which provides hooks into PSP (found in PSP)

testpile - a command-line tester for piledriver.cgi

    It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have
	discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if
	there was at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for
	submissions, but we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality
	control.  If your work has never been discussed publicly, then it's
	extremely difficult for us to make our judgement whether to accept the
	submission or not. 

FCGI-ProcManager - I have briefly discussed this with Sven Verdoolaege
  <skimo@kotnet.org> (author of FCGI) and Rob Saccoccio <robs@chelsea.net>.  I
  have not been able to share it until yesterday when I finally got approval
  to release it.  I am looking for a means of distributing it to a larger
  group of developers, and to get people interested in it.

Stress - I have discussed it with people I work with.  It has some
  interesting, convenient features for its purpose: to evaluate how much
  stress a system can take and how that system performs under stress.
  It is a little awkward right now, but versatile, and I think people will
  find it useful in a number of different situations.

PSP - At my company, we have been developing and using this system for the
  past several years.  PSP has just recently been re-written from the ground
  up, but this later version is currently not in production use yet.  It is my
  hope/intention that other developers will find this technology interesting
  and even possibly familiar, and will help develop this web application
  framework.  I consider this work in alpha because of how scrambled the
  documentation is right now, but it does work, and has been somewhat
  extensively tested.  This project was just released by my company's legal
  department last night.  If this project is not ready for CPAN yet, it
  will be soon.
