The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Rijndael::PP
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Pure Perl Implementation of the AES Cipher
  userid:      DRZIGMAN (Robert Stone)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    Houston Perl Mongers

  similar:
    Crypt::Rijndael_PP Crypt::Rijndael Crypt::Rijndael::MySQL
    Crypt::Cipher::AES

  rationale:

    Crypt::Rijndael::PP is a pure perl implementation of the AES Cipher
    (Rijndael, but with the restrictions on blocksize and keysize that
    the NIST has published for AES).

    The long term plan is to introduce this PP module initially as a
    proof of concept (and demonstration of the AES logic/implementation)
    and continue to refactor it to where it could stand alone as a
    Crypt::CBC compatible implementation of AES in Pure Perl. Then,
    similar to how there are PP and XS implementations of JSON,
    Crypt::Rijndael will become Crypt::Rijndael::XS and then
    Crypt::Rijndael::Any will provide users with a single interface for
    PP or XS implementations. Needless to say this process will take
    place over time, with many trial releases and input from consumers.

    Especially given the history of platform dependent issues with XS
    modules, the ability to offer a slower but fully functional API
    compliant drop in replacement as PP should enable users to ensure
    they are always able to make use of SOMETHING with Crypt::CBC.

    Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or
    concerns and I'd be happy to discuss them.

The resulting entry would be:
