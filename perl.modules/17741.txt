Good questions!

I proposed that it belongs in the XML namespace because, depending on its
usage, it is essentially (a) an XML variant, or (b) an XML
authoring/visualization tool.  Of course I'm open to guidance here -
any alternatives in mind?

I guess was thinking of putting in XML::Terse rather than
XML::Parser::Terse because it will have other functionality than just 
being an Expat replacement - for one, it also has routines to turn XML 
into tXML, which isn't parsing at all.  Rather, it will be a collection of 
tools for parsing and generating tXML, only part of which is an Expat 
lookalike API.
