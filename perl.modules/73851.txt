From: adam@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

Since my releases seem to have "regressed" issues that were "fixed" in
the no-longer-existing 0.23 (and created problems for some people) my
plan to not have to touch the actual code seem to have been derailed a
bit.

I'm going to see if I can apply some of the fixes suggested in RT, or
reapply some of the fixes from 0.23. If I can't knock out a decent
test-passing dev release I'm then going to rip out the leaking XS
versions of the functions as damage control.

Alternatively, if Jens plans to work on it straight away then I'll yield.

I'll see how far I can get now, but won't push a stable release
without Jens' approval.
