Hi

I've written a module for generating and validating certain email
addresses.  I'm thinking of calling it Mail::Address::Tagged

The module is based on an application written in Python, details of
that application are available here http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmda/

This module implements an object that can generate and validate tagged
email addresses.  These are designed to be used primarily in anti-spam
applications.  The module assumes that for a given user
(user@domain.net) for all values of TAG, addresses of the form
userTAG@doamin.net will be delivered to the user.  qmail and courier
are both capable of this kind fof delivery.

The addresses generated all carry extra information, such as the date
when they expire, who may use them to send you mail etc.  A
cryptocraphic hash of this extra information is also included in in
the address.  This Hashed Message Authenticaion Code (HMAC RFC 2104)
is your guarantee that the information contained in the address has
not been tampered with.

This module can generate and validate three different types of tagged
address.  They are all extensions of a users normal email address and
are constructed in a similar manner.  Where the normal address is
user@host.com, the tagged address takes the form
user-tagtype-tag@host.com.

cheers

Andrew
