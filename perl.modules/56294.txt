From: jeffreykegler@mac.com (Jeffrey Kegler)

I've had the PAUSE handle JKEGL since before there was a PAUSE, but  
haven't used it in a very long time, certainly not since PAUSE came  
on line.  Of course I wouldn't have clue what password (if any) was  
assigned to JKEGL.

The email address listed with JKEGL is long defunct.  It's now  
jeffreykegler@mac.com.

Please do what's needed to give me access to PAUSE and the JKEGL  
namespace.

I'm taking my project off the back burned.  I've recently discussed  
it with Randal Schwartz and Allison Randal.

thanks, jeffrey kegler
