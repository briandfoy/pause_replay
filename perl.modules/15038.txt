OK -if that's the vote then I will live with it.  As I said the GnomeVFS
case is slightly different in that that is the name of the library
( http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/gnome-vfs/index.html ) - but in the
interests of peace :-) ....  It is far more important to get the general
scheme of VFS::x VFS::y etc. going.

Cheers.
