     why:

    At the moment, something one might call
    "Unicode::Indic::Obliterator" (Obliterator is the internal name for
    it where I work) that transcodes ISCII (which is "Indic ASCII") for
    10 Indic writing systems into Unicode, and also transliterates them
    into UTF-diacritical romanizations and crudely simplified ascii (not
    any real Unicode decomposition forms, though that could be arranged
    if there's a demand for it). It doesn't currently transcode Unicode
    back to ISCII but it used to be able to do that, and I plan to fix
    it, probably before I actually upload it.
