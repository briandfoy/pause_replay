Hi.  I'd like to register MP3::Daemon into the modulelist.
It's been out for about a month and a half, now, and people
seem to like it.  It comes with a client called "mp3" which
is an mpg123 front-end for UNIX::Philosophers.

For more info, you can go to:

    http://opensource.lineo.com/~beppu/perl/MP3-Daemon.html

package MP3::Daemon;

my $info = {
    dsli        => "bdpO",
    description => "a daemon that possesses mpg123",
    category    => "Miscellaneous Modules",
    cpan_id     => "BEPPU",
}

thanks.
