Subject: Seeking co-maint on SuffixTree
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: daoswald@gmail.com (David Oswald)

I started a thread a couple weeks ago asking that a CPAN author be
assisted in re-establishing his PAUSE credentials so that he could
hand over co-maintenance on the module SuffixTree.  He has agreed to
allow me to co-maintain the module, but has lost his PAUSE
credentials.

I've checked with him several times since this all began to see if he
had gotten any reply from PAUSE folks.  He says he hasn't.

Here is the thread:

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2012/09/msg82161.html

If it's not possible to re-establish his PAUSE credentials so that he
can follow through on adding me as co-maintainer, would it be possible
for someone to add me as a co-maintainer?  The previous thread (link
provided above) provides details on my tracking down the author, and
his willingness to allow me to co-maintain the module so that I get
get some bug-fixes applied.

Assistance will be greatly appreciated!
