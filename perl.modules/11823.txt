The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Handle
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Supply object methods to classes
  userid:      ADAMK (Adam Kennedy)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:
    Class::ISA UNIVERSAL Class::Inspector

  rationale:

    Provides an OO Handle to a class. Provides a unifying OO wrapper to
    UNIVERSAL, Class::ISA, and Class::Inspector, as well as additional
    methods doing actions of varying types ( well ->load currently ).

    Makes life a bit easier for some sorts of programs that like to
    manipulate and examine their classes.

  enteredby:   ADAMK (Adam Kennedy)
  enteredon:   Fri May 24 16:21:35 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Handle          RdpOp Supply object methods to classes             ADAMK
