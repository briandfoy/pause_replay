Subject: Module submission Text::MediawikiFormat

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::MediawikiFormat
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Convert marked-up text into other formats
  userid:      DPRICE (Derek Price)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::WikiFormat

  rationale:

    This module is derived from Text::WikiFormat, but is more HTML
    aware (this is more closely tied to HTML than T:WF, which goes to
    greater lengths to be agnostic about the output format). This is
    necessary since Mediawiki style markup requires that processing of
    some wiki-markup be ignored when it appears on lines which contain
    block-level HTML elements and that some HTML-style tags be able to
    change the way the wiki-markup is processed.

    This module is already uploaded, but I intend to move most of the
    core functionality (all the functionality that isn't dependent on
    the back-end data store) from Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::Mediawiki
    into T:MediawikiFormat and update the documentation (which still
    looks mostly like T:WF's) in the next few business days.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::MediawikiFormat Rdpfp Convert marked-up text into other formats    DPRICE
