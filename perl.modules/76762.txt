The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CDP
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Perl wrapper for R1Soft CDP API
  userid:      JON (Jon A)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Hello,

    I chose CDP because that is the name of the product for which this
    module wraps the API. Additionally there is not currently a package
    using this name space and no packages provide similar functionality.

    I do not want to use R1Soft as the root because this is the name of
    the company that provides the product and I do not want to provide
    any free advertising. Also I think this module can be extended to
    accomodate other Constant Data Protection suites.

    I am open to other suggestions, but ConstantDataProtection is a bit
    long.

    Thank you for your consideration, Jon
