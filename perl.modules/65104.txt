The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::CommandLine
  DSLIP:       bdhfp
  description: Retrieve and reparse the Win32 command line
  userid:      RIVY (Roy Ivy III)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    No specific plan as of yet.

  similar:
    None known.

  rationale:

    This module is used to reparse the Win32 command line, automating
    better quoting and full globbing of the command line. Globbing is
    full bash POSIX compatible globbing, including subshell expansions.
    With the use of the companion script (xx.bat) and doskey for macro
    aliasing, you can add full-fledged bash compatible string
    quoting/expansion and file globbing to any Win32 command.

    Compatible with both cmd.exe and 4nt/tcc shells.

    Would this be better placed in Chapter 12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)?

    <1st module, any suggestions?>

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
