Hello,

Thank you for trying to stop the upload of what seems at first blush to be a
redundant and unnecessary module.

Possibly, this module was created and uploaded in part because the author
could not easily find me on CPAN. I'm not sure why (I thought I took all of
the proper steps), but I'm not listed in the authors page
(http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/), and on some other indexes, but I
am listed in others - and, of course, my module is ready for download from
CPAN. Can you please let me know what steps I can take to get myself
properly listed?

Thanks,

James Tolley
CPAN id: JAMES
