Hi!

I would like to contribute my Perl/Tk written WAP browser wApua [1] to
CPAN.

  [1] http://fsinfo.cs.uni-sb.de/~abe/wApua/

While it grew, I separated several components into modules without
knowledge of the CPAN Modules Guidelines. Now I wonder, if the
namespace I've once chosen is ok for CPAN.

Since the executable itself is named wApua, I named the package of the
executable wApua, too, and all modules especially written for wApua
are in the wApua::* namespace:

  wApua::About
  wApua::Cache
  wApua::Config
  wApua::Helpers
  wApua::History
  wApua::Phone
  wApua::UserAgent

  wApua::WBMP2XBM

Except the last one, all are components of the user interface and
probably not very usable for anyone else. The last module is a simple
converter between two bitmap formats and can easily be used by other
Perl scripts. In fact, it is used in the commandline bitmap converter
wbmp2xbm which I just wrote because it was so easy to do it. :-)

In my opinion it's unlikely that this namespace, especially with it's
"strange" capitalisation, leads to conflicts, but wApua::WBMP2XBM may
fit better into another namespace, perhaps into WAP::Wbmp:: or
Image::, maybe also into WML:: somewhere. Nevertheless, I have no idea
what of the four options (including keeping the current namespace)
would be most appropriate...

The wApua:: namespace itself would probably best fit into categories
23, 24 or 15.

Any advices or suggestion?

P.S.: Regardings modules in similar areas (WML::*, WAP::*): Those
      weren't around, when I started the project back in 2000.
      Otherwise I would have used them. :-)

		Regards, Axel
