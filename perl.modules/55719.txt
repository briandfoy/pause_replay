I have a simple module that tests two perl subroutines to determine which
one is faster. It accepts two subrefs and returns a table of average
runtimes over successive runs of increasing orders of magnitude, by default
attempting to keep the longest run under 10 mins (by stopping after anything
over 1 min).

Is there already a module available with similar functionality? (I looked
through a few hundred of the 5000 "Test" modules, with modifiers "Time",
"Simple" "Sub", "Subroutine",  and "Basic").

I would suggest Test::Perl::Simple, but would be happy calling it almost
anything. :}

Thanks!

Roger
