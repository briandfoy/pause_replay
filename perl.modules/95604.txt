Subject: purging old releases from your CPAN author directory

Hi Lincoln,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you again wearing my PAUSE admin hat. The NOC have =
let us know that we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN =
master. This is caused by packrats who are keeping lots of old releases =
in their author directory on CPAN.

Care to guess who is the biggest offender? ;-)

The single biggest culprit in terms of distributions is your GBrowse =
dist, though you also have a lot of old releases of other dists as well. =
All releases you=E2=80=99ve ever done will always be available from your =
BackPAN author directory:
	http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/L/LD/LDS/

Would you be happy to cull your old releases please? There are at least =
3 ways we can make this happen:
   1. you could use the script written by XDG and RJBS: =
https://gist.github.com/xdg/1739bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38
   2. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
   3. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

The script mentioned in (1) above keeps all developer releases later =
than a stable release, keeps up to 3 stable releases, and deletes =
everything else. Use at your own risk, of course. If you give me =
permission, I would delete everything other than the latest release for =
anything older than a year, and 3 releases of anything less than a year =
old. When marked for deletion, you=E2=80=99d have 3 days to check and =
revert anything you=E2=80=99re not happy with, before PAUSE would =
actually delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil
