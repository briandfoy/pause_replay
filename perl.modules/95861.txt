For context, please see this BackPAN user directory:

http://backpan.cpantesters.org/authors/id/G/GL/GLEACH/

BackPAN has permissions problems such that if one tries to download files named 
*.pl, such as the handful at the end of the above file listing, a 403 error 
results, eg "You don't have permission to access 
/authors/id/G/GL/GLEACH/pod2indexed_html-0.1.pl on this server."

The expected result would be a 200 response with type text/plain that shows the 
source code of that file, same as when clicking on a *.meta or a *.readme file.

In this case, the underlying problem is that there is a Perl script that was 
distributed bare a decade ago and not in a tarball, so a part of CPAN history so 
done can't be viewed easily without the fix.

As the front page for BackPAN says it is run by the PAUSE admins and doesn't 
give other contact info, I'm writing modules@ to get the attention of whomever 
is best to deal with this problem.

Thank you in advance for fixing this.
