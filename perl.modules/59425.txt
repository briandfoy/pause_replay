The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SNMP::Query::Asynch
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Execute lots of SNMP queries extremely fast
  userid:      SSCAFFIDI (Stephen R. Scaffidi)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    email, annocpan, cpanforum, rt, perlmonks

  similar:
    SNMP::Effective SNMP::Multi

  rationale:

    The actual name is pretty easy to explain: This module uses the
    SNMP module's interface to the net-snmp library to execute and issue
    batches of SNMP queries asynchronously. Hence SNMP::Query::Asynch.

    I also have a few other modules that could also go in the
    SNMP::Query namespace that I have not yet released.

    I began work on this module after having scalability and stability
    issues with SNMP::Multi. It turns out that the stability issues were
    actually due to a bug in the .xs code of the SNMP module. However, I
    dislike the interface of SNMP::Multi and is still wasn't fast enough
    for my needs.

    Later, after I had posted a *very* alpha version of my code to
    PerlMonks, someone pointed out that the purpose and usage of my code
    was almost identical to SNMP::Effective. SNMP::Eddective was indeed
    written to solve the same problem for which I created this new
    module. However, others with a need that could be satisfied by
    either module will now have a choice.

    Also, in my testing on a *large* network, I find that my code is
    *much* faster :)

The resulting entry would be:

SNMP::Query::
