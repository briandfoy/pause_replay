The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PAUSE::Permissions
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: interface to PAUSE's module permissions file
  userid:      NEILB (Neil Bowers)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    {module-authors,modules}@perl.org

  similar:
    Not aware of any

  rationale:

    This is an interface to 06perms.txt, the file PAUSE generates that
    contains all user permissions for modules on CPAN. Hence the name
    PAUSE::Permissions.

    I haven't found an existing module which provides an interface to
    the file, and the information isn't currently provided by MetaCPAN.
    They seemed to like the suggestion that it should be, but it doesn't
    seem to be a priority.

    I also couldn't find any place where the permissions model was
    written down in full, so I've been sucking it out of Andreas's head
    and writing it up in the pod :-)

The resulting entry would be:

PAUSE::
::Permissions     adpOp interface to PAUSE's module permissions file NEILB
