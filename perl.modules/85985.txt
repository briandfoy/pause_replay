     why:

    I would like to contribute a WebSocket server module to the CPAN
    (hopefully as Net::WebSocket::Server) because the existing modules
    are either 1) plugins in some massive framework or 2) plugins in
    some event system. This module is simply a server which speaks
    WebSocket and provides a few slots for interesting callbacks.

    I've written a lot of Perl, but I've never contributed, and so I'll
    probably package up a few more modules when I get a chance.
