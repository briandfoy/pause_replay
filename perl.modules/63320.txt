The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SysAdmin
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Collection of System Admin modules
  userid:      MARR (Miguel A. Rivera)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace would function as a centralized location of modules
    typically used by System Administrators.

    These modules are wrappers, for established CPAN modules, where the
    goal is to create object oriented interfaces with simple syntax for
    newcomers and experts looking for code abstraction/reuse.

    SysAdmin would house modules oriented for database interaction,
    file access, snmp, smtp, expect, etc. and would be accessed through
    an object oriented interface.

    Example:

    SysAdmin::DB::Pg - DBI and DBD::Pg wrapper SysAdmin::SNMP -
    Net::SNMP wrapper SysAdmin::SMTP - Net::SMTP and MIME::Lite wrapper
    SysAdmin::Expect - Expect.pm wrapper

    Looking forward through this module to share my experience with
    others as have all CPAN authors shared theirs' through their
    contributions.
