I don't know how far along in development this proposed application is yet 
(no CPAN upload to see), but I want to say that I'm looking for such an 
application to be built as well (a perl<any-ordbms>admin), to the point 
that I did make a GSoC 2008 proposal of it under TPF, except that it would 
be built over Muldis::Rosetta, whose API resembles the Perl DBI and should 
be adaptable to, and (unstated for GSoC) it would also be built using 
Catalyst.  The application would be valuable for ad-hoc database 
maintenance as well as troubleshooting other database-using applications by 
seeing what effects they have on the database.  I know I would want to use 
it, and I'm willing to help you make it. -- Darren Duncan
