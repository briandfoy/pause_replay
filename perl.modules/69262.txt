Subject: Module submission Net::Radius::Management

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Radius::Management
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: RADIUS SQL database management
  userid:      STEVEB (Steve Bertrand)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Initially a mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    This requested namespace replaces ISP::RADIUS that I requested a
    couple of weeks ago, as to not have to create a new top-level.

    FreeRADIUS is (and has been) bundled with a few 'accounting'
    aggregation and management scripts. To be useful to me, I had to
    severely hack them in several different ways.

    The overall purpose is for aggregating the user RADIUS
    time/bandwidth used so that it can be searched by day or month. It
    also archives the fast-growing accounting database table in order to
    keep it manageable. Many ISPs are, or will be doing all of their
    billing based on bandwidth consumption.

    This module tries to aid in the monthly billing data collection.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Radius::
::Management      ampOp RADIUS SQL database management               STEVEB
