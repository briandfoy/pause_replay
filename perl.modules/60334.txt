I run the test suite and it passed.
What side effects did you see?

Yes, I knew this, but I thought it could be useful to
bring the File::MMagic database "up-to-date".

I didn't understand. Can you explain this more?

I thought that including a new updated magic file would be enough.
But I realize that probably the debian magic file is not (entirely)
appropriate. Maybe the apache one? Did you use the plain apache
httpd magic file for File::MMagic 1.27?

I don't know really.
We had a bunch of sample files that mostly worked with 1.27.
Now they all work with this updated version.
I don't know what 'string/b' means.

Yes, it seems so  :-)
