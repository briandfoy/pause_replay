Subject: Module submission Authen::Passphrase

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::Passphrase
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: hashed passwords/passphrases as objects
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Crypt::Passwd Crypt::PasswdMD5 Crypt::SmbHash Crypt::UnixCrypt
    Crypt::UnixCrypt_XS

  rationale:

    This is the object-oriented approach to passphrase hashing. A
    hashed passphrase is represented by an object of type
    Authen::Passphrase. The object is essentially a passphrase
    recogniser: it knows when it's given the right passphrase. Methods
    also exist for a passphrase hash to represent it in crypt() or RFC
    2307 textual formats.

    The modules that I've listed as supplying similar functionality
    each implement a specific passphrase hashing scheme, each via a
    function interface. The Authen::Passphrase package supports each of
    those hashing schemes via subclasses. (In some cases the subclass
    actually calls the existing module to do the hashing.)

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Tue May 23 20:32:15 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::
::Passphrase      RdpOp hashed passwords/passphrases as objects      ZEFRAM
