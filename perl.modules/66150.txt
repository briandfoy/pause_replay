The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTime::AATW
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: DateTime All Around The World
  userid:      KMCGRATH (Kevin C. McGrath)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    CPAN RT

  similar:

  rationale:

    The initial reason for creating this module grew from a need to run
    scheduled tasks on servers around the world from a single monitoring
    / administration server. Some information for example, needed to be
    collected on the 0,4,8,12,16,20 hours within that servers time zone.
    The script on the monitoring server could be kicked off every hour,
    calculate which time zones needed to be collected from, then collect
    information form servers only in those time zones.

    Combining this module with L<DateTime::Event::Cron> helps figure
    out which time zones need be operated on at a specific time and
    schedule.

  enteredon:   Mon Jun  1 16:55:35 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DateTime::
::AATW            bdpOp DateTime All Around The World                KMCGRATH
