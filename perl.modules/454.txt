I believe that you were duplicating effort with Text::Hyphenate. I
recall that TeX::Hyphen is there for ages and I presume it does pretty
much of what your module does.

Here are my 2 Eurocents:

1. Wrapping into paragraphs is indeed related to hyphenation as we all
   know.

2. But nonetheless is hyphenation something that has rules independent
   of wrapping. This becomes apparent when you try to wrap with
   variable-width fonts

3. Hyphenation is heavily language dependent as native German speakers
   are painful aware. You have to put a considerable part of the
   language into the \hyphenation macro.

So what I would expect from a Text::Wrap::Hyphenated module is a way
to work with multiple hyphenation modules, not just one. And I would
expect that a hyphenation module can be queried for possible
hyphenations independent of line width, so that it can become useful
for other tasks but formatting fix-width fonts and regularly shaped
paragraphs.
