The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Radius::Management
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: FreeRADIUS SQL database/acct management
  userid:      STEVEB (Steve Bertrand)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    nrm-users@lists.ibctech.ca

  similar:

  rationale:

    FreeRADIUS is (and has been) bundled with a few 'accounting'
    aggregation and management scripts. To be useful to me, I had to
    severely hack them in several different ways.

    The overall purpose of this module is for aggregating the user
    RADIUS time/bandwidth used so that it can be searched by day or
    month. It also archives the fast-growing accounting database table
    in order to keep it manageable. Many ISPs are, or will be doing all
    of their billing based on bandwidth consumption.

    This module tries to aid in the monthly billing data collection.

    It also contains core user management/statistical methods, and is
    bundled with utility scripts that can be implemented immediately via
    cron, without the user having to write any code whatsoever.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Radius::
::Management      bmpOp FreeRADIUS SQL database/acct management      STEVEB
