     why:

    I was looking for a simple module for getting command line
    arguments that did not require any dependencies and returned your
    arguments in a hash. For some reason that seemed pretty hard to
    find. I made a very easy to use module that offers validation also
    and would like to contribute back to the community that has greatly
    contributed to my success with perl I could not do what I do without
    cpan and cpanm. Thanks.
