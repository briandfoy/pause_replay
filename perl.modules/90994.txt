I'm 'registered in the module list', but I don't appear to be the
'primary maintainer' for IPC::Run. I'm guessing (based on some other
UX on this page) that the primary maintainer is ADAMK.

And, yeah, based on my archives, it looks like in 2008, I approved him
to take it over, and I'm guessing he used PAUSE admin powers to do it:

> You don't need to do anything, I've got an admin bit so I can change the actual permission settings, I just needed your approval.

So that might be why it still lists me in the modlist, but doesn't
grant me admin rights.

If you're unable to reach ADAMK for approval [*], you still have mine,
but I'd defer to him as a first step.

ps. Also, 'TODDR was already a co-maintainer of IPC::Run: skipping',
so I guess you already have as much access as I do.
