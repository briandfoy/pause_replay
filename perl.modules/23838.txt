So far, no reaction (but that could just mean he's on vacation or so).
Anyways, since it seems that he didn't even register that namespace
himself, I'll CC: the person responsible for the registration, Andreas
KÃ¶nig :) Maybe he remembers what happened back then in more detail. Maybe
not...

I can't come up with the reference (despite having found it quickly the
first time, but now all my google searches fail to find the mail where
andreas says he'll register that modulelist entry).

Ah well :)
