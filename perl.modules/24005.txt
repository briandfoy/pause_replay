The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Shapelib
  DSLIP:       RdcOg
  description: Interface to Shapelib, C API for Shapefiles
  userid:      AJOLMA (Ari Jolma)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Geo::ShapeFile GISI::SHAPE

  rationale:

    Geo::ShapeFile is a read-only interface GISI:SHAPE is more or less
    abandoned

    Shapelib is a well maintained and much used C library for working
    with ESRI Shapefiles, see
    http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib/index.html

    My module is used by several people already. It has existed since
    2000 at http://www.water.hut.fi/pub/Grid/ (even this attempt to put
    it to CPAN is prompted by two users).

    I have emailed developers of both Geo::ShapeFile and GISI::SHAPE a
    couple of days ago and asked for discussion but have received no
    reply so far.

    I put chapter 6 since Shapefile is a data type (geographical data
    in vector format and associated attribute data -- not really a
    database) which is defined in a public white paper by ESRI. Geo:: is
    in 23 and 24 which do not describe anything very well.

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::Shapelib        RdcOg Interface to Shapelib, C API for Shapefiles  AJOLMA
