Hmm. Not giving out namespaces that start with a lower case letter is a 
hard rule for us. Not doing so for namespaces with a lower case letter 
at the start of a sub-namespace is more of a "best practices" thing, as 
far as I can tell.

Particularly given the similar naming of related modules, I'll register 
the namespace for you as requested. *If* you were to rename the module, 
you could go about it in two ways:

If there are no users yet:
Delete the old tarball(s) from PAUSE/CPAN. Upload one with renamed 
module. Done.

If there are users:
Upload a version under the old namespace that has warnings in big, red 
letters all over it that the module has been renamed. Delete all old 
versions. Upload a tarball with the renamed modules.

Best regards,
Steffen
