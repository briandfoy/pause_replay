can the second level be something more descriptive?  "RIM"
stands for Remote Invocation of Methods, but "RPC" already
has "Remote" in it.

i'm not an RPC sort of guy, so i don't have a good suggestion,
but i'd like to see something explicit rather than initials.
maybe something like:

   RPC::Method::*
   RPC::Method::Server
   RPC::Method::Client
   RPC::Method::Invoke

but Method is ambiguous.  it doesn't mean the way you do
it, but that it is a subroutine.
