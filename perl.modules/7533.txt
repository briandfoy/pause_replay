    You might be able to convince me otherwise, but I don't think
that `request tracking' is a pressing issue for modules@.

    The PAUSE is Pretty Good, and it's mostly Not Broken.  The parts
that _are_ Broken get fixed (eventually).  AFAICT, PAUSE ID requests,
modulelist updates, feature requests, and bug reports aren't going to
/dev/null, although they are sometimes deemed Undeserving of Response,
and they often get queued up for a long time.

    IMNSHO, what would really improve the PAUSE in general (and module-
related issues in particular) would be more admins who understood more of
the system.  That's not intended as an insult to anyone; _I_ sure don't
understand the whole system (for example, I just now tried to find the
list of PAUSE admins, and I couldn't figure out where to get it!).

    What would be /great/ would be a PAUSE Administrators' Manual.  I
would maintain it if people would use it.
