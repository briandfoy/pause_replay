The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::EditableTable
  DSLIP:       cdpO2
  description: Generate HTML tables with a view/edit toggle
  userid:      AESPEN (Andy Espenscheid)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    the namespace HTML::EditableTable was posed to modules.perl.org a
    few months back and no obections were raised.

  similar:
    HTML::Table - We considered extending HTML::Table in the early
    stages of development, but we decided that implementing the key
    feature (view/edit mode toggling) was best handled in a new base
    class.

  rationale:

    This module was developed to abstract and standardize the handling
    of complex tabular data in engineering and business-process web
    applications. The EditableTable class is an "abstract" base class
    and EditableTable::Horizontal and EditableTable::Vertical are the
    implementations for two types of commonly used tables.

    Key features of these classes: * toggling of the table between view
    and edit modes with support for common widgets

    * uniquification of form element data to support processing of html
    form submissions of table data

    * support for rowspanning * methods to generate javascript for
    dynamic addition and remove of rows and commonly needed features
    such as 'click-to-expand' text display, calendar date entry, and
    table sorting

    * callback mechanism when you need further processing of the data
    prior to displaying it

    We feel the module is best placed in the HTML:: root, as it is
    targeted exclusively at web applications. We considered extending
    HTML::Table in the early stages of development, but we decided that
    implementing the key feature (view/edit mode toggling) was best
    handled in a new base class.

    We've used these classes in several engineering web applications at
    Freescale Semiconductor and have received permission to submit the
    code to CPAN

The resulting entry would be:
