The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Activator
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Activator Development Framework
  userid:      KNASSAR (Karim Nassar)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    creating sf project for hosting.

  similar:

  rationale:

    Activator Development Framework is an Object Oriented framework to
    ease creation of mulit-developer distributed mixed environment perl
    based software projects, especially Catalyst based websites.

    From the MOTIVATION section of the pod:

    * Provide a framework that makes it easy to do OO programming in
    Perl. * Create a centralized configuration that plays nice with
    other projects using the same framework. * Play extra nice with
    Catalyst, but provide framework for any Perl project. * Maintain a
    strong separation between the 3 parts of an MVC codebase. * Provide
    tools so that crons, command line tools, and web site code all play
    nice together. * Provide I18N that works across all aspects of a
    project. * Provide Database access that works across all aspects of
    a project. Optionally, force programmers to write SQL. * Allow
    multiple developers on the same or distributed machines to play nice
    together.

    Many of the constituent parts have counterparts on CPAN, however,
    Activators parts work together for an entire project in a mixed
    environment. Note that we stand on the shoulders of giants, as here
    are some of the modules we utilize extensively in our modules:

    * Log::Log4perl * Exception::Class * Email::Send * MIME::Lite *
    Template * Digest:: * Crypt::CBC * Class::StrongSingleton *
    YAML::Syck

    It currently provides cohesive database access, logging, exception
    handling, command line options processing, dictionary lookups for
    I18N, emailing capabilities, project registry, and a pagination
    assistant class. Planned modules include: wrapper for Maketext as an
    extension to Dictionary, a codesync script which allows multiple
    developers to copy their codebase remotely or locally and run
    multiple instances of multiple projects whenever and wherever they
    need, codebuild which will output the project codebase in a cpan,
    rpm, deb, or tarball format,

    Activator is inspired by and plays extra nice with Catalyst
    Framework (hence the name), and for the same reasons that Catalyst
    requires a rootlevel namespace, Activator does as well.

    The current release is the culmination of 2 years of experience and
    research into this topic, and is only 40% complete: I would like
    assistance/feedback from the community to build on the work that is
    already in a usable state, but needs more tools.

    Thank you for your consideration into my rootlevel namespace
    request.
