Hello bitbucket@perl.org, in a previous mail you wrote:

It is now MORE THAN TWO MONTHS ago that I sent my initial requests
for "Carp::Clan" and "Date::Calendar".

Poke, poke, poke... :-)

I used the PAUSE form for my initial requests.

Does the lack of responses mean lack of opinions?! ;-)

Both modules are part of Date::Calc 5.0 (already on CPAN).
"Carp::Clan" is also part of Bit::Vector 6.1 (already on CPAN).

I am subscribed to both of these lists, and have sent RFCs to them
regarding my two namespace requests, but also got no answers whatsoever
yet.

Many thanks in advance for your consideration!
