The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OpenOffice::OODoc
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: OpenOffice.org document processing
  userid:      JMGDOC (Jean-Marie Gouarné)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    oodoc-users@genicorp.fr

  similar:
    Apache::AxKit::Provider::OpenOffice OpenOffice::OOBuilder
    PBib::Document

  rationale:

    OpenOffice::OODoc is an object-oriented query interface providing
    hifh-level methods to retrieve, read, updtate or create simple or
    complex objects in any OpenOffice.org compliant document. It can
    deal not only with content objects (paragraphs, tables, item lists,
    footnotes, images...) but with presentation objects (styles). Its
    most usefulness is probably related to text (Writer) and spreadsheet
    (Calc) documents, but it can process any OOo content class (one can
    use it, say, to resize an image or to do a keyword-based search in a
    slideshow (Impress) document.

    It's pure perl, platform independant, and don't use the
    OpenOffice.org API; it works directly with the OpenOffice.org files,
    using XML::Twig and Archive::Zip.

    The root namespace (OpenOffice) was the most straightforward
    choice.

    The more questionable OODoc name comes from historical reasons. The
    initial project name was "Open Office Document Connector", so
    "OODoc", and a few companies used it privately with a "use OODoc"
    statement. When the module was open-sourced and came to CPAN, the
    OODoc root name was no longer free, and the OpenOffice one had
    appeared in the meantime. So, I opted for the laziest possible
    option and simply inserted "OpenOffice::" before "OODoc" (knowing
    that there is a lot of better possibilities, such as
    "OpenOffice::Connector", "OpenOffice::Query", etc...)

    Thanks for your comments
