The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Visio
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: mainpulating and creating Visio XML files
  userid:      AAKHTER (Aamer Akhter)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    open to suggestions

  similar:
    none with visio, but there are several that are related to writing
    excel files (Spreadheet::WriteExcel, inspired me to work on this in
    a way)

  rationale:

    I'm open to a new namspace, but not sure what that namespace would
    be. I've sent an email to modules@perl.org.

  enteredby:   AAKHTER (Aamer Akhter)
  enteredon:   Mon Feb  7 23:39:05 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Visio             adpOg mainpulating and creating Visio XML files    AAKHTER
