Hello

I am the co-maint of Text::BibTeX and all Text::BibTeX::*
(mostly, there is an exception, Text::BibTeX::BibStyle)

The primary maintainer (Greg Ward) is in the Python world for some years 
(since I took the co-maintainership).

Now, I want to add a co-mainainer (Philip Kime - PHILKIME), but I can't 
because I am *just* a co-maintainer.

Is there somebody that can help me with this? I really didn't want to 
bother Greg Ward (don't hear from him for years).

Thank you
Alberto
