Hello Neil, and whom else it concerns.

Thank you for doing this!

It has long bothered me that the PAUSE indexer treated example or demo modules 
as something to reserve namespace for, or they otherwise pollute lists of normal 
modules, or get treated as more significant than they actually are.

I actually have 2 legacy distributions that need this kind of index cleanup, and 
I will spell it out for you to help you deal with them.

First, regarding my legacy Locale-KeyedText distribution, all of the following 
modules (all examples/* files) should NOT be indexed or reserved; please remove 
all reservations on them:

     examples/inverter1/MyApp/L/Eng.pm
     examples/inverter1/MyApp/L/Fre.pm
     examples/inverter1/MyApp/L/Homer.pm
     examples/inverter1/MyLib.pm
     examples/inverter1/MyLib/L/Eng.pm
     examples/inverter1/MyLib/L/Fre.pm
     examples/inverter2/MyApp/L/Homer.pm
     examples/inverter2/MyLib.pm

Only the 2 lib/* modules should be indexed/reserved.

Second, regarding my legacy CGI-Portable distribution, all of the following 
modules (all demos/* files) should NOT be indexed or reserved; please remove all 
reservations on them:

     demos/animals/DemoAardvark.pm
     demos/animals/DemoCamel.pm
     demos/animals/DemoOwl.pm
     demos/animals/DemoPanda.pm
     demos/animals/DemoTiger.pm
     demos/frameset/DemoFrameSet.pm
     demos/image/DemoDrawImage.pm
     demos/smarthouse/DemoLM465.pm
     demos/smarthouse/DemoX10.pm

Only the 11 lib/* modules should be indexed/reserved.

Note that, despite having Demo in their name, the 5 lib/Demo*.pm modules SHOULD 
actually remain indexed/reserved, because they are actually as complete and 
production-useable as any of the other lib/* modules, and they get installed.

While I COULD rename those 5 say to lib/CGI/Portable/Demo/*.pm to clean up the 
global namespace, I'm disinclined at least from the perspective of that I 
consider my web-related distributions to be legacy, they work but aren't being 
updated anymore, so I prefer not to make a new release.

On the other hand, I could make a new release with that rename anyway for the 
sole purpose that it would help clean the CPAN global namespace.

Do you want me to do that?

On a separate matter, and a heads-up, I consider all of my distributions with 
"Rosetta" in their name to be obsolete and they will be replaced with ones 
having "Muldis" in their name, which are actively under development; but until 
the replacements arrive I have left the older ones up as placeholders of sorts 
and they should remain indexed.

Thank you.
