The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::iTMS
  DSLIP:       RdpOd
  description: Interaction with the iTunes Music Store
  userid:      TSIBLEY (Thomas R. Sibley)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    personal website under projects, possibly perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I chose the Net::* namespace because the iTunes Music Store (iTMS)
    is interacted with over the internet via HTTP and HTTPS requests.
    There are currently no other modules (known to me) that provide
    similar functionality. Net::iTMS and the related modules included
    deal with the encryption, decompressing, and extraction of data to
    provide a solid base for other developers to use.

  enteredby:   TSIBLEY (Thomas R. Sibley)
  enteredon:   Sun May  2 02:04:43 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::iTMS            RdpOd Interaction with the iTunes Music Store      TSIBLEY
