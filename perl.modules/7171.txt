Hi,

Recently I mailed Gisle Aas about his WWW::Chat module with some patches as I
needed to fix some bugs for it to work Inline::WebChat. He says that he
doesn't have time to maintain it any more so I offered to take over.

Is there anything I need to do to do this? I have uploaded a new version
already to my CPAN repository S/SI/SIMONW as webchat-0.5.tar.gz
