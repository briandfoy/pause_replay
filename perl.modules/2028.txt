There have been several cases recently where someone wanted to tend to a
seemingly orphaned module but couldn't raise the author. I'm quite certain
that noone is trying to usurp your module or be rude.

The problem arises when authors go missing, modules go unloved and people
make other modules which then obsolete the unloved modules and cause
confusion for people who aren't aware of these often undocumented changes.

A documented procedure of how one goes about breathing life back into
orphaned modules without having to reinvent the wheel would be a nice
thing.

In any event, I'm happy to see Net::Telnet back on the active list :)
