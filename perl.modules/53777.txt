The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       eBay::API
  DSLIP:       ampOd
  description: Perl SDK for eBay's public web services
  userid:      EBAY (Jeff Nokes)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://developer.ebay.com/,
    https://ebay-perl-api-sdk.codebase.ebay.com/

  similar:
    Net::eBay, WWW::Ebay

  rationale:

    This is an eBay internal library now being released to the public.
    It provides full access to the public facing web services provided
    by eBay Inc. It is the form of an "SDK", where certain features such
    as: auto-generation of classes and data-types; error/exception
    framework; logging framework; sync and async API calls, compression,
    retry capabilities, etc. There are similar (in concept) existing
    modules mentioned above in this PAUSE form (Net::eBay, WWW::Ebay),
    but neither is as extensive or feature rich as this. Plus, this SDK
    was developed internally by developers who extensively deal with the
    eBay API, and this library is in current use by eBay in a production
    environment. Even though we have choses an alpha release, it has
    been tested fairly extensively. Our hope is to have the Perl
    community who use this module, help contribute to its success by
    offering bugs, feature suggestions, patches, etc. via the bug
    repository, discussion board and mailing list tools available at
    http://developer.ebay.com or
    https://ebay-perl-api-sdk.codebase.ebay.com.

The resulting entry would be:

eBay::
::API             ampOd Perl SDK for eBay's public web services      EBAY
