     why:

    1, I have ported a BFGS function optimizer from Fortran to perl; as
    the only optimizer available on CPAN is the simplex (from the same
    Fortran source book), it might be of use for others. Math::BFGS
    (currently not oop)

    2, Currently, I finished the first version of an Evolution Strategy
    function optimizer; this approach is comparable to the more known
    Genetic Algorithms. Math::ES (oop)

    3, As I am a computational chemist, there might be some chemistry
    related modules to put on CPAN, mainly for parsing specific output
    files of certain programs. Of course, they do already exist, but had
    to cleaned up prior to publication.
