Interesting thought. The idea I've mostly implemented is that we
indeed use CPAN ids that act as group IDs. Most prominently requested
by Stas Bekman. In this model, the CPAN id "APML" of the apache
mailing list will be managed by a core group of people and they can
upload into the APML directory --or-- into their own directory while
there is no password for the APML user.

But this is just a technical idea. What worries me more is the legal
aspect of using alphabetical IDs. Maybe we have to switch to numerical
IDs. Or email addresses. I don't know in how many countries mere
numbers (for example 4711) are subject to name based legislation, but
I know it can be expensive to use names that you do not own in some
countries.
