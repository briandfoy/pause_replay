The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Telephony::ErlangB
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Erlang B functions for dimensioning
  userid:      POLETTIX (Flavio Poletti)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=455816; deserted in
    comp.lang.perl.(misc|modules)

  similar:
    None I'm aware of

  rationale:

    These are three math functions dealing with calculations useful for
    various aspects of telephony world. They are based upon the Erlang B
    block probability formula for a M/M/S/0/inf traffic model (in
    Kendall notation). So:

    * it's math - they're formulas to calculate numbers (probability,
    traffic intensity, number of needed servers/lines) * it's primarily
    used in Telecommunications/Telephony world, even if the model is
    more general and roots in the queue theory.

    At the moment, it has an ad-interim name TrafficModeling::ErlangB,
    but I'm ready to release version 0.02 and I can change name during
    the process.

  enteredby:   POLETTIX (Flavio Poletti)
  enteredon:   Wed May 11 22:46:03 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Telephony::
::ErlangB         bdpfp Erlang B functions for dimensioning          POLETTIX
