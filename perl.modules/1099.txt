Well, that would be generating lists for commercial sale.

Enforcability is always a thorny issue with software licenses,
espcially free software.  When all the smoke clears it comes down to
that I can't enforce it unless I caught someone red-handed (like if
for some reason I happened to find a commercial spamming program which
made use of my software).  The odds of that happening is, of course,
slim so I guess it boils down to just an academic concern.

Should I even release the module at all?  -I- need it for a valid
reason (for marking-up addresses in plain text), but would anyone else
need it for anything but spamming?
