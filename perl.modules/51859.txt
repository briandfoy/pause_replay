Hi Bernd,

I'm trying to track you down (bernd@widd.de and
bdulfer@cpan.org) regarding your CPAN modules:

Sybase::RepAgent
Sybase::TdsServer

I've made attempts before but am unsure whether you received the emails
or not.  I would like to either contribute to them or if you don't wish
to maintain them, I would be honored to take them off of your hands.

Please let me know

thanks

Jason L. Froebe
