Everybody can upload dev releases without asking. They do not get
indexed, no matter if they are maintainer or doing a fork.

Frankly, I do not really understand how RT works. I'm in many RT queues
that I cannot imagine how I came in there. There is some hidden gate I
don't know of.

I'd love to see improvement on that front. Neil Bowers has raised my
attention on the matter. I'm not sure if PAUSE needs to be involved for
this or if maybe a well organized metacpan or something could play a
strong role without having access to pause?
