Subject: Module submission NCBIx::BigFetch
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NCBIx::BigFetch
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Robustly manage very large NCBI searches
  userid:      ROGERHALL (Roger A Hall)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://bioinformatics.ualr.edu/

  similar:
    Bio::DB::EUtilities::efetch

  rationale:

    Since the module is an interface to the NCBI database only, the
    root namespace NCBIx was chosen to 1) clearly note the relationship
    between the module and the database and 2) to not assume ownership
    of the potential NCBI namespace should the agency choose to release
    their own branded software.

    The module is named BigFetch to emphasize that it was designed to
    *robustly* manage *very large* downloads (in the millions of
    sequences) that take multiple days to accomplish. Given the
    likelihood of network or server errors during that time, BigFetch is
    able to "pick up" the script and continue downloading after the last
    successful index.

    This module was used to download 11,550,000 sequences associated
    with a single query over eight days, intelligently recovering from
    numerous network interruptions and NCBI database failures.
    Enhancements are planned, but it is working very well as-is. It
    includes working scripts for total operation.

    This software was offered to the Bioperl project, but it does not
    fit in the current scheme, and has a different enough purpose to be
    released separately.

The resulting entry would be:

NCBIx::
