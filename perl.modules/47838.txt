I have three modules I am preparing to submit to CPAN, and I was hoping =
to get some input on the names.

The modules are:
1)  DBIx::Class::Simple - a simpler alternative to DBIx::Class, but =
alas, not compatible (not even a little bit).  It takes a collection of =
data structures that describe your tables, and turns it into a =
collection of classes that can be used to access them.  I'm also open to =
the name DBIx::Simple::Class or DBIx::Simple::Object

2)  WWW::Scraper::Zip4 - a simple web scraper to retrieve address =
information from the USPS website.

3)  Well, I'm currently calling it TemplateLoader, but that's too =
horrible for words.  Your provide some particulars on the module "use" =
line, and it creates a method in the calling class that loads the =
template.  Any suggestions for this one would definitely be appreciated.
