Only that the term "My" has a context more often used for things like 
testing classes and user customisations and various other unusual stuff 
that is not intended to be "official" modules.

It does get abused a little, but not that the My:: top-level is empty 
(other than accidental indexings).

Perhaps DBIx::UserPassword?
