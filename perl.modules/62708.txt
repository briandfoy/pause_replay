Welcome Bradley Dean,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

If this doesn't answer your questions, contact modules@perl.org.

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Matt S Trout:
Welcome to PAUSE! Please before you upload think carefully about the namespace for your new module - the name is often how people will discover and remember it and CPAN already has a common system of namespaces that people will use.

I actually rather like Die::Retry but it's not a "usual" top level namespace, so I wonder if Exception::Retry or Error::Retry might be better - if you're not sure, mail modules@perl.org and we'd be happy to help.
