Subject: Module submission Data::Password::Filter

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Password::Filter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Asses password quality and strength.
  userid:      MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Password::Entropy

  rationale:

    This module attempts to organize the code written by Christopher
    Frenz in one of his article,

    http://perl.sys-con.com/node/1911661

    I found couple of modules in CPAN that handles the password
    strength but doesn't cover everything. The article above has put
    together everything very nicely. I have got the written permission
    from the author Christopher Frenz to use it and convert it into a
    perl module so that other can benefit from his work.

    Christopher Frenz is the author of "Visual Basic and Visual Basic
    .NET for Scientists and Engineers" (Apress) and "Pro Perl Parsing"
    (Apress).

  enteredby:   MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 25 15:33:18 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Password::
::Filter          bdpOp Asses password quality and strength.         MANWAR
