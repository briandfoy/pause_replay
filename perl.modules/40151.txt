Hallo,

@ Thanx for your mail and time spent searching web for FXN (as time is our most valuable resource ~{:-)

@ You can not find any reference in the web as Fast XML Notation is defined and named by me.

@ The problem behind FXN is that XML bears a lot of redundant data (document structure and tags). The question was, if it were possible to reduce the amount of information in a document:
[1] using the same special characters as defined in the XML Standard;
[2] not touching the editorial structure of the document;
[3] making the 1:1 conversion on the fly (streaming) in both direction;
[4] preserving the human readability.  

@ The FXN reduces the amount of information close to the theoretical limit if human readability is required (starting tags + content). Documents are on average ¼ smaller (it depends on document style). 

@ You will hardly find any valuable information about this topic as there is a hard businesses dimension of the problem:
[1] Some start-ups with a lot of money work on XML hardware acceleration of XML transformation and transmission in The States. To my knowledge they use similar algorithms as FXN.
[2] Cellular phones/networks use WB-XML;
[3] Sun Fast Webservices try to address similar problem (http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/WebServices/fastWS/);
[4] XML::PYX is another trial in the Perl community.

@ The XML::FXN works as described in the module POD and above. The only improvement/change, I see in the future, are bugs if any.

Regards,
JWach
