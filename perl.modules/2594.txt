Hi.

Just a quick question to make sure I'm doing things properly...

A few days ago, I received notification that the Win32::ASP userid has
changed from MSERGEANT to WNODOM, and I just got the note from Matt Sergeant
telling me "it's all yours."  However, CPAN still lists the module under
Matt's PAUSE ID, and there are no distributions listed under mine.

So, the question: Does the system make the necessary changes behind the
scenes, and I just need to wait a little longer for it to catch up, or do I
need to take some further step to transfer Win32::ASP to my account?

Thanks,

Bill Odom (WNODOM)
