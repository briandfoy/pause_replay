GiGi Books LLC, a Children's Audio and Picture Book Publisher, Announces
2004 Children's Book Writing Contest.
Leesburg, Virginia, May 25, 2004 --  GiGi Books is looking for a few good
stories - and is willing to make them into audiobooks! The company
announces its 2004 Children's Book Writing Contest, where the grand prize
winner will walk away with a published story and $250. The story will be
adapted to audio as well.  Three additional winners will be chosen and
their books will also be published and adapted to audio.  Submissions must
be 400 words or less and received by August 1st, 2004.
"Our goal with this contest is to offer budding authors, both children and
adults, the opportunity to have their works published and promoted," stated
Gail Anderson, president of GiGi Books.   Additional details on the contest
can be found on the GiGi Books website, www.gigiaudiobooks.com.
GiGi Books help build reading skills, teach character-building values,
stimulate critical thinking and improve a child's auditory retention
skills.  Three of the GiGi Books audio stories, intended for ages 7 to 12,
and three of the audio with picture books, intended for ages 3 to 7, will
be featured on QVC in September 2004.
"I really enjoy listening to the stories with my kids while driving around
town," said customer Stacy Hockel of New Berlin, WI. "We laugh at the
characters and we have great discussions based upon the story lines.
Driving is much more fun!"  
Adds customer Becky Orcutt of Leesburg, VA, "We all know that our kids
shouldn't watch more than five hours of TV a week.  But what are the
alternatives?  GiGi Books has helped my kids cut down on their TV time.  My
daughter loves listening to them before she goes to bed at night."
