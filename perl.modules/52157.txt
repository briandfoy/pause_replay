Dear Jean-Marc,

your Archive::Rar module has various distribution problems such as not 
declaring its prerequisites. Fixes for these problems have been 
available from the CPAN Request Tracker for some time now (at least two 
months), but we have not heard anything from you in this regard. You can 
find the patches or rather distribution files ready to upload to PAUSE 
here: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=21971

If you would rather not continue to maintain the distribution, then 
please say so. I would then upload a fixed distribution to PAUSE on your 
behalf. You would have to make me a co-maintainer via the PAUSE 
interface for that to work. (My ID is SMUELLER.) I'm CCing the PAUSE 
admins for this reason.

Cheers,
Steffen
