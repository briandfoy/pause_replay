Hello Oliver,

I found an email from October 2001 asking about taking over ownership of
this module in the modules@perl.org archives. (I saved it because I had,
at one point, also tried to use the module and found it didn't work with
current bzlib, and the tests weren't really there.)

The email is available at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-10/msg00651.html
and there is a response by Elaine Ashton at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-10/msg00656.html
which I suggest you read.

> Is there any defined process for a module handover from him to me in CPAN?

I don't speak for modules@perl.org, but as I understand it, the easiest
way is to have AZEMGI login at https://pause.perl.org/ and transfer
ownership to your CPAN ID (by choosing "Edit Module Metadata", selecting
"Compress::Bzip2", changing "CPAN User-ID" from "AZEMGI" to "PSTADT",
and pressing "Update").

Failing that, I would suggest you email modules@perl.org with a copy of
an email from AZEMGI saying that he is handing ownership of the module
to you; they may be able to transfer the ownership by hand. (However,
this process may take a fairly long while, as you may be able to
imagine, since it involves manual intervention.) You may, of course,
redact details such as the email address or signature from the message
so that they will not be archived.

See also http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_maintain_module
(this URL is also referenced in Elaine's response to the October 2001
enquiry).

Please respond to modules@perl.org, not to me (though you may CC me if
you wish; in fact, I would appreciate it).

Cheers,
Philip
