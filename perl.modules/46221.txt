The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PGPLOT::Simple
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Simple Interface for PGPLOT
  userid:      FMERGES (Florian Merges)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    PGPLOT

  rationale:

    PGPLOT::Simple because it's a simple interface to the PGPLOT
    library through the module PGPLOT.

    Simple because you can easily create some graphs to know if the
    underlying library (PGPLOT) will be suitable for your needs.

    Simple because it keep you far from calling functions for each
    attributes settings like defining color, font, line_width, etc...
    but instead providing you with a simple and intuitive interface.

    And in the case that something is not implemented yet, but you
    need, you can access directly using the package name to the
    underlying PGPLOT library calls exported into the PGPLOT::Simple
    namespace. Or send a mail wishing this feature be implemented. The
    idea is to create abstractions for common things and letting the
    more advanced ones, and not so much used available this way, instead
    of directly implementing them... but is up to the users needs. I
    will ship it with the things I needed and thought it would be useful
    for others.

The resulting entry would be:

PGPLOT::
::Simple          adpfp Simple Interface for PGPLOT                  FMERGES
