Hi Steffen,
	Everytime I try to get an account from pause.perl.org I get a
	500 (internal server error). Also is it frowned upon if I keep
	a developmental version of the code on github? The reason I am
	doing this is because I am more comfortable merging in git.
	Also what is chromatic 's email and the hostmaster at perl.org
	's email?
Thanks for the help,
Kartik Thakore
