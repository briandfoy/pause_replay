The XML module list is now also integrated into the main module list.
I haven't heard back from Jonathan, so I used
  http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/XML/perl-xml-modules.html

With that the PAUSE database now shows exactly which namespaces has
been dealt with by a module list maintainer. Whatever is being missed
now is a real miss and should be added.

My plan for the next weeks is to hunt for the most important modules
from our own judgement. When we have reached ~2000 (current number of
registered modules is 1749), I think, I'd like to implement an "apply
for registration" form, so that modules@ gets mails with an URL to
confirm. You can trust me that I'll be professional enough to
implement it as a two click shopping system:-)
