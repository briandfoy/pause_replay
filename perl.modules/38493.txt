The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::GMOD
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Unified Generic Model Organism Database API
  userid:      TWH (Todd Harris)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Background: Bio::GMOD::* is a unified Perl interface to
    participating Model Organism Databases (MOD). MODs serve as a
    clearing house of biological data, housing a vast variety of data
    relating to widely-used experimental systems. This data includes
    genomic sequence, gene model predictions, experimental reagents,
    curated literature, and functional annotations.

    To promote software reuse, MODs have organized into the Generic
    Model Organism Database (GMOD) project which has given rise to a
    number of projects including a generic graphical genome browser, a
    generic schema for storing biological data, and a template-driven
    website system.

    Although each MOD may use distinct DBMSs, data models, and data
    mining protocols, they all confront similar issues - namely, how to
    store and present biological information of experiment model
    organism systems. The evolutionary relationships between model
    organisms -- and between the data housed in MODs -- is a central
    cornerstone of modern biology.

    Approach: Bio::GMOD::* seeks to further the GMOD project by
    providing a unified API across participating MODs. Bio::GMOD::* uses
    a strongly object-oriented adaptor based architecture that serves to
    insulate end users from differences in naming schemes, data mining
    protocols, and adjustments to data models. Core modules are
    generically subclassable in order to create custom solutions for
    different MODs. Among current features are facilities for
    updates/maintainence of remote installations and remote version
    checking. Features currently under development include cross-MOD
    querying and data fetching.

    Namespace rationale: Bio::GMOD is most appropriately associated
    with other biologically-related modules and hence does not require a
    new root-level namespace. Although many features of Bio::GMOD will
    be used by a small core group of MOD developers, the data mining
    facilities will be of general use to all biologists using
    computational approaches. For this reason, Bio::GMOD should be
    listed in the main module list.
