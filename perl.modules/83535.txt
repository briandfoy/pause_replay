The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::PrereqGrapher
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: generate dependency graph for perl source
  userid:      NEILB (Neil Bowers)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    See http://neilb.org/reviews/dependencies.html

  rationale:

    There are many modules for getting dependency information, and a
    few that can generate graphs.

    None of the PPI-based modules can produce graphs, so I created this
    module which uses Perl::PrereqScanner to recursively parse
    dependencies, and build up a graph using Graph::Easy.

    It will then save the dependency graph in one of five formats.

    As you'd expect from the namespace, the dist includes a script for
    invoking this functionality from the command-line.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::PrereqGrapher   bdpOp generate dependency graph for perl source    NEILB
