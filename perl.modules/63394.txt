Subject: Module submission BINF::IOSea::Fetch

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BINF::IOSea::Fetch
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Bioinformatics Software: NCBI keyword efetch
  userid:      ROGERHALL (Roger A Hall)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://bioinformatics.ualr.edu/, http://www.ourpug.org/

  similar:
    Bio::DB::EUtilities::efetch is similar but does not include relevant
    features

  rationale:

    A new root namespace is requested to cover all Bioinformatics
    projects not directly contributed by the Bioperl project. They own
    the root name "Bio". "BINF" seems appropriate.

    I also propse to *always* add a group name (mine is "IOSea") after
    the root to manage further collisions between similar contributions.

    BINF::IOSea::Fetch can ethically manage downloading millions of
    sequences from NCBI with batch and record recovery over days of
    restarts, and Bio::DB::EUtilities::efetch cannot.

    Again, my intention is to share the "BINF" namespace with any other
    Bioinformatics contributors. If I should also have ownership, I
    would expect to enforce a "group name" requirement.

    Thanks!

    Roger
