Dear Sirs:

I was looking for a reporting module with subtotals and not finding one, I thought I could write one and give a little back. I have seen, and am using, Number::Format. I also Formatter, which doesn't quite look like what I need. My module would would be a report formatter, but would be able to choose subtotal points, and what to show including averages, sums, others?

I will probably write it for my own use, but I would like to be a part of a CPAN/PAUSE so if there is any interest please let me know.

Thanks,
Michael
