Hi.

I propose a new module, Tree::Ternary_XS. There exists on CPAN (but
not on the modules list) a Tree::Ternary module by Mark Rogaski.
This moves most of the implementation into C, speeding up the code
by a factor of 50 and greatly reducing the memory needed.

I followed Text::CSV_XS and named my version Tree::Ternary_XS. I hope
this is the right thing to do.

Proposed module-list entry:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Ternary_XS     adcO  XS implementation of ternary search trees    LBROCARD

Other Blurb:

Tree::Ternary_XS is a Perl interface to a C implementation of ternary
search trees as described by Jon Bentley and Robert Sedgewick.
Ternary search trees are interesting data structures that provide a
means of storing and accessing strings. They combine the time
efficiency of digital tries with the space efficiency of binary search
trees. Unlike a hash, they also maintain information about relative
order.

It is currently available for further inspection at:
<URL:http://www.astray.com/Ternary/>.

This is my first XS module - it may be unportable in ways I can't yet
imagine.

TODO:

  o If this is reasonable, go ahead with the module-list entry
  o Get everyone to criticize my code

Cheers, Leon
