The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MGP::Preprocessor
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Preprocessor for Magicpoint presentations
  userid:      YUMPY (Tim Maher)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    SPUG, Seattle Perl Users Group

  similar:
    POE::Preprocessor

  rationale:

    Magicpoint, aka MGP after its file extension, provides a very basic
    platform for creating and delivering X11-based presentations. In
    doing so, it defines a small command language, which deals with
    fonts, colors, line-centering and filling, point sizes, and little
    else.

    But unlike the markup notations used in HTML or POD, there's no
    easy way to say embolden or italicize a word. Unlike troff, or
    include there's no way to say include another file at this point
    (although it *has* a %include directive, it's not for arbitrary
    use). Nor is there a general way to run an arbitrary series of
    commands and reap their output that works the way I want.

    Moreover, there's no way to define a particular heading style, and
    have it applied every time you refer to it. There's no way to say
    "whenever I tell you to slurp in a source-code file, expand its
    tabs, and render all its comments in a particular color and a
    particular font"

    There's no easy way to say "I want half-spacing for a while", or
    "skip the next 10 lines, and then start processing again. Or to say
    "show page numbers at the top of each line".

    Or any way to say "let me leave the %pause directives in my file,
    but ignore them this time so I can proofread the pages in one
    glance". Nor is there any way to say "this is a table, render it as
    one".

    Don't get me wrong, I'm very fond of Magicpoint. Especially because
    it's driven by a text file, that can easily be preprocessed. And if
    there was ever an application in dire need of a macro facility and
    preprocessor, this is the Mother of All Such applications.

    So what I've done is write a set of functions that can be used to
    implement a custom preprocessor that provides the features whose
    absence I lamented above (except the tables, which are still under
    development).

    This is all done behind the back of Magicpoint, which simply
    interprets and renders a *.mgp file as always.

    Some of the functions process new "directives", such as code% and
    include% (yep, mine have trailing %s, not leading ones, like MGP
    itself). Others provide support for the creation and application of
    macros, allowing the user to associate any angle-bracketed symbol
    with a series of native mgp-requests. For example,

    It's time to <BIG_AND_BOLD>Make Money Fast<REGULAR>, you gullible
    pauper.

    Or given an "undo" definition for BIG_AND_BOLD as <REGULAR>, the
    following is equivalent:

    It's time to <BIG_AND_BOLD Make Money Fast>, you gullible pauper.

    So that's what and idea of what I've got, and I think lots of
    people are going to want to use it.

    But I'm not sure what Namespace this module belongs in. It does
    have its own "markup language" (more troff-ish than anything else),
    so perhaps it belongs alongside HTML:: or PDF:: or XML:: at the root
    level.

    But it's such a wimpy markup language that it seems unlikely to
    become a standard, as HTML:: and even RTF:: have. But then again,
    one could say the same for POD, which definitely *has* caught on.
    Who knows, with the addition of this preprocessor, the MGP
    application might really corner the market, leading to a host of
    other MGP-related tools. Or not! 8-}

    Or perhaps it belongs in an application-extensions namespace, such
    as Applications::MGP::Preprocessor, next to
    Applications::StarOfficeImpress::Preprocessor, etc. But on that
    basis, people would be led to look for PDF::Whatever under
    Applications::Acrobat::PDF::Whatever, and fail to find it.

    And given my recent experience in tempting the Carpal Tunnel
    Syndrome gods via Shell::POSIX::Select, I'm currently down on
    three-part names. So my vote is for MGP::Preprocess. It's not
    taxonomically ideal, perhaps, but it parallels the precedents
    offered by all those modules under RTF::, HTML::, PDF::, and I think
    people will easily find it there.

    What do you folks think? (and *Simon*, please be nice 8-} )
