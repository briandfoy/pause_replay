     why:

    I have developed a library in Perl5
    (https://sourceforge.net/p/prelude-pl) and I'd like it to be
    something more than an art project, to share it with people and see
    it downloaded. It has some a few functions, like case or match, or
    show; the Tuple package that can hold one or more values, either
    delayed or strict; the Lazy package that marks functions aware of
    delayed Tuple arguments; and the List package, that defines lazy
    lists and implements approx. 90% of Haskell's PreludeList. Please
    don't label it "yet another". Perl is very sporty, you can try to
    make it look like whatever you'd like.
