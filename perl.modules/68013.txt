     why:

    SQLite_File : a module that emulates DB_File for hash and array
    ties, as well as the BDB API (get, put, seq, del, del_dup, find_dup,
    get_dup), but uses SQLite (via the self-contained DBD::SQLite)
    rather than (external) BDB as the underlying driver. SQLite_File is
    designed to be an AnyDBM_File option. SQLite_File::Importer :
    imports symbols emulating DB_File flags and INFO structures Thanks!!
