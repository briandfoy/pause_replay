I'm pretty sure you can't load a module on that line -- that's the
"Safe" compartment limitation to avoid PAUSE running arbitrary perl
code, which could cause a server compromise:

    our $VERSION = do { use Malicious::Hack; 1 };

If you've got IRC, jump onto irc.perl.org in the #toolchain channel
and ask for help there and someone (maybe me) will be able to give you
options for what to do.

My 2cents -- consider using a tool like the one bundled in
Perl::Version to set a version into all your modules at once instead
of trying to pick it up from a "main" module.  Or, just set the
version in your main module and leave the rest of them with an undef
version.

Regards,
David
