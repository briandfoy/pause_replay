Subject: Fwd: Perl CPAN distribution 'Text-Balanced'
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: steve.m.hay@googlemail.com (Steve Hay)

I'm looking to get a co-maint bit for Text-Balanced since the owner
(DMANURA) has not responded to any requests for a long time now (see
emails below). Is this the right place to ask?

I've also enquired whether either of the two existing co-maintainers
could roll out a new release. They both responded to email, but
neither has followed up with a release...

This module has been out of sync with what's in blead for a long time
now, and I'm primarily just looking to get that straightened out. I'm
unlikely to become an active maintainer of the module myself, but I
will happily roll out new releases with changes from blead.

My CPAN ID is SHAY.

Is there any way to get this moving?

I had the reply below from Adam, plus "I would be very happy if David
were to make Steve a co-maintainer. (Having given up control of the
module, I can't do so myself)." from Damian, but sadly no reply from
David, nor when I emailed him again individually a month or so later
(18 Oct 2013).

It sounds like only David could give me a co-maint bit, so if there is
still no reply from David then is there any chance that either of the
other two co-maintainers (Adam and Damian) could make a release?

Or is this a case of the Keepers of the PAUSE needing to step in if
the primary maintainer of a module (one that's in core at that!) still
doesn't reply?

Steve
