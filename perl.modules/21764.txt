Oh great gods of the namespace realm.  We, your humble servants of the DateTime Asylum, seek your infinite wisdom and guidance.  As simple serfs we only wish to plant our seeds of temporal knowledge into the fertile soil of the CPAN and have it flourish.  Alas - the realm is awash with vagabonds that may trample upon our fields and ruin our orthogonal namespace rows.  We bow before your mighty power and ask that you ordain our crops as holy and that you bestow upon us magical charms to protect us from the many evils that have been unpleased in these dark times of top level depravity.

Subject: namespaces, command and control

While writing some documentation for the DateTime project ( http://datetime.perl.org ) I seem to have brought up the question of namespace control.

This is the paragraph in question:

--
=head2 Namespace Allocation

C<DateTime::*> namespace is allocated by the C<datetime@perl.org> mailing list.  Do not create a new 2nd tier namespace without first seeking approval from the list.  Unless specifically noted as C<open> most 2nd tier namespaces are not available to 3rd party developers.
--

Currently we have modules in the DateTime namespace and more then a dozen 2nd tier namespaces.  Is it appropriate for us [the DateTime 'Asylum'] to be presuming some sort of control over the DateTime namespace?  Further, is it possible to seek control over a top level namespace?  I believe there is some president for this, for example DBI, but the issue does seem somewhat vague.  At least nothing of this nature seems to be officially ordained.

Any clarification would be appreciated.

Cheers,

-J
