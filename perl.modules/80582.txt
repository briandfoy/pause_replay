Subject: Module submission Graph::Writer::Cytoscape

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::Writer::Cytoscape
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Write a directed graph out as Cytoscape file
  userid:      HSUREN (Haktan Suren)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    NA

  similar:
    Graph::Writer

  rationale:

    Write a directed graph out as Cytoscape competible input file. It
    generates Network, edge and node files separately so it is
    compatible for Cytoscape. I allows you to visualize dot file in
    Cytoscape. It can be used as a converter as well.

  enteredby:   HSUREN (Haktan Suren)
  enteredon:   Wed May 16 04:54:40 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::Writer::
::Cytoscape       RdpOg Write a directed graph out as Cytoscape file HSUREN
