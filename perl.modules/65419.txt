Subject: Module submission Authen::NIST::RBAC

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::NIST::RBAC
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Role Based Access Control Authorization
  userid:      PEDWARDS (Peter Edwards)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Authen::RBAC

  rationale:

    The existing Authen::RBAC seems a relatively simple approach aimed
    at "authorization of a username, command and hostname triad".

    However, there is a standards based approach to RBAC as outlined in
    the NIST paper "Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Role Based
    Security" published in "ACM Transactions on Information and System
    Security", Vol. 4, No. 3, August 2001 by D.F.Ferraiolo et al.
    http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac/rbacSTD-ACM.pdf

    I have a written a module at the BBC that implements this approach
    and would like to release it to CPAN. For the namespace I propose
    "Authen::NIST::RBAC" or "Authorization::RBAC" to distinguish it from
    the existing Authen::RBAC.
