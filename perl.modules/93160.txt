Request to register new user

fullname: Brent Laabs
  userid: LABSTER
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: https://github.com/labster/
     why:

    Not planning to contribute right away, but I have some six or so
    Perl 6 modules that are going to end up on CPAN eventually. Might as
    well get this registration done now.

    And maybe eventually clean up my Perl 5 code for Mediawiki::Page
    enough to release it (a page object using Mediawiki::Bot).

    Honestly just submitting my request now because I saw my name in
    Perl Weekly without capital letters next to it, and I was all like,
    "awww".
