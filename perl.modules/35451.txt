I've created a list of namespace requests that my report generator
will ignore, which means I won't see them anymore.  I've annotated
my reason for ignoring the request.  If one of these requests belong
to you, we'll still discuss and think about it, but you have to bring
it up again or respond to the previous messages. :)
