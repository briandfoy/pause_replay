Hi Andreas, and the rest of the list....

I looked into it and it turns out that what I wanted is indeed trivial.  To 
be honest getting a user ID and the rest to submit it will be MUCH more work 
than writing it in the first place.  And you are correct about the setting 
of Hint bits and warning bits.  It looks like use warnings is autogenerated 
(perhaps from the perl source) so I just set up the import/unimport routines 
in caution.pm to call the respective routines in strict.pm and warnings.pm 
and presto... New pragma! Cool.

So anyway I am now off to the PAUSE site to see if I can figure out how to 
start submitting... (My mother always said I was crap at following 
instructions....)

Yeah I think so...  If it is the same as
    http://www.stadtplan.net/brd/hessen/frankfurt_am_main/
Or maybe they are the competition? Actually yours is a bit nicer. Also 
amusing is that the link you sent shows where I work..

Anyways, Andreas thanks for the support.
