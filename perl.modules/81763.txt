The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::BackupPlan
  DSLIP:       aapOp
  description: System backup plan, suitable for automation
  userid:      GCHIAIA (Gualtiero Chiaia)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The location under the App root namespace indicates that BackupPlan
    is meant as a tool that can be used to help a system admin, rather
    than a general purpose API. Its potential evolution as a tool might
    require better and more flexible front end, but it is not likely to
    become a framework. Even if other perl based backup modules exist, I
    am not aware of anything similar to manage a flexible backup plan
    across different directories, with different frequencies and
    retention policies. It is very easy to edit and modify.

  enteredon:   Sun Aug 12 21:43:45 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::BackupPlan      aapOp System backup plan, suitable for automation  GCHIAIA
