Subject: Module submission Devel::dbg

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::dbg
  DSLIP:       anpOg
  description: Enhanced Debugger for Perl
  userid:      LORDSPACE (Svetoslav Marinov)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://groups.google.com/group/perl-dbg

  similar:
    Devel::ptkdb

  rationale:

    Devel::dbg is a fork from unmaintained Devel::ptkdb since 2003.
    Devel::ptkdb Perl module has many features already implemented which
    will serve as a base for Devel::dbg. The future version of
    Devel::dbg will contain many improvements in GUI, Usability etc.
    Some of features are already implemented and waiting for the next
    release. Devel::dbg name is used because + the name is important to
    be short and easy to type. Example: Not Recommended: perl
    -d:very_long_debugger_name script.pl

    Suggested: perl -d:dbg script.pl

    + in future releases we plan to rewrite Devel::dbg to use other
    than Tk Library, so Tk (ptk) will not be appropriate in part of the
    name.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::dbg             anpOg Enhanced Debugger for Perl                   LORDSPACE
