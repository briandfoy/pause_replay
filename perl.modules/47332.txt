Subject: Naming advice for new pcAnywhere-profile module

Hello,
According to http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html , I am  
to ask your help in selecting a name for a module I wish to submit  
soon to CPAN.

 From the module's README:

	This module provides an interface for operations on Remote Host
	Connection Profile data files (CHF files) for Symantec's pcAnywhere
	product. This module is based on 'pcainfo' from Stephen J. Friedl.  
His work,
	which is in the public domain, has been modified to add encoding
	capabilities to allow creating CHFs.

The basis code is located at http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/pcainfo.html .

I need advice on how to name this module. I'm not sure what existing  
namespace it could fit; I was thinking of something new like  
'Symantec::PCAnywhere::Util::CHF' or similar. There would likely be  
several modules of this type, for manipulating different pcAnywhere  
files (including 'BHF' and 'CIF' formats).

I eagerly await your response. Thanks!
