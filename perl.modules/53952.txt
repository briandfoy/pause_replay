The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Syslog::Best
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Common syslog API
  userid:      DONEILL (David O'Neill)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    none yet

  similar:
    Sys::Syslog Unix::Syslog

  rationale:

    Sys::Syslog and Unix::Syslog don't share a common API, and
    frequently only one or the other will be available on a given
    system. This module provides a shim allowing either one to be used
    when present.

    Syslog::Best is what it's currently called in my tree, but it's
    likely not a great name as it would require a new rootlevel
    namespace. I'm happy to choose a more appropriate name, if someone
    can suggest a better one (Log::Syslog::Best? Log::Syslog::Common?)

  enteredby:   DONEILL (David O'Neill)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 12 22:04:43 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Syslog::
::Best            bdpfp Common syslog API                            DONEILL
