I've written a Diff.pm that uses MJD's Algorithm::Diff to
produce old-style, context, and unified diffs and am planning to send it
CPAN-ward, either on it's own or as part of Ned Konz's diff package.

I will also be writing a Patch.pm that can read (at first) unified diffs
and apply them.  I need these for the VCP package so it doesn't need to
rely on local system having unified diffs and patch available.  Also,
patch takes a crapper should a NUL sneak in to a file.
