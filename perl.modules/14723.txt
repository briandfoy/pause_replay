i don't think you should use Monte Carlo since you really aren't
sinmulating a system.  Monte Carlo simulations pick sensible random
values from a defined frequency distribution and apply those to 
part of a system.  your module would hopefully pick unsensible values
too, and i don't think you'll need the frequency distribution.

i also don't think most people will know what "Monte Carlo" means.

how about Test::RandomData or some such?
