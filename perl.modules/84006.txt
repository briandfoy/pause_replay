The Test::* namespace has a bit of a problem in that people now expect
the modules to do Test::Builder sorts of things. If you're doing
something completely different, the trick is to set your stuff apart
somehow.

However, before you go off to do a lot of work,  I'll point out that
this sounds like what I already do with Test::More subtests:

    use Test::More;

    subtest 'some_label' => sub {
        local *STDOUT = ...
        ...
        };

    done_testing();

If you still want a separate module, that's not a problem. Since I
don't have any ideas on a better name, if you still want the original
name, that's not a problem either.
