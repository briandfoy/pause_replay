Yes and no. You will notice that on http://search.cpan.org/~saper/=20
XSLoader-0.05/
XSLoader is listed under the heading Documentation. That is because =20
Search CPAN
found some pod. It is not listed as a module for the same reason a =20
PAUSE not
indexing it.

Adding a .pm file to your dist file that is not installed by Build.PL =20=

or Makefile.PL
(whichever you use) could be sufficient for PAUSE and Search to =20
locate a module. eg
XSLoader-0.05/fake/XSLoader.pm could just contain

package XSLoader;
$VERSION=3D0.05;

Personally I don't like overwriting. If you decide to add a SIGNATURE =20=

to your
dist and a test to validate it, then the test will fail
