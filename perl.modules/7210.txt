Admins see an additional menu on PAUSE.

mysql> select * from grouptable where ugroup='admin';
+-------+--------+
| user  | ugroup |
+-------+--------+
| ABH   | admin  |
| ANDK  | admin  |
| DOUGM | admin  |
| GBARR | admin  |
| JHI   | admin  |
| JONO  | admin  |

In the menu you can ignore everything except

    Add a User or Mailinglist
and
    Register a Module

At the bottom of emails coming from namespace submissions you find two
links that let you confirm the submission. From that moment the module
is in the database and finds its way into the indexes. So a few hours
later people see the module via CPAN.pm with a DESCRIPTION entry (no
matter if the thing is uploaded already or not).

Producing the module list itself is still a manual operation that I
have to do. It's not very much work, really. The hard work is
answering difficult submissions on the list.
