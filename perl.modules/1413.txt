G'day PAUSE people,

	I was hoping that I could register myself to use PAUSE.  As
requested by www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html, here's a bit of
information about myself:

	Name:		Paul Jamieson Fenwick
	E-mail: 	pjf@schools.net.au
	Homepage:	None.
	Preferred UID:	PJF || PFENWICK

	At the present time I am planning to contribute a module to
CPAN called Finance::Quote, which provides a simple interface to
fetch a variety of stock-quotes (including NYSE, European and Australian
stocks) over the Internet.

	The Finance::Quote package is derived from the Quote package
used in GnuCash <http://www.gnucash.org>.  I've recently updated the
package to provide support for Australian stocks and have contacted
the other authors of the Quote package to see if they have any objections
to a CPAN release (so far everyone's been happy).

	A DLSI entry for this module would be:

Name            DSLI  Description                        
--------------  ----  ------------------------------------
Finance::Quote  bdpf  Fetch stock prices over the Internet  

	Although the f has a good chance of turning into either an O or
an h -- I've become quite fond of perl's OO features.

	As for public discussion of the module, there hasn't been a great
deal yet.  GnuCash certainly makes use of it, as will myself and some of
my collegues.  If desired I can release the source through other channels
(Freshmeat, etc) to see what the public opinion is like.

	Best wishes,

		Paul
