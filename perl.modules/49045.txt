The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Xmldoom
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Object persistance framework.
  userid:      DSNOPEK (David Snopek)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Mailing list, GNU Arch repository

  similar:
    Jifty::DBI Object::Mediator Oryx DBIx::Objects SLOOPS

  rationale:

    A root level namespace was choosen mostly to match the Python API,
    of which this code is originally a port.

    The name is supposedly an acronym for XML Database Object-Oriented
    Model. I know the name isn't great, but I have been using it since
    the projects first release in 2002 and it has stuck with me.

    It is my opinion that it should have a top-level namespace because
    I intend to port this to as many programming languages as possible,
    and match the interfaces as closely as possible. Currently, it is
    available for Python, Javascript, and Perl.

  enteredon:   Fri May 26 16:02:34 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Xmldoom           bdpOg Object persistance framework.                DSNOPEK
