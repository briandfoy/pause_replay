We would like to have module WordNet::SenseRelate deleted. Nothing has
been released under this name.

Since proposing this module, we have decided to split it into two
modules (WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords, and
WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord).

We already have WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords available, and will be
proposing WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord shortly.

Thank you,
Ted
