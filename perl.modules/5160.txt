    I think there is a reason for it.  Each file on PAUSE is uploaded by
*a* person who's ultimately responsible for it.  You don't have that with
files `owned' by a list -- you've thrown away the information of who did
the upload.  Also, it's not too rare that a list to dissolves, but the last
person who left the list doesn't know that they're the last one to leave.
This makes it even harder to pick up dropped packages.
