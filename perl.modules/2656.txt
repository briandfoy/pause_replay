I would like to register on CPAN as a developer.

Name:        Michael Fross
email:       frossm@yahoo.com
homepage:    http://fross.org
CPAN ID:     FROSTY

I plan on contributing modules and scripts to the repository.  Currently I
am working on a Win32 interface to the Microsoft Speech Recognition SDK.
Win32::Speech will be my first module contributed.  It is still in early
development stages and I have not yet brought it to comp.lang.perl.modules.
As a question, I have limited access to usenet.  Do you know of a web
interface or 'digest' format that can be used.

DLSI for this module would be:  cdpO

I look forward to hearing from you.

Frosty
