Hi,

a question about a module that is not mine, but that I use a lot: 
Text::BibTeX.

CPAN has versions 0.34 available (and 0.33 too, I think) but only 0.31 
is indexed (so, cpan installs 0.31).

The question is: why is not the 0.34 version indexed? Can you help me 
finding why? (so I can contact the author and ask him to fix that issue)

Thanks
Kind Regards,
ambs

Much as I hate to say it, the Computer Science view of language design
has gotten too inbred in recent years. The Computer Scientists should
pay more attention to the Linguists, who have a much better handle on
how people prefer to communicate.
