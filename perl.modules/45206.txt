It's a bug in your packaging. All your directories have a permission
of 666 which means that the indexer can untar your distribution but
cannot read the files.

I'd recommend, you use 'make dist' and 'make disttest' to distribute
your modules.

I apologize that the indexer is not smart enough to write a proper
report to you. On first sight a fix to that end seems to involve quite
a view parts of the code, so I must defer such a fix....
