The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MMDS
  DSLIP:       Mdphp
  description: Minimal Markup Document System
  userid:      JV (Johan Vromans)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    N/A

  similar:

  rationale:

    MMDS is a powerful text transformation system. Using plain text as
    input, it can be used to produce professionally typeset documents in
    PostScript and PDF using the LaTeX typesetting system. With the same
    input, it can also produce HTML for web pages, presentation slides,
    and more. MMDS differs from other tools in that it tries to infer
    the desired markup from the document, instead of requiring the user
    to insert all kinds of cryptic instructions.

    MMDS is a major revision of the Squirrel Document System, a.k.a.
    mh_doc, that I wrote in 1993-1995. It has been in production since
    then, but was never released to the public.

    MMDS has been reworked to the Perl5 modules model, and is mostly
    plugin based. Additional input formats (e.g., POD, XML) can be added
    seamlessly, and output formats (e.g., XML, OOo) as well. It is
    envisioned that several modules will be added to the MMDS::
    hierarchy in the near future.

    For (some) more information:
    http://www.squirrel.nl/mmds/intro/index.html.

The resulting entry would be:

MMDS              Mdphp Minimal Markup Document System               JV
