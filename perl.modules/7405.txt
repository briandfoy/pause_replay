Subject: Test::Cmd subclass module?

I have a new version (1.05) of the Test::Cmd module ready in a package
that includes an additional, new Test::Cmd::Common module.  The
Test::Cmd::Common subclass is a wrapper that provides some common
exception-handling routines, useful for most normal command testing.

I was just about to upload it to CPAN, when I realized that I didn't
know if being the maintainer of Test::Cmd gave me the authority to
create new subsidiary modules in its namespace, or if I needed run it by
modules@perl.org first.  So I figured I'd play it safe and check.

If I don't hear any objections in the next day or so, I'll go ahead and
upload.  Thanks.
