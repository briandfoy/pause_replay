I've written a small package for communicating with weather
stations of the WS-23xx line by La Crosse Technologies.

Factors in my decision to name it Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx

   * There is an existing Device::Davis package for the (much)
     higher-end weather stations manufactured by Davis Instruments.

   * There also exists Device::WS2000::IO but I'm pretty sure
     it is not related to the La Crosse units.  In any case,
     I think it's important to include the manufacturer name
     in the module for differentiation.

   * The La Crosse 23xx line (2300, 2308, 2315, 2316, ...others...)
     all seem to share the same serial line protocol, but the
     35xx line does not.  My module should be usable on
     existing (and future?) WS-23xx products, but will
     not work on other series.

Any better suggestions for a name?  Is WS23xx too clunky?  I
considered and rejected Ws23xx (yuk), WS2300 (too specific: not
obvious that 2308/2316/etc are the same), Ws2300.  I also
considered the Weather:: namespace.

Thanks in advance,
Ed
