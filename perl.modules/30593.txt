     why:

    A small Kerberos password verification module. There is one module
    on CPAN currently that attempts to perform this function:
    Authen-Krb5-Simple-0.31, but does so incompletely because it doesn't
    verify the authenticity of the response from the Kerberos server. I
    have a small module that has been used in production at Penn for a
    number of years which I'd like to contribute to the archive.
