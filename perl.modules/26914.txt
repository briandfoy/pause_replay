Howdy,

   I've recently written a module that subclasses Net::SMTP, 
implementing the XMRG, XDFN and XPRT commands that IronPort uses for 
their SMTP extension IronPort Mail Merge (IPMM).

   I was originally thinking that since it is an SMTP extension that 
adds a couple of commands to Net::SMTP that the correct namespace would 
be Net::SMTP::IPMM.  After taking another look at 
http://cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html I couldn't help but wonder 
if IronPort::IPMM may be the right place for the module.

   The documentation is still pretty lacking, and there are no tests yet 
(I won't be uploading this to the CPAN until that is fixed) but the code 
is available here:  http://plusthree.com/dug/IPMM/

   Any thoughts on where this should go?

Thanks,

   -- Douglas
