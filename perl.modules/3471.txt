Just three days since the Sub:: namespace has been officially
introduced:-/

Dave, in your first note

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-07/msg00222.html

you say, this "is a completely stupid think" and now you decide to
write separate modules for Subs, Scalars, Arrays and Hashes? I regret
I didn't hear your talk, apparently I'm missing something.

My thinking is (I wouldn't mind being correted here): if you have good
approximate matching code, talk about its merits, compare it to
others, like Match::Approx or IR techniques and make it a module or
three, no? You instead say nothing about the matching code and create
namespaces for each and every entity that can be matched
approximately. This seems backwards to me. Feel free to just send me
your talk if it answers my qualms.

Have you ever looked at Devel::Symdump? How does your GlobWalk differ?
