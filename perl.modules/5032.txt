Hello, I would like to request comments on an EventCountFile module I 
released on CPAN last year in regards to what would be a good name 
for it and whether it should be registered.

CGI::WPM::EventCountFile - Perl module that interfaces to a 
tab-delimited text file for storing date-bounded counts of occurances 
for multiple events, such as web page views.

This essentially does a smarter version of those common hit counter files.

You can see the module at 
"http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=EventCountFile", and 
its temporary full name is CGI::WPM::EventCountFile, which I want to 
change.  Or its complete POD page is at 
"http://search.cpan.org/doc/DUNCAND/CGI-WebsiteGenerator-0.35/EventCountFile.pm".

This is probably one of my oldest modules and I feel that it is going 
to waste unless it is registered.

I am hoping for feedback soon before making a formal request.

Thank you,

// Darren Duncan
