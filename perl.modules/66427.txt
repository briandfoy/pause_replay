Quick guess about what's going on because I cannot look deeper right
now: Although the indexer accepted the item, the other part that
writes the 02packages file makes some sanity check and expects the
filename to be Anarch.pm when the package is called App::Anarch.

Not sure if this is the problem and what needs fixing but it seems
that PAUSE is at least partly right.

Let me know what you think. In any case I'll give it more thought in
the evening.
