The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::Maketext::Gettext
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Bridge between GNU gettext and Maketext
  userid:      IMACAT (依瑪貓)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Locale::Maketext Locale::Maketext::Lexicon

  rationale:

    I write this module simply because I need to use GNU gettext
    lexicon files from Locale::Maketext, and Locale::Maketext::Lexicon
    is not working. Locale::Maketext lacks the full lexicon management
    tools that GNU gettext has. Locale::Maketext::Lexicon tries to seal
    this gap, but it is not working. It is not platform independent,
    either, since it uses msgunfmt from GNU gettext, and msgunfmt is not
    available on non-GNU systems. Locale::Maketext::Gettext is a
    replacement of Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. It dedicates itself to
    bridge GNU gettext to Locale::Maketext, with almost the same way of
    working. It is working, simple, and it is a lot faster than
    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. In the future I would like to implement
    some sort of smart encoding conversion, like what GNU gettext does
    now, to make it a smarter wrapper to the Locale::Maketext class.

The resulting entry would be:

Locale::Maketext::
::Gettext         RdpOp Bridge between GNU gettext and Maketext      IMACAT
