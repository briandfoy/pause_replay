It seems that part of the problem was, after I split 'Rosetta.pm' into
itself and 'Documentation.pod', I had maintained an identical 'Name' line
at the top of both files of 'Rosetta - framework for ...'.

Graham explained that the CPAN Search indexer, upon finding two files with
identical 'Name', was listing only one, and defaulted to using
'Rosetta.pm' for POD extraction and conversion to HTML.

What I changed was that I renamed the file 'Documentation.pod' to
'Framework.pod', and I changed the first line of that file to
'Rosetta::Framework - main documentation ...'.  Also, I put the POD file
into lib/Rosetta/ instead of having it at the distribution root dir.

I suspect that the changing of the 'Name' line was all that was actually
needed by the indexer, and the other changes were just good ideas, which
also made the file arrangement more 'standard'.  But following standards
is still good as it makes it easier for people to find what they want.
