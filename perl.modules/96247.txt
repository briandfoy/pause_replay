Hi Alexey,

In July I emailed you:
> I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving =
conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.
>=20
> You have ownership of the =E2=80=9CText=E2=80=9D namespace, which is =
used for the Text package which is defined and used within your =
Business::OnlinePayment::SurePay module. This now clashes with the TEXT =
module, which is owned by user SHERZODR.
>=20
> To resolve this conflict, the easiest change would be to rename the =
package from =E2=80=9CText=E2=80=9D to =
Business::OnlinePayment::SurePay::Text, which is the usual way to name =
internal packages.
>=20
> Or there is another option: I noticed that this module doesn=E2=80=99t =
work on any version of Perl released in roughly the last 15 years:

http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=3DBusiness-OnlinePayment-SurePay+0.01

your permissions on the relevant namespaces.

Would you be happy to do one of these, or for me to do one of them on =
your behalf?

Regards,
Neil
