Subject: Module submission Freedesktop::Trash

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Freedesktop::Trash
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: The Freedesktop.org "Trash Can" standard
  userid:      RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    module-authors list

  similar:
    Trash::Park, File::Remove

  rationale:

    There is no module that implements the Freedesktop.org trash
    specification.

    One nice thing about the spec is that it's platform independent. It
    can be implemented on any system, even a console system (since it
    specifies where trashed files are stored, and not a visual
    interface).

    It also means that when Perl modules which make use of it to trash
    files, other applications which support the standard can "untrash"
    these files.

    One it is implemented, drivers for File::Remove will be added.

    Trash::Park implements it's own standard.

The resulting entry would be:

Freedesktop::
::Trash           cdpOp The Freedesktop.org "Trash Can" standard     RRWO
