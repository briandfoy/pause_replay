     why:

    Kinosearch is a search engine library, optimized for search-time
    performance with large datasets. It supports phrase matching,
    boolean queries of arbitrary depth, stemming, excerpting, sorting by
    either date or relevance, and more. The core functions are
    language-independent and agnostic with regards to encoding;
    provisions have been made to facilitate extension to an arbitrary
    number of languages. The ranking algorithm uses the classic Term
    Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF).
