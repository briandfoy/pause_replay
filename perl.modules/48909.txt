The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Romani
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Helps handle differences in SQL dialects.
  userid:      DSNOPEK (David Snopek)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailing list, GNU Arch repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    DBIx::Romani is an database interface that helps handle the
    differences between SQL dialects in an object-oriented way. Its
    design was inspired by Creole (for PHP) and some aspects (the few
    good ones) of JDBC. Its is a layer over DBI, hence appropriately
    belongs in the DBIx:: namespace.

  enteredby:   DSNOPEK (David Snopek)
  enteredon:   Fri May 19 16:35:11 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Romani          bdpOg Helps handle differences in SQL dialects.    DSNOPEK
