The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::AuthCookieLDAP
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: An AuthCookie module for LDAP authentication
  userid:      KSOLOMKO (Kirill Solomko)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    not discussed publicity yet but will be discussed freely anywhere in
    mailinglists, chatrooms, forums, etc.

  similar:
    Apache2::AuthCookieDBI, Apache::AuthCookieLDAP

  rationale:

    I needed a module for LDAP authentication, for one of my projects
    and I did not find any for just simple authentication, without any
    extra sql database usage for tickets/cookies storage and also with
    Apache2 support.

    Apache::AuthCookieLDAP is for Apache 1.x + not supported/obsolete
    in my humble opinion and also there is a nice module
    Apache2::AuthCookieDBI with similar functionality but that one for
    DB auth, therefore, I think that it might be useful for people using
    Apache 2 and willing a simple and efficient AuthCookie based way for
    LDAP database auth.

    The module has similar variables and usage as
    Apache::AuthCookieLDAP/Apache2::AuthCookieDBI so to keep it the
    common way. Optionally if you are using pam_ldap and do not want to
    spread bindpw the module reads /etc/pam_ldap.conf (configurable via
    "YourAuth"_PAMLDAP variable).

    Also I am about to support and improve it once uploaded (feature
    requests from the community, etc.).

    Yours faithfully, Kirill
