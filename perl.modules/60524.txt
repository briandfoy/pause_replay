Thanks brian!  App::SweeperBot it is.  ;)

I'm currently using pp to build a stand-alone Windows .exe file which can be 
run without perl (or anything else) having been installed.  The resulting 
.exe is 6.6MB in size, which is rather large[1], but I'd love to include it 
in the dist.

Would including the .exe be considered an abuse of CPAN or cause any other 
issues?  If so, then I can arrange for alternate hosting for people who just 
want their machines to play minesweeper without worrying about installing Perl.

[1] It includes a bunch of screen capturing and image manipulation libraries.
