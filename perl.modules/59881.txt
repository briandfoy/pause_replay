The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Atlassian::Jira
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Interface to the Jira issue tracker
  userid:      DBARTLE (David Bartle)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    WWW::Bugzilla

  rationale:

    My original choice was WWW::Jira. Here is why I'm leaning toward
    WWW::Atlassian::Jira

    I have plans to create modules for other products under the
    Atlassian (atlassian.com) umbrella.

    Some of their product lines such as "Crowd" and "Bamboo" are such
    generic names that I feel that the further namespace qualification
    of "Atlassian" is warranted for disambiguation.

    Let me know what you think.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Atlassian::
::Jira            adpOg Interface to the Jira issue tracker          DBARTLE
