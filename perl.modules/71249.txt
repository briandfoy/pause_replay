I disagree. According the the description, VirtualBox would be a good
choice for the namespace.

W.r.t. the already existing VirtualBox::Manage: my suggestion is to
just ignore it. It is moose based anyway, pulling in an awful lot of
dependencies for no real purpose. It is in no way holding a lock on
the namespace. It's not even registered ;).

So Matthew, provide your own VirtualBox:: modules and if they're
useful people will find and use them.
