The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Search::Indexer
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: fulltext indexing library
  userid:      DAMI (Laurent Dami)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Plucene Search::Kinosearch Search::FreeText Search::InvertedIndex

  rationale:

    Search::FreeText and Search::InvertedIndex are simple, compact
    indexers, but limited in functionality. Search::Indexer was
    developed for the Justice Department at Geneva ; we use it for
    indexing collections of judgements. It supports boolean
    combinations, phrase queries, etc. Not quite as sophisticated as
    Plucene, but still approaching it in functionality ... and in a more
    "perlish" way (Plucene's design comes from the Java world and takes
    little advantage of Perl's strong points, like regexes, closures,
    etc.). No deep tests have been done yet, but Search::Indexer seems
    to be 3 to 4 times faster than Plucene.

  enteredby:   DAMI (Laurent Dami)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun 11 22:30:32 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Search::
::Indexer         RdpOp fulltext indexing library                    DAMI
