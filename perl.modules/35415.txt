If it's OK with you, can we go with BBC?  It'll be less hassle for both
of us than setting up a second PAUSE account for every member of the
team.

Thanks for being so helpful.  Hopefully our first "pilot" module will
see the light of day very soon and the others waiting in the wings can
join it before long.

John.

I think we can make an exception in this case.  We don't like it, but we
don't always get our way.  You've tried to work within PAUSE precendent
and it just hasn't worked for you for reasons neither of us control.

So, in this case, tell us what you want and I or someone else will
approve them.  BBC or BBCKENT are fine in this case.

Sorry for the hassle, and thanks for your understanding.
