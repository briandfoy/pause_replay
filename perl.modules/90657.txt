Hi Ron,
Yes, TJC is Toby (J) Corkindale.

I could change the module name, but there's quite a few things
depending upon the old versions of the names, so would prefer to keep
them somehow.
I'm not familiar enough to know if CPAN (and the cpan/cpanp/cpanm
tools) will work if I publish a module that contains both versions in
the same package?

ie Test-PostgreSQL contains PostgreSQL.pm as well as postgresql.pm,
and one of those packages just inherits from the other.

PS. I'm in Melbourne too; perhaps you would have met me while I was
running the local Perlmonger meetings for a while?

Toby

Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world
