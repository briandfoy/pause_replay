The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::JCL
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Job Control Library for Data Management Task
  userid:      BADKINS (Brad Adkins)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    COLLABORATE08, IOUG Conference, April 15, 2008

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Provide a suite of standard functions that can be shared across all
    batch job scripts used to support database back end tasks. Provide a
    standardized approach for the development of all back end database
    job scripts. Centralize the administration and access to
    configuration data. Enforce coding standards and documentation.
    Abstract the sql used to support back end processes from the task
    processing logic, by placing all sqlinto an sql library. This will
    make maintenance of back end sql a trivial task. Provide generalized
    logging, notification, and system information functions.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
