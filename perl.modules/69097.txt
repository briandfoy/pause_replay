I've already sent email directly to the owner at multiple addresses, and 
posted my intention to take over the module on the datetime list. The most 
recent datetime@perl.org post is here - 
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.datetime/2009/12/msg7464.html

The earliest is 
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.datetime/2009/12/msg7409.html

My earliest private emails to him go back to October 12.

I know the author read the datetime@perl.org list at one time, so I can't 
think of a better public forum with which to contact him.

It'd be nice to get a little leeway here since I've been the nominal lead 
of the Perl DateTime Project since it started, and the module I want to 
take over is blocking the release of other work I have pending. If the 
author pops up again I'm happy to give him the module back. I don't even 
_want_ it, it's just in my way.
