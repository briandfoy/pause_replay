 The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you=2E

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction=2E If you are interested=2C please reply immediately via the private email address below=2E
Upon your response=2C I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand=2E Please observe utmost confidentiality=2C and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country=2E
