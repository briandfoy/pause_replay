Hi Brian -

Thanks for the advice.

Unfortunately the Postgres namespace is already used by a module that =
hasn't
been supported in 7 years.   I am concerned that if we publish under the
Postgres root namespace that users will confuse the independent module I
have written as a sub-class of the unrelated Postgres module.

The top level Pg is unused, but there is no "root" super-class to go =
with
it.   I do not feel that our module is appropriate for such a generic
high-level class name.=20

Maybe a root Pg.pm super-class needs to be created that is just a simple
shell?  But who should create that, and what should be in it?   To be =
truly
useful as a top-level Postgres "catch-all" class it should be an empty =
class
shell.   Then our module would become something like Pg::Handler.  That
would open the door to other modules being put in that root namespace =
like
PG-Simple becoming Pg::Simple, etc.

Postgres things should probably go in a Postgres::* top
level namespace (although Pg::* would probably work, but
isn't as telling).

If you have an extension to DBI, you can put it into DBIx::*
