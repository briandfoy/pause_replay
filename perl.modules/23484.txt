The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AI::Pathfinding::AStar
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: A* Pathfinding Algorithm
  userid:      ACDALTON (Aaron Dalton)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I was originally going to put it in Games::Pathfinding but thought
    it could possibly be more generally useful so moved it to AI. I
    couldn't find a similar module anywhere else in CPAN so I decided to
    upload what I came up with. This is my very first attempt at a CPAN
    contribution so any feedback is appreciated. Thank you for your
    time.

The resulting entry would be:

AI::Pathfinding::
::AStar           adpfp A* Pathfinding Algorithm                     ACDALTON
