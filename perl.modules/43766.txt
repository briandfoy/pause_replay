Subject: Module submission CGI::Ajax

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Ajax
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Export perl methods to javascript for AJAX
  userid:      BCT (Brian C. Thomas)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://pjax.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    CGI::Perljax

  rationale:

    We are the authors of "CGI::Perljax" and would like to change it's
    name to "CGI::Ajax". We think this name is better suited for our
    module. We originally developed this code under the name "Perljax",
    but then when we submitted to CPAN/PAUSE, we wanted to place it
    under CGI, and that's how it came by its current name.

    We plan to expire the CGI::Perljax name if our name change request
    is granted.

    Sincerely,

    Brian Thomas (BCT) and Brent Pedersen (BPEDERSE)

    -- original CGI::Perljax rationale below... Perljax provides a
    unique mechanism to access server-side perl code asynchronously from
    javascript using the AJAX design. Perljax unburdens the user from
    having to write any javascript, except for having to associate an
    exported method with a document-defined event (such as onClick,
    onKeyUp, etc). Only in the more advanced implementations of an
    exported perl method would a user need to write any javascript.
    Perljax supports methods that return single results, or multiple
    results to the web page. No other projects that we know of are like
    Perljax for the following reasons: 1. Perljax is targeted
    specifically for perl development. 2. Perljax shields the user from
    having to write any javascript at all (unless they want to). 3. The
    URL for the HTTP GET request is automatically generated based on
    HTML layout and events, and the page is then dynamically updated. 4.
    Perljax is not part of a Content Management System, or some other
    larger project. The specific namespace we think fits best under
    "CGI::", since any use of Perljax will be in a perl CGI script (or
    from mod_perl).

The resulting entry would be:
