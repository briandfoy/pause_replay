This is a good idea, but I fear that the Tk::Program name is somewhat
too vague and may be misleading. When I read the name, I thought it
was a Tk tutorial...

OTOH, I know that finding a good name for a swiss army knife widget is
very hard ...

Looks like you widget is a kind of craddle to hook a user's program in
it. As you say a main window with better features.

So here are other possibilities:

Tk::MenuOptionWindow     (not so bad)
Tk::MenuOptionMainWindow (long but fits better)
Tk::MenuOptionTopLevel   (might be misleading)

Any other idea ?

Cheers
