Palm::KeyRing belongs to the group of Palm::* modules that deal with
Palm database files. It should/could have been part of p5-Palm.

The KeyRing utility is a PalmOS tool. From the web site
(http://keyring.sourceforge.net): 

  a note on naming

  This is not an official GNU program. The original name gnukeyring
  was chosen in 1999 as a token of thanks to the many people who've
  contributed to the body of free software.

  The Free Software Foundation has a policy that software bearing the
  ``GNU'' brand should, amongst other things, run on at least one free
  computer system. PalmOS, though a fine technical achievement, is not
  free.

  As a result, this application has changed its name to Keyring for
  PalmOS to make this clearer.

Despite this, "GNU KeyRing" is still a common name for this tool.
