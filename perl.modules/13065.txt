The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Debug::FaultAutoBT
  DSLIP:       adhOa
  description: Automatic Backtrace Extractor on SIG Faults
  userid:      STAS (Stas Bekman)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Devel::CoreStack

  rationale:

    When a signal, that normally causes a coredump, is delivered This
    module attempts to automatically extract a backtrace, rather than
    letting the core file be dumped. This has the following benefits:

    * no need to setup the environment to allow core file dumped.
    Sometimes people just don't know how to set it up. Sometimes you
    aren't allowed to set it up (e.g., when the webserver environment is
    not under your control).

    * if many Perl programs are run in a row and more than one program
    segfaults it's possible to collect all backtraces, rathen then
    aborting the run on the first segfault or staying with only the last
    core file, which will overwrite all the previous ones. For example
    consider a live webserver or a test suite which may segfault many
    times for different reasons.

    * for huge core files, this approach saves disk space. And can be a
    saver when you don't have disk space left for various reasons
    (passed the quota?), but still have a few kilo-bytes left.

    Devel::CoreStack tries to do the same but requires a core file,
    which is sometimes hard or impossible to get. My module attempts to
    achieve the same without any extra work.

    ---

    I've used the root Debug:: namespace instead of Devel::, since this
    module is really for the end users not developers. We (developers)
    want users to send us backtraces when they get segfaults. Users
    shouldn't be intimidated by the Devel:: root namespace. I hope this
    is a good reason for opening a new root namespace for this

The resulting entry would be:

Debug::
::FaultAutoBT     adhOa Automatic Backtrace Extractor on SIG Faults  STAS
