modules@perl.org is subscribed to by people who work with modules and the
CPAN a lot, and is often consulted by module authors when some sort of
problem or conflict arises.  Normally, in cases like this, the members of
the list just serve an advisory role, which can be helpful since the list
members have been around awhile and often have a lot of perspective of the
issues involved.

It just so happens that in this case, I am on the modules@perl.org list,
and my module is one of the ones in discussion here.  :-)

I mentioned to Sander that I have some experimental OOP support for
MP3::Info in place; I've also mentioned before that I would like to have
greater support for ID3v2, but don't have time to do it myself.  I'd really
like to have it, though, and my thought was to take the MPEG::ID3v2 module
and use it to give MP3::Info the support it needs.  I've been holding back
because it is incomplete, because it needs perl 5.005 (and I want this to
continue to work on MacPerl, which is stuck at 5.004 for the time being
:-), and because I've been too busy.

All that said, I'd like to see MP3::Info support whatever might need
supporting.  Perhaps we can set up a list (I already have one at
SourceForge that could be used,
http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mp3-info-discuss) and we can
discuss what our technical requirements are, what interfaces we want, and
how we can merge the existing codebases together to achieve it all.
