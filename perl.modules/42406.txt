The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PHP::Interpreter
  DSLIP:       RmcOa
  description: Tightly integrated PHP interpereter
  userid:      GSCHLOSS (George Schlossnagle)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    devel@lists.bricolage.cc

  similar:
    PHP

  rationale:

    This module differs from PHP in that it provides a much tighter and
    transparent integration with PHP, as well as the native ability for
    PHP to call back up into it's controlling Perl interpreter. Every
    effort was made to make certain that Perl data passed into PHP
    appear as native types, and similarly that PHP data passed back into
    Perl appear as Perl native types. In contrast, the PHP module
    provides one way integration (Perl calling into PHP), does not
    support multiple or long-running interpreters, and wraps even
    simple, compatible types in opaque wrappers.

The resulting entry would be:

PHP::
