Brian,

Thank you for your comment.

brian> half-good modules. :)

Win32::MIDI and Win32::MIDI::API (Win32API::MIDI) has differnt job.
Win32::MIDI::API is a direct (one-to-one) interface with Microsoft
Windows MIDI API.  But Win32::MIDI provides higher level API.  The
current implementation has its own XS code.  High level API requres
less coding for most purpose.  But low level API is mandatory on some
situations.  Even Win32::MIDI can use Win32::MIDI::API instead of the
XS code.  We can see this kind of hierarchy on many Perl modules.

We are working to make two good modules:-)
