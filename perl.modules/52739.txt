The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PerlIO::via::Logger
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: A PerlIO layer suited for use in log systems
  userid:      AKAPLAN (Adam Kaplan)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::trivial log::info

  rationale:

    There are literally dozens of Logging modules on CPAN. This is not
    one of them. Nearly all of the logging modules suffer from being
    either extremely complicated or highly specialized. Also, all of
    them were created to deal with the "last mile" of messages. As the
    name implies, this module is just an IO layer for formatting log
    messages as they pass through Perl's IO system.

    I required something simple, fast and elegant. This module gives me
    all three. In fact, you can so something as simple as loading this
    module and then passing *STDOUT to the convienant logify function.
    After that, all output via "print" in your program would be prefixed
    with the current day/time (or another prefix if one is optionally
    supplied).

The resulting entry would be:

PerlIO::via::
