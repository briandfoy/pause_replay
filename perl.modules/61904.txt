The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       sh2p
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Convert UNIX sh scripts to perl
  userid:      CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=577182

  similar:
    Not aware of any.

  rationale:

    This is a program not a module: apologies if this is not the
    correct place. This program and associated modules are for taking
    the tedium out of the conversion process from shell (sh, ksh88,
    bash, early ksh93) to Perl. It will not rewrite the script to be
    more efficient. I had taken a decision to drop the project because
    most scripts were written poorly and were no better once converted
    to Perl (many were worse). Knowing those limitations I am
    registering the namespace because I continue to have people asking
    for whatever code I have written, even though it is not yet
    complete. There is a genuine need for such a tool out there, however
    misguided that may be! (see the perlmonks reference)

The resulting entry would be:

sh2p              cdphp Convert UNIX sh scripts to perl              CLIVE
