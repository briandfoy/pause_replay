     why:

    I have written written several utility/administration modules that
    are front ends on 3rd party applications. Most are related to
    enterprise monitoring applications (BMC Patrol, AlarmPoint, SCOM
    2007) and deal with giving easy access to config files and
    input/output to/from executables. I want to get a few of the ones I
    find useful into CPAN.
