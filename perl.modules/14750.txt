Tassilo is becoming the guy that says "No worries, brian will do it" :)

i don't know what the problem has been. i have some concerns:

   there is already a Crypt::TEA, so i suggest working with that author
   or extending his module

   CGI::Htauth makes me nervous.  based on just the documentation
   the system doesn not seem secure, although that seems to be your
   intent.  Htauth has a different meaning for most people, too, since
   the apache ht* files use another scheme.  i might register this
   under a different name if the security issues could be worked out.

   Term::Clui needs a better name, i think

   I've registered Math::Evol.



what actually happens when you "register a namespace" is:

   * PAUSE send a message to modules@perl.org
   * maybe one of the admins registers it right away, or maybe
   they have questions
   * if they have questions, you respond to those on modules@perl.org
   * an admin registers it, or it fades away

typically things only happen if one of the admins makes a positive
decision about the module.  since we're a loose collective, no one
is really pushing for decisions on all of the module submissions.
sometimes no one steps forward with anything to say and it slips
through the cracks.
