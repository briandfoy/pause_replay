I have a large personal class library with approx. 150 classes,
1200 Methods and 200 Functions. It is a closed library
with classes for very different purposes (HTML generation,
database access, image manipulation etc.)
I don't know if it is of value to anyone but I want to put
selected parts of the library on CPAN. I think it's best
to leave the code in it's own namespace. At this level I can't
be precise about the purpose. The classes are documented separatly.
If someone wants to use any functionality from the
library he writes

  use S1;

  # ...instantiate objects, call methods, call functions...
  # (the needed packages are loaded automatically)

Ok, thank you.
