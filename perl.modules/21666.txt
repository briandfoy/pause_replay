The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::Damn
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: 'unbless' Perl objects
  userid:      IBB (Ian Brayshaw)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Perl let's you "bless" references, but not "unbless" them.
    Acme::Damn provides a single method "damn" that unblesses (or damns)
    a Perl object, returning the original, unblessed reference.

    I can't think of any reason why you'd want to do this, but that
    doesn't mean that you shouldn't be able to.

  enteredby:   IBB (Ian Brayshaw)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun  9 19:48:39 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Acme::
::Damn            Rdcfp 'unbless' Perl objects                       IBB
