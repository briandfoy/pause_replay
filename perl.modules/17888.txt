>Hi, and thanks for mailing modules@perl.org.   This is an automated
>response to your email.
>
>We get lots of mail, and sometimes it takes us a while to get to yours.
>Please be patient, we *will* try and respond as soon as we can gather
>enough tuits.
>
>In the meantime, here are some pointers which may help you find your
>answer, along with some hints for making your modules@perl.org
>experience easier.
>
>modules@perl.org has several roles:
>
>1. creating PAUSE accounts
>2. keeping the CPAN module list updated
>3. responding to enquiries about modules and especially module naming
>
>If you mailed us about getting a PAUSE account
>----------------------------------------------
>It will probably be set up in the next few days.  You will receive email
>notifying you when your account has been created.  In the meantime, read
>the PAUSE documentation at:
> http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about
>
>If you mailed us to register a module namespace
>-----------------------------------------------
>This may take up to a week.  If you haven't received email confirming
>your namespace registration by then, please poke us (gently).
>
>You can make it easier for us next time by using the namespace request
>form on PAUSE; this gives us your request in a standard format with
>links we can just click on to approve it.
>
>If we have problems or comments with your proposed namespace, we'll
>respond within a week with our opinions.  Note that you can still upload
>a module before we approve the namespace -- it just won't appear in the
>official modules list, and we may ask you to change the name before
>we'll list it there.
>
>In the meantime, or for next time, we recommend you discuss your
>proposed namespace with any appropriate mailing lists or other fora of
>Perl developers.  Some of these include:
>
>Places to post your ideas etc (general):
> comp.lang.perl.modules
> module-authors-subscribe@perl.org
>
>Places to discuss specific types of modules:
> datetime-subscribe@perl.org  (Date::* and Time::*)
> dbi-users-subscribe@perl.org (DBI::*, DBIx::*)
> macperl-modules-subscribe@perl.org (MacOS::*)
>        perl-crypto-subscribe@perl.org (Crypt::*)
> perl-qa-subscribe@perl.org (Test::*)
>        (...)
>        (check http://lists.perl.org/ for a full list of Perl lists)
>
>Another good idea is to look back through the modules@perl.org archive,
>at http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/, and see if we've
>dealt with a similar issue before.
>
>If you had a general module-related enquiry
>-------------------------------------------
>We'll try to get back to you within a week.  If we don't, and the
>resources listed below don't help you find your answer, please prod us
>(gently).
>
>If your enquiry was related to module naming, the resources listed in
>the above section will probably be useful to you.
>
>If you want to know if anyone's written a module similar to one you're
>thinking of writing, check http://search.cpan.org/ and search for as
>many relevant keywords as you can think of.
>
>If you're writing a module for the first time and want advice, read the
>perlnewmod manpage, at http://perldoc.com/perl5.6.1/pod/perlnewmod.html
>or "perldoc perlnewmod".
>
>If you need help installing Perl modules, read the perlmodinstall
>manpage, at http://perldoc.com/perl5.6.1/pod/perlmodinstall.html or
>"perldoc perlmodinstall".
>
>If your email was unrelated to Perl modules
>-------------------------------------------
>Sorry, wrong address.  Don't expect a response.
