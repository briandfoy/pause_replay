The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chess
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Manipulate and Validate a chess board
  userid:      BJR (Brian Richardson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Perl-Chess mailing list @ Yahoo!Groups

  similar:
    Meta::Chess

  rationale:

    There are currently 3 people who are working on things chess
    related. A mailing list has been opened, and further CPAN
    development on things Chess is expected in the next while. Chess is
    a large enough that it warrants its own namespace, especially since
    there is already 3 levels of nesting (cf. Chess::Piece::Pawn), and
    there is no existing namespace that really describes chess very
    well.

The resulting entry would be:

Chess             adpOg Manipulate and Validate a chess board        BJR
