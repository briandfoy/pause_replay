I've uploaded Digest::LineByLine in the file LineByLine-1.0.tar.gz. This 
module
has been discussed on sci.crypt and comp.lang.perl.modules. I've also 
incorporated
some helpful comments from Gisle Aas, who is the maintainer of Digest.
This is my first time submitting a CPAN module, so please let me know if 
I've
committed any gaffes ... :-)
