     why:

    You *might* know me because of my work on pp_sort.c in the core,
    but let's assume otherwise. I have a module for controlling access
    to a pool of resources (logins on remote machines, processors on a
    multi-processor system, whatever), where the pool may shrink or grow
    over time (new logins added, processors unavailable during prime
    hours).

    Processes are assigned a resource if one is available, and will
    block (or not), if none are. Resources are returned automatically
    (using semaphores) if a process dies before returning them
    explicitly. A logging mechanism records resource use.

    I have found the module useful, and think others might, too.

    I'll have to get approval for release from AT&T, so nothing will
    happen soon, but I gather registration isn't instantaneous, either.
    I've been calling the module AccessControl.pm, but I'm open to
    better names and suggestions for where to file it. -- jpl
