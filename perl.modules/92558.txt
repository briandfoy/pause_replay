     why:

    My participation in the 2015 CPAN PR Challenge has inspired me to
    actively contribute in a broader fashion and is helping me to
    understand the process to correctly contribute to it.

    Most immediately will be modules relating to little known/used
    filesystem/storage attributes like Solaris UFS attributes
    (recursive/multi-dimensional storage, OSX's several independent
    attribute systems), etc. Lack of awareness or tools can impede
    security scans and cause operational issues.

    My general contributions would be ones which support Infrastructure
    Administration (Systems Administration, Database Administration,
    Network Engineering, Storage Engineeering, and Security).

    Unfortunatly, I believe none of my existing code can be submitted
    to CPAN at this time.
