Subject: Module submission Music::Chord::Namer
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Music::Chord::Namer
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: You give it notes, it names the chord.
  userid:      JIMI (Jimi-Carlo Bukowski-Wills)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    newsgroups (comp.lang.perl.modules)

  similar:
    Music::Image::Chord is the only other module that has anything to do
    with chords at the moment. These two could be combined in a nice
    app!

  rationale:

    This module should be listed because it's the only one that does
    anything like this. In fact, currently, only one module is listed
    when you search CPAN modules with the keyword "Chord". This module
    clearly belongs in the Music toplevel! I asked on c.l.p.modules
    about namespaces and got the very good idea that perhaps, one day,
    more chord modules will arrive and so they should be placed into the
    Music::Chord namespace. My module exports (on request) a sub that
    names chords, so I call it Namer.

  enteredby:   JIMI (Jimi-Carlo Bukowski-Wills)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 14 20:22:51 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Music::Chord::
::Namer           adpfp You give it notes, it names the chord.       JIMI
