The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::JumbleCreator
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Create and solve Jumble word games
  userid:      DSPARLING (Douglas Sparling)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    None that I'm aware of.

  rationale:

    I've recently had to create Jumble word games and didn't find any
    module on CPAN to do this, so I've uploaded my simple Jumble
    creator.

    I've also considered naming the module Games::Jumble, but this
    module only builds and solves jumbles, it's not the actual game
    itself. All opinions gladly accepted.

  enteredon:   Fri Mar 29 21:25:54 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::JumbleCreator   RdpOp Create and solve Jumble word games           DSPARLING
