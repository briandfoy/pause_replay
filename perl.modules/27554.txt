The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Match::Smart
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: best guess matching of two scalars
  userid:      DANBOO (Daniel B. Boorstein)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    none

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is all about matching, making 'Match::' the obvious
    root namespace. Because it matches in whatever way seems appropriate
    it doesn't fit in the 'Regexp::' root.

    Since the term "smart matching" has already become common in the
    perl 6 design, 'Match' and 'Smart' seemed like appropriate terms to
    use in the module name. Since there are already 'Smart' modules such
    as 'XML::Smart' and 'Tree::Smart', it seemed to reinforce using
    'Match' first and 'Smart' second. Hence 'Match::Smart'.

    And though it does draw heavily from Apocalypse 4, it makes no
    attempt to mirror perl 6 syntax, making 'Perl6::' inappropriate.

  enteredby:   DANBOO (Daniel B. Boorstein)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb  3 02:47:11 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Match::
::Smart           bdpfp best guess matching of two scalars           DANBOO
