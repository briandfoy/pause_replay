Thanks for the very concise description what this module does. What
about

   Widget::FixedWidthFont::Input

or something like that. See, how I pull that name out of your
description: if something's still missing to make the name really
descriptive, please extend on that.

You indicated that a bit vaguely, so I went ahead. You can always
discard that namespace by changing the field "Lifecycle" in the PAUSE
interface "Edit Module Metadata".
