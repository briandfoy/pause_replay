Subject: ANN: Version 2.29 of Perl module XML::Parser released
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: coopercc@netheaven.com (Clark Cooper)


I've uploaded Version 2.29 of XML::Parser to CPAN.

This is a maintenance release.

Here's the relevant part of the Changes log:

2.29 Sun May 21 21:19:45 EDT 2000
  - In expat, notation declaration handler registration wasn't
    surviving through external entity references.
  - Chase Tingley <tingley@sundell.net> discovered that text
    accumulation in the Stream style wasn't working across processing
    instructions and recommended the appropriate fix.
  - Jochen Wiedmann <jochen.wiedmann@softwareag.com>, noted that
    you couldn't use ExpatNB directly because it wasn't setting
    the protective _State_ variable. Now doing this in the
    parse_more method of ExpatNB.
  - At the suggestion of Grant Hopwood <hopwoodg@valero.com>, now
    calling the env_proxy method on the LWP::UserAgent in the LWP
    external entity handler when it's created to set any proxies
    from environment variables.
  - Grant McLean, Matt Sergeant (& others I may have missed) noted that
    loading the LWP & URI modules slowed startup of the module, even
    if the application didn't need it. The default LWP handler is now
    dynamicly loaded (along with LWP & URI modules) the first time an
    external entity is referenced. Also provided a NoLWP option to
    XML::Parser that forces the file based external entity handler.
  - Fixed allocation errors in element declaration patches in expat
  - The Expat base method now works, even before expat starts parsing.
  - Changed the canonical script to take an optional file argument.
  - Enno Derksen <enno@att.com> reported that the attlist handler
    was not returning NOTATION type attlist information.
  - Michel Rodriguez <mrodrigu@ieee.org>, noted that the constructor
    for XML::Parser objects no longer checked for the existence of
    applications installed external entity handlers before installing
    the default ones.
  - Burkhard Meier <burkhard.meier@ixos.de> sent in a fix for
    compiler directives in Expat/Makefile.PL for Win32 machines.
    A change in 5.6.0 caused the old conditional to fail.
  - Forgot to document changes to the Entity declaration handler:
    there is an additional "IsParam" argument that indicates whether
    or not the entity is a parameter entity. This information is
    no longer passed on in the name.
  - Ben Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au> reported an undefined macro with
    version 5.004_04.
