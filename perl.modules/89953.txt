Hi -

I am about to upload my very first submission of code to PAUSE, having
already obtained an account with the id EXW, but am a bit confused about
the email redirect. Unfortunately, I cannot find any FAQ which provides an
answer (probably because it is so obvious...except to me).   Anyway, my
secret/private email address is exwinston@gmail.com, and this is what I
have entered into the %User section of ~/.dzil/config.ini.  On the other
hand, the 'author' line in my dist.ini is equal to  Elliot Winston <
exw@cpan.org>.  So far, this makes sense to me.  To test the redirect, I
sent a test email to exw@cpan.org, expecting to get it delivered to
exwinston@gmail.com., but it doesn't.  Either my PAUSE account settings are
incorrect, or I am not understanding something simple.  I would like to get
this straightened out before my submission.  Any hints you can send my way
will be appreciated.  Thank you.

-       EXW
