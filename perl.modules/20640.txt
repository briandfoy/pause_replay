The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Z3950::AsyncZ
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Asynchronous interface for Net::Z3950
  userid:      TURNERMM (Myron Turner)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Net::Z3950 mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ adds a layer of asynchronous support for the
    Net::Z3950 module through the use of multiple forked processes. This
    approach enables it to handle queries to a large numbers of servers
    in a single session. While asynchronous access is theoretically
    possible with Net:Z3950, Net:Z3950 presents difficulties in
    practice. Net::Z3950::AsyncZ also deals with the problems presented
    by Z39.50 servers that fail to respond properly and therefore cause
    Net::Z3950 to hang.

    Users will also find that it provides a useful front end to
    Net::Z3950, by providing convenient facilities to process and format
    Z39.50 records.

    I announced Net::Z3950::AsyncZ on the Net::Z3950 mailing list, and
    it is currently in use; it has received support from Mike Taylor,
    author of Net:Z3950, who asked me to include it under Net::Z3950.

  enteredon:   Wed Apr 23 23:25:59 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Z3950::
::AsyncZ          RmpOp Asynchronous interface for Net::Z3950        TURNERMM
