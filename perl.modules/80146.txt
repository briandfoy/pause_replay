Subject: Module submission Data::Walk::Print

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Walk::Print
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A way to say what should be removed
  userid:      JANDREW (Jed Lund)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jandrew/Data-Walk-Extracted

  similar:
    YAML Data::Dumper

  rationale:

    This is really just a demonstration module for
    Data::Walk::Extracted. Since the data walker does no action on it's
    own it needs a Role to implement functionality. The value of
    registering the name is to allow developers who want to use the
    Data::Walk::Extracted to have some pre-built Moose::Role choices for
    examples and implementation.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Walk::
::Print           bdpOp A way to say what should be removed          JANDREW
