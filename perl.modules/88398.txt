     why:

    I have worked for many years in Perl and used CPAN on many
    occasions. I mainly develop in Perl for a Billing System called
    Singl.eView Convergent Billing and have a number of modules that I
    have written which are useful to that area. I have also started to
    develop more generic modules that are useful outside if the
    Singl.eView community which I would like to start sharing with
    others.
