Hello,

I am frantically looking for a Perl Module called CGIP.  It is supposed to
have the functionality of CGI::Request among other things.  Since I do not
have the option to install the concurrent version system on my ISP=B9s server
but can upload CPAN Modules I am hoping to find this module.  When
accesseing the Perl and CPAN Websites or when accessing CPAN though my shel=
l
The computer is looking for the Module CGIP but can=B9t locate it because the
author does not seen to have been entered correctly or something like this.

Do you have any idea if this module actually exists and where I could get a
copy of it?

Thank you
