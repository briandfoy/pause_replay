 would like to merge it in/make it the official Win32::API on CPAN=2C tell =
me your plan.

I haven't heard from you since my last post a month ago. I've submitted a p=
ull request ( https://github.com/cosimo/perl5-win32-api/pulls?direction=3Dd=
esc&page=3D1&sort=3Dcreated&state=3Dopen ) to you github a month ago=2C but=
 there was no response to date. I am requesting that you either incorporate=
 my changes and make a new CPAN release=2C or give me COMAINT on Win32::API=
 (PAUSE ID is BULKDD). I am also forwarding this message to modules@perl.or=
g.
