Hi Peter,

sorry for the delay in answering.

It's not easy to find a good place for that. Something with "SystemTray" 
or "TrayIcon" in the name seems appropriate, but I'm not sure where to 
put it since typically this kind of thing is put into the namespace of 
the implementation - such as Gtk2::TrayIcon. A similar thing is 
"Printer" which is an interface to various, OS dependent methods of 
printing.

 From your description, I can't really tell how much your module really 
does (set the icon and hover text only?). Some suggestions:

SystemTray::Applet
SystemTray::Icon

and the implementation specific submodules would naturally go into 
namespaces below that such as:

SystemTray::Applet::Win32
SystemTray::Applet::Gnome
etc.

I'm not fond of creating a new top-level namespace for this, but I can't 
think of a better fit.

Any suggestions from other modules people?

Best regards,
Steffen
