The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::BellmanFord
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Implements the BellmanFord algorithm
  userid:      ROHANK (Rohan Kachewar)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The reason I choose Algorithms namespace, [this namespace is
    already available], is because the module I have developed is
    Bellman Ford algorithm implemented using perl. I dont know wether
    other bellman ford algorithm is available on cpan, however some
    graph algorithms I saw, the addition of nodes is very complicated
    and so is adding weights. My algorithm is flexible and takes input
    from user defined input file and prints the output to a user defined
    output file.

  enteredby:   ROHANK (Rohan Kachewar)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug  2 18:00:01 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::BellmanFord     bdpfp Implements the BellmanFord algorithm         ROHANK
