This shouldn't be in Win32:: that's for sure.
There are several samba related modules in several places. File::Samba, 
Filesys::SmbClient, Filesys::SmbClientParser, ...
The latter might actually do something very similar to what you plan to 
do. If you were implementing any part of the smb protocol itself, I'd 
say use Net::SMB or so. But that's not the case, so I'd suggest 
something similar to the precedents. Anyhow, here are a couple of 
suggestions. No guarantee they'll be approved by the module list 
maintainers.

File::SMBClient
Filesys::SMBClient
Parse::SMBClient

Or possibly better:
File::SMB::Client
Filesys::SMB::Client
Parse::SMB::Client

Alternatively, it might be warranted to create an SMB top level 
namespace, but only if there will be significantly more modules. This is 
unlikely to be approved.

SMB::Client::Parser etc
