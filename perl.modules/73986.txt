The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::DecisionTree
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Decision-tree based classification of data
  userid:      AVIKAK (Avinash Kak)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    mailinglists, newsgroups

  similar:
    AI::DecisionTree

  rationale:

    The Algorithm::DecisionTree is a full-blown implementation of the
    class entropy-based approach to decision tree construction.

    From the standpoint of its practical usefulness, the module
    generates all applicable class labels for a new data sample if so
    warranted by the amount of information (and its nature) in the
    training data set. In other words, if the class distributions are
    overlapping in the underlying feature space, the decision tree
    classifier will show you all the class lables for a datapoint that
    falls in the overlap region.

    The implementation is designed to work with large datasets and has
    an interface that I believe is convenient to use for diskfile based
    training datasets. In other words, the implmentation is NOT a toy
    example. The implementation also includes facilities for creating
    large training datasets to experiment with decision-tree based
    approach to data classification.

The resulting entry would be:
