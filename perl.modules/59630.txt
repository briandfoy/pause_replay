Hi,

I'm like to upload a module for writing simple system tray applets but 
I'm not sure what to call it.  The basic idea is the script provides a 
callback which sets the applets icon and hover text and the module does
the rest. Windows (using Win32::GUI) and Gnome (using Gtk2::TrayIcon)
will both be supported. 

Any suggestions about what to call the module and the desktop specific
modules?

Thanks
Peter
