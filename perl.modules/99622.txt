Hi Rob,

I'm not sure, I could imagine the parser tripped over these lines:

 : $VERSION='1.1.3-3';
 : our $VERSION = '1.1.3-3';

Could you try to use legal perl version numbers? It might help. You
apparently had success with Amazon::Credentials, but there you
experimented with

 : $VERSION = '1.0.6-4'; $VERSION=~s/\-.*$//;

Seems to be legal enough. Better yet, in Amazon::EC2 you had success
with a good old boring stress free version number:

 : our $VERSION = '1.0.1';

I'd say, this might be the way to go.

Should you continue to have problems, please ask again, maybe we can
then spot the error better, when the version weirdness is out of the
way.

Good luck,
-- 
andreas
