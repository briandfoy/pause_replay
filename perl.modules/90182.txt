Hi, Priyal.

Once files are uploaded to CPAN, they are immutable.  You have to
upload a new distribution with edited files to CPAN.

You seem to have a lot of questions and modules@perl.org is not a
general help forum.  Please take your future questions to any of these
places:

    * Perl Monks: http://perlmonks.com/
    * StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl
    * Perl beginners mailing list: http://learn.perl.org/faq/beginners.html
    * IRC: irc.perl.org channel #perl-help

Any of those places will be able to help you further.

Regards,
David
