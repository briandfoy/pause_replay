From: bjturner@bigfoot.com (Benjamin John Turner)

	Hello, I'd like to contribute a module to CPAN. The module at 
hand is a perl module for reading Eudora Address Book files 
(otherwise known as Nickname files). I wrote it as part of a project 
to import desktop client address book data to a server, but the 
module in question is completely independent of the server and might 
come in handy to others looking to extract data from Eudora files.
	Here's the rest of the information that the FAQ said you'd want 
in order to set up an account on PAUSE:

Name: Benjamin Turner
Email: bjturner@mac.com
Homepage: http://www.usfca.edu/turner/
Preferred ID: BJTURNER

	Thanks for your help with my request, and with all of the work 
that has gone into PAUSE and CPAN.
		Benjamin Turner
