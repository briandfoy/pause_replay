     why:

    I would like develop and share modules of an accounting / business
    nature and contribute more broadly. My first module will be a very
    simple text parser tailored to a specific use but part of a larger
    account reconciliation program. I have also developed a simple but
    effective CRM CGI program which I would like to abstract out and
    contribute. Thanks
