The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Router::Statistics
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: The collection of router statistics
  userid:      SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  similar:

  rationale:

    i have chosen to initially use the namespace Router:: already
    registered, and add 'Statistics' but also want to add several other
    lower level modules which are currently all defined as a single
    entity in my development.

    having never submitted or used pause before I will need some help
    and pointers on how to package the module

    For statistics the following functionality

    Cisco Router Statistics/Inventory Collection Code covering the
    following routers

    UBR7200 - CMTS - Inventory and traffic statistics along with cable
    plant characteristics. Detailing per card characteristics and
    interface performance parameters.

    7600 - Switch/Router GSR - 12xxx series routers 7500 - Business
    circuit aggregation device

    UBR Manipulation Code for Cable Providers, offering the following
    functionality

    Per MAC data collection statistics ( so per Cable Modem/Set top box
    ) - Octets up/down, Packets Up/Down, Profile ( DOCSIS profile ), IP
    addresses associated with devices, + variety of other data points

  enteredby:   SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov 27 07:56:03 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Router::
::Statistics      adpOp The collection of router statistics          SHAMROCK
