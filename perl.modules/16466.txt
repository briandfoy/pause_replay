Hi!  Here's the info you wanted:

Jeff Yoak
jeff@yoak.com
http://yoak.com/
preferred pause id: JEFFY

	If JEFFY is unavailable for some reason, my second choice is YOAK, but
I strongly prefer JEFFY.

	As to what I plan to contribute, I'll probably add quite a few things
in the coming few months.  One of my new years resolutions is to get
around to sharing some of the stuff I've built.  Probably the first
thing I'll put up is a class to which hashes may be tied that gives you
expiring hash keys, similar to the behavior of Tie::Scalar::Timeout and
similar to behavior you can extract out of Memoize, but narrowed to this
particular application.  I haven't decided on a specific name yet, but
rest assured that it will be sane and things will be put together with
h2xs and install and work in the normal way.

Thanks!

Cheers,
Jeff
