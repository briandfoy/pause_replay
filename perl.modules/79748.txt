Many thanks for your help and suggestion. I am new to Perl and more interes=
ted to work in this in my future. I am struggling for this issue from quite=
 long time and not able to find any solution to work by using Perl.

Please guide me to resolve this issue.

Problem section-1-

I have executed following statement in my UNIX box. When I executed I got t=
he following error.
santosh_script> perl -e 'use MQSeries; print(MQSeries::MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERRO=
R, "\n");'
Can't locate MQSeries.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/perl5/5.8.4/lib/sun4-=
solaris-64int /usr/perl5/5.8.4/lib /usr/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4/sun4-solaris-=
64int /usr/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4 /usr/perl5/site_perl /usr/perl5/vendor_per=
l/5.8.4/sun4-solaris-64int /usr/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.4 /usr/perl5/vendor_p=
erl .) at -e line 1.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at -e line 1.

To resolve this I have tried following things but nothing workout for me.

1) The above error is coming, as MQseries.pm file is not present at @INC.
2) When I have added the path of my MQSeries.pm file in my PATH and execute=
d the statement, I got the error same as above.
3) Finally I have tried to add in INC,by using following command. When I am=
 executing this, it not adding and taking more time and no shell prompt is =
coming for long time.
Perl  =96I /applications/hotscan/HSDOM/hotdev2/Learning/santosh_script/Mqli=
b/sun4-solaris

So could you please let me know to add this path in PERL INC, Do I need?sup=
per user access.


Problem Section-2-

Following is my Analysis regarding the garbage value issue. Please correct =
me and provide your suggestion, if I have analyzed anything wrong.

I am getting the garbage value in MQSeries constant and my MQCONN is not ab=
le to connect to Queue manager due to following reason.

1) MQCC_FAILED and other MQSeries constant is declared in the file MQClient=
/MQSeries.pm.From this file it is autolodaing this constant at runtime by t=
he function autoload.

BEGIN {
    %EXPORT_TAGS =3D
      ( 'functions' =3D> [ qw(
                            MQCONN
                            MQCONNX
                            )
                        ],
                       'constants' =3D> [ qw(
             MQRC_NONE
             MQACH_CURRENT_VERSION
            MQCC_FAILED
             )
            ]
);
 #
    # Build 'all' list and make routines known in @EXPORT
    #
    $EXPORT_TAGS{'all'} =3D [ map { @$_ } values %EXPORT_TAGS ];
    Exporter::export_tags('all');
}

2) So I am thinking,as the Autoload function is not ableto load these const=
ant,I am getting the garbage value.

3) I have conformed this,when I added the below statement in MQSeries.pm fi=
le to print the Constat MQCC_FAILED like this.I got the NULL Value in my ou=
tput.
            Print(MQCC_FAILED);

4) When I have searched this constant in my sever,I found this is declared =
in the below file .
         /usr/include/cmqc.h: #define MQRC_NONE                      0

5) So could you please let me know?in your environment, where the mqseries =
constant is defined and how it is autoloading.

6) Also please let me know "Will it working in your solaris 64bit platform=
=94.

Following is my problem code-

my $compCode =3D MQCC_FAILED;
    my $Reason =3D   MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR;
      my $mnone =3D MQRC_NONE;
      print "mqnone is $mnone\n";
      print "code is $compCode\n";
      print "Reason is  $Reason\n";
      print "Before calling MQCONN\n";
      print(MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR, "\n");
      print "-------------------------------------------\n";
            $Hconn =3D MQCONN($qm_name,
                             \$compCode,
                             \$Reason,
                            )|| die "Unable to Connect to Queuemanager\n";


Thanks,
Santosh

this code seems to work fine here, so let's try something simpler.
what do you get from this:

   perl -e 'use MQSeries; print(MQSeries::MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR, "\n");'
