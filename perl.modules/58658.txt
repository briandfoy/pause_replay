The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Exists
  DSLIP:       Rmpfp
  description: fast check for process existence
  userid:      BRIANSKI (Brian Szymanski)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    XML::Comma - will be added as a dependency in next release

  similar:
    Proc::ProcessTable XML::Comma

  rationale:

    We were having a problem in XML::Comma with our locking code, which
    checks for stale locks by checking PIDs via Proc::ProcessTable.
    Since we're only checking for one pid, Proc::ProcessTable is
    massively overkill, because it dumps every process on the system
    into an array and does some expensive calculations on them. We
    determined that, over 95% of the CPU time we spend blocked on
    another process is actually spent in Proc::ProcessTable. After a
    check to see if there are other modules which do something similar
    (there aren't), I whipped this together as a replacement.

  enteredby:   BRIANSKI (Brian Szymanski)
  enteredon:   Fri Jan 18 18:57:47 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Proc::
::Exists          Rmpfp fast check for process existence             BRIANSKI
