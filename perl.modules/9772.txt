Hello,

I've put together a toolkit of about 60 modules which can be used to 
build a comprehensive monitoring system similar to big-brother but 
completely written in perl.

It is a generic engine built to accept input from command-line commands, 
DBI queries, snmp services, etc.  It also does probing of HTTP, SMTP, 
POP3, and other TCP services.  It parses the results, sets statuses 
based on rules, and performs email and pager notifications.  It provides 
a configurable web interface to display details, history, graphs (via 
rrdtool) and on-line help (via dynamic pod2html).

My friends have dubb'd it VBTK, (Virtual Brent Toolkit) because they say 
it's like having me around to watch things.  So I prefixed all the 
modules with 'VBTK::'.  It's still a bit rough, but I would like to 
upload it to CPAN, so I can get feedback from others.

Any suggestions on what category it should go under?  I didn't see a 
good fit on any existing category.  Is the naming okay for CPAN?  Comments?

Thanks,

Brent Henry
