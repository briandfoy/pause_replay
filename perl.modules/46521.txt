     why:

    Hello, my name is Jonny and I am planing to contribute a module to
    collect linux system statistics from the /proc filesystem.

    The background is that my company was terrible annoy about the high
    costs of monitor tools for linux systems. So I startet in 2004 with
    the idea to develope our own linux performance monitor. My first
    script was written in Korn- Shell and it collected the data with
    commands sar, iostat, df and netstat.

    Last year I started to learning Perl. Perl is very great. My new
    idea was to write a linux monitor in perl. So I did it and now I
    want to contribute it to CPAN and the rest of this little planet :-)

    In addition I develope a GUI - to see what my module collected :-)
    - and it's written in HTML. For sure dynamic and with
    HTML::Template. But I want only contribute the Module to CPAN, the
    GUI maybe one time on my HP. The module calls LinuxStatistics.pm. If
    this name isn't a good idea then it's not a problem to take another
    one. Maybe Linux::Statistics.pm, Stats::Lstats.pm or any other.

    Kind regards, Jonny
