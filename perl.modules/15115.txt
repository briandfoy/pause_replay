The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CAM::Template
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Template library with configurable syntax
  userid:      CLOTHO (Chris Dolan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    This module used to be proprietary code of Clotho Advanced Media
    ("CAM") but is now released under the GPL. We have historically used
    the CAM root namespace to distinguish our modules from others.

    We're not really sure this module *should* appear in the module
    list until it is further refined, but it does serve a useful niche.
    It differs from it's closest "competitor", HTML::Template, in that
    its template syntax is easily overrideable in subclasses.
    Additionally it supports the CAM template syntax, which is of
    obvious importance to us (and likely us alone...).

  enteredby:   CLOTHO (Chris Dolan)
  enteredon:   Sat Nov  9 01:51:15 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CAM::
::Template        RdpOg Template library with configurable syntax    CLOTHO
