I regret to say that I'd take issue with this sentence.

    The idea of Locale::Maketext::Getttext came from
    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon(3), a great work by autrijus. But it is
    simply not finished yet and not practically usable.
    So I decide to write a replacement.

L::M::L has been deployed in quite a few production-level environments
and projects, so I'd really like to hear your opinions on how it is
not practically usable, so I can improve it.  I'd be happy to take this
off-list too, if you wish.

The encode/decode auto-transformation looks like something that should
be merged back to Locale::Maketext, so it can benefit more people,
imho.

Also, how is bindtextdomain() etc implemented?  Your module submission
states that it is pure-perl, so are you parsing the binary MO files
manually?  If yes, I can certainly merge that bit of code back to
L::M::L.

All in all, it does look different from my approach in L::M::L, but
I'm quite sure they could be reconcilled if you're willing to work
with me on it.  But if you wish to stick with your current API
(which is quite neat, really), I'm willing to accept it into the
modlist, barring objections from other list members.

Thanks,
/Autrijus/
