yes it's pre existing, but not in the official namespace as far as i know.
(features differ somehow)

i somehow don't like that: there is a Audio::CD and it suggerates that this is
a "submodule" with maybe a same interface/subclassing. 
(e.g.: URI::file, URI::file::Unix)

Audio::CDDB.pm would be nice, if you decide otherwise i'll of course accept
that ;-)
