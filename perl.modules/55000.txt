Alas, that last part is not quite true. MyLibrary is about creating a  
person's "personal" page. The system is made up of essentially four  
modules. One to manage information resources. One to manage people.  
One to manage librarians. One to manage a vocabulary/ontology that  
creates relationships between items #1, #2, and #3. By doing so a  
MyLibrary system is expected to allow people to create their "my  
library" and do all the things increasingly expected from information  
systems such as Find More Like This, People Who Used This Also Used  
That, The Most Popular Item Is, Review, Annotate, Share...  MyLibrary  
is a set of tools enabling the creation of things like My Yahoo, etc.

I hope this helps.
