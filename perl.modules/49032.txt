Request to register new user

fullname: Earle Martin
  userid: HEX
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://downlode.org/
     why:

    I already have a number of CPAN modules under the username EMARTIN.
    I picked EMARTIN because at the time I wasn't allowed to register a
    three-character user name. I have always greatly disliked EMARTIN as
    a user name.

    This is a repeat request, and constitutes my fourth for this user
    name since Dec 9, 2003.

    I humbly ask to be allowed to change my user name once and
    permanently, or at the very least informed why not, rather than
    receiving more of this resounding silence that I have been responded
    with for the last two and a half years.

    Thank you.
