The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Positron
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Templating and markup module family
  userid:      BDEUTSCH (Ben Deutsch)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    https://github.com/bendeutsch/positron-template

  similar:
    Template HTML::Template

  rationale:

    * What is this?

    Positron is a family of modules dealing with templating and markup:

    Positron::Template Positron::DataTemplate Positron::Environment
    Positron::Expression Positron::Markup Positron::Document

    and potentially more in the future. The primary module would be
    Positron::Template, which is a HTML and XML templating system, like
    Template Toolkit or HTML::Template, but with a twist: instead of
    performing text concatenation, the template and result is actually a
    real, live DOM representation. This makes it unsuitable for anything
    besides HTML / XML, but guarantees well-formed output, and also
    allows editing the template with an editor which handles HTML really
    well (e.g. tag matching).

    Positron::DataTemplate is similar, but works directly on plain old
    data (arrays and hashes). It uses similar syntax as
    Positron::Template via the shared Environment and Expression
    modules.

    Markup and Document are planned extensions, which provide
    ASCII-like markup for structured documents (think Markdown), and for
    an key-value container for such documents.

    * Why not choose a more descriptive name?

    A descriptive name would imply an authority that these modules do
    not presume. They (specifically Positron::Template) solve a problem
    that most people no longer have, because other, more mainstream
    solutions are available. Precisely this "twist" of not working on
    text is unusual and surprising, especially given other templating
    systems, not just in Perl, but in many languages. Noone would search
    for a templating system working on a DOM / raw data; most people
    would not even know to ask the question. This is something a user
    would need to be shown, to be pointed towards. Searchability is not
    as great an issue.

    Additionally, finding a descriptive name based on the domain or
    implementation is difficult, since there is no underlying domain
    (HTML? XML? Data?). Anyway, "HTML::Template" is already taken ;-)

    * So why "Positron"?

    It is short. It is memorizable and recognizable. It is easily
    pronounced and spelled, even by non-native English speakers. It does
    not collide with existing templating systems; in fact, even the
    initials do not collide with TT or H::T (Template Toolkit and
    HTML::Template, respectively).

The resulting entry would be:
