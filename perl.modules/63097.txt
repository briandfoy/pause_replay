     why:

    The idea is to give to anybody the possibility to create mobile
    solution, it's not important if you know programming language just
    what you need to know is a little bit of html and if it's necessary
    wml. So I thought it was to make something simply that can identify
    a browser and redirect it the correct url (for mobile or pc).

    If you are a programmer and you want to develop a simple mobile
    solution you can use this module to pass fiew Wurfl Capability
    information to your application. In this case it's not important
    with which language you want to develop your site and you don't need
    to implement some library.
