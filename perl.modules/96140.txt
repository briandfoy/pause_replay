Peter,

I'm sorry to hear that you interpreted my email as threatening.

The language used was reviewed collectively by the PAUSE administrators
with the goal of being clear and constructive to avoid misunderstanding.

Now that we are aware of a dispute =E2=80=93 regardless of the details =E2=
=80=93 we don't
want any action taken until the dispute is resolved.

For the good of the community, we believe the situation is best resolved
through discussion rather than fiat.  We believe the DBIC maintainers,
authors and/or the broader DBIC community are the best informed to decide
the future direction of DBIC.

Regards,
David

      I must remind you that it was me who reached out publicly[1] to
      the PAUSE admins as a sole CPAN author, seeking protection from a
      particular &quot;community member&quot;. I am rather puzzled that ins=

      complaint, I received a *private* borderline-threat shown below in

      <br>
      As indicated previously - I will not indulge this conversation in

      If the powers of PAUSE are seriously considering these claims on
      what has for years been exclusively a single-maintainer project,
      then these claims (and the planned administrative action) must be
      restated publicly.<br>
