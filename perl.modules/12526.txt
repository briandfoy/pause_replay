As Tim pointed out recently, some top level namespaces such as Apache:: or 
XML:: are so generic that three-level names make sense. Thus, people wishing 
to develop addition TEI tools would use XML::TEILite as their root namespace. 
The same discussion occurred with the same conclusion when the perl-xml list 
was debating whether to use XML::SAX::* or have a SAX:: top level namespace.
