Subject: Module submission Net::validMX

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::validMX
  DSLIP:       Rdpfa
  description: Perl DNS mail exchange & email validation
  userid:      KMCGRAIL (Kevin A. McGrail)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Has been discussed publicly on MIMEDefang Mailing List

  similar:
    Unknown

  rationale:

    The namespace was based on the dependence on Net::DNS and the
    approach to try and show that the MX records for a domain are valid.

    The module is based on code used on production systems for
    approximately 8 months and has been peer-reviewed on the MIMEDefang
    mailing list.

    I believe it will also allow for a unique pre-screening process for
    web registrations, mailing list signups, etc. prior to a
    confirmation based system.

Net::
