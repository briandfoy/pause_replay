Thanks for your feedback.

Is this actually a problem? If you find yourself using Bio::Graphics in 
your code you would have to list Bio::Graphics as a dependency. That 
would cause Bio::Graphics to be installed if the end-user didn't have 
it. Bio::Graphics itself uses Bio::Graphics::Panel so would have that as 
its own dependency. Bio::Graphics::Panel uses 
Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory, and Bio::Graphics::Glyph::Factory (though 
it isn't explicit in the code) uses all the Bio::Graphics::Glyph::* 
modules, so would have those as dependencies.

So in fact everything would get installed automatically just be having a 
single dependency on Bio::Graphics.

And the idea being, its perhaps easier to take a 'pure', automated one 
distribution per module (ODPM) approach that sorts all these things out 
by itself, than for us to decide on the 'correct' and desirable groupings.

Well, that was my thought anyway.

Yes, other Bioperl developers have suggested much the same. And we could 
easily go down that route: it's a sound idea. But I ask, is it really 
necessary to decide on these splits? Are there actually any practical 
problems with ODPM?

It wasn't clear to me from this context what a 'driver' module was. Can 
you clarify?

Given what I've said above (that dependencies would ideally take care of 
themselves), does your strong recommendation against still stand? Why?


Thank you,
Sendu.
