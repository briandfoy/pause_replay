Hi!  I was curious if you're aware that Google's terms of service disallow
scraping, now that they've exposed a wonderfully useful SOAP API (which
there's actually a module for, too [1]).

I think they can request that your module be removed, in its entirety,
from CPAN, due to that scraper, so it's worth making sure you're aware :)
If you already knew all this, please pardon the intrusion, and have a nice
day!

If you want to keep the module namespace for backwards compatibility, but
remove the scrapiness, you could rewrite the guts to use Net::Google, and
no one would ever know (well, except for the XML SOAP dependencies.)
