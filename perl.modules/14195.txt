The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::WMF
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Creates and writes windows metafile images
  userid:      TCOX (Tony Cox)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Same call interface to GD (PNG creator)

  rationale:

    This module is a pure perl implementation of the win32 GDI API
    calls necessary for creating a binary metafile image. Although the
    images are primarily used on a win32 platform this code was written
    so that non-windows code could support windows specfic image
    generation. I would therefore suggest that it should live with other
    general image-producing/manipulating code in Image::WMF. I have
    stuck as closely as possible to the GD image API so that people with
    experience of creating PNG/Gifs will find is very easy.

The resulting entry would be:
