Subject: Module submission Ebook::text2html

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ebook::text2html
  DSLIP:       Rnphr
  description: Conversion functions for ebook production
  userid:      STHOMAS (Steve Thomas)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    *text2html

  rationale:

    There are a few other modules with similar conversion functions,
    but this one goes further, and is directed specifically at the
    production of xHTML ebooks from plain text transcriptions.

    I thought about using Convert::text2html, but Convert seems
    directed more at code conversions. Text:: or HTML:: namespaces would
    also do, but seem more generalised.

    Since I will be adding more modules for various ebook production
    tasks, it seems reasonable to start a new Ebook:: namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

Ebook::
::text2html       Rnphr Conversion functions for ebook production    STHOMAS
