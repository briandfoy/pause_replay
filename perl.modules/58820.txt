The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::IdentifyFile
  DSLIP:       adcfp
  description: Uniquely identifies a file on Windows.
  userid:      CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    perlmonks CB

  similar:
    Win32API::File

  rationale:

    Windows NTFS has a rather more complex identification system for
    files than the inode on UNIX. The Microsoft API required is
    GetFileInformationByHandle. Win32API::File exposes this interface,
    which is general purpose, but it can be complex to use with that
    interface. In particular, the unique id is only valid while a Win32
    HANDLE is open to it. This module takes care of that, and simplifies
    its use.

    'grinder' asked on perlmonks CB if Windows used a system like an
    inode, which he needs for one of his modules. I voluntered this as a
    solution.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::IdentifyFile    adcfp Uniquely identifies a file on Windows.       CLIVE
