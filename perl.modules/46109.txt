This is considered a feature:)

I will not make it the default behaviour because users of the module
still will have those higher versions installed and will be
inconvenienced unnecessarily by falling version numbers. However, I
have added a page to PAUSE to reset registered versions for those who
believe they can justify that step vis-=C3=A0-vis their users.

I'd always argue to authors to ***please*** let their version numbers
grow and never ever let them fall down again. But its up to you if you
want to agree with me:)
