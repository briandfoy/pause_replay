Hi Guys,

There might be a problem with pause for my user name? Im trying to edit 
module metadata, and Pause think s there are no modules for me, even though I 
have previously provided Digest-MD4, and recently registered Authen-ACE4.

Im listed here
ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CPAN/modules/by-module/Digest/MIKEM/

But this page:
http://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_mod
says:

Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to MIKEM. Please note, only 
modules that are already registered in the
                                module list can be edited here. If you 
believe, this is a bug, please contact modules@perl.org.

My user name is MIKEM

Cheers.
