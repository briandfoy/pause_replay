I'd call it SCUBA::Table::NoDeco, to distinguish from tables that
give deco obligations.  Under that namespace, I'd also break it
down further by table name (Navy, PADI, etc), although the
interface my allow the user to select the table instead of loading
every table module by name.

sounds cool. :)
