     why:

    I've been writing an ISP management/accounting system that I feel
    is quite ready to at least be viewed by others.

    It contains 8 modules, up-to-date and clear (imho) documentation
    for the methods, 600+ tests.

    CPAN will allow me to expand the breadth of my tests, allow for
    peer review, and hopefully allow my project to be used by others.
