Subject: Module submission Games::Sudoku::General

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Sudoku::General
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Solve Sudoku and Sudoku-like puzzles
  userid:      WYANT (Tom Wyant)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Games::Sudoku Games::Sudoku::OO Games::YASudoku

  rationale:

    The Games::Sudoku part of the name is a given. The ::General is
    because the module solves not only the "standard" 9 x 9 puzzle, but
    also a number of variants: 9 x 9 with diagonals, 6 x 6 with
    rectangular subregions, puzzles with prior constraints on cell
    contents, and so on.

    This module also attempts to solve the puzzle by logic, and is able
    to report the steps taken to solve the problem. Backtracking is used
    only as a last resort.

    I floated this on comp.lang.perl.modules on November 30. The only
    response was from a guy in Norway (judging by his top-level domain),
    who was working on a similar module, but who deferred to me. I will
    pass back to him if it makes sense to do so.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Sudoku::
::General         adpOp Solve Sudoku and Sudoku-like puzzles         WYANT
