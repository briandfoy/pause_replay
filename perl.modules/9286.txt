The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::AppTest
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Browser object to test your web application
  userid:      MIKO (Miko O'Sullivan)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    none known

  rationale:

    A system for performing automated tests on a web-based application.
    AppTest provides you with a browser object that can navigate a web
    sigte in much the same way a web browser navigates a site. For
    example, link objects have a "click" method that navigates the
    browser the same way clicking on a link in a browser does. Forms are
    exposed through form objects, and provide access to each field as
    field objects. Field values can be set, and radio, checkbox, and
    submit buttons can be "clicked". The browser handles cookies and
    redirection just like other browsers. It is highly recommended that
    your application use the ID attribute on the HTML to simplify the
    finding of specific elements on the page that indicate success or
    failure of the system.
