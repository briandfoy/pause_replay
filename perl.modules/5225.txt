The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XMLI
  DSLI:        bmpO
  description: Encapsulates XML drivers
  userid:      ISTERIN (Ilya Sterin)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-xml@listserv.ActiveState.com, TPJ

  similar:

  rationale:

    XMLI is the same idea as DBI for DBD drivers. It will encapsulate
    the XML::CSV, XML::Excel, and other drivers. I am the author of
    XML::CSV and XML::Excel. XMLI was already widely discussed with the
    users of XML::CSV and XML::Excel. Jon Orwant really liked the idea
    and offered for me to publish an article in TPJ on XML::CSV,
    XML::Excel, and the soon coming XMLI interface. Both XML::CSV and
    XML::Excel are being discussed and supported through
    perl-xml@listserv.ActiveState.com mailing list. XMLI will also be
    supported through this list as well as my email.

The resulting entry would be:

XMLI              bmpO Encapsulates XML drivers                     ISTERIN
