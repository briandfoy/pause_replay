Is categorization by SAX type the only benefit to
XML::anysaxthing::FooBaa?  I prefer primary categorization by related
purpose (XML::FooBaa::anysaxthing).  I also believe that using
XML::anysaxthing::* limits the number of useful ``anysaxthing''
namespaces.  For example, XML::Grove::Builder is a SAX handler that
builds a grove.  I think the concept that it builds a grove is more
important than the fact that it's a handler.  Similar for
SAX::XMLWriter (the proposed rename of XML::Handler::XMLWriter), it's
more important that it's an XMLWriter than a SAX handler.

The Perl-XML module list includes a categorized list of Perl-XML
modules.  We could add categories for handlers, drivers, filters,
etc. to make looking them up easy:

  <http://www.perlxml.com/modules/perl-xml-modules.html>

I made the proposal for renaming the SAX modules.  I can't find my
original message in the archive, but the first response includes it:

  <http://www.penguinteam.org/archives/perl-xml-9909/msg00046.html>

I had planned on doing this rename in the next version of libxml-perl,
so additional discussion about this is very timely!
