The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Darian::Mars
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: the Darian calendar for Mars
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Darian calendar is the most popular of the various calendars
    proposed for Mars. This is a straightforward implementation of it,
    converting between calendar dates and a linear count of Martian
    days.

    The module name includes the "::Mars" component because there are
    also Darian calendars for other solar system bodies (Titan and
    others). The various Darian calendars are distinct but designed
    according to similar principles. The Darian calendars are described
    canonically at
    <http://pweb.jps.net/~tgangale/mars/converter/calendar_clock.htm>.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Sat Feb 17 10:28:45 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Darian::
::Mars            Rdpfp the Darian calendar for Mars                 ZEFRAM
