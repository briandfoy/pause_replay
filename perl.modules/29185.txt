The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Acme::Wabby
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Generate random sentences based on seed text
  userid:      POZNICK (Nathan Poznick)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Silly::Werder, Algorithm::MarkovChain

  rationale:

    I'd like to name this module Acme::Wabby based on discussion on the
    modules list (as opposed to the previous name, Silly::Wabby). The
    Wabby part of the name comes from the fact that it is based upon an
    earlier IRC bot called 'wabbylegs'. I have greatly enjoyed using
    Silly::Wabby to annoy people on IRC and AIM while writing it, and
    think it needs to be shared with the rest of the Perl world.

    Silly::Werder performs a vaguely similar function, except that it
    deals with syllables within words. Algorithm::MarkovChain is a more
    generalized Markov chain implementation, but doesn't suit my more
    specific needs (in particular the memory usage is very high, and it
    doesn't seem to generate chains in a manner which suits my usage).

    I chose chapter 11 because this module really does not fit well
    into the chapers in which Acme is registered: 2 (not a Perl language
    extension or core module), 9 (not an interface or emulation of
    another language), or 15 (Does not deal with the WWW, HTML, CGI,
    etc...). The best fit seems to be under 11.

The resulting entry would be:

Acme::
::Wabby           RdpOg Generate random sentences based on seed text POZNICK
