The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::GUIAutomate
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Baseclass to use mouse/kbd; manipulate wndos
  userid:      PARAGAPE (John Adams Jackson)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32::GuiTest

  rationale:

    'Win32::GUIAutomate' is actually just a base class for a suite of
    modules that let the user manipulate the Microsoft Windows graphical
    interface with the intention of automated testing. This suite is
    object-oriented and written entirely in Perl.

    The 'Win32::GUIAutomate' module just provides the OS function calls
    similar to the module 'Win32', but provides the specific and
    additional ones needed for the suite. 'Win32::GUIAutomate' uses the
    'Win32::API' module to send commands to the Windows operating
    system. The 'Win32::GUIAutomate' module also provides a few library
    routines.

    The actual 'workhorse' modules are:

    Win32::GUIAutomate::Keyboard Win32::GUIAutomate::Mouse
    Win32::GUIAutomate::Window Win32::GUIAutomate::Window::Button
    Win32::GUIAutomate::Window::Editbox
    Win32::GUIAutomate::Window::Combobox
    Win32::GUIAutomate::Window::Listview
    Win32::GUIAutomate::Window::Treeview etc.

    These modules provide the methods needed to manipulate their
    respective controls. The idea is to create a module for each of the
    control types. For example, the ::Treeview module lets you find
    treeview controls, test for the existence of and select any branch
    in the treeview, expand the tree, collapse the tree, display the
    tree, drag-and-drop to/from the tree, get a structure that
    represents the tree, etc.

    The 'Win32::GuiTest' module is sort-of object-oriented, requires
    the user to possess quite a bit of knowledge that should remain
    hidden, is not structured in a logical heirarchy, is not written
    entirely in Perl (uses C++ to talk to the operating system), and I
    think not exactly the easiest thing to use.

    I don't know that I can give a conclusive argument why I shouldn't
    just help improve 'Win32::GuiTest' rather than write my own suite. I
    do think, however, that my interface is much cleaner and easier to
    understand, and I don't like requiring a C++ foundation to make the
    whole thing work, especially since I don't have a C++ compiler and
    have no interest in acquiring one, even though I can get it for
    free. I prefer writing in Perl - period.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
