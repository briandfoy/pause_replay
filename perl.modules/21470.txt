Dear Gentlemen,

I am sorry to ask such a stupid question but what should I do,

I am happy with the name - any name; should I replace the module name
and upload another submission ?

FWIW, the module has been running happily on two or three sites (one
Linux, one FreeBSD and one unknown) for more than 6 months; I had no
idea that underscores are deprecated in module names - although, yes, I
have never seen a module with an underscore in its name.

Yours sincerely.
