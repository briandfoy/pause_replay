After discussing the matter with several others in our organization, 
we've decided to request the PAUSE ID of "DATABUILT" and be done with it.

ID Requested:    DATABUILT
Email Address:  cpan@databuilt.com
Name:                 DataBuilt, Inc.

Expediting this ID would be appreciated as this matter is now four 
months old.

Thank you in advance for the expedited service.

ps.  Note I have no issue with any individual person on the modules@ 
list - some of whom I consider as friends and the talents of all which I 
respect - it's simply the actions, practices, and policies of the group 
as a whole.  I do remain highly upset at the unprofessional behvior and 
tyrannical attitude often displayed by the modules@ group.  I hardly 
think this attitude helps the Perl community grow both in public image 
or in codebase.  I am firmly of the opinion that the management of CPAN 
and the modules@ list should be brought under community review with 
actions and sanctions brought where appropriate.  Stringing contributing 
community members (and existing PAUSE authors) along for four months 
while they wait, exhibit patience, give polite explanations, are willing 
to have open discussion and sit in silence is inexcusable when the 
result is little more than pedantics and ID denial due to emotional or 
non-rational objection.  Among ideas for improvement I would suggest:

1) Community Voting for ID Approval
2) Placing a Time Limit on the Age of a Request - after expiration and 
without majority denial the ID is automatically approved
3) Larry's Rule applies.
4) Written ID Policy (e.g. Organizational IDs are allowed/disallowed, 
etc.)
.... add your own here ...

Finally in reference to those objecting to Organizational IDs, be aware 
that (in the US at a minimum) if code is written during company work 
hours and/or on company hardware, it is property of the company, not the 
programmer.  The programmer, as an individual, has no rights to post the 
work and exposes themselves to legal action on the part of the company.  
Welcome to  Corporate Benevolence.  If you want to reap the benefits of 
professional, corporate-quality code which many companies are willing to 
contribute back to the community then you must accept the requirement of 
Organizational IDs (or be willing to explain to the community why you've 
just rejected the addition of professionally written code - unless it 
just sucks :-)
