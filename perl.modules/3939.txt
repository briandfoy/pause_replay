(preferred user-ID:)	FAICHNEY

(description:)		there are many things I would like to contribute, the 
			first of which is a configuration integration module 
			(described next.)

(module description:)	Rdpf
			44 chars: "unified ARGV/table/etc parameter processing"
			suggested name (cf. section 12) "App::Parameter"

(previous discussion:)	none.  while this module tries to solve a different
			problem than existing "getopts" modules, it also 
			overlaps w/ them (tho not in ways that promote
			inheritance.)  all told, I believe that this module
			offers distinct, compelling value, and so bears
			inclusion in public resources... I just dont expect
			much acknowledgement.

			in any case, the entire module amounts to all of 468
			lines... of which the last 322 is pod!  fwiw, I think
			it's well-written (uses "use strict"; generates zero
			warnings in -w mode.)
