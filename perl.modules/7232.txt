Hello,

Please disregard my earlier message; sorry for the inconvenience.

I will be taking over maintenance of Business::OnlinePayment and
Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet with the blessing of the author; see
attached mesasge.  My CPAN id is IVAN.  Thanks!

I will shortly upload an updated Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet.

I haven't used or really maintained the onlinepayment modules in quite a
while, if you would like to take them over, be my guest, I'll try and
answer questions the best I can if you have any...
