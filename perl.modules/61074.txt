I recently split all libwin32 modules into their own CPAN distributions,
and correspondingly separate RT queues. A bug report for the
Win32::NetResource today generated an email loop between RT and the
perl-win32-users@activestate.com mailing list. It turns out that a
couple of modules were originally registered (probably by Sarathy) with
the "WIN32" CPAN id, which is just an alias for this mailing list
and not a real person.

I'm already a co-maintainer for all the Win32::* modules registered
to this CPAN id, so could you please transfer the primary ownership
to my id (JDB) and remove WIN32 from the list?

There are 3 more module names registered to the WIN32 id: "NT",
"Win95" and "WinNT".  None of these namespaces are in use anymore,
and none of the modules can be found on CPAN as far as I can see.
I would therefore suggest to remove those module list entries as
well as the WIN32 CPAN id.  Any email sent to this id will be
rejected by the Mailman mailing list software anyways.

Here is the full list of modules registered to the WIN32 id:

NT  	WIN32  	 	modulelist  	WIN32
Win32::EventLog 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
Win32::NetAdmin 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
Win32::NetResource 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
Win32::Process 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
Win32::Registry 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
Win32::WinError 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
Win95 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32
WinNT 	WIN32 		modulelist 	WIN32

While looking at this I noticed that there is also an old and unused
"ASTEAM" CPAN id (in 00whois.xml) that should be deleted as well.

Cheers,
-Jan
