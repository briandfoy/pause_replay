My company ships a large proprietary Perl program that does a lot of
SNMP work; it primarily uses Net::SNMP.  While Net::SNMP is an
extremely useful module that does lots of things, it isn't perfect for
our needs, for the following reasons. 

- it's slow, about 30 times slower than net-snmp
- it's clumsy for simple tasks
- it has some bug-prone features
  - translations
  - blocking vs. nonblocking
  - in-band error indications
- it's somewhat inflexible
  - hard to dissect captured SNMP packets with (although I've done it)
  - hard to write SNMP agents with (although I've done it)
  - hard to write a POE component with
- large, therefore bug-prone; some of these bugs have lost us sales

So I've written a new pure-Perl SNMP module, which is fast, is simple
to use for simple tasks, has none of the Net::SNMP features that have
introduced bugs into our software, is flexible enough for use in many
different contexts, and is much smaller.  It even includes a skeletal
agent implementation, which it uses for regression tests, and its
regression tests are much more thorough than Net::SNMP's.

This initial release doesn't support traps, inform-requests, GetBulk,
SNMPv3, or MIB parsing; it doesn't fully support multiple VarBinds per
PDU or nonblocking operation; and it doesn't have Net::SNMP's useful
array of workarounds for common SNMP agent bugs.  But many useful SNMP
applications don't need those features.  I plan to implement them in
future releases, however.

If there wasn't already a Net::SNMP (perish the thought!) I'd want to
call it Net::SNMP.  Should I put it directly under Net::SNMP
(Net::SNMP::Simple, Net::SNMP::Agent, Net::SNMP::EncodeDecode),
somewhere else under Net (Net::FastSNMP?), in some specific place
under Net::SNMP (Net::SNMP::Simple::*?  Net::SNMP::Lite::*?), or
somewhere else altogether?

I sympathize with the argument that it would be better to improve
Net::SNMP rather than reinvent the wheel, but in this case, I've been
developing our product on top of Net::SNMP for a year and a half, and
I don't think it will ever meet our needs, so I will develop and
distribute this software in any case.  I suspect there are other
people who would benefit from this software, too, so I would like to
add it to the module list.
