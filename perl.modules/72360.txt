Someone may have already fixed this for you, but I didn't have a
problem changing your account info and getting the changes to stick. It
looks like the hompage value now has http:// in front of it.

Besides someone fixing it fo you, maybe it worked the first time but
there was a browser or cache issue showing you old versions. *shrug*
