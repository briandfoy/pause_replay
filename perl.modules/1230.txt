G'day,

	I'm writing a little mod_perl integration tool for an internal
project ... the project is closed but I'm planning on releasing the tool
parts Open Source. 

	In summary, it is a minimalist layer of stuff trying to roughly
what HTML::Mason and Apache::Registry do, but in a less Apache dependant
way and (in my opinion :-) ) neater from an OO perspective. Kind of Zope
for Perl. A lot of it consists of using Text::Template and
Apache::StatINC [1] you'll be pleased to hear :-)

	Development name is 'sushi' [2], and at the moment it uses
a (largely virtual) class Sushi from which Sushi objects (which you
build pages with) are descended. Also a couple of toolkit things,
Sushi::Response for example, and Sushi::Text::Template (a wrapper for 
Text::Template objects). The Apache interface uses Apache::Sushi
and Apache::Sushi::Response (the former a standard mod_perl handler
which calls Sushi objects, the latter a subclass of Sushi::Response).

	That probably doesn't explain it very well, but gives you some
idea. I'm hoping for advice on where _you_ think it should fit
in the heirachy. It doesn't really belong under Apache, because part
of the point of it is to allow CLI invocation, or invocation from
other web servers. 

	While I'm here, I'll also register for a PAUSE id ...

	(see above)

... there's a timeframe of about a month by which time this will be
ready to be 0.2ed and released on an unsuspecting world, more details
to follow based largely on what suggestions you have for me ...
	
cheers, look forward to hearing from you (and other readers of
modules@perl.org too) ...
