True, on the other hand, not sure if is this important to have a Condor
root namespace, given that we still don't know if more people are going to
contribute with more modules for Condor. I find it possible but unlikely.
That said, I feel more comfortable to contribute to an already existant
namespace, but let me know what is the best.

Anyway, I'm doing some changes in the module itself and POD after some
discussion with the Condor developers, so still time to discuss the naming
before I submit.

Thanks,
Samir
