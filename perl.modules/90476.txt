Hi Kedar

I still can't see it. It's Sat 9:45 am here in Melbourne.

Questions:

o What is your CPAN id?

o Did you receive any emails when you submitted the module?

o Did those emails show any problems?

o Can you post the contents of the emails to this list (after waiting a 
few hours at least - This is a voluntary service, after all)?
(If not happy about public posting, email copies to me directly, along 
with the module. Note: This is virtually never necessary, so be patient).

o Anything could be interfering with CPAN activity. I'm sure it's not 
someone stalling deliberately just because they don't like you :-).
I.e. Be patient (again). It should show up in a few hours.
