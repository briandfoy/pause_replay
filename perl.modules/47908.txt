Perhaps David could ask this guy what he's doing and why he's doing it.
If the two can't work it out on their own, then one of us can step in.

My first suspicion wouldn't be a hijacking though. The user is fairly
new and might have just made a newbie mistake. Also, sometime we
encourage poeple to upload their fixes if they can't reach the original
author. I don't think we did that in this case, but he might have seen
a message to someone else.
