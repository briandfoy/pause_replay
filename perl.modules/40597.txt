The indexer is failing to find the version number of any modules that use 
version.pm. For example:


                User: DCONWAY (Damian Conway)
   Distribution file: Smart-Comments-1.0.1.tar.gz
     Number of files: 27
          *.pm files: 1
              README: Smart-Comments-1.0.1/README
            META.yml: Smart-Comments-1.0.1/META.yml
   Timestamp of file: Wed May 25 01:07:41 2005 UTC
    Time of this run: Wed May 25 01:44:20 2005 UTC

The following packages (grouped by status) have been found in the distro:

Status: Falling version number
==============================

      module: Smart::Comments
     version: undef
     in file: Smart-Comments-1.0.1/lib/Smart/Comments.pm
      status: Not indexed because
              Smart-Comments-0.01/lib/Smart/Comments.pm in
              A/AU/AUTRIJUS/Smart-Comments-0.01.tar.gz has a higher
              version number (0.01)

__END__


This will presumably become an even larger problem when version.pm is core in 
5.10.
