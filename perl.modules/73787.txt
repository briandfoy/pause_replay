This is not a private talk. I have no objections if this is public readable=

Depends. Before I decide anything I'd like to know what was going on.

This is a definitive issue for me - 'cause I always thought that the
current maintainer must
be tried to be contacted before CPAN admin will give someone co-maint.
When I take a
look to my modules and know, that at any time another one could get
the permission
to release new versions (without asking me or inform me) of the modules I h=
ave
responsibility, this could at least stop me from uploading modules to CPAN,=
 yes.

> Have you tried talking to Adam?

I've cc'ed him as you might have notived and I cc him with this reply,
too. So he
had the same chance to answer. I'm very busy at the moment and do not inten=
d
to invest additional time by trying to contact Adam on another way
than his public
CPAN email-address.

Best regards,
Jens
