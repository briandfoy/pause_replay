From: p.stewart@attbi.com ("Peter J. Stewart")

I'd like to have my module, Games::Object, registered so that when I go 
to look at the metadata for it, I'm not told that I have no modules 
registered to me. The module has been out there for over a year now, and 
I've emailed this group a few times over that time period (about once 
every few months, which I don't considered being too much of a pest).

All I ask is that if you CAN'T register it for some reason, that someone 
please drop me a brief email note to that effect rather than leaving me 
hanging. I din't think that's too much to ask, since I've been waiting 
about a year to get the module registered.

Thanks in advance.


Pete Stewart
