The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Restrict
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Strip away unwanted HTML tags and attributes
  userid:      OALDERS (Olaf Alders)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Scrubber HTML::Declaw HTML::Defang

  rationale:

    This module uses HTML::Parser to strip HTML from text in a
    restrictive manner. By default all HTML is restricted. You may alter
    the default behaviour by supplying your own tag rules.

    There are already several modules on the CPAN which accomplish much
    of the same thing, but after doing a lot of poking around, I was
    unable to find a solution with a simple setup which I was happy
    with. My aim here is to keep things easy and, hopefully, cover a lot
    of the less complex use cases with just a few lines of code.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
