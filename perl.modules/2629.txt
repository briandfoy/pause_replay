I'm developing a large RDF library for the WRAF project
    http://www.uxn.nu/wraf/

I would like to register the name "RDF". Second choice is "RDF::Wraf".




The long version:
-----------------

One could think that they should go under XML::RDF, but I don't agree with
that. Reason: The librare doesn't (yet) using XML in any way.  XML is used
to communicate RDF data. But RDF itself is not based upon RDF.  The WRAF
modules mainly uses the DBI to store data. XML is not involved.

The modules are in alpha stage. They presently consist of

RDF
RDF::Cache
RDF::Config
RDF::Constants
RDF::Dispatcher
RDF::Interface::DBI::V01
RDF::Interface::Schema::RDFS_200001
RDF::Resource
RDF::Resource::Class
RDF::Resource::Collection
RDF::Resource::Collection::Module
RDF::Resource::Function
RDF::Resource::Interface
RDF::Resource::Literal
RDF::Resource::Model
RDF::Resource::Statement

The intention is that new RDF::Interface modules can be released as
separate modules. (The reason for this enumeration of the modules was to
argue that RDF in itself is big enough.)


Eric Prud'hommeaux has created a couple of modules, put in the W3C name
space:
	W3C::Rdf::RdfParser
	W3C::Rdf::RdfDB
	W3C::Rdf::RdfVisualizer
	W3C::Rdf::ListRdfParser

Janne Saarela <js@pro-solutions.com> has announced "CPAN Module
RDF::Parser V1.01"



My first choise for the module name is RDF. But that may shut out other
implementations. My second choice for the module name is RDF::Wraf.
