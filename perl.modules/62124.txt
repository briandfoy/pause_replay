I think the number of those modules wouldn't be that high. That's
because people just gradually disappear and don't sit down to decide
that they're suddenly going to give up all their CPAN code. And that's
good: If we advertised too much that there's no need to maintain your
stuff, there'd be quite an incentive to upload things and then set the
"I don't want tedious work" flag.

I think having a separate PAUSE ID would be too much work and
potentially fragile. Gabor gave a couple of examples of when it would be
sub-optimal.

Ideally, we'd have a flag for all modules (not only those on the list)
which search.cpan can then interpret at leisure.

Best regards,
Steffen
