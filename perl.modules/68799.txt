No, you shouldn't ignore it.

I see you're using ExtUtils::MakeMaker. What you want to do is modify 
the defaults of the "no_index" property of the distributions META.yml in 
order to tell the PAUSE indexer that it shouldn't be indexing the 
testing directory.

There is the META_MERGE property of ExtUtils::MakeMaker in recent 
versions. Try adding the following to your WriteMakefile call if Foo.pm 
lives in t/:

META_MERGE => {
   no_index => {
     directory => 't',
   },
},

Cheers,
Steffen
