I have reserved the namespace Class::PublicInternal.  I'm ready to upload 
the module but I've come to feel that Class::PublicPrivate is really a 
better name.  Nobody should be using the module when it was called 
Class::PublicInternal (because I've never uploaded the module) so the change 
should not effect anyone.
