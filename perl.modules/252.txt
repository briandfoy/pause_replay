> Hi all,
> 
> While working with Dan Sugalski's mail_attach.pl script, I found several
> file-name suffixes missing.  I added them and sent back a new script to
> Dan, but I also thought that the big hash in the program might make a
> good module.
> 
> I've discussed this a bit with Dan and come up with an idea of providing
> a default map/hash, then have OS-specific maps overriding definitions in
> the main map.  The main interface would be a subroutine that takes a file
> name or suffix and returns the MIME type and its "customary" encoding
> method.
> 
> My proposed name is MIME::Types.

> Comments and suggestions?

> Thanks,
