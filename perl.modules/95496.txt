Hi Tom,

> I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m =
working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package =
names case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where =
two or more people are owners of namespaces previously considered =
distinct, and now considered the same.
>=20

which relates to:

> This is listed in the CPAN Index, but doesn=E2=80=99t appear against =
your id on MetaCPAN or search.cpan.org, so is essentially unreachable.

> Your ownership of UnderScore conflicts with =E2=80=9Cunderscore=E2=80=9D=

Do you have a preference for the way forward?

2 and 3 are cleaner solutions, but my default action will eventually be =
1, just to resolve the conflict. That would result in UnderScore not =
being listed in the CPAN Index (02packages) any more.

Cheers,
Neil
