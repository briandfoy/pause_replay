     why:

    I have a module I've been tinkering with for finding the Gematria
    numbers of words, that I'd like to upload and maintain as practice.

    Beyond the basic, I am a perl professional (currently working on
    BackupPC) and would like to contribute any work that I feel may be
    useful. Some things I'd like to include are a fs- and
    content-agnostic path munging library.
