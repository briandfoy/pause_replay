It's not normal to have lowercase namespaces, even when it is an 
application.

Generally the most common technique for that is to create your 
application in the appropriate namespace as a module, say Tk::VPTK, and 
then have a vptk launch script installed into bin, which you don't need 
a namespace registration for...

Also, you don't need to register the module in order to do an upload. 
With large new projects that might falter we generally like to see an 
upload before registering the module namespace.

Thoughts?
