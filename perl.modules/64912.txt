Can you please answer one simple question, or let your boss answer it?
Because I do not get it: why can't you simply ask the man to hand out
the password for the account and be done with it?

Once you have the password you can change the email address and can
upload and can treat that account as a company asset (which you should
probably have done the day you [the company] applied for it).
