     why:

    I am a Perl programmer who is beginning to reach the upper
    Intermediate to Advanced skill levels, and I would like the ability
    to contribute modules to the community. I have no specific plan yet,
    but I work in Information Assurance. I am sure to come up with some
    super-useful security-related tools at some point.
