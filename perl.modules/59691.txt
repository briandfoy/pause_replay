Subject: Module submission Muldis::D

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Muldis::D
  DSLIP:       cmong
  description: Formal spec of Muldis D relational DBMS lang
  userid:      DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    N/A

  similar:
    N/A

  rationale:

    Simply put, I wish to rename one of my Perl package namespaces that
    was already registered with the module list last year, from
    Language::MuldisD to Muldis::D. See
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Language-MuldisD/ for what I refer to.
    Going forward I believe the new package name is better. While having
    Language in the name served as a descriptor, the Description in
    Module List + CPAN directory + NAME pod also uses that word so I
    don't think there will be confusion. It also lets me more
    consolidate my multiple Muldis branded projects into a common
    namespace ... Muldis::DB is already there. And I don't think there
    will be confusion between the 2, which are the same but for one
    letter, or if there is, I would then want to rename the DB one to
    something longer. But I don't think there is confusion.

    Note that the actual name of the language being specified, "Muldis
    D", is not changing at all, just the Perl package name it is put up
    on CPAN with.

    Obviously, then, I wish to release the Language::MuldisD namespace
    after gaining Muldis::D, so the old one is no longer registered. Not
    that anyone's likely to come up and use it later, but only the new
    name should appear in the CPAN directory of course.

  enteredby:   DUNCAND (Darren Duncan)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar 22 19:59:13 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Muldis::
::D               cmong Formal spec of Muldis D relational DBMS lang DUNCAND
