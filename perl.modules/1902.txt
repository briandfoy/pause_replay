Planning to contribute:
        Various source code which we've found useful and reusable.  This
includes a package management system written in Perl (Bundle::Installer).
Discussed:
        This particular module (Bundle::Installer) has been discussed on
#perl on DALnet.  It was very well received.  It is also in very wide use
in-house.
