First of all, the module I have is not a development version. It's as 
production-ready as the original. Secondly, I don't see the point of 
uploading my own version, as it won't get properly indexed by search.cpan.org 
and friends and won't be installed by CPAN.pm/CPANPLUS.pm by default.

Consider Pod::DocBook for example:

http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&query=pod%3A%3Adocbook

search.cpan.org still finds the old distribution by Alligator Descartes that 
wasn't updated since 1999. However, there's a newer version:

http://cpan-sj.viaverio.com/authors/id/N/NA/NANDU/

So it would just be a waste of time.

I already sent him a letter, to which he as well as modules@ and 
module-authors@ were corresponded. He was also CCed on the rest of the 
conversation, including this message. If he can and wishes to respond, then I 
already did the best for him to do so.

I could wait, but the question is - how long? Are their pre-defined policies 
for adopting a module, when it hasn't been maintained in a long time (and 
requires maintenance) and there is someone who volunteers to maintain it?

There's:

http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq7.html#How-do-I-adopt-or-take-over-a-module-already-on-CPAN%3f

The first step is to:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Write to modules@perl.org explaining what you did to contact the current 
maintainer. The PAUSE admins will also try to reach the maintainer.

Well, I tried to contact him by sending him an email to an address which was 
the only one I could find on the web. So I ask the PAUSE admins to also try 
and reach him.

They can already do that by pulling the source from the subversion repository.
