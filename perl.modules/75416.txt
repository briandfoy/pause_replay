Subject: Module submission HTML::Barcode

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Barcode
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Render HTML representations of barcodes
  userid:      MSTRAT (Mark A. Stratman)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    https://github.com/mstratman/HTML-Barcode

  similar:
    GD::Barcode PostScript::Barcode

  rationale:

    This distribution provides a way to render barcodes without the
    need for an image or postscript library, using HTML.

    It also provides a simple API and hierarchy that make it easy to
    add more HTML::Barcode::* formats.

    I've also begun talks (and will start more in the near future) with
    other developers to encourage and/or help move the data logic from
    GD::Barcode:* into the Barcode::* (or other appropriate) namespace,
    leaving HTML::Barcode and GD::Barcode responsible for only
    rendering. I haven't yet investigated how PostScript::Barcode is
    doing it.

  enteredby:   MSTRAT (Mark A. Stratman)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 30 02:15:59 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Barcode         RdpOp Render HTML representations of barcodes      MSTRAT
