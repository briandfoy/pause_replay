I have some requests for the module list / CPAN maintainers.

- - I uploaded a new version of Convert::Recode to CPAN on the suggestion
of its author.  Please reassign ownership of this module to EDAVIS so
that the new version shows up in the main listing.  The original author
GAAS is not maintaining it any more.  The new entry is:

Convert::
::Recode Rdpf? Mapping functions between character sets    EDAVIS

- - I have a module Log::TraceMessages which does show up in
modules/by-module/Log/.  But only version 1.0.  Version 1.1 which I
uploaded to my author directory a while ago does not appear.

Could somebody explain how I can get Log-TraceMessages-1.1.tar.gz
to appear in by-module/Log/ as well as my author directory.  In other
words, please consider this message to be prefixed by

    use diagnostics;

TIA,

- --
