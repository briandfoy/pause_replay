Planning to Contribute:

I have a module that creates PayPal buttons, and validates the Instant Payment
Notification that PayPal sends back.  This allows easy integration of PayPal
into payment forms which previously only could support Credit Cards.  This
makes using paypal for things like software downloads, or in my case
conference registrations easier, because the user can see if their payment
has succeeded or failed instantly.  You can see it currently working at
https://www.cansecwest.com/register.cgi.
Probably the best name for this module is Business::PayPal as it doesn't 
really share any of the fundamentals of the Business::OnlinePayment hierarchy.

I also have another module which I hacked up while writing the PayPal module
which adds the retrieval of the x509 certificate to https requests so that
verification of the authenticity of the remote server can be done.  It's
some minor tweaks and a little bit of extra code on a couple of the functions
in Net::SSLeay but it does change the interface a bit.  I call it
Net::SSLeay::Cert but that's mostly because it's short and I couldn't think
of anything better.
