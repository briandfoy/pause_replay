search.cpan.org will also show this module.

But now both search and PAUSE support the private: entry in META.yml
files that Module::Build and MakeMaker can create. If you mark the
examples/ directory as private then neither will look in that directory
for anything

Of course you will have to add a META.yml file an upload a new release
