PAUSE doesn't reserve sub namespaces, so registering "FlintHoldings" won't prevent
anyone from using that name in other modules. If that's not what you are trying to do,
maybe we can help you come up with a name that describes what's in your module. We
typically try to name modules after what they can do for the user instead of their source. :)
