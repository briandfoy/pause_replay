Hi, I was interested in possibly contributing my loginMD5.pm
module to CPAN.

my name is Alan Raetz
my email is alanraetz@chicodigital.com
my web site is chicodigital.com (although the MD5 project is on
sourceforge at http://perl-md5-login.sourceforge.net/)

a good user name would be "alanraetz"

This project implements an MD5-based encryption scheme for Perl/CGI
applications on both the client browser (using JavaScript MD5) and the
server (using Digest::MD5).
Since this is a security-related module, and I'm not a security
expert, I'd definitely like to get as much feedback as possible.
This module implements an algorithm that is clearly not 100% secure,
but I think it has advantages over .htaccess.

http://perl-md5-login.sourceforge.net/

It can be downloaded from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-md5-login/

I've already gotten some useful feedback, but any additional comments
would be welcome.
I think it is just a matter of clearly stating the shortcomings of
this module.

thanks,

-alan
