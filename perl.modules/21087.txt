The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Heap::Base
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Virtual base class for simple Heap modules
  userid:      THOSPEL (Ton Hospel)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org mailinglist

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'd like to claim Heap::Base as a place to put baseclasses for the
    module family Heap::Number and Heap::String (whose request are still
    pending).

    I could of course go for a shared base like Heap::Simple under
    which I would then put Heap::Simple::Base, Heap::Simple::Number and
    Heap::Simple::String, but then usage would get enormously long,
    like:

    use Heap::Simple::Number::Hash

    which is overkill for what is meant as a very basic set of modules.

    I could also put the base classes under e.g. Heap::Number, but that
    would be extremely ugly (Heap/Number.pm would inherit from
    Heap/Number/Base.pm, as would Heap::String).

    The actual name is not so important, since these baseclasses would
    only be used directly by people making new modules in the
    Heap::Number style, so I would be happy with something like
    Heap::Simple instead of Heap::Base too.

    But since the Heap namespace is still rather empty even after all
    these years, Heap::Base doesn't seem to unreasonable to me.

The resulting entry would be:

Heap::
::Base            bdpOp Virtual base class for simple Heap modules   THOSPEL
