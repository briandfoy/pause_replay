     why:

    writing a lot of perl code in OpenBSD, I have some short snippets
    that could turn into useful modules, such as some design patterns
    helpers (composite and autocache), a signal framework, and the
    beginning of a "lightweight" filetemp clone that doesn't pull in 10s
    of dependencies, and hooks into the signal framework to clean up
    correctly every time.
