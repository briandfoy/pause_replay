The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       What
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Find out about running services (MTA, etc)
  userid:      TPG (Toni Prug)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::SMTP

  rationale:

    It has been the case on few ocassion that I needed to find out what
    MTA is running on a given server. On this ocassion, testing of
    another package (called Luka) that i'm working on depends on whether
    Exim (or possibly Postfix) are running. This is because Luka reports
    to syslog and attempts to deliver exceptions&reports as events - via
    email at the moment. Since different MTAs report to syslog in totaly
    different manner, i had to to be sure what MTA runs in order to be
    able to test important parts of Luka package functionality. Hence
    What::MTA module that in its first release implements MTA detection
    for Exim, Postfix, Sendmail, Courier, XMail, MasqMail, and "What" as
    its root namespace. I'm hoping that when someone would need to
    discover some other service, implementing other protocols (like FTP,
    DNS, HTTP, LDAP, POP3, etc) could happen under "What" namespace. So
    that we end up with a service discovery suite, like What::FTP,
    What::POP3, etc. To start with, I did look for existing rootlevel
    namespace to put new MTA discovery module under, but couldn't find
    suitable one.

The resulting entry would be:

What              RdpOg Find out about running services (MTA, etc)   TPG
