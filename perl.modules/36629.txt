Subject: Module submission Tk::Playlist
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, crakrjack@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Playlist
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: HList widget with "playlist" editing ability
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Years ago in several bars and coffeeshops during the groovebot
    project

  similar:
    Tk::HList

  rationale:

    Tk::Playlist is part of a project I embarked on 5 years ago (and
    have maintained a little bit here or there since), a database-driven
    networked music server with a Tk client-side interface. Tonight, I
    was looking through my old code, thinking about refitting the
    project for public release, when I realized that this little bit of
    useful code was easily to split out of the main tree. So here it is,
    I hope you like it.

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::Playlist        RdpOp HList widget with "playlist" editing ability CRAKRJACK
