Request to register new user

fullname: J. Bobby Lopez

     why:

    I've been a perl programmer for many years. Fairly active on the
    Toronto Perl Mongers mailing list, and generally enjoy (modern) perl
    programming. I should have set up a PAUSE account a long time ago,
    but never got around to it :)

    Yes, the reason for registering the PAUSE account is because I
    intend to contribute to the CPAN. Do I need to have a module ready
    to go before I register for a PAUSE account?

    One module that I do hope to add is a module that makes it easy to
    convert Freemind
    (http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) mind-map
    output (XML) to clean Perl data-structures, and vice-versa. I have
    working code for this (use it quite often), but it has not yet been
    structured appropriately for CPAN.

    Please also note that other services, such as metacpan.org, require
    connecting to a PAUSE account for certain user-account related
    actions, such as profile configuration.
