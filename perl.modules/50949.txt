[snip relevant quote]

You're right. Further down, there's a passage about all code on CPAN 
being free of charge. I think I misremembered that it stated something 
akin to "modules need to be 'free'" or shouldn't be on CPAN.

Personally, I consider the existence of non-free code on CPAN bad even 
if just because the mirror sites donate their bandwidth to something 
they possibly can't even use.

Anyhow, that's just my opinion and not what the FAQ states. We needn't 
even remove anything. By not doing anything at all, it'll end up that 
way. The author clearly stated that either may Dave Rolsky apologize 
(for whatever) or he removes his work from CPAN. That's sad. What I 
tried to say is that I don't feel like a mediator.
