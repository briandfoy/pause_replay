[ cc'ed to the modperl list. Geoffreys original message is at

To me it looks very specific for one application and not too extensible.
Also there already is three gazillion template systems doing similar
things. I would think that some of them could be used (or changed) to work
like yours?

Anyway, if you upload it ::Wrapper doesn't really say much about what it
is doing. Apache::SimpleReplace or something would maybe be better.
