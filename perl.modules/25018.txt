I'm still waiting for a response on Test::MultiFork.

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

    I wrote this so that I could test for deadlocks in my persistent
    object store.

    NAME Test::MultiFork - Test suite support for multi-process
    programs

    SYNOPSIS use Test::MultiFork;

    ($name, $letter, $number) = procname([new name]) lockcommon()
    @oldvalues = getcommon() setcommon(@newvalues) unlockcommon()

    use Test::MultiFork qw(groupwait setgroup dofork)

    groupwait([$tag]) $oldgroup = setgroup([$newgroup])
    dofork(fork_specification)

    DESCRIPTION This test module is to support creating test suites for
    programs and modules that run as multiple processes and do mostly
    blocking I/O.

    Test::MultiFork handles the forking so that it can set up each
    child to coordinate the output. The output from each child fork is
    redirected to the parent. Each fork produces normal test output --
    possibly using normal test modules like Test::Simple. The output is
    collected and rewritten by the parent process.

    Each child fork has a letter and number designation. The forks are
    created by "dofork()". Dofork takes a specifiction on the form:
    ([a-z](\d*))+. That is to say, one or more lower-case letters, each
    optionally followd by a number. The number says how many children to
    fork for that letter (default one). The specifier "ab2c3" means have
    one "a" child (numbered 1); two "b" children (numbered 1, 2); and
    three "c" children (numbered 1, 2, 3).

    To aid in writing tests, Test::MultiFork will pass data between the
    child processes. The data is test-writer defined.

    SOURCE FILTER Test::MultiFork acts as a source filter on your code.
    It does this so that it can do lock-step execution control.

    The source filtering is controlled with pseudo labels. The labels
    must be the only thing on the line. The main source control is a
    label like "FORK_abc:". This label tells Test::MultiFork how many
    times to fork (see above). Whatever comes after the "FORK_" and
    before the ":" is a fork specifier.

    With a "FORK_abc:" label, varient execution labels are enabled.
    Varient execution labels must be all lowercase. This is to allow you
    to use something different for you loop control labels. This module
    can be used without putting in any special labels.

    Outside of a function, a varient execution label does will
    synchronize all the program forks to that line of code. As each fork
    reaches that line, it will stop and wait until all forks get there.
    At that point, all of the forks will start up and run again.

    Inside or outside of a function, once a varient execution labels is
    seen, source code is turned on or off (commented out) depending on
    if the process fork letter is in the label.

    For example:

    # let's fork 5 times FORK_abc2d:

    ab: print "I'm an 'a' or 'b' process\n";

    cd: print "I'm an 'c' or 'd' process\n";

    abcd: print "we are all running in lockstep\n";

    sub xyz { a: print "only a does something in this function\n"; }

    Since the processes run in lockstep (synchronized at the labels),
    loops controls must cover all processes.

    In addition to fork() and the varient execution labels, you can
    override a default signal selection for debugging. By default the
    "USR1" signal is used to aid debugging: if the parent process bails
    out, it will send "USR1" signals to all the children to ask them to
    print out some diagnostics. The special label "SIGNAL_xyz:" changes
    which signal to use. Substitute "xyz" with your choice of signal or
    "none" to disable this feature.

    FUNCTIONS lockcommon() Sets a lock on the shared common data.

    getcommon() Returns the current value of the common data. The
    common data is an array. In scalar context, the first element is
    returned. getcommon does not care if the common data is locked.

    setcommon(@newvalues) Sets the value of the common data to the new
    values. Dies if common data lock isn't held.

    unlockcommon() Releases a lock on the shared common data. Dies if
    the lock isn't already held.

    groupwait([$tag]) Wait for all process forks in the process group
    to get reach this same synchronization point as designated by the
    $tag. The default tag is the current source file name and line
    number. All processes start in the "default" group. This is the
    function used to implement the varient execution lockstep
    synchronization.

    setgroup([$newgroup]) With a $newgroup, changes the process' group
    identity. All processes start in group "default". Returns the old
    group name.

    dofork($fork_specification) Fork off children processes. The parent
    process becomes the special-purpose test coordinator. The
    specification is as detailed in the DESCRIPTION above.

    INTEGRATION WITH TEST::* Test::Simple and Test::More encourage you
    to specify a test plan at compile time. Make sure that dofork() is
    called before the test plan is specified.

    When using Test::MultiFork's source filter in conjunction with
    Test::Builder anything built on top of it (eg: Test::Simple or
    Test::More) put Test::MultiFork first in the "use" list.
