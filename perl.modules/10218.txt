The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::ObjectHandler
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Organises variables controlling Tk widgets
  userid:      CAILLTE (Simon Parsons)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)

  rationale:

    I started writing this after a discussion on the perlmonks
    chatterbox. A lot of people tend to find the number of variables
    needed to handle the widgets in a Tk program confusing and, while a
    number of soloutions are possible none of the ones suggested are
    really general purpose and all required an overhead of coding.

    The whole idea of this module is to remove the work required in
    organising and structuring the variables. The fact that it works on
    a heirarchy basis means that you can access variables like
    $mw->frame1->label1 and $mw->frame2->label1 etc meaning that similar
    frames, windows, etc can have identical sub-widget names which can
    be a much lighter load on the memory! (coder not computer ;))
