The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SelectLoop
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: The "select" Loop of the Korn & Bash Shells
  userid:      YUMPY (Tim Maher)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.thepen.com/186913.html

  similar:
    Switch.pm

  rationale:

    This module adds the "select" loop of the UNIX shells to Perl
    through source filtering. Ultimately, I think it belongs in the perl
    core, but initially, it needs to mature as a separate entity.

    There doesn't seeem to be any existing namespace that's devoted to
    control structures for Perl. The most similar module, Damian's
    Switch.pm, was granted its own root-level namespace, so I figure
    this module should get the same treatment.

    Ultimately, perhaps we should have a root-level namespace of
    "source-filtered flow-control extensions to Perl", providing for
    names like PerlExt::SelectLoop.pm. Maybe this would be a good time
    to institute that change!

The resulting entry would be:

SelectLoop        adphp The "select" Loop of the Korn & Bash Shells  YUMPY
