 Hi,

 I'm user LDACHARY. I'd like to contribute with the Text::Unaccent modu=
le.

Text::Unaccent is a module that provides functions to remove accents
from a string.  For instance the string =E9t=E9 will become ete.  The
charset of the input string is specified as an argument. The input is
converted to UTF-16 using iconv(3), accents are stripped and the
result is converted back to the original charset. The iconv --list
command on GNU/Linux will show all charset supported.

 It is a recent module and I cannot provide proofs that it is widely us=
ed.
I've checked that it has no equivalent at present. It is built on top o=
f
a C library available at http://www.senga.org/unac/html/ but it is self=

contained.
