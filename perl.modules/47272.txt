Hello, I currently maintain the namespaces:  Filesys::Df, Filesys::Statvfs, 
and Filesys::Statfs. All three come in one  distribution and can't be installed 
individually, although I could break out the  Statfs and Statvfs modules if I 
had or wanted to.  

Anyway I want to register two new modules to support the system calls  
fstatvfs and fstatfs. My question is, should I move all the stat system calls  under 
the Filesys::Df namespace (for instance Filesys::Df::Statvfs) since they  
will all be in one distribution, or should I continue to register them under  
Filesys directly? I am thinking moving everything under Filesys::Df  would  be 
cleanest solution. 
 
Also do you think there would be any value in breaking out the individual  
stat modules, or should I just leave everything in one package? Filesys::Df is  
dependent on all of them, so if I did that, I would still have to add all of  
them to the Filesys::Df package anyway.
 
Thanks,
Ian Guthrie
