The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Bricks
  DSLIP:       bmpOb
  description: Build web sites without writing code or HTML
  userid:      PETERMCD (Peter McDermott)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailing lists and other services are available from
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/bricks

  similar:
    HTML::Mason HTML::Tagset Image::Magick Digest::MD5 MD5 Mime::Base64
    Storable Apache::Constants Apache::Cookie Apache::Session
    Apache::Request Apache::Util Apache::File

  rationale:

    While currently Bricks Site Builder only runs under Apache +
    mod_perl, it's planned to be ported to CGI. As such, the more
    general HTML:: namespace seems appropriate.

    Bricks is a web-based design tool that uses a select-and-submit
    interface to allow users to build assemblies (pages) of dynamic
    objects. A user can build a web page containing static text and
    images as well as dynamic objects like photo albums and weblogs. All
    the objects, static or dynamic, are really mason components (perl
    objects).

    Bricks has a long way to go, but it is usable for simple vanity
    sites. My site, www.pmcdermott.com is an example.
