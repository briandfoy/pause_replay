Hello everybody!

[[ Please keep me CC'ed, I'm already on too many lists. Thank you. ]]


In Games::Hack::Live (http://search.cpan.org/~pmarek/Games-Hack-Live-0.4/)
I'd like to include a small script for /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin), to
allow easier running of the "module" (which is really a script).

[[   I know about the scripts part of CPAN - but I had the impression that
it's not really used, and read that "a lot" of scripts are uploaded as
modules. ]]

Is there some easy way to have some script installed to /usr(local/)?/bin,
or is that generally considered bad form?


Thank you for all answers.


Regards,

Phil
