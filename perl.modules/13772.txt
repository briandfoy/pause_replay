Is it possible for a module to have two different names?  If so, I'd like
to make "PersistentPerl" an alias for CGI::SpeedyCGI.

The problem is that some people don't realize that SpeedyCGI supports
general purpose persistent perl programs, not just CGI programs.  This
support has been there from the beginning, but not well publicized, so
it's been overlooked.

I asked the users on the speedycgi mailing list for their opinions on
how to make this support better known.  The best suggestion I think
was to name the distribution pperl, but since that name is taken, I'd
like to call it PersistentPerl.

Is there a way to make an alias under this name?  If not, then I'd like to
upload it separately under this name.

Thanks,
Sam Horrocks
