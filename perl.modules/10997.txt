The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::LDAP::Exchange
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Easily query Exchange's (5+)  LDAP interface
  userid:      JBISBEE (Jeff Bisbee)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    Where is the best place - would Perlmonks work?

  similar:
    Did not find any or do not know of any

  rationale:

    This is a wrapper around Net::LDAP talking to Exchange's 5+ LDAP
    server

    I wanted to share an easy way to query Exchange and get company
    information out. I created the inital code because I wanted to
    create a mutt alias file will everyone in the company so I wouldn't
    have to switch to windows to look up an e-mail

  enteredby:   JBISBEE (Jeff Bisbee)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr  3 16:15:52 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::LDAP::
::Exchange        adpOp Easily query Exchange's (5+)  LDAP interface JBISBEE
