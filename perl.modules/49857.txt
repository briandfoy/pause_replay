The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Clutter
  DSLIP:       bdcOl
  description: Simple GL-based canvas library
  userid:      EBASSI (Emmanuele Bassi)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglist: clutter@o-hand.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    Clutter is a GObject based library for creating fast, visually rich
    graphical user interfaces. It is intended for creating single window
    heavily stylised applications such as media box uiâs,
    presentations or kiosk style programs in preference to regular
    âdesktopâ style applications.

    It is intended to mask the developer from the low-level OpenGL API
    by using objects (actors) on a top-level canvas (stage), and using
    object oriented programming techniques instead of an imperative
    approach.

  enteredby:   EBASSI (Emmanuele Bassi)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul 16 14:39:32 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Clutter           bdcOl Simple GL-based canvas library               EBASSI
