The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Linux::KernelSort
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Sort a list of Linux kernel versions.
  userid:      OGASAWARA (leann ogasawara)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    crucible-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    The reason I chose this namespace, Linux::KernelSort, is that it is
    fairly descriptive of what the module does. It specifically sorts a
    list of strings which represents Linux kernel versions. In terms of
    the uniqueness of my approach, it is the only module I'm aware of
    that sorts Linux kernel versions, taking into account not only the
    2.6.x mainline kernel releases, but also -rc, -git, -mm, -scsi-rc,
    and -scsi-rc-fixes releases as well. I simply cycle through the list
    of kernel versions, give each version a "ranking" and then use a
    simple shell sort algorithm to compare and sort the rankings thus
    generating a sorted list of kernel versions. I believe this module
    should be listed in the module list because I know of other
    individuals who would like to use this module and it would be nice
    if it were easily searchable/accessable.

The resulting entry would be:

Linux::
::KernelSort      adpOg Sort a list of Linux kernel versions.        OGASAWARA
