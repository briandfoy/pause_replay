I would like to schedule BENSOMMER for removal. It has never been
used, so the directory was never created and it would be easy to drop
it. Would anybody lobby for letting people have multiple accounts?
I'll always support it if people have *some* reason, so I would ask
Ben if it's OK for him to remove the second account. But not if it is
just an accident.
