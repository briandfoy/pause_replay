The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ReleaseAction
  DSLI:        bdph
  description: Trigger actions on destruction of a handle
  userid:      TILLY (Ben Tilly)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=72887

  similar:
    SelectSaver

  rationale:

    I called this ReleaseAction because it sets up actions that will
    fire when something is released.

    This makes it trivial to take advantage of reliable destructors to
    have a customized action take place on destruction of an object
    without having to write a class with a constructor and destructor.
    For instance the functionality of SelectSaver as a one-liner:

    { my $hold_select = on_release {select shift} select FILE; # *FILE
    is selected but we will revert to the old # selection at the end of
    the block }

    I called this ReleaseAction because it creates an action that is
    fired upon release. I do not see any modules that provide similar
    functionality, and I do not think that there will be any modules
    built on it. So I chose a name in the root space. But I would be
    happy to change it to any other name that people think a better fit.

    I am submitting it for consideration on CPAN mostly because Randal
    Schwartz' first reaction on seeing it was to ask whether I was
    planning to do that. I think that it is useful enough to justify
    listing because it nicely encapsulates most of the things that I
    think people need reliable destruction mechanics for in production
    code (as opposed to debugging).

The resulting entry would be:

ReleaseAction     bdph Trigger actions on destruction of a handle   TILLY
