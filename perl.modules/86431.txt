The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NNexus
  DSLIP:       Mmpho
  description: Auto-linking for Mathematical Concepts
  userid:      DGINEV (Deyan Ginev)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    planetary-dev@googlegroups.com, https://github.com/dginev/nnexus,
    https://github.com/dginev/nnexus/issues

  similar:

  rationale:

    NNexus (https://github.com/dginev/nnexus) has been an instrumental
    component to the PlanetMath.org math encyclopedia for just about a
    decade. It has grown in functionality since then and after a change
    in developers in 2012 has been reimplemented in almost-modern Perl 5
    (can't be bothered to moo for now). In the process of
    reimplementation, the application has been specifically redesigned
    as a self-contained general-purpose Perl library.

    The package is already available on Github, has a test suite with
    good coverage and comes bundled with a database of 50,000 concept
    entries, yet still modest in size (~10MB).

    The module is hence useful beyond the PlanetMath project, as it
    provides general purpose data mining for mathematical concepts, as
    well as modular annotation and indexing utilities. The package comes
    with a versatile hybrid interface: - procedural, exported from the
    main NNexus package - object oriented, via the lower-level
    NNexus::Job class. - remote and RESTful, via the nnexus web
    application, written in Mojolicious.

    NNexus has also been published on several occasions in
    peer-reviewed journals of the Computer Science community, which can
    be accessed through a quick google search.

The resulting entry would be:

NNexus            Mmpho Auto-linking for Mathematical Concepts       DGINEV
