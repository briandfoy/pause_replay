Request to register new user

     why:

    I've been using Perl since 1998 and have been sorely remiss in
    participating in community building. I'm looking to both help other
    developers with their maintenance as well as contribute new modules
    in unifying dynamic automated website interaction, testing, and
    automated website exploration.
