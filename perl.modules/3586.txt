I think GTop will work - I'll try that.  Unfortunately it's very difficult
to find because it's up at the root (why?), and its readme doesn't contain
words like "memory" or "process" so it didn't show up in a search.

Wouldn't Sys::GTop would be preferable to a root-level GTop.  At least
Sys would sort-of categorize at as interfacing to the operating system.
Putting in the root doesn't categorize it at all.
