The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Alter
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: Alter Ego Objects
  userid:      ANNO (Anno Siegel)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    Hash::Util::FieldHash

  rationale:

    Alter presents an alternative to the inside-out technique of object
    construction in that Alter-based classes support black-box
    inheritance. The main advantages are support of the same data model
    as traditional Perl objects, and being natively garbage-collected
    and thread-safe.

    In my humble opinion it ought to revolutionize(*) Perl OOP, making
    it what it was meant to be and never quite was. So I wanted an
    unencumbered, snappy name. If that makes it un-registrable, that's
    bad. I did consider alternatives (module naming is hard) but
    couldn't convince myself that anything else would do. I admit that I
    didn't consider I'd have to write this bit of apology :)

    The relation to Hash::Util::FieldHash is that both modules support
    construction of freely inheritable classes (black-box-inheritance).
    HashUtil::FieldHash is based on the inside-out technique, Alter
    brings its own primitives.

    Anno

    (*) I know it won't, not as an XS-based CPAN module. It might have
    a chance as a code module, but the timing is bad with 5.10 on the
    doorstep and Alter fresh from the drawing-board.

The resulting entry would be:

Alter             Rdcfp Alter Ego Objects                            ANNO
