God forbid I discourage people seperating modules because of design 
reasons. I have more than my fair share of modules I've split apart 
because not everybody needed all of it, and I didn't want to burdon 
people will all the additional dependencies.

My point is mainly "what you said"...

The data set for LineGraph would seem to be an implementation details.

What IS bad is when you have two mutually-dependany modules. If you 
can't use TK::LineGraph without TK::LineGraphDataset and you can't use 
the latter without the former either, then they are logically one thing 
and they belong together.
