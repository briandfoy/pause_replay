From: steve.hay@uk.radan.com (Steve Hay)

[I posted this message to Andreas Koenig last week but haven't (yet) had 
any reply, so I'm trying here instead. I'm really surprised that there's 
nothing on PAUSE about who to email to take over maintenance of 
abandoned modules. Or have I missed something somewhere?]

I have a minor patch for the XML-Encoding distribution to make it work 
with bleadperl, but I've been unable to contact the distribution's only 
current maintainer, Clark Cooper (COOPERCL). I've tried all four email 
addresses that I could find for him, and all four returned with 550 
(Unknown user) messages:

clark@coopercc.net
coopercc@netheaven.com
coopercl@sch.ge.com
cccooper@ltionline.com

I've also contacted Matt Sergeant (MSERGEANT), who has taken over 
XML-Parser from Clark, to see if he had any other contact details but he 
replied that he hasn't, and in fact has also failed in previous attempts 
to contact Clark himself.

I would therefore like to get at least co-maint permissions on 
XML-Encoding so that I can release a fixed version.

Thanks,
Steve (SHAY)
