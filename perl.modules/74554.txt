sorry, we don't have any special avenues of finding people. Considering 
that Andrew (in CC despite me expecting it to bounce) hasn't been 
uploading releases since 2006, I just assigned co-maintenance 
permissions to you for his POE-Component-Client-Traceroute module.

You can now upload new versions.

Net-Traceroute-PurePerl was originally written by Tom Scanlan. Andrew 
just has co-maintenance permissions. Can you try reaching Tom instead? 
If that fails, we'll do the same trick again.

Andrew, if you read this and object, please note that this is a 
reversible action.

Best regards,
Steffen
