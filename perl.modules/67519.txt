The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Random::Seed
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Seed a PRNG automatically or manually
  userid:      FANGLY (Florent Angly)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math-Random-MT-Auto

  rationale:

    A shortcoming of Perl is that, as far as I know, there is no way to
    get what value was used to seed the pseudo random number generator
    (PRNG). This capacity is essential in science to repeat experiments
    where random number are involved.

    The proposed Math::Random::Seed module will allow to seed the Perl
    standard PRNG (or any module's PRNG that overloads the Perl standard
    PRNG) manually, or do it automatically. It will be possible to
    retrieve the value of the seed used for an automatically seeded
    PRNG.

  enteredby:   FANGLY (Florent Angly)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep  3 22:48:29 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Random::
::Seed            bdpfp Seed a PRNG automatically or manually        FANGLY
