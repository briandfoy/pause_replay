The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::ShapeFile
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: GIS system shape file interface
  userid:      JASONK (Jason Kohles)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    nothing similar found in perl

  rationale:

    This is a very common file format, but there seems to be very
    little in the way of programming support for it (apparently the vast
    majority of people using the files don't use them with anything but
    ARC/INFO). Originally I called it GIS::ShapeFile, but Geo seems to
    be the appropriate top-level space for GIS related modules.
    (Although there is also a Geography top-level, most of the actual
    map related modules seem to be in Geo).

  enteredby:   JASONK (Jason Kohles)
  enteredon:   Wed Jan 22 15:31:20 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::ShapeFile       RdpOp GIS system shape file interface              JASONK
