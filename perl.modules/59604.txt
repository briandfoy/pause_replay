If you want to be an ass instead of seriously trying to produce the
best work that you can, I have better things to do than help you.

Perhaps your thinking of your past expereince with something else,
especially since you've only been a registered PAUSE account since
August 2007. You're well on your way to be completely ignored and you
barely just got here. I certainly wouldn't mind not spending the five
minutes each day trying to keep up with all of your registration
requests.

In the few times that you've written to this list, you and I have
exchanged messages. You might haved missed that I register almost all
of your modules without comment, even when you've submitted several a
day. You might have also missed the parts where I've told you that I'm
trying to help you choose the best name possible so that more people
find your modules. Maybe you lost some of those responses in spam
filtering.

But, think about it a bit longer, perhaps. Maybe something will come to
mind when you are least expecting it. That might work better for some
of your other modules, too. 

If someone suggests to you that there is a better name for a module and
you ignore the advice and none of the PAUSE admins register your
module, well, who's to blame?
