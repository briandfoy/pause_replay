The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OOP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Assist in Object Oriented Perl Programming.
  userid:      MILAN (Milan Adamovsky)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    The CPAN module's discussion forum. If demand will grow I will build
    a separate website for it. I might develop an area under
    www.perlscript.com for it.

  similar:
    None that I know of.

  rationale:

    I think this namespace will make it easy for both advanced users
    and novice users to find other modules that pertain to Object
    Oriented programming in PERL - thus hopefully encouraging everyone
    to use OOP rather than shy away from it. I still get upset when I
    head still today that PERL is not Object Oriented...grrr! I think my
    module is a good starting point, but I'd be interested in porting
    many OO classes from other OO languages to give PERL a richer and
    easier OO development environment. Hopefully there are more Perl
    developers of the same mindset.

The resulting entry would be:

OOP               RdpOp Assist in Object Oriented Perl Programming.  MILAN
