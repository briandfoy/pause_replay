Malcom,

I would like to do some cleanup on the module Net::Daemon. There are
some minor outstanding RT bugs that need to be corrected, and I would
like to get a corrected META.yml associated with it. At present, it
has the wrong version in it.

I notice that the module hasn't had any attention since June of 2007.
If you're open to it, I'd like to offer to be co-maintainer to help
apply the obvious pending patches in the RT queue and get the updates
pushed out to CPAN.

I'm not really looking to make any changes so much as apply low
hanging fruit fixes hanging out in RT.

If you're open to this, you can just add TODDR as a co-maintainer in
PAUSE and I will do the needful from there.

This link shows what modules you have associated with this module.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
