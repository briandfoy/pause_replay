Okay, if anyone knows who that person is, let's transfer the modules to
that PAUSE ID. I'll ask around about that. However, ...

Right now NI-S owns a lot of the modules in Tk, as does GSLONDON. I
figured we treat Nick's account as if we were still there until someone
wants to take the primary maintainer permissions on those modules.

If the right names are listed as co-maintainers in the mailing list, I
can reindex the Tk modules to get rid of the unauthorized markings. I
figured listing those names would be the easiest way to do that.

Do you have another way that you think we should do this?
