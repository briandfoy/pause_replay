The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Combine
  DSLIP:       Rdphg
  description: Focused Web crawling
  userid:      AARDO (Anders Ardö)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://combine.it.lth.se/; Comming to Sourceforge

  similar:

  rationale:

    Combine is an existing open system for crawling Internet resources.
    It can be used both as a general and focused crawler.

    Its is implemented in Perl and is easily configured for most types
    of Web-crawling. Users are requesting it to be made available from
    CPAN.

    See http://combine.it.lth.se/

    Features include: higly configurable, integrated automated topic
    classifier for focused crawling mode, possibility to use any topic
    classifier (if provided as a Perl PlugIn module) in focused crawling
    mode

  enteredby:   AARDO (Anders Ardö)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov 28 07:06:23 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Combine           Rdphg Focused Web crawling                         AARDO
