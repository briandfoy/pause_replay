The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PANT
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Ant/Nant like support for batch building
  userid:      JONIONS (Julian Onions)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm not really sure where this should go. Development seems
    logical, but most of that is perl related. This modules is closer to
    a Meta-Make like process. It attempts to do what ant and nant do for
    java and c# respectively, but without the description laguage being
    XML, rather being perl itself. In that sense its making a sort of
    meta language. Its best described as ANT meets Test::More...

The resulting entry would be:

PANT              cdpfp Ant/Nant like support for batch building     JONIONS
