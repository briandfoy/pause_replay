The recommendation of 11 stems from very old unixes that didn't allow
more than 14 characters for a filename (3 discounted for ".pm"). I
believe, these systems aren't that widespread anymore.

OTOH, StormTrack doesn't sound completely wrong does it?

I just did this:

% perl -MCPAN -e shell
[...]
cpan> m /Geo::/
Module          Geo::METAR      (J/JZ/JZAWODNY/Geo-METAR-1.12.tar.gz)
Module          Geo::Storm_Tracker (C/CA/CARPENTER/Storm-Tracker_0.01.tar.gz)
Module          Geo::Storm_Tracker::Advisory (C/CA/CARPENTER/Storm-Tracker_0.01.tar.gz)
Module          Geo::Storm_Tracker::Data (C/CA/CARPENTER/Storm-Tracker_0.01.tar.gz)
Module          Geo::Storm_Tracker::Main (C/CA/CARPENTER/Storm-Tracker_0.01.tar.gz)
Module          Geo::Storm_Tracker::Parser (C/CA/CARPENTER/Storm-Tracker_0.01.tar.gz)
Module          Geo::WeatherNOAA (MSOLOMON/Geo-WeatherNOAA-4.33.tar.gz)

Looks good.  What did you try?

Geo::GNUPlot maybe? If it satisfies the needs of people drawing the
earth with GNU-Plot, this sounds a natural name. The doubled "Geo" in
the name is of no use. And Graphics? This isn't really core Graphics,
it is applied Graphics and as such it may be listed where it is
applied. IMHO.
