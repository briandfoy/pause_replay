The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Forge
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: Rich Web Application Framework
  userid:      FPORCHER (Franck PORCHER)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    YAPC::EU::2005 (under CGI::Forge)

  similar:
    TT, CGI::Application, Maypole, HTML::Mason

  rationale:

    WWW::Forge is a OO framework aimed at streamlining the process of
    developing reusable, robust, flexible, and cost effective
    sophisticated web applications.

    WWW::Forge is comprised of several related modules to provide the
    developer with the strong semantic primitive needed to easily
    capture the intrinsic properties of web application programming,
    namely :

    - A state machine, to capture and modelize the web application
    navigation logic.

    - A powerful and extensible XML compliant templating system,
    supporting reentrance, data binding, parameter passing, and
    lazy-evaluation, and its compiler to native OO Perl code.

    - A "Registree" language, its compiler and virtual machine engine,
    to provide a unified syntax and interface for publishing and
    accessing the application data from the templates.

    WWW::Forge is also designed to be easily extended through
    subclassing and plugins. Core plugins already exist for
    Authentication, Sessions, Acl(s), Menus, I18n/L10n. Others are "at
    the forge" (data data base access for instance).

    Interesting modules like TT, CGI::Application, Mason, or Maypole
    have been deeply studied. WWW::Forge is a compilation off the best
    ideas that span these modules, plus many on its own, and it's my
    feeling that WWW::Forge goes a step further towards delivering a
    richer and better integrated web development framework, whose the
    name : At the forge of the Web !

    By the way, WWW::Forge has been actively developped since 2002, and
    is in the state of alpha release.
