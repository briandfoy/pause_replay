Subject: Redux:  Devel::Reloader ==> Modules::Reload::Selective
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: chris@thorman.com (Chris Thorman)

Hi Joshua and other esteemed modules members,

Please recall the exchange below from back in July 2000:

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2000-07/msg00246.html

.... in which I requested to upload a module called Devel::Reloader which was similar to your Module::Reload.  You guys on the list helped me realize that Module::Reload::Force or something would be a better name for my module.

Joshua, you perhaps jokingly suggested renaming your module (Module::Reload) to Module::Autoreload presumably so that mine could take the name of yours, which was a kind gesture, but obviously not practical or helpful to those already using your module.

Anyway, eventually there seemed to be no particular further interest in the thread -- see: 

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/w3glimpse/modules?query=reloader&errors=0&case=on&maxfiles=100&maxlines=30

.... and I got busy and never uploaded anything.

Anyway, I'm finally ready to make this module available.

Considering the discussions that were had, I would be happy to rename my module Module::Reload::Selective or some such similar.

If there are no objections, I'll consider that I have tacit approval to do so and will prepare to package it accordingly and upload (I already have a PAUSE ID).

Sincerely,

-chris

Oops :-)

Hm hm.

Agreed.

Or maybe I should rename mine to Module::Autoreload?

do_stuff() if $ENV{TESTING};  # pretty trival

Oh good.  Me too.
