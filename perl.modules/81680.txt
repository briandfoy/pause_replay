It also shouldn't be in the ::Moose pseuod-namespace. To summarise what
I'm saying below in case of tl;dr;

Either (a) document the use of Moose or (b) use Moo. Don't pollute the
module name.

The naming convention for modules using Moose is "don't put it in the name".

I don't think it is either.

As I said already,

  http://metacpan.org/module/Name::Of::Module

shows dependencies so people should already know.

As I said already, I have no argument against you documenting it.

It's just silly to put it in the name.

I run:

  curl -L cpanmin.us | perl - -l$HOME/perl5 Moose

and then go for a coffee.

But, as I say, if you're worried about that, I wrote Moo to provide an
alternative choice that still gives Moose users all the advantages.
