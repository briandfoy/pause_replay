Subject: Module submission Ham::WSPR

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ham::WSPR
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Pull WSPR log data from wsprnet.org
  userid:      MEH (Andy Smith)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module scrapes data from wsprnet.org's database, for use with
    other projects. This was written by myself for a specific purpose,
    and I have tidied it up for general release as it appears that there
    may be a wider use for this module.

    I have chosen to put it under the Ham namespace because it's quite
    a sparsely-populated namespace, and would fit there quite nicely in
    my opinion.

  enteredby:   MEH (Andy Smith)
  enteredon:   Sat Jan 15 19:42:03 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Ham::
::WSPR            adpOp Pull WSPR log data from wsprnet.org          MEH
