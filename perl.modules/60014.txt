     why:

    I wrote a module Unicode::Property::XS which contains many lookup
    tables (In total, 1.8M .o file ) encoding all the unicode properties
    supported by Perl now. It's fast for unicode property lookup which
    can accelerate tasks with heavy property lookup, like text warping,
    language detection, or so.

    I also plan to contribute some other modules in the future, but it
    depends on the actual need and personal plans....
