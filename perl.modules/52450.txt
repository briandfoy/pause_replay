     why:

    I have a port of Apache::Pod to Apache2 I've appropriately named
    "Apache2::Pod" that includes some significant improvements. The
    author of Apache::Pod, Andy Lester suggested that I take over as the
    maintainer for this package. In his words, "...if you want to create
    Apache2::Pod and be the maintainer for it, go ahead. It's not like I
    need to maintain MORE packages. :-)" I also have a number of other
    perl libraries I've written over the years to speed up database
    driven application development and a number of useful scripts that I
    would like to publish in the future.
