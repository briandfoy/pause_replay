SHORT DESCRIPTION:

Math::Variables adds to Math::BigFloat, et al, by creating a variable / value / units / description presentation layer.  
Text / Wiki (mine) / HTML encoding options supported.  Scientific notation presentation supported in standard 
format.

Values are Math::BigFloats and are initialized from engineering notation specifications.

Variables support step-wise calculations.  NaN values cause the intermediate expressions to be discarded (in a 
presentation sense).

Each mathematical operation (+, -, *, /, sqrt(), ^) has the ability to name and identity the resulting intermediate value 
name, units and description.  The default description is the expression which constructed the intermediate variable.

Created by a coder taking college-level physics for coders who want to be generate their homework.  Very useful in 
academic situations where tracking intermediate units is an easily overlooked, yet crucial, step.  It allows for (IMHO) 
clean educational calculators.

PACKAGE JUSTIFICATION:

This is a presentation layer for Math::BigFloats.

PACKAGE READINESS:

I've created the module and tested the pod2html documentation for presentation issues.  An example .cgi is provided 
which takes a series of electric field / force parameters and displays the intermediate and final results based on 
which parameters were provided.  All intermediate calculations are unit-based and documented, providing students 
(and myself) the ability to understand what is happening (in a units-sense) when calculating values.

I'll be validating that my module conforms to the submission guidelines (http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html) 
while waiting for a response to this request.
