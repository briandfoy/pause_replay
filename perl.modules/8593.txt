Subject: and another one, re Docbook

Thanks Tim, Devel::SubXref it is.

Now another one... I'm planning to write some tools for generating
Docbook, which is an SGML markup language for technical documentation.
It's analogous to HTML.  It's widely used for documentation for open
source and other projects.

The first thing I really need is a thing which, given a Perl data 
structure like a hash or a LOL, generates a Docbook table.  A bit like 
HTML::HashTable (one of mine) does for HTML.

There's currently no namespace for Docbook, however there is a
Pod::Docbook.  The SGML namespace seems to be for generalised SGML tools
and stuff.

So, anyone got any complaints about me opening up Docbook::*?

K.
