(It took me close to a year to have one of my modules recognised.)

When I suggested something like this before, I was told that part of the
problem is that you can't just delegate PAUSE admin-ship to just anyone,
since part of the role is to offer advice on module naming -- and there
is a fairly large body of "case law" and precedents and reasons for
doing certain things in certain ways which are difficult to transmit to
new people who would like to begin.

And I can imagine that, say, thirty people with twenty different
opinions might be worse than six people with one opinion, even if the
thirty people give you a quicker turnaround with their "advice".

Yes. This is occasionally a fact of life, unfortunately.

I think the best one can do is prod, gently, every once in a while if no
response has come -- say, every three weeks or so.

Cheers,
