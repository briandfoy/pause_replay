     why:

    Hi, My name is Truc Nguyen. I have been working with PERL as a web
    developer and software engineering for more than ten years. During
    those ten years, I have created many PERL script or module to
    suppose my work. In addition, I also download many PERL files or
    modules from difference sources and one of the main one is CPAN.

    Currently, I have many file that I create for hoppy. I would like
    to donate them the PERL community so people can use them for their
    interest.

    thank you for consideration

    Truc
