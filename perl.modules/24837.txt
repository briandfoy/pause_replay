We have received your article submission. If we decide to use it
in a future issue, we will contact you at the address you've given us.

NOTE: If you've written to us to simply ask us if we'd be interested
in an article that you've written or are going to write, this is the
ONLY reply you will receive. Yes, we are interested. Please send it in.

IMPORTANT: Articles submitted in weird formats (including some
non-ascii word processors and HTML) may not ever make it to us
due to various junk filters. Be safe and make sure your submission
is in ascii text.

EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: Do not submit material to us that has been
submitted or printed elsewhere. You're welcome to do whatever you
want with your article AFTER it appears in 2600 but we ask that
articles sent in to us not be reprints. If two issues of 2600 have
come out since you sent in your article and you still haven't seen
it, it's a safe assumption that we won't be printing it. Please
allow this amount of time to pass before publishing it elsewhere.

Thanks for your interest and support.
