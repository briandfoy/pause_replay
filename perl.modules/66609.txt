Request to register new user

fullname: Lars Stoltenow
  userid: PENMA
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://penma.de
     why:

    Currently work in progress is Weather::WetterInfo - a module to
    retrieve weather information from www.wetter.info. Maybe I'll later
    also upload a library similar to Graph.pm, having less features, but
    with some common features (for now, Dijkstra) being heavily
    optimized for speed (pure Perl though).
