Subject: File::Remove's maintainer is AWOL, no releases for six years; I'd like to take it over.

Hi, I'm interested in taking over maintenance for the CPAN module 
File::Remove.  It was last updated in 1998 by the original author (who 
is no longer available, afaict, by email or on the Internet afaict at 
all).

I've already uploaded a release candidate, File-Remove-0.21_01, that 
makes File::Remove function on non-UNIX, non-"/"-dirsep platforms.  
Tests done by hand pass as before; however, I've been considering the 
dilemma of testing unlink(), and plan to release 0.22 in a few weeks 
with a light, comprehensive test suite.

Please let me know if there's anything further I must do to move this 
request along; I'll delay the release of 0.21 until I've received 
confirmation of the transfer (or until it shows up in RT).  Thanks for 
listening :)

  - R. (RSOD)
