The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RPM::Make
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: cleanly generate an RPM
  userid:      SHARRISON (Scott Harrison)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It will be located at.
    http://cpan.valueclick.com/authors/id/S/SH/SHARRISON/RPM-Tools-0.1.tar.gzls-0.1.tar.gz

    There are two namespace possibilities as I see it.

    RPM::Make or SoftwarePackageMake::RPM

    I think RPM::Make is the better choice since standards are still
    developing for a more uniform SoftwarePackageMake API.

    Uniqueness of approach: It is non-trivial to generate RPMs and
    non-trivial to do so in a quick manner that can be included in other
    software. This perl module solves that problem.

The resulting entry would be:

RPM::
::Make            adpfg cleanly generate an RPM                      SHARRISON
