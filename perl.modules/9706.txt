Yes, I agree it is confusing.  I am not crazy about MacOSX, but can think
of nothing better, so I am not objecting.

What can be expected of Mac OS (9) isn't relevant, since binary
distributions are possible (and the norm).  We have binary distributions of
all the Mac modules, plus many other modules; certainly a binary
distribution of this module for Mac OS 9 would be possible, if it were
written to be compatible (or were patched as such).

So it makes me wonder again if MacOSX is the right place for it, if indeed
it can work on both platforms.

Well, there is a canonical way on Mac OS, but I don't know about Mac OS X.
You can grab one of the distributions from my user directory (CNANDOR) and
examine it; essentially, I put the binary files in their place
(macbinarizing them), and then there is special code in ExtUtils::Mac /
CPAN / Mac::BuildTools to handle them.  It wouldn't be as complex for Mac
OS X to handle it, if for no other reason but that you wouldn't need
MacBinary for anything.

But the issue is that there *will be* Mac::Files on Mac OS X eventually.
So with your module, there will be two sets of modules that do the same
thing, one of which is incompatible with Mac OS (perhaps).

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I would like to see something like
this module just be a stopgap measure until the full toolbox set is
available via the Mac:: modules, because I would rather people use modules
compatible for both OSes when possible, for maximum portability.

I am not denying the need for the module, and I am not saying the module as
it exists is wrong in any way.  But the issue of duplicated functionality
and compatability (as well as the issues of what File::Copy etc. should do)
need to be addressed, so that we all know what direction things are headed,
and so that interested parties have a chance to weigh in.

Thanks,
