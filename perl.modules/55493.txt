The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URI::ParseSearchString::More
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Extract search strings from more referrers.
  userid:      OALDERS (Olaf Alders)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    URI::ParseSearchString

  rationale:

    This module is a subclass of the very helpful, but incomplete,
    URI::ParseSearchString.

    URI::ParseSearchString does not return search strings for URLs
    which contain session info rather than the actual search string. In
    this case, URI::ParseSearchString::More will attempt a lookup of the
    URL and will try to extract the search terms from the page returned.

    There are other cases where URI::ParseSearchString lacks coverage:

    a) It does not cover some large (enough) search engines b) Some
    query info returned is incomplete (particularly local.google.* and
    maps.google.* searches) c) It does not guess at URLs which are quite
    likely search engine URLs (like URLs containing ?q=)

    URI::ParseSearchString::More already extends URI::ParseSearchString
    by dealing with AOL URLs containing session info. It aims to solve
    the above listed problems over time as well. It will not try to
    duplicate the things with URI::ParseSearchString already does well,
    but it will return info on more URLs.

The resulting entry would be:

URI::ParseSearchString::
::More            RdpOp Extract search strings from more referrers.  OALDERS
