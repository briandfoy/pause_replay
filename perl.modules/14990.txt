should we have a script that generates PAUSE ID requests like
we do for new modules, and so on?  i've not been very good at
registering new users because it takes me a couple of steps
to get to the point where i can start it.

the maintainers then can click on a link that takes them to
the current form for adding IDs.  we could edit the information
and continue the process.

i'll write the script, make modifications to the current script
to take values from the query string, and whatever else needs to
be done.  i just need to know where the current code base is. :)
