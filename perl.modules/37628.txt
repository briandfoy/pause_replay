The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::UPDmsg
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: provides cross platform IPC message passing
  userid:      RLAUGHLIN (Robert Laughlin)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    only with a fellow developer

  similar:
    IPC::Msg & IPC::Run::Win32Helper, Win32::IPC

  rationale:

    This module adds the ability to send messages between processes
    like IPC::Msg, however it is based on UDP sockets so that it will
    work on Linux/Unix as well as Win32. Although the main reason for
    writing it was to add non-blocking IPC to Win32, it's not really a
    Win32 only module, so putting it under Win32 does not seem the best
    place. Other Win32-only modules can already pass messages. This
    module is cross platform, and that is it's advantage, to have a
    single method that can run on many platforms. I would think either
    IPC::UDPmsg.pm or IPC::MSG:UDP.pm would be the best names. I would
    be happy with either. But if you feel that something else would be
    better, I doubt that would upset me.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::UPDmsg          bdpOp provides cross platform IPC message passing  RLAUGHLIN
