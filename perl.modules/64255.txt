The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Emit
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Print with indentation, status, and closure
  userid:      ROSCIO (Steve Roscio)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    c-l-p-modules

  similar:
    Debug::Message Log::Dispatch PTools::Debug Term::Activity
    Term::ProgressBar

  rationale:

    The Term::Emit module is used by command-line applications, not for
    debugging or logging, but for "normal" output, to show what's going
    on at the moment (progress) and to give status. It's the type of
    output you see from the CPAN.pm installer, the Test::* modules,
    bootloaders, and many command line apps (especially in my company).
    Output like this:

    Reconfiguring the grappolator... Processing
    whatchamacallit.................. [WARN] Fibulating something
    else... Fibulation phase one...................... [OK] Fibulation
    phase two...................... [ERROR] Wrapup of
    fibulation...................... [OK] Reconfiguring the
    grappolator................. [DONE]

    But so far, none of those use a common module; they just roll their
    own. Hence this module.

    Since this module is for normal output, something in the Debug:: or
    Log:: namespaces seems inappropriate.

    I looked into Msg:: and Print:: and these seem to be a nice fit.
    However, neither of these are _real_ top-level namespaces, from what
    I can tell.

    So then I looked at CLI::*, and there's a few modules in this
    space, but not very related to what my module does.

    Then looking at Term::*, I see the best fit. There's some modules
    there that do progress indicators, and that deal with input or
    output in command line environments.

    Too, I asked in c-l-p-modules but got silence.

    Based upon the above, Term::Emit seems the best choice. I'm open to
    suggestions tho!

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
