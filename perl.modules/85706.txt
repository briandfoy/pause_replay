     why:

    I have written perl code since 1992 and am currently developing a
    large set of perl apps/modules addressing use of argus
    (http://www.qosient.com/argus) in our network measurement and
    monitoring applications. I am hopeful that what we develop will have
    broader application (both within and outside of our GLORIAD
    (www.gloriad.org) community). I also maintain a rather ancient
    (1994) US-Russia community development site, Friends and Partners
    (www.friends-partners.org) - also perl-driven - and would like to
    share the code we continue to develop for this site to cpan
    community.
