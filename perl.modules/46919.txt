Thanks for your input.

OK. I think I will go for Linux::Monitor since I'm not too bothered 
about portability (although I'm sure it's very little work to make it 
run with other unix systems such as FreeBSD and MacOSX) and since the 
modules tend to use a lot of system tools.

Agreed, let's try to avoid it. I've not been very good with this in the 
past (upping 'Petal' and other various top level namespaces) but I will 
try to be better from now on :)

That being said, I'm currently developing quite a few Perl modules for 
the open source Asterisk telephony PBX. I think creating an 'Asterisk' 
top level namespace for this is fair...

At any rate, thanks for your input!

Cheers,
Jean-Michel.
