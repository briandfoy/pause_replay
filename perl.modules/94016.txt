Added SHLOMIF to co-maintainers of Locale::gettext.

Added SHLOMIF to co-maintainers of gettext.

He can now upload releases to CPAN; I'm guessing the details of the
repostiory you can work out between you :)

'same license as perl itself' is fine. The problem is that you've then
expanded that to 'GPL or AL' explicitly, which could be read to mean
'only Artistic License original, not the much better version 2'.

Assuming your intention was to do the sensible/normal thing, I'd say
clarifying the existing license is fine.
