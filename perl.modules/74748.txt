The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CPANChangesTests
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Add release tests using Test::CPAN::Changes
  userid:      RWSTAUNER (Randy Stauner)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    After watching recent discussions on useful 'Changes' files in CPAN
    distributions I was thrilled to see CPAN::Changes come on the scene.

    When I saw that it included a Test::CPAN::Changes module I
    instantly wanted to use it but there was no plugin for Dist::Zilla
    yet.

  enteredby:   RWSTAUNER (Randy Stauner)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb 10 06:16:48 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::
::CPANChangesTests RdpOp Add release tests using Test::CPAN::Changes  RWSTAUNER
