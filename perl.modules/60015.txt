Never mind.  It's a feature, not a bug. :-)

Turns out all the packages of which CPAN complained about the VERSION,
and suppressed, were "internal" -- supposed to be hidden.  So CPAN
refusing to index them was a good thing.  Though I wouldn't suggest
anybody trying to hide packages from the CPAN listing do it through
the mechanism of arranging their VERSION strings in a way that makes
CPAN decide they're screwed up. :-)

More seriously, I'm not entirely comfortable with CPAN looking at any
version number except that of the top package.  In this case the
messages were for packages that don't even have their own separate
files -- they're used for namespace-hiding inside a single file.  Even
if what I am doing is not wise, CPAN indexing checks are not the
optimum way to establish best practices.

Enforcing a discipline on the top level module name and version makes
sense. Tracking internal package names and versions, even to enforce
sensible-seeming restrictions will lead to trouble, I think.

best, jeffrey
