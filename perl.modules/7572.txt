Sure you can talk to modules@perl.org -- that's what we're there for!

While it would be nice for all the Lingua::XX::Numbers modules to follow
a common API so you could easily switch between them, I don't think this
is currently the case, and I wouldn't let it stop you or slow you down.

Note also that there is stuff like Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinal which
turns "1" into "1st", "23" into "23rd" and so on.  You can always have
similar add-ons for your Spanish module.

Why not talk to the author of Lingua::EN::Numbers and see if you think
it'd be useful to have a common API?  You might also want to talk to the
author of Lingua::JA::Number and Lingua::ID::Nums2Words, if you're going
to go down that route.
