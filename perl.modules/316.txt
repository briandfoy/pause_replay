I see, I didn't spot that.

Nope, Benchmark isn't populated at all.

I could imagine Devel::, but maybe a new top level is in order. That
could be Tune or Trace. Devel has the advantage of being there and
being accurate. But it is already crowded. And most of Devel is
special to perl while ARM is not perl specific.

I think, I'd like Tune or Tuning. Let's hear more opinions, please.
