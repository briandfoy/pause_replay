I've problem on installing DBI and DBD::Oracle module in to WinNT using
ActivePerl 5.21.

I've read through the README file over and over. What I've done is extract
the DBI-1.13.tar.gz and copy all the file to D:\Perl\lib then run 'perl
makefile.pl' and ask the readme said, the next step is 'make', 'make test'
and 'make install'  But I can't run it since I think I don't have the right
program (a compiler??)

May I know:
1. should I install the DBI then DBD or DBD then DBI
2. should I really copy all the files to the /lib folder before run 'perl
makefile.pl'? (I got some error messages if I 'perl makefile.pl' at where I
extract the tar.gz!)
3. Is there any program should I use in order to 'make'?? could you suggest
me some for WinNt platform?

What will happen (what file is added in where) after I've successfully
install the moduel?

Thank you

Alan
