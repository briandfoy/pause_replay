Hi,
 
i requested and received successfully a PAUSE account (ASTILLER). Before
uploading my module i want to be sure that the choosen module name is ok.
The module is named currently DBD::RDB and is actually a DBI driver for
Oracle RDB. It was discussed in the thread: RDB module for perl in the
VMSPERL mailing list during 14/15.11.2000.
 
Is it OK to upload the module as DBD::RDB ?
 
Best Regards
Andreas Stiller
