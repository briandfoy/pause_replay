Dear CPAN administrators,

We like to publish our script and modules to CPAN.

Our proposed registration data are:


         name: Leader.IT S.r.l.
       e-mail: perldev@leader.it
     homepage: www.leader.it
      user-ID: LEADER_IT
  description: The activity of Leader.IT is primary to develope
               perl software for local marcket. The resulting work
               probably is good for the rest of people.
               From CPAN we have get many worderful modules that are
               the base for our work, we like to contribute to
               enlarge it.

      scripts: NVAUDIO: perl program to admin audio database
                        for blind men
               VideoMatrix: client-server audio/video remote control
               DNS_Dynamic: client-server dynamic DNS changer

      modules: not ready at this time:
                 Ecasound wrapper (audio processing)
                 PlayRec (audio play and recording; variable
                           speed up/down)

We don't register by Authors but Company name because the number
involved are a lot (~6); the Authors (and the e-mail reference) are in
scripts or modules documentations and source code.

perldev@leader.it is preferred e-mail sent to perl's developer io our
organization.


Best regards


  the Leader.IT S.r.l.
