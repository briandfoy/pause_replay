  rationale:

    Hello,

    we are Developer of IBM Tivoli TME10 and we write many one-way
    Shell and Perl-Scripts to implement Tivoli in Customer Environments.
    Much times I have looked on CPAN for a Tivoli-Module, but I haven't
    found anything. - That's my time to write one! I think, I can help
    many colleagues with this Module and the Module-List will help to
    find it.

    P.S.: Please look to www.tivolisten.de for some of my colleagues.

The resulting entry would be:

Tivoli            Smpfp Tivoli TME10 - Perl Interface                RHASE
