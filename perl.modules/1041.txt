I'd like to register *another* set of modules as well, please. These
modules, based on LWP::UserAgent, allow you to fetch historical stock
quotes from the web. I understand that some of the derived module names
end up going into the realm of "three names", but in my estimation this
will be better as more site-specific instances get added. Please let me
know if this is a mondo faux pas or just plain ugly. They all live
beneath the Finance namespace currently:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Finance::
HistQuote      bdpO  Historical stock quotes from multiple sites  MSISK

Finance::
HistQuote::
Generic        bdpO  Historical stock quote base class            MSISK

Finance::
HistQuote::
MotleyFool     bdpO  Historical stock quotes from the Motley Fool MSISK

Finance::
HistQuote::
FinancialWeb   bdpO  Historical stock quotes from FinancialWeb    MSISK


The idea, here, is that site-specific instances all derive from the
Generic base class. One of the properties of these classes is that you
can specify a "lineup" of other site-specific classes to try in the
event the first class fails in its attempt to retrieve quotes.

Finance::HistQuote, the top-level class, is merely an aggregator that
defaults to a particular lineup automatically, but otherwise behaves as
though it were an instance of the first site-specific class in the
lineup.

I really don't know what to do about the long module names in the
site-specific cases, unless it involves moving them out of the Finance
category, which would be a shame since that is where they seem to
belong, along with the Finance::FoolQuote and others of that ilk.

At any rate, if you would like to see more details, then the
documentation and distribution is available here:
