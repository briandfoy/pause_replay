The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Ping
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: A test module to test pings on servers
  userid:      XSAWYERX (Sawyer X)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Ping

  rationale:

    We have a lot of Test modules on CPAN. This is my second
    contribution to that. You can use Net::Ping to create an object that
    you will use later to test for livelihood, but it's annoying and
    having a test module would be much easier.

    I already wrote the 3rd release of the module which supports
    ping_ok() and I would like to at least reach a point where I support
    all relevant variables and behaviors in Net::Ping.

    I maintain it using Git, available on GitHub here:
    git://github.com/xsawyerx/test-ping.git, I wrote about this on my
    use.perl.org journal here:
    http://use.perl.org/~xsawyerx/journal/38846 and I intent to keep
    CPAN up to date with the versions as well, fix bugs and improve it
    as much as possible.

    Should be noted that it uses Net::Ping internally.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
