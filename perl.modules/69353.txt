The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ProxyGrinder
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Seek and cache proxy address via plugins
  userid:      KANGU (kangu)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://github.com/kangu/Proxy-Grinder

  similar:

  rationale:

    It will seek proxies addresses using a specified plugin (available
    only through google dorks but looking forward to write more plugins
    for other free proxy providers...) and cache them in an SQLite
    database. once done you can keep a running daemon (not persistent
    yet but planning in future release) that would iteratively check the
    cache database and update proxy relative informations such as
    connection speed, location, country, proxy type, ...

    It's a full features perl5 with OOP in mind. Easy to maintain and
    write plugins for Does help me a lot hiding my tracks I wish
    everyone would use it and help encouraging us to extend it
    functionnalities!

    Thanks
