Subject:  In-Range module...


I'm working on a module where one specifies a collection of ranges (dates
ranges, numerical ranges, etc.) and a value associated with each range. One
than passes a specific value to the module and gets the appropriate value.

For instance, something like

  $obj->add('2000-01-01', '2000-01-31', 100);
  $obj->add('2000-02-01', '2000-01-28', 80);
  $obj->add('2000-03-01', '2000-01-31', 60);

 $value = $obj->value('2000-02-15');  # should return 80

Question is... what do I call this module? I was thinking of it as a kind
of "range hash" but hashes may not be used (I may spend tonight hacking
with tied hashes though). I was ready to call it "Tree::Range" but trees
are not relevant to what the module does, even if that's the internal
mechanism. (And if it's rewritten not to use trees, the name is
meaningless.)

Suggestions would be appreciated (Send replies to my non-work E-mail
