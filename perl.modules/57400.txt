Hi Steffen,

I do still have a module out there on my web site, but it has made  
little progress from alpha.

Probably due to the demands of those looking for AI inference engines.

If you need the namespace, let me know if someone is asking for it.

Otherwise, if I could still amp out, I'd like to.  Perhaps I'll have  
a chance to update my code base.

Regards,

Mike
