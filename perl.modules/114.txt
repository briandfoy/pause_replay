Great.

Well good luck, and the appropriate amount of reverse engineering fun:-)

Done.

I have not committed your homepage to the database because the comment
seems to indicate that you would like to not expose it. You can add a
homepage anytime yourself anyway.

Excellent. Thanks for digging into that.
