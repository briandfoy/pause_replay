     why:

    I'm a Biomedical Engineer from Spain and have written some Perl
    code that is currently used by physicians in my biomedical research
    field. As I've become a perl lover, I would like to contribute to
    CPAN with any perl code that could be used by biomedical engineers
    all arround the perl community.
