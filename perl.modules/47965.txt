The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XPS
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: XPS documents access and manipulation
  userid:      MAIN (Jianyuan Wu)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a new open document format. It
    could be a better equivalent than the well known PDF format. XPS
    will be the default printer spool file format of Windows Vista. XPS
    format is an open standard, and will be supported by major printer
    manufacturers. New version of Microsoft Office will be able to
    directly save file to XPS format.

    Although initially supported by Microsoft products, the ``open''
    nature of XPS format will make it popular on many other platforms
    and become widely spread.

    The ``XPS'' Perl module is developed to access and manipulate the
    content of XPS documents. It will be the essential tools to process
    XPS documents for Perl programs.

    I, as the developer of XPS module, constantly involved the
    development of a major XPS product, and would like to submit my work
    of this perl module to CPAN and help the community.

  enteredby:   MAIN (Jianyuan Wu)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 21 14:13:52 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XPS               adpOb XPS documents access and manipulation        MAIN
