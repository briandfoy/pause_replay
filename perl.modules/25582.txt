By now you have probably heard of the untimely passing of Iain
Truskett. (SPOON)

His death has left some CPAN modules orphaned. As the author of Mail::Thread,
I helped Spoon put together Email::Thread, a subclass based on
Email::Simple. I've picked up some patches to this, and would like to get a
new version out, so I'd appreciate it if ownership of the module could be
transferred to me. It may make sense to release his other CPAN modules too.

Thanks,
Simon
