The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Assert
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Assertion methods for those who like JUnit.
  userid:      DEXTER (Piotr Roszatycki)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    CPAN

  similar:
    Test::Unit

  rationale:

    This is set of assertion methods which throws an exception on
    failure rather than returning false value. It perfectly fits to
    xUnit testing model which is provided by Test::Unit and
    Test::Unit::Lite modules. The Test::Assert can be used also as
    assertion functions for run-time checking.

  enteredby:   DEXTER (Piotr Roszatycki)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 14 18:49:29 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Assert          adpOp Assertion methods for those who like JUnit.  DEXTER
