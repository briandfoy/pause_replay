Then maybe you should use Google or even look at the distro, before 
making wild accusations:

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2007/04/msg123813.html
http://search.cpan.org/src/TTY/kurila-0_02/README

The Kurila project is a fork of Perl5 without the strict backwards 
compatibility required of v5.10.0, as a theoretical experiment.  You'll 
note now that under CPAN, it shows up as

	** UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE **

which should make it highly unlikely that someone will install it by 
accident.
