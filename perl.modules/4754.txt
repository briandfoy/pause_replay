Description:    I am currently writing a modular system that allow the user
                to interact with an SQL database without writing any SQL.
                It is currently using the namespace EasyDB.
                The user formulates the queries in a more natural, boolean
                language and the module deals with parsing into SQL, running
                the query, managing the DBH and STH, cacheing, and more.
                The module is built on the DBI and DBD modules.

Format:         cannot access the modlist webpage, is broken.  Here is my
                best effort:
                Current working version is .3b.  Written in native perl
                using DBI and DBD::mysql.  Provides a nice API to various
                types of SQL query.

Notes:          This module is part of my third year computing project.  I
                am currently studying at the university of Leeds, UK.  This
                project has been discussed with my supervisor and assessors,
                who both believe the product to be of a good quality.  I am
                currently looking for some people to bug-test and provide
                feedback, such that I can include in the final report.
