     why:

    I have obtained permission to publish the following packages
    developed at Texas Instruments:

    TI::Config is an pure-Perl package which provides the ability to
    read and validate program control parameters from configuration
    files and command line arguments. This capability is similar to
    other app-config packages available through CPAN, but these modules
    have a wider range of features and flexibility than previous
    implementations.

    TI::Log::MsgHandler is an pure-Perl package which provides a
    general message-generation and logging facility.

    TI::DefineClass is an pure-Perl package that constructs other Perl
    object classes.

    Our immediate intent is to share these packages with development
    partners and anyone else who might find them useful.
