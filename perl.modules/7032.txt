I've written a module that provides a clone of Net::POP3's interface, but it
talks to HTTPMail servers (e.g. HotMail) rather that POP3 servers. Because
of the similarity in interface to Net::POP3 I'm thinking that Net::HTTPMail
is the right name. But arguments could be made for HTTP::Mail (particularly
since the module is based on HTTP::Webdav) or Mail::HTTP. An argument could
also be made for 'Mail::HotMail' since many people searching will not know
the protocol is called 'HTTPMail' but will only know that they're looking
for a 'HotMail' interface.

Any suggestions? Any objections to 'Net::HTTPMail'?
