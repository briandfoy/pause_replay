Yeah, another good point.  Hrm.  Although, the way Apple is doing it now,
the OS is named "Mac OS X" and its version is "10.1.2", so the complete
name is "Mac OS X 10.1.2"; similarly, it is "Mac OS 9.2.1".  So if they
continued with that, it would be "Mac OS X 11.0".  However, there is no way
of knowing what Apple will do in this regard; I don't think consistency is
necessarily going to be the standard by which future rules apply.

I wonder if maybe Mac:: is a better namespace, and then say in the docs
which versions of "Mac" are supported?
