Thank you.

I have made all the code changes, but _NOT_ yet uploaded them. It wasn't hard, but I experienced a gumption shortage for a couple days, and just got around to it.

What I intend to do is to sit on the changes for a month or so to see if any other reason to change the code manifests itself. If not, I may upload anyway, just to get it out of the way. The TODO file for this contains a note to me to notify you when the update occurs. My packaging tool won't let me package if TODO exists and is not empty, so there is _SOME_ chance the notification will actually take place. The notification will probably be a reply to my latest note from you, unless you would like me to do something different.

Thanks again,
