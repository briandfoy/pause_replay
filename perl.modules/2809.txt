Hi there:

I would like this module to be included in the modulelist.

This module allows the specification of 'rules' to populate hash buckets on 
command.

A rule is a tuple consisting of a user-supplied method, a preference, a key 
to which it applies and a set of  rerequisite keys that must exists in the 
hash for this rule to be applied.

The module uses all the available rules to 'fill' a hash bucket, filling 
any required prerequisites. It uses the preference in the rules as well as 
the prerequisites to obtain the set of rules to be applied to this task.

Thanks in advance.
