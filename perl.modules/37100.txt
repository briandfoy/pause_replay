Request to register new user

fullname: Tim Chambers
  userid: TBC
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://alum.mit.edu/www/tbc/hacks
     why:

    Presently working on a utilities module that standardizes I/O by
    category (e.g. regular messages, verbose messages, errors, warnings)
    in a style preferred by me and my friends in the scripts that we
    write. It's called TES.pm (for Tim, Eric, and Stephen). Also working
    on a script called rirc (Read IRC) that parses a dircproxy IRC log,
    implements searches, and pretty prints output. I realize TES.pm may
    not be suitable for CPAN, but rirc presently uses it. I'm willing to
    refactor to make CPAN community happy.
