Hi all,

apparently, "cpan Math::Cephes" or "cpanp install Math::Cephes" (with this =
mirror -
http://biocourse.weizmann.ac.il/CPAN/ ) still install the old Math-Cephes-0=
.47 from
the ADOPTME account instead of SHLOMIF's new Math-Cephes-0.48 .

Why? Should I just upload a new distribution?

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
