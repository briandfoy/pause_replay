Hi Ge Peng,

I re-registered this namespace as Data::Hierarchy::Traverser to correct
the spelling. You can ignore the previous registration.

To get rid of the previous name, go to the "Edit Module Metadata" link
in PAUSE.

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_mod

Select "Data::Heirarchy::Traverser" (the incorrectly spelled one with
the "e" before the "i"). On the page for that module, go to the bottom
of the page where it says "Module Lifecycle" and set to "Can be deleted
from database".

Actually, don't worry about it. I just did it for you, but if you ever
need to do that again, now you know how. :)
