The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Data
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Check data and variable properties and value
  userid:      BDFOY (brian d foy)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::More and friends, although this module has different tests

  rationale:

    the functions in these modules encapsulate common tests i use in
    the .t files. now that i've wrapped them in a Test::Builder sorta
    thing, they move a lot of code out of the .t files and into places
    where i don't have to see it. :)

  enteredby:   BDFOY (brian d foy)
  enteredon:   Mon Sep  2 22:55:19 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Data            adpfp Check data and variable properties and value BDFOY
