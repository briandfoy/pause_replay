The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPDevices
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Data storage for IP routers and others
  userid:      SAMUEL (Samuel Abels)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    The toplevel-namespace "IPDevice" was chosen because I have not
    found any other namespace where I believe a storage module like this
    would fit in.

    Also, the modules will be extended by analyzers, parsers and more
    in the near future, providing a complete suite (>30 modules) for
    vendor-intependend handling of WAN network hardware and
    configuration. I believe that it makes sense to have this large
    collection of modules in one namespace.

    The suite of modules, representing an IP router, is commercially
    developed; I believe it might be interesting for other IP backbone
    providers too.

The resulting entry would be:

IPDevices         adpOp Data storage for IP routers and others       SAMUEL
