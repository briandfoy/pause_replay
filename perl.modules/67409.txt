     why:

    I'm already on PAUSE/CPAN as FREQUENCY and have authored several
    modules and filed many bug reports. In order to be more consistent
    with my other online presence, I'd like to transfer my modules under
    this desired ID (JAWNSY).

    Mostly these days I just maintain my modules and use the account to
    file RT bugs against other dists (as I do a lot of work packaging
    CPAN modules for Debian). I do plan to add more modules though, in
    particular, PerlQt4 stuff.
