     why:

    All the cool kids have one? I'm at YAPC still and need another hit
    of the Perl pipe?

    I don't have an immediate need to upload to CPAN, but I hope to in
    the future, and removing the barrier of getting a PAUSE account now
    when I have the motivation is better than waiting and hoping said
    motivation doesn't leave.

    That said, I'm currently starting on dealing with ZFS filesystem
    snapshots and jails on FreeBSD, and there doesn't seem to be a huge
    amount of modules for that. So if I were a good Perl citizen, I'd
    upload useful work for that.
