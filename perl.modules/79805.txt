Normally, all lowercase names are reserved for pragmas. Would you like
to choose a different name? Perhaps FlatDB? However, you might want to
think about choosing a name that distinguishes your module from all the
other DB modules.

And, I'm curious is this is better than something like DBI::CSV, which
I think already does what you want to do.
