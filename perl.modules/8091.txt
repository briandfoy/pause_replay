Is "system2" the common Unix name for this feature?  If so, I approve
the name.  If, however, it's just your own way of saying "this is
another way of doing System" I'd suggest System::Whatever (where
"whatever" is the distinguishing feature of your module as compared to
System, eg "Fast" or "Simple" or whatever.)
