yes, I agree, that the major part of the code is comparing file names.
However, I don't think it is a good idea to name the module focusing
on the comparison part. because,

what a module/function/procedure do is more important than how it is
done. The purpose of the module is to find out similar files in the
given directories. IMHO, theoritically, this is not much different
than find files in directories, because if you look into how 'find'
finds files, it use comparison too. My module just do a bit more on
the comparison.

In brief, the module finds/looks for similar files. So I think names
like File::Search::Similars, File::LookFor::Similars are more
appropriate than File::Compare::Similars. Because otherwise, the
module name will actually be confusing. What do you think?

thanks
