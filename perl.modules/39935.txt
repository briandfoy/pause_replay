The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::ReportWriter
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Renders high-quality business reports to PDF
  userid:      DKASAK (Daniel Kasak)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    beginners@perl.org

  similar:
    Business::ReportWriter

  rationale:

    Namespace: Pretty self-explanitory. It's a report writer, and it
    outputs to PDF.

    Uniqueness of approach:

    - html-table-like rendering of all objects - Uses PDF::API2 - as
    opposed to rendering to Latex or DVI and converting to PDF, which
    I've found to produce lower quality results and be far more
    complicated and buggy - Very small ( version 0.1 less than 300 lines
    of code ) and very fast ( I suppose PDF::API2 is to thank for this )

The resulting entry would be:

PDF::
::ReportWriter    bdpOl Renders high-quality business reports to PDF DKASAK
