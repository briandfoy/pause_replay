The module will work by finding overlapping strings in the two text 
documents.  The idea is that text documents that share a lot of 
identical strings will be very similar (the length of the strings will 
also be taken into account).

For example, let's say we have two short, one-sentence documents: "The 
big brown bear likes to eat fish" and "John and Sally often eat fish". 
There is one overlap here: "eat fish".
