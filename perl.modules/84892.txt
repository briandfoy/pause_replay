The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SMS::Send::RedOxygen
  DSLIP:       bdpOb
  description: SMS::Send driver for RedOxygen RedSMS
  userid:      RINGERC (Craig Ringer)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/ringerc/sms-send-redsms-perl

  similar:
    SMS::Send Net::SMS WWW::SMS

  rationale:

    I've written a cleaner and saner SMS send interface for RedOxygen
    than the very poor Perl snippet that they supply, and want to upload
    it so others don't have to waste their time repeating the work.

    I have no strong preference for the SMS::Send vs Net::SMS vs
    WWW::SMS and just had to pick one.

    I strongly suspect that this should be in chapter 24 given that
    it's an interface to commercial software (a commercial web service).

    I am a customer of RedOxygen and have no other relationship with
    them.

The resulting entry would be:

SMS::Send::
::RedOxygen       bdpOb SMS::Send driver for RedOxygen RedSMS        RINGERC
