I have submitted a package for profiling DBI queries.  I named it
DBIx::Profile, and the name of the file "Profile.pm".  In retrospect,
this might be dumb, since Profile is bound to be quite the common
name.

I am pretty sure the DBIx::Profile name is acceptable, but I am not so
sure about "Profile.pm".

Is this an acceptable name?  If not, do you have a name that you recommend?

Thanks for your time,

jeff
