Can you link me to the rt ticket where you reported the bug? That email
address may be more current.

Have you mailed him with a URL to the ticket and a -clear- subject line
and a request to apply the patch in the ticket?

In that mail you could offer to take over co-maint if he doesn't want to
continue to maintain the module on his own.

The only email I've seen from you is one with a title suggesting it's a
request for co-maint from somebody he's never heard of, with a top-posted
body of "hi alexander, are u around?" which suggests you're not only
unknown but unable to spell the word 'u'. I wouldn't blame him for simply
deleting something that useless and rude.

Please try to contact the author -properly- and then if he doesn't reply
within a month or so we can consider giving you temporary co-maint.
