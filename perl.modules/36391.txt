     why:

    All sorts of things. I program in perl both at work and at home, so
    I'm always coming up with cool stuff. I just recently started doing
    the whole OO thing, so I thought I might as well start contributing
    the cleaner code to CPAN, since I've been feeding off CPAN for so
    long... time to give back!
