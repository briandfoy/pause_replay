     why:

    I plan to contribute Table.pm Table::File.pm I posted questions
    about this to modules@... The first one made it but I see the
    follow-up did not. I will resend it.

    Other Table::*.pm modules may follow.

    Table.pm differs from existing modules Data::Table.pm
    Data::CTable.pm in that the abstraction is the Table, rather than
    the data it contains. However, I expect it to live under section 6.
