Generally, you should put your @cpan.org address in your
.dzil/config.ini or else it might be made public when you release
things.

Your account appears set up correctly for forwarding.  I've copied
your cpan.org address.  If you get this message multiple times, then
the forwarding is working.  If not, let me know and I'll follow up
with our email admins.

(Sending a message from gmail to something that forwards back to the
same gmail account is sometimes quirky, because gmail can detect that
it's receiving a message that it sent and might not show it as new
mail.)
