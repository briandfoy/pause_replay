The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Transceiver
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Object interface to client/server socket IO
  userid:      WILSOND (Dusty Wilson)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    Has been discussed at #hey.nu on irc.hey.nu, plans to add a
    discussion board - URL unknown.

  similar:
    IO::NonBlocking IO::Multiplex

  rationale:

    A 'transceiver' is a transmitter and receiver in one package. A CB
    radio would be a good example, as would a cellular telephone. This
    name was chosen because the module does just that, allows
    communication as both a client and a server.

    This module was originally named "hey::Transponder", but the root
    namespace "hey" is obviously inappropriate for contribution and the
    term "Transponder" shows too strict of specialization of
    communication. The module makes IO::Socket objects, leaving open
    quite a few possibilities for communication.

    The purpose of the module itself is to allow easy creation of
    non-blocking, multiplexing servers and clients through an object
    interface. The programmer would create the new client or server and
    assign a callback function to this new client or server connection.
    The programmer using this code would not need to deal with the
    network wiring to make use of multiple clients and servers in their
    code.

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::Transceiver     adpOa Object interface to client/server socket IO  WILSOND
