Hello Linda.

My name is Shmuel, a Perl user and CPAN author, like you.
I have used your module, HTTP::Recorder, and noticed that there are a
few bugs in it, as documented in the RT.
Also I have noticed that the module was not touched since 2005.

Are you interested in fixing these bugs?

If not, maybe you will be interested in handing over maintenance of the
module to someone else?

Thank you, and thanks for writing the module,
Shmuel.
