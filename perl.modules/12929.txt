Hi all,

you would like to contribute to the CPAN archive. Here my datas:


*	Name: Alexander Schober
*	EMail: a.d.j.schober@t-online.de
*	Homepage: http://www.spiegelrichtig.de
*	Preferred user-ID: mirrorOk (close translation of "Spiegelrichtig")
*	I work on a Tk::Text-widget that is able to copy formated Text from
one position to another. For POD I wrote some modules which allow a big ease
to make documentation. For example the Dot-Module which is a template to
translate POD in each textbased format. With Dot you are able to at java
script, applets an whatever you want to HTML results of POD translations.
Another Tk::Widget I wrote is Tk::Project::Explorer, a Dir::Tree-Hlist which
starts on a certain root.


Thanks

Alex
