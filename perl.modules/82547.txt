The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Plack::Middleware::AccessLog::Structured
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Plack middleware for structured logging
  userid:      MSTOCK (Manfred Stock)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://prepan.org/module/429En4oFec

  similar:
    Plack::Middleware::AccessLog

  rationale:

    This is a special access log middleware for Plack which creates and
    logs JSON-encoded log messages - and Plack middlewares usually live
    below Plack::Middleware::*. The messages contain roughly the same
    information like "normal" log messages, but a user can also add
    additional, potentially application-specific, fields to the
    messages. Since they are encoded as JSON, it's also easier to parse
    and process them, which distinguishes this middleware from
    Plack::Middleware::AccessLog.

  enteredby:   MSTOCK (Manfred Stock)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct  3 19:48:56 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Plack::Middleware::AccessLog::
::Structured      bdpOp Plack middleware for structured logging      MSTOCK
