have you read the Tk documentation? The code is part of the main Tk. Try 
calling the method (which is what getOpenFile is) on your main window or so.

main docs: http://search.cpan.org/~ni-s/Tk-804.027/
This states it quite clearly: 
http://search.cpan.org/~ni-s/Tk-804.027/pod/getOpenFile.pod

Ie. $widget->getOpenFile(...)
