For the record, I've now sent email to Douglas Wegscheid both at
wegscd@whirlpool.com and dwegscheid@qtm.net asking whether he would
like the idea of transferring the maintenance of Time::HiRes to me.
I could spin it off now that it has been made more portable and also
otherwise enhanced alongside Perl 5.8.0.  I'll keep sending emails
every few weeks.
