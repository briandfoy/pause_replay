The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::Arabic
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl extension for encodings of Arabic
  userid:      SMRZ (Otakar Smrž)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Locale::RecodeData MARC::Charset Lingua::AR::MacArabic
    Text::TransMetaphone::ar

  rationale:

    This module is a wrapper for different implementations of encoding
    systems used for the Arabic language, rather than the Arabic script.
    The included modules fit in the philosophy of Encode::Encoding and
    can be used directly with the Encode module. It is aimed at the
    Natural Language Processing community of IT, web designers etc., and
    Orientalists.

    Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX - extension for multi-purpose processing of
    the ArabTeX notation of Arabic - conversions into/from the Arabic
    script and/or phonetic transcriptions, highly configurable -
    non-trivial implementation relying on Encode::Mapper and suiting the
    Encode::Encoding interface

    Encode::Arabic::Buckwalter - extension for Tim Buckwalter's
    transliteration of Arabic - tr/// one-to-one mapping with the
    Encode::Encoding interface

    Unlike other CPAN modules working with the Arabic script, this
    module supplies two most popular ASCII transliterations of the
    script. The author would like to stress the Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX
    module, which is a unique implementation of the interpreter to the
    excelent ArabTeX notation for Arabic -- there is only the original
    TeX/LaTeX package doing the job.

  enteredon:   Mon Sep  8 22:05:01 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::
::Arabic          bdpOp Perl extension for encodings of Arabic       SMRZ
