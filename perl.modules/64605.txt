Subject: Module submission CouchDB::ExternalProcess

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CouchDB::ExternalProcess
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: Create External Processes for CouchDB
  userid:      FANSIPANS (Mike Walker)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Currently there are clients, abstraction libraries, and view
    servers supporting CouchDB.

    A new feature, External Processes, lets CouchDB make use of any
    other process by exchanging data over standard in and standard out.
    No Perl support for External Processes currently exists.

    CouchDB::ExternalProcess is a lightweight wrapper allowing a single
    simple subroutine to serve as an External Process. The mundane tasks
    of input, output, error handling, and pre/post processing are all
    handled by CouchDB::ExternalProcess.

  enteredby:   FANSIPANS (Mike Walker)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 18 14:04:17 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CouchDB::
::ExternalProcess adpOb Create External Processes for CouchDB        FANSIPANS
