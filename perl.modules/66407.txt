     why:

    I want to write a module that calculates the BLEU score and later
    eventually other things related to machine translation. I also asked
    the maintainer of Text::Levenshtein of I might take over the
    maintainer ship of that module and correct errors that have been
    reported since years. Levenshtein distance is related to machine
    translation as well.
