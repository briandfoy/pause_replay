The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::Object::IP::v4
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Reusable ip object class for Moose
  userid:      KHULTMAN (Kyle Hultman)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's a simple moose class that handles some pretty good ip
    manipulation. I personally didn't like net::ip or the other myrid of
    others, as they didn't quite do what I needed. I also wanted to have
    something that was purely moose, as it's a small cog in a much
    larger application I've been working on. The code is mature enough
    for general use, and generally I've found it to be bug free for my
    use cases.

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::Object::IP::
::v4              adpOp Reusable ip object class for Moose           KHULTMAN
