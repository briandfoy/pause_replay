Subject: Module submission Time::TCG

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::TCG
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Geocentric Coordinate Time and realisations
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) is a coordinate time scale
    representing time in the Terran system. Specifically, it is the
    proper time experienced by a distant clock comoving with the
    geocentre. It is linearly related to Terrestrial Time (TT), which is
    the proper time scale underlying timekeeping on the Terran surface.
    TT is formally defined in terms of TCG: TT ticks exactly
    0.999_999_999_303_070_986_6 seconds for each second of TCG.

    This module directly parallels the Time::TT module which handles
    Terrestrial Time. It provides the equivalent facilities:
    linear<->MJD conversion and realisation processing. It also performs
    conversions between TT and TCG. The realisation processing is
    actually implemented using Time::TT, since the linear relationship
    between the time scales means that a realisation of one is
    implicitly also a realisation of the other.

    As with the various modules that I submitted last month concerned
    with precision time scales, I don't think that the DateTime list is
    the right place to discuss this module. I'm open to suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
::TCG             Rdphp Geocentric Coordinate Time and realisations  ZEFRAM
