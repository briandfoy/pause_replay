Business intelligence (BI) refers to a broad range of applications and
technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing access to data
to help make business decisions.  BI is also described as a type of decision
support system.  MicroStrategy is a leading BI vendor.  MicroStrategy is
also the name of MicroStrategy's suite of BI tools.  Here is a link to the
company's website:  http://www.microstrategy.com

MicroStrategy's Command Manager allows you to automate various
administrative and application development tasks for the MicroStrategy
platform.  I created a module that provides a perl interface to
MicroStrategy's Command Manager.  I want to contribute this module to CPAN.

I would like some help in choosing an appropriate name for the module.  I
have been using the name MicroStrategy::Cmdmgr during development.   Since
it's not good practice to create a new top level name like MicroStrategy, I
need to rename my module before I release it.  A natural fit would be
Business::Intelligence::MicroStrategy::Cmdmgr.  But the name is a bit
unwieldy because of the length.  Can someone suggest a better name for my
module?

Thanks,
Craig
