     why:

    I'm working on a few things to contribute to CPAN.

    In the short term, I'm developing a Perl/XS wrapper for the wv
    library for parsing MS Word documents (see wv's homepage at
    http://www.wvware.com).

    In the medium term, I'll probably also create a Perl/XS wrapper for
    the librsvg library so that one can render SVG from Perl without a
    separate process.

    In the long term, my team at work is developing a project called
    Xeiron, which is an open-source framework for combined course
    management and knowledge management.

    All of this work is being funded by my employer (Tufts University)
    or National Library of Medicine grants, and both are conducive to
    their release under the Artistic License.
