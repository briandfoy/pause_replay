Hi, Neil

Some time ago (probably two years) I got a good cleanup on my pause 
account, but since them, I forgot to do so. so, yes, I will clean not 
just Math-GSL but others too.

Usually what I do is to keep the most recent that *I* have, but i can 
try to look into other guys who release the same modules as I do, and 
delete if somebody else has a more recent version.

Thank you :-)
Alberto

So we’ve identified the authors who can free up the most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

LETO has the most recent release of Math-GSL, so maybe Alberto (AMBS) can delete all releases of Math-GSL, and Jonathan maybe you could delete 0.28 and earlier?

When marked for deletion, you’d have 3 days to check and revert anything you’re not happy with, before PAUSE would actually delete them.
