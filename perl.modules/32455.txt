Hi,

I'm building a module that when finished, I expect to upload to CPAN.
This module communicates with a piece of stock trading software 
called TWS (Trader's Work Station).  The software is published by 
an online broker called "Interactive Brokers" www.interactivebrokers.com

The TWS is a GUI Java app that I will communicate with to place trades, 
request stock data...

My question is do I name the thing I'm building:

Finance::TWS - The thing I'm building obviously fits under the Finance high
level.  But TWS is pretty ambiguous

or 

InteractiveBrokers::TWS - Much more self documenting, and provides for the 
odd chance that InteractiveBrokers publishes another piece of software

I'm not on this mailing list so please CC me on your response

Thanks
Jay
