The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::PureDB
  DSLIP:       Rdhrp
  description: Tie::PureDB - Perl extension for pure-db
  userid:      PODMASTER (D. H.)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    "Perl bindings for puredb" at
    http://perlmonks.com/index.pl?node_id=247695

  similar:
    DB_File BerkeleyDB

  rationale:

    Developed for pureftpd (http://pureftpd.sourceforge.net/ ) PureDB
    (http://pureftpd.sourceforge.net/puredb/ ) "is a portable and tiny
    set of libraries for creating and reading constant databases. "

    Tie-PureDB is the perl interface to pure-db.

    This module was prompted by a post on perlmonks at by someone who
    needed to interface with a pure-db database file.

    Tie-PureDB is related to DB_File and BerkeleyDB because like them,
    it interfaces to an exsiting c/c++ library which is a good candidate
    for the perl tie interface. That is all.

  enteredby:   PODMASTER (D. H.)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 20 23:00:24 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::PureDB          Rdhrp Tie::PureDB - Perl extension for pure-db     PODMASTER
