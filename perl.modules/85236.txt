The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       mem
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: allow use of  in-'mem' copy of package;
  userid:      LAWALSH (Linda A Walsh)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    it's a pragma that allows one to use the in memory copy of a
    package without fetching it from disk.

    i.e. {package xxx. use mem export stuff; } use mem; and then use
    'stuff';

    all in 1 file;

    Also allows Exporter to reference the in-mem copies of the function
    prototypes so that they can be immediately active in the rest of the
    module (where they are used).

    There was resistance to adding this functionality to use package,
    and it was suggested I develop it as a CPAN module first (not that
    was complicated to develop).

    It's use is meant to be simple and easy to 'member

    ;-)

The resulting entry would be:

mem               bdppp allow use of  in-'mem' copy of package;      LAWALSH
