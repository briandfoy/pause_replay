The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MegaDistro
  DSLIP:       cmpfg
  description: Build a package from a list of perl modules.
  userid:      DBUCHMAN (David Buchman)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    https://svn.perl.org/projects/perlplus/

  similar:
    CPANPLUS::Dist

  rationale:

    I was developing this project under the guidence and supervision of
    a select few at The Perl Foundation, for Googler's Summer of Code
    2005 program. After much dedication and work, and thanks to a lot of
    help from my mentors there (Ask Bjørn Hansen, Michael G. Schwern,
    and also, Curtis Ovid Poe), they thought it best to get my project
    (module), out for distribution -- somewhere where it could be
    downloaded and tested, by the community -- futhermore, such that,
    there would be a system for submitting bugreports, especially
    because it is their opinion that this is the stage of where the
    project is currently at. I am unsure as to whether it could be
    called a full-blown "alpha-release," but it would certainly meet the
    "pre-alpha" status, since it is functional. It just needs much
    improvement and further work on, code-wise and design-wise :)

The resulting entry would be:

MegaDistro        cmpfg Build a package from a list of perl modules. DBUCHMAN
