I hadn't even thought of File.  I think I like that.  It seems to fit there
(along with Copy, Move, Compare, etc better than Filesys (with DiskSpace,
and Statvfs).  Does anyone have a problem with File::Rsync?

Greg Ward <gward@ase.com> suggested I restructure the arguments to rsync
more like a perl hash.  I'd originally wanted the args to be familiar in
format to rsync users, but now I'm working on handling them as a hash like
Tk does.  I hope to be able to accept both formats without too much
additional overhead.
