From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AWS::Zocalo
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl Client for the AWS Zocalo API
  userid:      TECHMAN (Leon Wright)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/techman83/aws-zocalo

  similar:

  rationale:

    The AWS namespace appears to be where all the newer development for
    AWS services is going. Rather makes sense given the breadth of their
    service offering.

    Registering in Advance of uploading as the API has not been
    formally released yet.

  enteredby:   TECHMAN (Leon Wright)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 12 00:30:24 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

AWS::
::Zocalo          bdpOp Perl Client for the AWS Zocalo API           TECHMAN
