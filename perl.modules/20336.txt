The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Monitor::General
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Framework for monitoring hosts and services
  userid:      VROOM (Tim Vroom)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    PerlMonks.org

  similar:
    Watchdog::Base

  rationale:

    Monitor::General seemed to be the best name for my module although
    I'm open to others as well. I wasn't able to find an existing type
    of module that was similar.

    What the module does:

    Sets up framework for types of tests (Database,HTTP
    Service,Ping,etc), and handlers for test responses (E-mail, print to
    screen,log) to be reused

    Defines specific tests based on Config::General style config file

    Allows for post processing of test results regardless of handler
    type for a specific test. This could allow for logging, or storing
    up results of tests to be handled and consolidated after all tests
    have occurred.

    This module allows for a simple, and easily configurable, and
    extensible framework for monitoring availability of any important
    services or resources to your organization.
