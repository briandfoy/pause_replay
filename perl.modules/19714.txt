Thank you.

(perldoc perlnewmod) did not mention a form, but said to 'send a
message,' with approximately the same format I used.  Pardon if it
brought confusion.

The instructions on "Register Namespace" form were not clear.  I did not
see it as necessary if I was adding a leaf module in an established
tree.  It still says it's only a recommendation.
