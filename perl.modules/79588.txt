Dear PAUSE Admins,

Can you give me co-maint for HTTP::DetectUserAgent please? The author is =
Takaaki Mizuno, who I tried mailing a couple of times in January, and =
again a couple of times this month. His official CPAN email address =
bounces, but after some googling I found another email address for a =
Takaaki Mizuno, and emailed that too, with no response.

My plan is to fix all the bugs listed on RT, and update the =
documentation to refer to other modules and my review.

I'm starting to work on a roll-up with Olaf Alders, but in the meantime =
I'll fix any new issues that are reported for HTTP::DetectUserAgent.

I've copied Takaaki-san's email address, and Bcc'd the other email =
address I found, just in case.

thanks,
Neil
