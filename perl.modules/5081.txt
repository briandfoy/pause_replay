Hi Johan,

In message "Help!" on modules.perl.org, you said:

I feel your pain.  ;-}   I think some of your frustration may be
coming from a mismatch between your expectations and existing PAUSE
documentation.

Your expectations are sensible, I think, and I'd like to propose (or
maybe you've proposed but I haven't seen it?) that the documentation 
be revised to match them.

I see a lot of people trying pretty hard to faithfully follow the
documentation as it's currently worded.  If I were to ask for a
namespace registration today, I'd raise your frustration level more,
because I'd follow the docs.  I thought we weren't *supposed* to
upload until *after* we've registered...  ;-b

In message "Re: Namespace for Splash?" you said:
> Please apply for registration when the modules have been uploaded.

In message "Re: Namespace Registration Proposal" you said:
> Please upload your modules, and the sumbit a DSLI entry for
> registration.

In message "Re: Renaming Net::SNMP::Interfaces" you said:
> I'd suggest to take this discussion to comp.lang.perl.modules.

In message "Re: Acceptation modules?" you said:
> For the registry of modules:
> - you can upload the modules to CPAN without registering
> - discuss the use, naming and such, in comp.lang.perl.modules
> - when this stabilizes, submit a registry reguest (DSLI entry)

Finally, in message "Re: Help!", you said:
> I think this would be a good requirement anyway: only register

I think this is a good idea -- perhaps even have the unpacking and
indexing process trigger a default registration of some sort.

All of the above conflicts with the docs in the module list itself
though.  Referring to http://cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html:

Section "Playing Your Part" says:
> Instead upload your module, once registered, to the PAUSE site for
> forwarding on to CPAN.

This means register first, then upload.  If we want to instead follow
the policy direction you're trying to set, then this sentence should
probably be changed to say "Upload your module to PAUSE, allow it to
unpack and index, then if all is successful, send a DSLI registration
to modules@perl.org." Or something like that.

Section "2.5 Select a name for the module" says:
> If in any doubt ask for suggestions in comp.lang.perl.modules or
> modules@perl.org.  

If we want to reduce traffic on modules@perl.org, then this sentence
should be changed to remove mention of the modules list.

> Send mail to modules@perl.org before you upload, so we can help you
> select a name. 

This probably needs to say comp.lang.perl.modules instead.

There may be other places in the docs which would also need to be
changed -- these are just the ones I spotted.
