Personally (i.e. not in any way officially), I would recommend not making it a
top level name, especially since the name isn't in any way descriptive.  Perhaps
you could use Business::Bookkeeping::Rbks???

On the other hand, Johan Vromans has had a Dutch-language bookkeeping module,
EekBoek, on CPAN for ~2 years, so what do I know... ;-)
