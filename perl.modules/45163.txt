"One of the BIGGEST g.a.m.b.l.i.n.g companies out there - worth approx. 1.5
billion USD with 20 million customers - is going MLM." 
This means:
!!P.o.k.e.r – C.a.s.i.n.o – G.a.m.b.l.i.n.g – F.u.n!!
From a company who has been doing this on the Web for the past 8 years!
If you are an entrepreneur you will immediately understand what this
represents.
In advance of the launch, (there are still a few weeks to go!) we are
looking for distributors and players to register early.
The sooner you get involved the better off you are – be at the top!
To qualify, you need to have the desire to make a potentially open-ended
amount of revenue and to have some fun at the same time.
We cannot reveal too much at this present time, but if you are interested
to know more as new information is released, please ‘click’ on the ‘More
Info Please!’ link below or simply reply to this email with ‘More Info
Please!’ as the subject.
More Info Please!
If you would not like to be contacted about this again (it’s up to you!)
then please ‘click’ the ‘No Thanks’ link at the bottom of the page or
simply reply to this email with ‘No Thanks’ as the subject.
And remember:
Please respond QUICKLY!! Those Who Come FIRST get the Top Positions!!
Regards,
All The Eights Admin Team.
