Subject: Module submission Java::JCR

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Java::JCR
  DSLIP:       adoOp
  description: Use JSR 170 (JCR) repositories from Perl
  userid:      HANENKAMP (Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Java::Swing

  rationale:

    This is a direct mapping to javax.jcr.* using Inline::Java with
    Perl wrappers for each class for additional functionality and to
    help smooth some of the rough edges such a mapping involves. I've
    also included a tool for connecting to Jackrabbit.

    I've mentioned the desire for something like this on the module
    authors list and am working on a related module, Repository::Simple,
    which may eventually provide a pure-Perl API that does something
    very similar.

    And I really think this belongs in Chapter 7 since it's not a
    language interface, it's a database tool.

The resulting entry would be:

Java::
::JCR             adoOp Use JSR 170 (JCR) repositories from Perl     HANENKAMP
