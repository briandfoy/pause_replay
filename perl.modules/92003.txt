Subject: failure to identify PAUSE ACCOUNT on metacpan.

Hi there,


I tried to identify my PAUSE account on Metacpan.

It says "

An email has been sent to the email address associated with the PAUSE
account. Please check your inbox and verify your account by visiting the
link in the mail.

If you do not receive the email, please ensure that you have properly set
up email forwarding for your PAUSE account.
"
but I didn't get any email, so I checked my PAUSE account setting on
https://pause.perl.org

I could see the setting of forwarding email was checked on "neither nor".

I changed the setting to "my secret email" and sumitted one week ago

However, I am still waiting for it.

I need some your help to make it work.


I apology you if this is not proper mail to ask.


Thanks,
John
