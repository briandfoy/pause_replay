It seems your patch causes some side effect.

1. MMagic.pm can read an external file, use it if it is necessary.
   ex. $mm = File:: MMagic-new('/etc/magic');  #  use external magic file

2. Transaction speed becomes slow when  add mime data lines.
   I am not going to add the low format of the use frequency as much as 
possible.

3. There were not enough sample files for the inspection of magic data, 
I cannot judge your patch.

4. File-MMagic does not support a new format such as 'string/b'.
   Do you come to be usable when you use your patch?
