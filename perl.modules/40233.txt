Dear Friend,

Every day I get at least a half dozen emails from new investors who need some help. And the most common question I get is...

"I read just about every course there is and still can't find a good deal. I think my area has too much competition. Can your course help?"


Well instead of me saying yes it can, blah, blah, blah...I let you, the reader, find out for yourself. So instead of me giving you some kind of sales pitch, I figured I'd give you a small assignment that can land you more goods deals than you could possibly even want!

How's that sound?

First things first...instead of tracking down a bunch of realtors and chasing foreclosures like everyone else, I've got something new for you do.

Okay, what you'll want to do is get a list of all tax-delinquent properties in your area. You can get this by making one phone call to your county building.  Now when you get this list, I want you to contact only the out-of-state owners.

How do you know if they are out of state? That's easy; just take a look at where the tax bills are mailed...nothing complicated there.

Why would I ask you to do this?  Hmmm...let's think about this...if you were living out of state and had a property basically just sitting in another town - doing nothing - how would you feel?

Pretty lousy...don't ya think?

Even better, you would be very motivated to sell. And why not; the property isn't doing anything for you. Heck; the owners aren't even paying the property taxes on it...how much could they really want it? The answer is...they DON'T really want it, and that's where you can swoop in and pick up a killer deal that 99% of other investors don't have a clue was even there!

It's simple my friends, and those deals are out there if you want them. Try this out and tell me what happens.

And one more thing before I call it quits for today...what do you DO with the property once you get it?

Well Friend, it's your choice...but one super smart thing you could do would be to quick flip it like a friend of mine teaches at http://www.one-stop-real-estate.net. The guy is the best in the biz; not only that, he was a boxing trainer to some of the biggest names in the sport. Interesting guy...with fantastic ideas...so check it out!

That's all for now...

Take care

Lou

P.S. Stay tuned to your email for some more top-notch info about if you want to keep the property for long-term cash flow...I've got some amazing articles coming your way this week!
