The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       flatdb
  DSLIP:       idpnb
  description: A more advanced flat file database engine
  userid:      HOUZUO (Houzuo Guo)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/HouzuoGuo/flatdb

  similar:
    Sprite MLDBM::TinyDB

  rationale:

    Currently, there isn't a flat file database implementation in CPAN
    that supports relational algebra. I.e., they only store data but do
    not provide mechanisms for flexible data retrieval (such as
    relational algebras) and flexible data processing (such as using
    query results to update data).

    I have implemented flat file database engines in Python and Go
    programming languages, I plan to make a flat file database engine in
    Perl that has the following features: - Only one column data type -
    string - Create, rename, drop table - Fixed length columns - Add,
    rename, resize, remove column - Insert, update, delete row -
    Relational algebras - rename, join, cross, select, project - Use
    relational algebra results to update/delete data - Utility features
    - sort relational algebra results

The resulting entry would be:

flatdb            idpnb A more advanced flat file database engine    HOUZUO
