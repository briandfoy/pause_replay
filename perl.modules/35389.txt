The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Assert
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Enforces restrictions on variables' contents
  userid:      MOLT (Paul Golds)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's something I've not seen done before, using Tie() to guarantee
    a variable cannot be set to invalid values. It's useful both during
    development (It was originally build to find where a variable was
    becoming invalid, it can also be used for logging variable change),
    and also providing an added level of security to programs.

    The original name was to be Tie::TypeSafe, or Tie::TypeCheck, but a
    number of the Perlmonks Chatterbox people seemed to think
    Tie::Assert was a better name, referring to the use of Assert() in
    C/C++, and also fitting in better with the other *::Assert modules
    on CPAN.

  enteredby:   MOLT (Paul Golds)

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::Assert          adpOp Enforces restrictions on variables' contents MOLT
