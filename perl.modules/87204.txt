The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Sv
  DSLIP:       adpO2
  description: Event-based multi-process supervisor
  userid:      GVL (Gelu Lupaş)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://chiselapp.com/user/ggl/repository/App-Sv

  similar:
    App::SuperviseMe, ControlFreak, Supervisor

  rationale:

    It's an application, hence the namespace choice.

    The supervisor is event-based (using AnyEvent) and uses YAML for
    the configuration. It features a socket for controlling supervised
    services and the ability to log state changes to multiple targets
    (STDOUT/STDERR or a log file), a server part (so start everything
    and listen on the control socket) and a client part (so
    start/stop/restart supervised services or send different signals to
    them).

    This module was born out of necessity, as App::SuperviseMe is too
    basic, ControlFreak has some issues when starting a second instance
    and Supervisor is just a library that you cannot use directly
    without writing simple server and client scripts. This aims to have
    ControlFreak's and Supervisor's features without and keep
    dependencies to a minimum.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Sv              adpO2 Event-based multi-process supervisor         GVL
