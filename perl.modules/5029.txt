Subject: Naming of the NEXT module
Reply-To: damian@conway.org

Dear All,

I am about to unlease a Perl 5 implementation of:

	http://dev.perl.org/rfc/190.html

on the CPAN.

It seems to me that the obvious name is NEXT.pm, so users can just say:

	use NEXT;

and then proceed to...err...use NEXT.

However, I always like to check when I'm contemplating naming a
"top-level" module, especially one that might well find its way into
a future 5.7 or 5.8 release (hint, hint, Jarrko -- this is that
optimal "bang for the buck" OO module you were looking for! ;-).

So, does anyone object to my uploading a module called NEXT.pm?

Damian
