Randal -

A-ha! I understand now. CPAN.pm grabs the latest version of every module, 
rather than those from my latest release (I can see how that caused you 
some problems). Since that difficulty I had with WinCVS last summer, it 
started the version numbers over on some of my modules.

I knew I should learn more about how CPAN works, so I guess now is that time.

BTW: I had already scheduled v2.23 for deletion (last night). Doesn't 
matter I guess, since v2.16 (which I left) has a NLv1.04, too . . .

I'm working on it . . . bundling these modules makes more sense anyway, so 
perhaps that's the way I'll go (or do I have to own a namespace to do that? 
hmm . . .)
