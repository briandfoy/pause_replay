The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::DirSync
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Syncronize two directories rapidly
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    It's already being used.

  similar:
    File::Copy

  rationale:

    File::DirSync will make two directories exactly the same. The goal
    is to perform this syncronization process as quickly as possible
    with as few stats and reads and writes as possible. It can be used
    for many purposes, but I use it to avoid accessing commonly needed
    files across a slow NFS mount by using File::DirSync to sync
    everything to a local hard drive. It can gaurantee exact file
    structure consistency within the entire descend of two directories
    for hundreds of megabytes of files, directories, and symlinks within
    a few milliseconds.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::DirSync         bdpOp Syncronize two directories rapidly           BBB
