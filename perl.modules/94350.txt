<html><body><span style=3D"font-family:Verdana; color:#000000; font-size:10=
pt;"><div>Neil,</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for clarifying this. I w=
ill create a core <a href=3D"http://Ginger.pm">Ginger.pm</a> for this purpo=
se and include it. Really it should be there anyway in order to describe th=
e purpose and arrangement of the 'Ginger' namespace.</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>I assume that I can still release other deeper modules in the same packa=
ge, ( Ginger::Reference::... ), and they will properly be accepted? I alrea=
dy do see them CPAN, but I do not see updated permissions in Pause.</div><d=
iv><br></div><div>Some additional questions that I don't see answered elsew=
here, for you or anyone else on the list who can answer these:</div><div><b=
r></div><div>1. I want Ginger::Reference to be reserved for official ginger=
 modules. In order to make that be true, do I need to also release a 'Ginge=
r/<a href=3D"http://Reference.pm">Reference.pm</a>' module in the release t=
o ensure people don't add random things under that namespace?</div><div><br=
></div><div>2. Is it acceptable to create a 'Ginger::WebApp' namespace, and=
 suggest people place Apps created using Ginger inside of that? Obviously t=
hey could simply place them in the normal 'App' namespace, but I feel like =
it may be more meaningful to home them in Ginger since they will have stron=
g dependencies upon many modules under Ginger. I say 'Ginger::WebApp' and n=
ot 'Ginger::App', since 'Ginger::ShellApp' should be applications that can =
run under a command line.</div><div><br></div><div>3. I created 'Ginger::Re=
ference' to contain all the modules that are the 'Reference' implementation=
s for core functionality of the framework. I say 'Reference' because I want=
 people to be able to write different implementations that still function w=
ith the same API. I was thinking of having those go under 'Ginger::Custom'.=
 The advice being that the custom modules names would mirror the reference =
modules names. So, someone would create 'Ginger::Custom::Log::Log4J' and it=
 would act similar to 'Ginger::Reference::Log::Default'. I want to keep use=
r implementations separate namespace wise so that it is clear what the "off=
icial" interactions are among the core modules.</div><div><br></div><div>4.=
 One of the facets of the Framework is that it is meant to facilitate havin=
g whole web applications live in CPAN. Install a 'Ginger::WebApp::...' and =
it will function completely just by running a tiny script calling it. As a =
result, those applications will need to be serving out JS libraries. I was =
thinking of having something like "Ginger::Lib::Web::JS::JQuery", and actua=
lly placing a module containing the JQuery distribution itself. Is it accep=
table for me to home entire JS libraries in CPAN for this purpose? I though=
t of having them download automatically from the internet, but there are pe=
ople running CPAN behind firewalls where they cannot reach the internet. If=
 I did that those people would not be able to use the WebApps as internal a=
pplications as easily.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again for all help w=
ith this.</div><div>- David</div><div><br></div>=0A<blockquote id=3D"replyB=
