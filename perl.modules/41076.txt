Hi,

    I am the module maintainer for Nmap::Scanner.  I did an update to my
    module, to version 0.8, on 27 Apr 2005, or at least I thought I had ..
    I received an email from a user today who said that my module was not
    downloadable from CPAN, I went and checked, and this is the case.

    I tried to reupload my module, version 0.8, but got an error about a 
    duplicate file, so renamed and uploaded again .. I then spent some time
    searching for the duplicate upload, and instead of finding it under my
    cpan.org download section, I found it in backpan!

    This is very confusing, I don't understand why my previous upload was
    moved to backpan, I didn't get any email about any errors with the module,
    and it was the latest version .. my previous update is in place on CPAN
    from the website perspective but using CPAN one cannot download it :(.

    testers.cpan.org shows all passes for tests for it.

    Please help me figure out what happened and why my module is no longer
    able to be download .. why my latest update was moved to backpan instead
    of being indexed and made the current release.

    I know you are volunteers, thank you very much in advance for your help ..
    I am lost about what to do to remedy this situation, I did reupload the
    module today and received emails that it was uploaded and verified but
    it seems like something is very weird with my account now .. I had done
    3 updates previous to 0.8 and they all worked flawlessly.

    If I have emailed the wrong address, please let me know, I hate to bother
    any of you, I just don't understand why my update failed and why that update
    was not made primary but instead moved to backpan!

Thank you,
Max
