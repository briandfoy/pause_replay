The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::View::Download
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Convenient Formatted Content Downloads.
  userid:      GAUDEON (Travis Chase)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Newsgroup: comp.lang.perl.modules Mailing List:
    http://lists.scsys.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/catalyst-dev

  similar:

  rationale:

    The choice of this namespace directly relates to the purpose, to
    support downloading of content in a variety of formats. And it's
    intended audience, Catalyst Users. Granted there are only two format
    options right now, however I plan to add more and the module allows
    for easy expansion by anyone, either under this namespace or not.
    The value of this module is that within one Catalyst Controller
    Action several formats may be supported while only one ends up being
    the final format based on the choices made in said action. So one
    could provide a HTML, CSV and PDF export options, for example. Then
    based on something as simple as a parameter passed via the http
    request, the action could determine which should format be the final
    output for download.

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::View::
::Download        RdpOp Convenient Formatted Content Downloads.      GAUDEON
