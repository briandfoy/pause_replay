I actually tried that, but CPAN still has been sending me email
to my non-secret address, sadly.

But that's not the real point here - the real problem here is
that CPAN seems to have no problem publishing email addresses
on the web, which is generally considered unwise.

When I replied to your first message, I sadly didn't realize
that the reply-to was set to modules@perl.org, and now my
reply email address is sadly on the web.  I wish I could change that.

The cpan email address I use (which is also published at the cpan
list of authors) is one of my worst spam receivers, pulling in over
2000 spam messages just in 2006, that's over 10 per day, *just* to
the address that I only use for CPAN.

I would have to *massively* agree with Adam Kennedy's point about
using something like HTML::Email::Obfuscate, as far as I'm concerned,
this is desperately needed for me to be able to have any sort of
point of communication available for CPAN.
