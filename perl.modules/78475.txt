Subject: Module naming question (wrapper to IPsonar API)

Hello, I'm writing a module to interface with an application called =
IPsonar.
IPsonar is written by a company called Lumeta and is a tool used to tell =
middle-large organizations things that they didn't know about their =
network.

I work at Lumeta but this is a personal project rather than being =
company sponsored (I enjoy perl and while our developers do too, they've =
got too much on their plate to put together a module for CPAN).

My initial thought was that I would name the module "IPsonar-<version>", =
but in looking at the namespace registration form it looks like new root =
namespaces are discouraged.

I've looked through the existing modules and I didn't see an existing =
namespace that looked really appropriate.  It looked like there were a =
few application-specific root names, but I'm not sure if that reflect =
current best practice.

Obviously (based on my asking what's probably a dumb question) I'm new =
to all things PAUSE, would someone be able to comment on whether my =
module name would be appropriate or if there's a better place for it.

Thanks, George Budd
