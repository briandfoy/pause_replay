     why:

    I created a Many-Core Engine (MCE) for Perl. MCE helps developers
    maximize on available cores (for example under Linux). Both threads
    and forking are supported. Workers are launched once. MCE has very
    little overhead. MCE is a chunking engine. It's also an aggregating
    engine as well.

    I have two Perl modules: EnvInitAndCleanup.pm (tmp_dir creating and
    signal handling and cleanup) ManyCoreEngine.pm (The Many-Core
    Engine)

    If you can, please help me identify the name space this should go
    under. Currently, the the modules works with Perl 5.8.x and tested
    up to 5.14.x (UNIX only at this time)

    Thanks, Mario
