I'd like to become co-maintainer of the Mail-Webmail-Gmail module:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/Mail-Webmail-Gmail/

Has been unmaintained since April 2005, and is now broken due to the gmail 
interface change. I wrote and submitted a patch to fix it:

http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=14540

However it was not applied since its submission. The author did not respond to 
my ping, and had not dealt with the incompatiblity change.

Thus, please make my user on PAUSE ("SHLOMIF") a co-maintainer of this module 
so I can upload a corrected version of it there.

Thanks in advance,

	Shlomi Fish
