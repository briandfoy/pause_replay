Free - Subscription to our quarterly e-zine to help you and your organisation work better with IT
 
Help your organisation keep up-to-date with the latest in IT learning and development.

Everyday Jopa Learning helps thousands of organisations like yours work better with Technology.  

It seems to be that the only constant in our lives, particularly in the work environment, is change!   Our learning resources are used by thousands of organisations of various sizes and our e-zine is designed to pass on to you the wealth of knowledge,information, tips & tricks that we have gained over the past 10 years.  

LearnIT will show you how to; increase productivity using your existing IT products, help people feel more comfortable with technology, make the most of your training budget, and decide which are the best methods and tools to use when providing learning, not just in IT, but across the board.  Our goal is to ensure that technology is used to its fullest potential and the learning resources, services and information that we provide will help you achieve this too.

In the first of our quarterly newsletters, we ask the question "Is instructor-led training dead?", which is the issue of instructor-led training versus-learning.  This has been an important issue for some time now and many organisations have not fully come to grips with how to make the most of the e-learning medium, while ensuring the quality of their training is not impacted by a lack of people-to-people contact in the training room.

How We Found You

We found your email address on your web site, and have sent you this email, because research has shown that organisations similar to yours have benefited enormously from the information to work better with technology - information that we provide free.

If you are not interested in receiving our free e-zine,simply reply to the email with the subject of"unsubscribe" and we will gladly remove you from any further mailings and ensure that we do not bother you again.  Otherwise we would love to help you and your organisation keep on top of the constant changes in IT and the work environment!
 
Please enjoy ...
