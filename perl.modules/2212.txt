My CPAN id is TJMATHER.

I'm planning to upload two Perl Modules to CPAN.  They are

1. HTML::FillInForm
2. DBIx::FullTextSearch

Currently they are posted at http://www.thoughtstore.com/~tjmather/perl/

I would like to know if these names are acceptable.  Here's a brief
summary of what they do:

	DBIx::FullTextSearch - Indexing documents with MySQL as
storage.  Indexes databases, files, and URLs.  Includes support for
phrases, required words, and stop words.  This was originally named
MyConText by Jan Pazdziora.
	HTML::FillInForm - Populates HTML Forms with CGI data.  Populates 
HTML Forms with CGI (or other) data.  One useful application is after a
user submits an HTML form without filling out required field.
HTML::FillInForm can be used to redisplay the HTML form with all the form
elements containing the submitted info.
