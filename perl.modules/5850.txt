PREFFERED USERID: avp
DESCRIPTION: I have written Template Engine in Perl. It's rewrite of
very usable Xtpl engine to Perl. Now I have:

	PHP - C Engine.
Today I want to contribute Perl version of Engine to CPAN.
But I plan to made XS (C) version of engine (for better
perfomance). So I want to make this standart for Web-
deelopment. :-)
