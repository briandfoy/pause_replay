Subject: Module submission LSN

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LSN
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Content Management Framework
  userid:      RYANGIES (Ryan Gies)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    LSN Is short for Livesite Networks. The intention is to support
    developers using the Livesite Networks runtime.

    Being that there are (currently) 220 callable methods, convience to
    those methods is provided via the root (LSN) package. For example:

    LSN::callback( ... ) LSN::writefile( ... ) LSN::find( ... )

    And because of this, a 3 letter namespace is ideal.

    This is a compilation of several modules which are sub categorized
    like LSN::Base::, LSN::Webapp::

    LSN/: | |-Base/: | | |-Config.pm | | |-File.pm | | |-HashFile.pm |
    | |-HashUtil.pm | | |-Instance.pm | | |-Logger.pm | | |-NoOp.pm | |
    |-Parse.pm | | |-Path.pm | | `-PerlUtil.pm | |-Std/: | | |-Nest/: |
    | | |-Array.pm | | | |-Base.pm | | | |-DB_File.pm | | | |-Hash.pm |
    | | `-Scalar.pm | | |-Archive.pm | | |-Calendar.pm | | |-Data.pm | |
    |-Database.pm | | |-Meta.pm | | |-Nest.pm | | `-Util.pm | `-Webapp/:
    | |-CGI.pm | |-Client.pm | |-Color.pm | |-ImgSize.pm | |-Module.pm |
    |-PageData.pm | |-Template.pm | |-Variable.pm | |-WebPage.pm |
    `-WebSite.pm `-LSN.pm

The resulting entry would be:

LSN               bdphp Content Management Framework                 RYANGIES
