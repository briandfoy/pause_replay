Subject: Module submission CommaEquals
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, gryphon@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CommaEquals
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Adds support for ,= to any package or script
  userid:      GRYPHON (Gryphon Shafer)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:
    Switch?

  rationale:

    NAMESPACE CHOICE I'm not really excited about using a root
    namespace, but CommaEquals seems to match the same theory as what
    Switch.pm is doing. I suppose it could go under Filter:: or
    Language::, probably Filter:: being better, but it doesn't really
    match any of the other modules in Filter::.

    UNIQUENESS OF APPROACH I'm not sure how unique this is, but I don't
    see any other module that does this. ,= seems like it should be
    something in core.

The resulting entry would be:

CommaEquals       bdppp Adds support for ,= to any package or script GRYPHON
