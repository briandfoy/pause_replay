Due to the prevalence of network gateway AV products, it is important =
that
all        =20
submissions be zipped and the zip file password-protected (password -
infected). Some =20
products will reject an email that contains a virus that is not sent in =
this
way. In  =20
addition, often we receive a file that appears not to have been =
infected, to
find     =20
later that the file was infected when it left the sender, and was =
cleaned
somewhere   =20
along the line.
