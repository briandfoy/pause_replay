PAUSE Admins: Normally I would wait for a response, but it looks like
all of the contacts for this user are all expired. And I assume the
cpan address I sent to probably was never setup based on the age of
the account. What is the procedure when there are not contacts for a
module owner?

Thanks,
Todd
