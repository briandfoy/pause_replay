I cannot think of any scenario where I would want to block a duplicate
upload from the same user but allow a duplicate upload from another user...
this sounds like a failure in application of the "be liberal in what you
accept" rule.

Is this genuinely considered a beneficial feature?  Is there any appetite
for tightening up the checking?

If not, it sounds like we need another release-time tool for checking PAUSE
for duplicate uploads.  This can be done as a Dist::Zilla plugin, but that
won't benefit dists not using that tool (and local::lib is in that class,
unfortunately).

It looks as if metacpan is just following PAUSE's lead here.
