It helps to include the module name in your message :)

Try to contact the author anyway that you can, and include a message
here that you're interested in maintaining the module (include the
module name!). Make a public announcement where a lot of people are
likely to see it. Then wait.

After a couple weeks, if there isn't a response, we can make you a
co-maintainer. We don't do this quickly though, because we want to give
the original author every chance to respond.
