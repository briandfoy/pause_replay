The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::SHA
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: SHA-1/256/384/512 (BIT and BYTE Inputs)
  userid:      MSHELOR (Mark Shelor)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Digest::SHA1

  rationale:

    The primary reason for submitting Digest::SHA is that the current
    CPAN modules contain support for byte-oriented inputs only. It would
    require major surgery of the underlying C code to get them to accept
    bit-strings (which is useful for cryptanalysis). Also, Digest::SHA
    supports all NIST algorithms in FIPS PUB 180-2, whereas the current
    modules focus on particular subsets.

    Responses on comp.lang.perl.modules indicate that the Digest::
    space is the most appropriate one for this module, and that
    Digest::SHA would be the most appropriate name since the module
    covers all algorithms and input types described in the SHA standard.
    For reference, the thread in which this was discussed is "RFD:
    SHA-1/256/384/512 Bitwise Implementation".

  enteredby:   MSHELOR (Mark Shelor)
  enteredon:   Sat Oct 11 10:23:57 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::SHA             bdcfp SHA-1/256/384/512 (BIT and BYTE Inputs)      MSHELOR
