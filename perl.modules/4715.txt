Description of contribution : Date convert module
DSLI                        : Rdpf


Extended descrption :

I created Date::MMDDYY to be able to do quick conversions of a epoch
time stamp into a MM-DD-YY format. Just feed the function datecon(); a
epoch time stamp, and it returns the date string. Examples for use would
be to create a list of dates from today, to 5 days ago .. Just keep on
subtracting 86400 from the current time(); and then just run datecon();
on the time .. Not sure if it is usefull for anyone else, but I have had
to use it all the time, as our developers love putting s MM-DD-YY
timestamp on alot of logs files ..
