Another way to handle this, if we were back at the start, was to make
your work part of the Django project. :)

Everyone suggested DTL as a name. I don't really like that. After
reading the thread, it sounds like you aren't implementing exactly what
Django does, but just something close to it. If your Perl thing called
DTL doesn't act like the PHP thing DTL, then people will be confused.

I don't have a better suggestion at the moment.
