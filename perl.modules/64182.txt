Hello,

I'd like to automatically download Perlbal via CPAN. Downloading
manually via the link on this page:

http://search.cpan.org/~dormando/Perlbal-1.72/

works fine, but this is not appropriate for use in a script (ie, the
CPAN downloader script in OpenBSD's port tree). The problem is that the
required directories and/or links under .../CPAN/modules/by-module
don't exist.

This URL should work, but doesn't:
ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/modules/by-module/Perlbal/Perlbal-1.72.tar.gz


After opening a ticket on cpan ([perl #62642]), Graham Barr told me to
turn to PAUSE. Reading there, specifically this page:
http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about

Quote: "There are also two symlink trees of modules maintained
automatically. One is based on the basenames of the packages involved:
by-module and the other one divides the modules by the chapters of the
Module List: by-category."

I now tend to assume that something has gone wrong in the creation of
this symlink tree.

It would be great if someone could fix this problem.


Thank you!


Kind regards,
--Toni++
