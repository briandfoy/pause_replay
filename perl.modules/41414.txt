The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GStreamer
  DSLIP:       bmcOl
  description: Interface to the GStreamer library
  userid:      TSCH (Torsten Schönfeld)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Mailinglist: http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gtk-perl-list

  similar:
    Audio::* Video::Xine Video::Info::*

  rationale:

    The GStreamer module provides Perl bindings for the GStreamer
    library, the de-facto standard for video and audio playback in GNOME
    and KDE. The namespace choice was discussed at length on
    module-authors@perl.org and on modules@perl.org -- GStreamer was the
    compromise between Gst and Media::GStreamer.

    GStreamer is related to the modules mentioned above insofar that it
    offers the same functionality as they do through its plugin
    mechanism. GStreamer itself is a framework that provides things like
    pipelines, threads and containers for the numerous plugins. There
    are plugins for nearly any kind of multimedia content.

    I would like to file this under some kind of multimedia category in
    the module list, but such a category doesn't seem to exist.

The resulting entry would be:

GStreamer         bmcOl Interface to the GStreamer library           TSCH
