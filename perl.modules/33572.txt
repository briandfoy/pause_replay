The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CPAN::Search::Lite::Index
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: maintain a searchable CPAN database
  userid:      RKOBES (Randy Kobes)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    use.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a suite of modules that are used to run the CPAN search
    engine at http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/htdocs/cpan-search.html. The
    CPAN::Search::Lite::* namespace was chosen after discussions with
    Elaine at search.cpan.org, so as not to possibly lead to confusion
    with the software running search.cpan.org. There are two main types
    of modules included - set up and maintain the database, and an
    interface to perform queries. Some sample Apache mod_perl handlers
    with Template-Toolkit pages are also included to provide a web
    interface, as are some sample scripts providing a SOAP interface.

The resulting entry would be:

CPAN::Search::Lite::
::Index           adpOp maintain a searchable CPAN database          RKOBES
