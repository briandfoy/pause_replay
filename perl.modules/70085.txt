Subject: Module submission IPC::MMA
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::MMA
  DSLIP:       Mdhfp
  description: Shared Memory using R. Engelschall's mm lib
  userid:      MACKENNA (Craig MacKenna)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    modperl@perl.apache.org, modules@perl.org, module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    IPC::MM

  rationale:

    I have been working on this module since Q4 2008. It works fine
    now, and seems to have some usage. However, the namespace
    registration that I requested on 2/13/09 seems to have gotten lost.
    It was never approved nor denied. Please consider this either a
    reminder of the prior request, or a new one as you prefer.

    Adapted from previous submission: The existing IPC::MM hash feature
    is considered by many to be"broken" because its keys must be ASCII
    strings rather than general Perl scalars. Also its approach to
    locking is almost impossible to use. IPC::MMA remedies these
    problems and also adds full Perl array functionality in shared
    memory. Like IPC::MM, this module is based on Ralf Engelschall's mm
    library.

    At the time Brian Foy asked why I didn't re-use the name IPC::MM. I
    replied that I didn't want to do that because it had a bad
    reputation.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
