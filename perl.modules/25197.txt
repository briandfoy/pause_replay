The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::Helix
  DSLIP:       adchp
  description: Helix Used as a Pure MAC Function
  userid:      MSHELOR (Mark Shelor)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Digest

  rationale:

    The Helix stream cipher and MAC function are gaining increasing
    interest in the cryptographic community since the publication of the
    Ferguson, Schneier, et al. paper defining this new algorithm.
    Currently, there is no Helix support whatsoever within CPAN. The
    Digest::Helix module would provide a convenient way for
    cryptographers to conduct further research into this algorithm. It's
    also conjectured that this module would provide Perl users with one
    of the fastest ways to compute cryptographically strong message
    digests.

    I am the author of the Digest::SHA module, which fully complies
    with all OO interface guidelines established in the Digest:: module.
    The Digest::Helix module would also fit these same guidelines,
    thereby making its operation very easy to understand for CPAN Digest
    users.

    NB: the authors of Helix "explicitly release any intellectural
    property rights to Helix into the public domain." The CPAN
    implementation would be released under the standard Perl license.

  enteredby:   MSHELOR (Mark Shelor)
  enteredon:   Sun Dec 21 06:00:36 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::Helix           adchp Helix Used as a Pure MAC Function            MSHELOR
