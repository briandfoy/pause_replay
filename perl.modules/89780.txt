     why:

    to say what is planned to contribute is truly difficult. I have
    always gone to the job I can get and each has had a new problem
    space where I engage myself. I thrive in web services, network
    administration, and application development for business. So, when
    an eligible contribution occurs from these various future endeavors
    I will consider a contribution now that I am signing up here if I am
    accepted.
