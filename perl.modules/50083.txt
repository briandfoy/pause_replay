     why:

    This module will use SpreadSheet::WriteExcel to automatically
    generate a formatted spreadsheet based on a small number of options.
    The data that will be used for the information of the spreadsheet
    will need to be in a 2d array. The module will also allow for totals
    to be placed in the spreadsheet. This module will then write the
    spreadsheet to a file, send an email, or place it up for CGI use.
    It's meant for people that generate a lot of simple reports and
    don't want to waste time with formatting their own templates.
