I can't really make a suggestion if you don't show any examples of usage.

What distinguishes it from Data::SPath? From Data::DPath? From straight up
XPath matching using an adaptor like Class::XPath?

"It picks the right thing 80% of the time" is true of all of those from the
point of view of the people -currently- using each one. I'm not using any yet
- what's special about your module apart from "it's a different set of
defaults" ? What made it worth being a separate module rather than a wrapper
around SPath or DPath ?

These are the questions you need answers to in order to pick a -good- name
rather than a merely adequate one - you try and answer them and we'll try
and help you come up with it :)
