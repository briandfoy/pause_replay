Because most people don't care what style is used for the interface, 
they care about getting some task accomplished.  And those who DO 
care about the style and not the functionality, well, they should be 
shot.

Note that "Date::Object" tells me not a jot about what the module 
actually does for me.  So the name is DOUBLY bad.  It not only tells 
me about the interface, which I don't care one whit about, but it 
doesn't tell me what the module does, which is what I do care about.

I also think names like Text::CSV_XS are Really Bad.  Pick a new name 
if you have to, don't tell me how it is implemented.  I can read the 
docs if I happen to care (which I probably won't).

Well, I don't know the implementation details, but I've never had 
significant problem with making stuff alternately functional or OO. 
Worst case scenario is to write it in OO and then have wrapper 
functions that you can export.

That assumes facts not in evidence, that the OO interface equates to 
more comfort.

I think that possibly one does not exist.  Now, Date::Calc::Simple or 
Date::Calc::Easy might be better ... but it might also be misleading, 
if the only difference is that it is OOP.

Maybe there is not a need for this new module?  Just a thought.  Good luck,
