Hello again.  I'd like to release a module I'm developing on CPAN.  It's a
CGI::Application module that allows people to mail HTML pages to their
friends.  I'd like to call it CGI::Application::MailPage.  I have the
permission of Jesse Erlbaum, the author of CGI::Application, to put it
under his namespace.

The module is configurable in a number of ways - it can use sendmail or
SMTP, the HTML it uses can be changed and the format of the email it sends
can be modified.  The users of the module can choose to send HTML or
auto-generated text or just a plain link.  They can also choose to have
the page sent as an attachment.

The module uses CGI::Application, Mail::Tools, MIME::Tools, HTML::Template
and CGI.pm.  It will be the first CGI::Application module on CPAN and as
such represents something of an experiment.  I'm hopeful that this will
encourage others to make configurable, reusable versions of their CGI apps
available on CPAN.

So, is the name OK?  Do you want to see the POD I've written so far?
