The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Components
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: date and date component functions
  userid:      DMAC (David McAllister)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    None

  similar:
    Date::Calc and Date::Simple are OOP and do NOT provide a long range
    parser, formatter and do not do all the operations I require on date
    components.

  rationale:

    I am writing financial planning software that requires a long
    working date range, general purpose and overloaded parser and date
    formatter. Also, I need to perform operations on date components as
    well which precludes an OOP approach. My needs do not require any
    knowledge of time and thus this module is completely time
    independent which results in a more compact, simpler and faster
    module than if time functionality were to be included.

    Most, if not all other, date modules take an OOP approach where the
    basic date is a standard object. This module operates on dates as
    well as the four date components - month, dayofmonth, year and
    dayofweek.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::Components      bdpfg date and date component functions            DMAC
