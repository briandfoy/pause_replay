The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Schedule::Parallel
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: N-way parallel execution of queue via forks.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Schedule::At Schedule::Cron Schedule::Load

  rationale:

    Schedule:: seems likely since this runs the jobs N-way parallel. It
    does not perform any significant process control (aside from reaping
    children). It isn't really a system interface, since the forked
    process begins life by running a closure rather than exec or system.
    It was originally developed to simplify database loading and
    gzip-ing from large directories.

    Main difference between this and others is taking in an array of
    closures. This simplifies building the queue: Items do not need to
    be of the same type or package to get executed. Building the queue
    can reduce to a single map statement in many cases (see test.pl).

    Main differences between this and other scheduling modules is
    keeping track of N-way execution and a simple interface.

The resulting entry would be:

Schedule::
::Parallel        Rdpfp N-way parallel execution of queue via forks. LEMBARK
