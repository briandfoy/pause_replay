Well, the latest version in CPAN is 0.2.1 when you look in your author
directory.

The problem is that the latest version wasn't indexed for some reason.
Did you get an indexer failure report from PAUSE?

I don't see anything different in your $VERSION line. You can try to
reindex it and see if you get another failure:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=reindex

IF that doesn't solve it or tell you what the problem is, Andreas might
have to help.
