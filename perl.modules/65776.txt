The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::MAGETAB
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Reading and writing MAGE-TAB docs
  userid:      TFRAYNER (Tim Rayner)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://magetabutils.sourceforge.net/

  similar:
    Bio::MAGE

  rationale:

    The biological research community has, over the years, developed a
    number of different file formats for exchanging microarray data. The
    latest of these is MAGE-TAB, a tabular format developed in response
    to the perceived failings of its predecessor, MAGE-ML (supported by
    the Bio::MAGE module namespace). MAGE-TAB is quite distinct from
    MAGE-ML; the latter is a very complex XML-based format while
    MAGE-TAB represents a simplification of the overall object model to
    capture just the minimum required information. In addition, the
    module dependencies differ greatly between the two approaches. As a
    result I feel Bio::MAGETAB deserves its own namespace. I am not
    aware of any other community efforts to create a Perl API for
    manipulating MAGE-TAB documents.

    PS. My apologies for submitting this twice; the web form apparently
    has a hair trigger!
