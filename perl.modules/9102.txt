Subject: Module DBIx::Librarian missing from CPAN index
Date: Sat, 1 Dec 2001 15:28:52 -0800
X-Mailer: KMail [version 1.2]

My recently-released module DBIx::Librarian (currently at v0.2)
has disappeared from the CPAN index.  It is reachable via
search.cpan.org, but not through CPAN.pm or on Randy Kobes'
site.  Also, my author id (JMAY) is missing from the index.
Is it possible that the index could be corrupted?  It was fine
up until a week or so back.

Any assistance in resolving this is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
-Jason
