         Hi, =0A Mail::Spamcannibal is reported in CPAN as "A tool to stop =
SPAM". However, that description is misleading, as the personal gripes of t=
he author with very large senders (such as SES) mean that it (by design) st=
ops a large amount of non-spam emails, which the author acknowledges, citin=
g the 'no warranty of fitness for any particular purposes'. however, that d=
oes not mean that its entry is misleading nor that this software is not to =
be considered malicious - in its default install, it will silently harm its=
 users a lot more than doing them good, hence qualifying for malicious soft=
ware. While the author is fully entitled to free speech, I don't believe CP=
AN is under any commitment to provide the 'stage' so to speak, not to menti=
on certify a misleading entry. I request that you delist this module and it=
s submodules, I can provide additional evidence as needed. =0A Regards, =0A=
 Gil
