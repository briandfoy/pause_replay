Subject: Module submission AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, grandpa@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Particle Swarm Optimization - OO interface
  userid:      GRANDPA (Peter Jaquiery)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:
    AI::PSO

  rationale:

    Simple to use OO interface with otherwise similar implementation to
    AI::PSO

    This is a substantially rewritten module compared to AI::PSO with a
    completely different and incompatible OO API.

    The suggested name has been changed as suggested by brian d foy
    from AI::PSO::OO to AI::ParticleSwarmOptimization.

    The module is currently uploaded as AI::PSO::OO, but will be
    removed and uploaded using the new name when approved.

  enteredby:   GRANDPA (Peter Jaquiery)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 22 09:03:21 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

AI::
::ParticleSwarmOptimization RdpOp Particle Swarm Optimization - OO interface   GRANDPA
