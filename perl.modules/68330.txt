Subject: Module submission Net::IRR

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IRR
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Internet Route Registry daemon (IRRd) client
  userid:      TCAINE (Todd Caine)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Referenced from the www.irrd.net website. Referenced in many
    presentations by MERIT, and various Regional Internet Registries.

  similar:

  rationale:

    This library is a client interface to the Internet Route Registry
    daemon IRRd. It is widely used by internet service providers who use
    one of the many available internet route registries such as the
    RADB. Since this library connects to an external daemon over the
    network and supplies detailed information about networks and their
    policies, I feel like it makes sense to live under the Net::
    root-level namespace.

  enteredby:   TCAINE (Todd Caine)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov  6 03:17:30 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::IRR             RdpOp Internet Route Registry daemon (IRRd) client TCAINE
