Dear CPAN mantainers,

I will be happy to contribute to the CPAN archive. I've some ready (and tested 
on the ground) modules to upload, and I'm starting to think,talk,investigate 
and all the everything before send them to CPAN :-)

In the meanwile I send you my personal datas:

	name:	Lorenzo Canovi
	email:	lorenzo@lcanovi.com
	www:	http://www.lcanovi.com (not yet operative)
	id:	KANNA

I use perl for a lot of duties, mostly in a higly customized environment, but 
some of this work can be usefull to other people. Actually the exportable 
stuffs (modules, pure perl, all already in the CPAN installable form) are:

- a module to read and write text configuration files; there are other modules 
that do this, in variuos manners, but this is capable to read different 
formats, and have an the interest feature of "inerithance" of definitions 
(obtained with multiple files merging, and section nesting). This can be 
used, for example, to setup a sort of "system default" read-only settings, 
merged with local definitions. A 'tie' module is provided to interact with 
the content of a config file using an hash interface. You can write modified 
datas back to a text files, with various options (full, only differeces to 
original, etc); there is some work to be made, the docs are in italian 
language only, I would to add the capability to read and store binary 
(encoded) datas, but the module is almost ready to use.

- a simple module to write data to a stream with fixed len records size ... I 
think that this module is not so usefull, I'm sure that there is already 
something of this kind in the CPAN

- a package (module collection) for building and run text menues: It's use 
termcap capabilites to generate text based screens, accept options, or select 
items or files, launch commands, etc. I must investigate if this kind of 
modules are usefull for other people. All the modules need some work to be 
exportable outside the original development environment.

- a module to manage a user session over a tcp/ip connection (a ftp like 
interface): basicly a pattern reconition combined with a function handler, 
with some added stuffs like send/recv of binary datas, syntax check, online 
help and others. I used it to build some simple client/server apps (like a 
network oriented backup utility, before I discovered the 'amanda' project, or 
a "configuration data exchanger").

All modules are object oriented, doesn't pollute namespaces, have debug and 
error handling features ... as far as my coder capabilites can do :-)

Well, I hope to ear you soon,
bye.
