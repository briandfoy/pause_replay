     why:

    I have a module providing a few functions for managing options data
    - collecting listed options for an instrument, determining which
    cycle an equity lists options for, calculating listed options for
    the next listed month, and collecting intraday adds. In an options
    trading firm's database it is not uncommon to have traders
    monitoring 60k options. It's a lot of data to sort through, and
    these functions helped me. I hope they can help someone else.
