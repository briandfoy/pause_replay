Looking at your RWDE.pm file from
http://search.cpan.org/src/DAMJANP/RWDE-518/RWDE.pm, I see that the file
has no package statement. Yet you specify VERSION_FROM that file in the
Makefile.PL. Quite frankly, I'm not surprised it's not being picked up
by the indexer.

The proper fix would be to add a

package RWDE;

to RWDE.pm.

While you're at it, may I suggest that you move the .pm files under
lib/? That's part of the best-practices for CPAN distribution structure.

Best regards,
Steffen
