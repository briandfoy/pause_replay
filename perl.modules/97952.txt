Hi Daniel,

>> I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working through =
tidying up permissions conflicts that have been caused by the fact that =
PAUSE now consider package names case insensitively (due to =
case-insensitive filesystems, as on Windows and MacOS X). PAUSE =
doesn=E2=80=99t let these situations occur now, but we have some =
historical cases. I=E2=80=99m sorting these out so that we don=E2=80=99t =
need code in the toolchain for dealing with permissions conflicts.
>>=20
>> You have first-come permission on =
SOAP::Transport::ACTIVEWORKS::Client, which you last released in
>>=20
>>   SOAP-Lite-ActiveWorks-0.10.tar.gz        (released 26th Oct 2000)
>>=20
>> You also have first-come permission on =
SOAP::Transport::ActiveWorks::Client, which you last released in
>>=20
>>   D/DY/DYACOB/SOAP-ActiveWorks-0.12.tar.gz (released 27th Oct 2000)
>>=20
>> These package names are different only in case. To resolve the =
potential conflict, I propose dropping your permissions on the older =
SOAP::Transport::ACTIVEWORKS::Client, and deleting the 0.10 and 0.11 =
releases from your CPAN author directory.
>=20
> How would you like to resolve this conflict?
>=20
> As I said above, it looks to me as it SOAP-ActiveWorks was superseded =
by SOAP-Lite-ActiveWorks, so the former distribution could be deleted =
from CPAN, and the permissions on that dropped.
>=20
> I can do those steps on your behalf, with your permission. Or do you =
want to keep both dists on CPAN? If the latter, then one of the modules =
should be resolved, as at the moment people on case-insensitive =
filesystems can=E2=80=99t have both distributions installed at the same =
time, as one of SOAP::Transport::ACTIVEWORKS::Client and =
SOAP::Transport::ActiveWorks::Client will over-write the other.

Since you haven=E2=80=99t replied to any of my emails, and neither =
distribution has had a release since 2001, I will shortly resolve this =
by dropping your first-come permission on =
SOAP::Transport::ActiveWorks::Client; that will resolve the conflict. =
Both releases will still be on CPAN, but =
SOAP::Transport::ActiveWorks::Client won=E2=80=99t be indexed against =
SOAP-ActiveWorks.

Please let me know if you=E2=80=99d rather resolve this in a different =
way. Even if I=E2=80=99ve dropped the permission on =
SOAP::Transport::ActiveWorks::Client, we can always reverse that, if you =
want to solve it a different way.

Cheers,
Neil
