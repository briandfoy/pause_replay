OK, fair enough.

Meanwhile, here's a suggested autoresponder mail/FAQ/whatever:


Hi, and thanks for mailing modules@perl.org.   This is an automated
response to your email.

We get lots of mail, and sometimes it takes us a while to get to yours.
Please be patient, we *will* try and respond as soon as we can gather
enough tuits.

In the meantime, here are some pointers which may help you find your
answer, along with some hints for making your modules@perl.org
experience easier.

modules@perl.org has several roles:

1. creating PAUSE accounts
2. keeping the CPAN module list updated
3. responding to enquiries about modules and especially module naming

If you mailed us about getting a PAUSE account
----------------------------------------------
It will probably be set up in the next few days.  You will receive email
notifying you when your account has been created.  In the meantime, read
the PAUSE documentation at:
	http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about

If you mailed us to register a module namespace
-----------------------------------------------
This may take up to a week.  If you haven't received email confirming
your namespace registration by then, please poke us (gently).

You can make it easier for us next time by using the namespace request 
form on PAUSE; this gives us your request in a standard format with
links we can just click on to approve it.

If we have problems or comments with your proposed namespace, we'll
respond within a week with our opinions.  Note that you can still upload
a module before we approve the namespace -- it just won't appear in the
official modules list, and we may ask you to change the name before
we'll list it there.

In the meantime, or for next time, we recommend you discuss your
proposed namespace with any appropriate mailing lists or other fora of
Perl developers.  Some of these include:

Places to post your ideas etc (general):
	comp.lang.perl.modules
	module-authors@perl.org

Places to discuss specific types of modules:
	datetime@perl.org  (Date::* and Time::*)
	dbi-dev@perl.org (DBI::*)
	perl-qa@perl.org (Test::*)
	macperl-modules@perl.org (MacOS::*)
	perl-crypto@perl.org (Crypt::*)
	etc...
	(check http://lists.perl.org/ for a full list of Perl lists)

Another good idea is to look back through the modules@perl.org archive,
at http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/, and see if we've
dealt with a similar issue before.

If you had a general module-related enquiry
-------------------------------------------
We'll try to get back to you within a week.  If we don't, and the
resources listed below don't help you find your answer, please prod us
(gently).

If your enquiry was related to module naming, the resources listed in
the above section will probably be useful to you.

If you want to know if anyone's written a module similar to one you're
thinking of writing, check http://search.cpan.org/ and search for as
many relevant keywords as you can think of.

If you're writing a module for the first time and want advice, read the
perlnewmod manpage, at http://perldoc.com/perl5.6.1/pod/perlnewmod.html 
or "perldoc perlnewmod".

If you need help installing Perl modules, read the perlmodinstall
manpage, at http://perldoc.com/perl5.6.1/pod/perlmodinstall.html or
"perldoc perlmodinstall".

If your email was unrelated to Perl modules
-------------------------------------------
Sorry, wrong address.  Don't expect a response.
