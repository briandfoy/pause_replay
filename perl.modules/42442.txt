The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       hey::heyPass
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perl Interface to hey.nu Network's heyPass
  userid:      WILSOND (Dusty Wilson)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://board.hey.nu/

  similar:

  rationale:

    At hey.nu Network Community Services, we have always used hey::*
    for our internally used modules. This module started as an
    internal-use-only module, but has started to become useful for
    public use. While it would be difficult to migrate to a different
    namespace, I am open to any suggestions if you know where it would
    best fit within an existing root namespace.

  enteredby:   WILSOND (Dusty Wilson)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug  9 17:21:49 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

hey::
::heyPass         RdpOp Perl Interface to hey.nu Network's heyPass   WILSOND
