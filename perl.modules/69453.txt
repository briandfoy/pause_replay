Hi Mike,

Registration isn't required. It buys you inclusion in the modules list, 
some extra meta-data and (most importantly) a sanity check on the 
namespace choice from experienced folks. We would have killed of the 
modules list a while ago if it didn't have the positive side effect of 
encouraging new contributors to get advice from the old.

Best regards,
Steffen

PS: By the way, module-authors@perl.org is probably an even better way 
of getting feedback than registering.
