The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::SearchEngineLog
  DSLIP:       ampfg
  description: Logging of terms used in search engines
  userid:      OCTO (Florian Forster)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The choice for the "Apache" root namespace is based on the fact,
    that it is a mod_perl module which enhances Apache. The name itself
    is chosen as descriptive as possible. I don't know of any perl
    module doing a similar job (and no non-perl programm either) which
    is why I think it shoul be integrated in the module list.

  enteredby:   OCTO (Florian Forster)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 11 14:56:09 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::SearchEngineLog ampfg Logging of terms used in search engines      OCTO
