The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Twitter::CLI
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Command line Twitter with plugins
  userid:      SVIEBROCK (Seth Viebrock)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://github.com/sethviebrock/net-twitter-cli/

  similar:
    App::Tweet Twitter::Shell blt - This module is different because it
    will provide pluggable command-line interfaces, so that different
    shell interfaces can be written, with unified config handling.
    Net::Twitter::CLI will include a prompting interface by default.

  rationale:

    There are already several CLI Twitter apps, but a unified namespace
    with pluggable interfaces and handy config handling will be neat and
    possibly unify some twitter CLI namespaces. I'd also like to use
    this namespace for the Frozen Perl conference at the U of Minnesota
    this weekend for an introductory hackathon, where I and Steven
    Lembark will have beginners write a plugin or two for
    Net::Twitter::CLI, and introduce them to CPAN, module development
    concepts, beginning Moose, etc.

The resulting entry would be:

Twitter::
::CLI             cdphp Command line Twitter with plugins            SVIEBROCK
