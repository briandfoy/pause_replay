I am sure your not, but on the other hand when two modules are so
close in functionality it can help to merge them. There are
several reasons why this can be benificial, not least that it cuts down on duplication
of effort

That;'s no reason why it cannot be extended. Like many modules on CPAN
DumpHeaders was written to meet a specific task. That does not mean 
enhancements cannot be added.

And I would encourage everyone to take a learning cycle, it's fun.

So extend it.

Huh?

extend

It seems to me that these two modules are VERY close in many aspects yet
both have something the other does not.

The two main things I see in DumpHeaders that are not in yours are the ability
to specify a log file (I think yours goes to the standard apache log)
and the ability to specify which IP addresses to dump headers for, this
is VERY useful when trying to debug a problem on a live site that only
a few people see, dumping all headers is just too much.

So that said, what would it take to add these two features to yours ?
I it could do that, and support the PerlSetVars that DumpHeaders uses then it
could just be a drop in replacement.
