     why:

    I am a tester at Socialtext.

    I'm working on a log parser for JMeter right now that I'd like to
    put up on CPAN. I may also contribute to the wikitests framework or
    other testing frameworks.

    I may augment .t files for modules I like or contribute patches. I
    tend to write a lot of one-off scripts that could probably be made
    into re-usable code with just a little effort. IF I had a PAUSE
    account, I'm much more likely to put in the effort.
