Dear brian d foy,

Thanks for getting back to me.

Sorry, I didn't notice this stipulation anywhere in the CPAN documentation.

And being a fan of the work of Abigail and Alligator Descartes, it never occurred to
me that it was a legal requirement in Perl Country. I'm curious as to why you think you need it.

At any rate, thanks for unslipping my application.

Best wishes,
chocolateboy.
