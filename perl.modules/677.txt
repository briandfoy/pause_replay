Tim,

I think that you're right. The Schedule tree is probably more
appropriate than the Time tree.

Concerning the module name, I'd like to avoid mentioning seconds and/or
minutes in the name since that makes it difficult to expand the module
with more capabilities (using other time units) in the future, should
that be requested.


Maybe Schedule::SleepUntil would cut it?


IMO, this is very explanatory, since that is exactly what the module
does. It sleep()'s *until* a given time (contrary to sleep() itself that
sleeps *for* a given time).


Any thoughts about that?

Best regards
Gustav
