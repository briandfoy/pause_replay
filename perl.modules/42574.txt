  rationale:

    Hello everyone!

    My employer End2End Germany is a division of End2End, Europe's
    leading B2B managed service solution provider for mobile data
    services and content.

    Our platform where (new) services are offered to our customers is
    called 'promessaging'.

    Currently we are developing a new service called MRS which stands
    for 'MSISDN Resolver Service'. With the help of the 'MRS' service
    mobile application developers are able to obtain detailed
    information about a given MSISDN - a mobile phone number.

    This returned information includes the MCC (mobile country code),
    the MNC (mobile netework code) and detailed information concerning
    the mobile's current status, location and more ...

    In the future it is likely that we will publish other useful
    modules designed for incorporation into custom software that belong
    to the promessaging platform like MRS.pm.

    Further questions regarding 'MRS'/MRS.pm can be emailed to
    'hotline@end2endmobile.com'.

    Best regards, Christian Malter
