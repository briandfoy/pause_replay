Hi,

	I'd like to contribute a CPAN module, so I need to set up an account.

name: Ben Crowell
e-mail: b_crowell67@hotmail.com

user-ID: B-CROWELL

I'd like to contribute a module called Digest::LineByLine. The idea is that it
adds a kind of MAC to a plain-text file, so that you can detect tampering on a
line-by-line basis. The algorithm is designed so that the person who knows the
authentication key can detect
 - modification of  lines
 - deletion of lines
 - addition of lines
 - permutation of lines

Thanks in advance! BTW, the hotmail address is the one I'd like listed publicly
on CPAN (it's my spam-receiving account), but I'm sending this from the
account I use normally.

          Ben Crowell
