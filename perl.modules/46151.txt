Sorry, it took me a few days to notice that the post was trapped by
my spam filter. I started to compose a reply, but cancelled it. I
realised that this was the kick the butt I needed. I was thinking
of a finding another name before I released, but I could not think
of anything better. But I was only thinking in terms of MSSQL::.

The module is now Win32::SqlServer which much better captures the
purpose of the module. Expect a new submission coming in soon. Consider
the old request as cancelled.

Big thanks for putting me in the right direction.
