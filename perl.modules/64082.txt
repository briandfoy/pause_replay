Subject: Transfer of Bio::DB::GFF::Aggregator::orf to BIOPERLML

From: cjfields@illinois.edu (Chris Fields)

Lincoln Stein accidentally included Bio::DB::GFF::Aggregator::orf  
along with the last Gbrowse distribution in CPAN.  As BioPerl is still  
in dev (RC2, a final stable release is imminent) and Gbrowse is using  
stable release numbers, the Bio::DB::GFF::Aggregator::orf namespace is  
now used.  This is causing the latest BioPerl RC2 be labeled as  
unauthorized.

Lincoln (LDS) has given up maintainer status on this module; I would  
like to either transfer primary to me (CJFIELDS) or directly to  
BIOPERLML.

Thanks!

Chris Fields
