Jeez, what a mess the permissions on parrot. I've made PARTICLE and
ARANDAL comaintainer of a lot of modules in the Parrot:: namespace
taken from Leo's and Chip's portefeuille. But I'm sure there are many
more owners and many more namespaces that would be involved in the
next parrot release? It's probably not a serious problem but if we can
make it easier for the future, we probably should.

Now let me suggest or better propose or ask if such a proposal would
fit the needs of the team:

Introduce a new group ID on CPAN, tentatively named PARROTML and pass
all ownership bits to that ID. What works quite well for apache (APML)
and bioperl (BIOPERLML) should work for parrot too. CPAN has these
mailinglist IDs since the first day but only recently they have turned
out to be useful for something:)

The process would go like this: all authors pass mainainership rights
to PARROTML. PARROTML has no password and no upload rights. You can
name me the people who shall be authorised to deal with the
permissions once they have been passed to PARROTML (I must enter them
manually into the database). Then all the parrot modules are in a
central place and can be fixed quickly without my intervention by the
people you choose yourself.
