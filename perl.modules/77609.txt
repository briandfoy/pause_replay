That was the suggestion from Andreas, however I ended up solving the
problem in a different way.  The Base.pm file was previously being
generated on-the-fly from Makefile.PL which meant that it didn't exist
in the tarball.  I have switched to packaging the distribution using
Dist::Zilla and arranged for the code generation to occur at release
time rather than install time.  It seems cleaner all round.

Short story: I uploaded release 1.06 and it was indexed without problem.

Thanks brian and Andreas for your help.

Grant
