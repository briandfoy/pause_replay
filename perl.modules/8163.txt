The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::DirSelect
  DSLIP:       bupOp
  description: Tk directory selection dialog.
  userid:      KRISTI (Kristi)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.tk

  similar:
    Tk::FileSelect

  rationale:

    This is a composite Tk widget which uses other Tk widgets and so
    belongs in the Tk namespace. Module has been discussed on
    comp.lang.perl.tk and no objections raised.

    On Win32platforms the module also makes use of the Win32API::File
    module, however it is not a Win32-only module and so does not belong
    in a Win32 namespace.

    This widget allows the user to navigate drives and directories and
    select a directory. Other Tk widgets have been written to perform
    similar functions, however this widget was needed because the
    widgets written for Unix sysyems (such as Tk::FileSelect) don't
    allow the user to browse local and mapped drives on Win32 systems,
    and the ones adapted for Win32 systems that do allow this (such as
    Tk::GetOpenFile) don't allow the user to select a directory instead
    of a file.

    I am submitting this to the module list because users have asked
    that I do so

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::DirSelect       bupOp Tk directory selection dialog.               KRISTI
