If this is the wrong mailing list, please redirect me.

Q1.
I installed BerkeleyDB v. 0.19
I then read its README file to discover that one should first install
"Berkeley DB Version 2.6.4 or greater" (They got me on that one. :-) )
Later I downloaded db-4.1.24.CN.tar.gz from SleepCat.com and installed it.
I looked at the resulting directories, du -a, and discovered a lot of
BerkeleyDB-0.19 stuff.
So now I'm out of sync having installed db-4.1.24.CN after BerkeleyDB-0.19.
Do I need to uninstall BerkeleyDB-0.19 and reinstall it? If so, how? I.e.,
do I simply erase the BerkeleyDB-0.19 directories and repeat the install
procedure. Will that remove all of the BerkeleyDB-0.19 stuff?
SleepCat says they can't help me on this one.

Q2.
I'm using perl to write a simple data base management system: collect client
data and append it to a db file. I can't get O_APPEND to work. All calls to
the script overwrite the reseults of the previous call.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	#!/usr/bin/perl

	## Test from
http://archive.devx.com/dbzone/articles/renaker01/Renaker01-3.asp with
O_APPEND added

	use strict;
	use DB_File;

	my %hash;

	tie %hash, "DB_File", "myDB", O_RDWR|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666, $DB_HASH
	  or die "Could not create file 'myDB': $!\n";

	$hash{'key1'} = 'value7';	## value_ numbers are changed on successive calls
	$hash{'key2'} = 'value8';	## to see if the new values show up as appended
	$hash{'key3'} = 'value9';	## values when printed below -- they don't??

	untie %hash;

	# Now open and read the contents of myDB
	my $key;
	tie %hash, "DB_File", "myDB", O_RDWR, 0666, $DB_HASH
	  or die "Could not read file 'myDB': $!\n";

	foreach $key (keys %hash) {
	  print "$key => $hash{$key}\n";
	}

	untie %hash;

	## This works on first run. But if 'value_'s are changed and this program
run again
	## it overwrites the myDB rather than appending to it.!!

What am I doing wrong?
