Hi,
I am sorry to trouble you, but I am unable to reset my password after 
the reset on Aug 8 2009.

My pause ID is CPWILLMOT.  When I set up that ID I was using the email 
address (chris.willmot@ukf.net). 

I haven't used Pause for some while and changed providers in the 
meantime.  I created my own permanent domain (chris@willmot.org.uk) to 
overcome this very issue of lost access.  However, I am very sorry, but 
I forgot to update my Pause account.

I no longer need access to Pause, another user (CJM) has offered to take 
over all my modules and I am happy for him to do this.  Could you please 
either reset my password so I can handle the transfer myself,  or set 
CJM as the primary maintainer for all my perl modules and close my account.

Thanks in advance,

-- 
Christopher Willmot
