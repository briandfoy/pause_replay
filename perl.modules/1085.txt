I have uploaded Error-Unhandled-1.01.tar.gz to my directory on CPAN.

Here is the proposed Modules list line.  It is relies upon Graham Barr's
Error.pm.

Error::
::Unhandled	RdpO	Allows errors to do their own handling	TEVERETT

The idea behind the module is that in some situations (ASP programming, for
example), it is useful for code to be able to throw an exception that will
behave in an intelligent manner if it is not caught by some enclosing try
block.  Normally if an exception is unhandled, it will result in an error
message being printed to STDOUT, which is not always desired.
Error::Unhandled lets one define what the error should do if it is not
caught by a try block.
