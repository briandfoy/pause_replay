How about an alias file.  I know we have one for HTML::Mason so that it
also shows up as Apache::Mason.

I want it in the modules list because any publicity is good for spreading
the word.

I think putting it in as Alzabo isn't a real problem because I really
can't see how it steps on anyone else's toes.  If its in the same category
as Class::DBI and DbFramework it seems like it'd be obvious what it was.  
And there will be a description of it there too.

That said, I don't mind an alias for it as above.  However, I will not
change the actual class names.  The inheritance hierarchy is already three
levels deep and prepending DbFramework to everything seems unappealing
from an aesthetic level.  Plus there already is a sort of similar
module suite called DbFramework.
