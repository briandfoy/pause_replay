Contribution: Mac:Serial.pm is a MacPerl library which uses a simple 
object-oriented programming style to provide a set of tools to 
control the serial ports of the Macintosh and communicate through 
them. This library defines Mac::Serial objects, entities which 
contain the values for serial port configuration parameters. Using a 
Mac::Serial object's methods ports can be opened and closed and data 
can be sent out of those ports or received through them. In addition, 
various configuration settings are under program control including 
data transmission protocols (baud rate, data size, etc.), hardware 
and software flow control methods, and the size of the buffer 
allocated to the input driver.

Module List Description: a/bmpO OOP interface to Macintosh serial ports

Prior discussions: I have announced Mac::Serial.pm on the MacPerl 
mailing list, offered it to list members at several different times 
and development stages, delivered it to several interested parties, 
received feedback from most of them, and made many improvements based 
on that feedback. In an email message Matthias Neeracher wrote about 
Mac:Serial.pm "PS: If Mac::Serial does what the name implies, I'm 
sure it will be in high
demand." I have experienced a modest interest level from the Mac 
community but unfortunately no one has been busting down my doors.
