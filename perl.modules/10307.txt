I would like to request a PAUSE ID.

Name         : Drew Taylor
Email        : drew@drewtaylor.com
Homepage     : http://www.drewtaylor.com/
Preferred ID : DTAYLOR or DREWT

Contribution :
Right now I don't have anything specific to contribute. I hope to 
contribute module enhancements/bug fixes/documentation, and new modules I 
may write in the course of my freelance development work in the near 
future. The most likely candidate will be the addition of TT support for 
CGI::Application. I've been an avid perl programmer for several years now 
and I would like to officially give back to the community that has helped 
me learn so much.

Sincerely,
Drew
