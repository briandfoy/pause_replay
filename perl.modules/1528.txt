Andreas,

Thanks for the reply and for looking into this problem.
In the meantime I have actually written a Locale::State.
I figured since Locale::US was registered, this was the
place to put it. I also found Geography::States to be
written in a confusing way and quite hard to understand.
I think I have addressed most of it's weaknesses.

What to do now?? Would Loacle::State still be accepted?

Thanks,

Kim
