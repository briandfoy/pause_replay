The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::BitMask
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Bitmask manipulation
  userid:      TEVERETT (Toby Ovod-Everett)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)

  rationale:

    Namespace choice was recommended by Tim Bunce
    (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2003-08/msg00342.html).
    Using C-style constants (i.e. global or semi-global values or
    subroutines) is a bad approach to supporting bitmasks in modules for
    a number of reasons. First, it allows for inaccurate specification
    of bitmasks (i.e. allowing the use of constants authorized for a
    given situation in other situations where the constant does not
    accurately describe the bitmask in question), causing potential
    problems in code maintenance. Second, it provides no easy way to
    break a bitmask back into its constituent constants. Third, it
    relies upon the user to do all of the bitmask manipulation. Many
    module users do not have a solid understanding of the bitwise
    operations necessary to do the manipulation properly, which can lead
    to bugs in code.

    This module attempts to address all of those concerns.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
