I've written a module which I use to download web content in a form 
suitable for my PDA, i.e. it reads a set of rules in a sub-module 
(Foo::Slate for scraping Slate magazine) by grabbing the list of new 
stories, transforming their URLs to the "print-friendly" version and 
downloading that content to HD.

I've just been calling it PDAScraper, but as regards the top level I 
guess it should be in WWW? There's a whole namespace WWW::Scraper but 
it's really not the same kind of thing, it seems mostly used for 
extracting data from classified/auction/job websites and search 
engines, not text content. There's one module called 
WWW::Scraper::Response::News which seems to have the same idea 
(there's a WWW::Scraper::CNN along with it) but it appears to be 
abandoned.

My only other concern is that it's not necessarily useful just for 
PDAs. Anyone who wants simplified ad-free HTML from a particular 
website could use it. Maybe 'PDA' shouldn't be in there? Any 
suggestions gratefully received.
