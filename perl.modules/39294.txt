Subject: Module submission Games::Manager

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Manager
  DSLIP:       bnpfg
  description: Games manager for interactive environments
  userid:      KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Bot-Depot.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    Games::Manager is a module for the creation, maintenance, and
    management of multiplayer games in interactive environments. This
    module is more aimed at being used on constantly running scripts
    (for example, an IRC, AOL, or MSN chatterbot, or on a server
    daemon).

    The namespace Games::Manager is appropriate because this module
    does just that: it manages games. A single Games::Manager object can
    manage virtually unlimited games. The only limits are your hardware.

  enteredby:   KIRSLE (Cerone Kirsle)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar 26 03:43:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Manager         bnpfg Games manager for interactive environments   KIRSLE
