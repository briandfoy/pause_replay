    Duly noted.

    I think that's an accurate model.

    I'm not opposing a request tracker, if somebody else wants to set it
up.  But again, we're not failing to respond due to poor management
skills.  We're failing to respond due to lack of tuits.  If there were
a web thingy where I could find all those old responses, I still wouldn't
be following up on all of them.  I follow up when I have something useful
to say, unless somebody else says it first.

    The point is that we're not _forgetting_ to get back to people.  None
of us has been willing to take responsibility to make sure that everybody
gets responded to.  Perhaps you wish to become that special somebody?

    I'm working on a first draft.

P.S.  None of the above is meant to indicate any lack of interest on
my part for serving the Perl community better.  I'm just trying to
emphasize that, IMHO, the proposed solution (a request tracker) doesn't
match the actual problem (dearth of tuits).
