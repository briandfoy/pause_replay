The reason you got the mail is that the version on CPAN is a development
release (underscore in version). Those aren't indexed and my script
thought there was no implementation on CPAN.

This isn't great since installation via "cpan WWW::Webjay" wouldn't work
like this and the link under "Registered Modules" on your
search.cpan.org authors page goes nowhere. You can fix this by uploading
a non-developer release to PAUSE/CPAN..

I won't delete your registration since it's entirely valid.

Best regards,
Steffen
