the usual means of going about this is sending mail to the author with a 
copy to this list. Also, you can file RT (rt.cpan.org) bug reports. 
Anything that shows you've been trying hard to contact the author. If 
the author doesn't react within a reasonable time span, (A couple of 
weeks, usually) the PAUSE admin can make you co-maintainer.
