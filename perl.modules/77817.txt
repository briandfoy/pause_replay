     why:

    I have few modules i m thinking to upload (parameter management)
    webservices framework and maybe more. I writing maybe, because i was
    making it at my job, for our apps, and now my cheffe decides that,
    because we are using open source a lot, we can open our source (of
    course - not core - secret part). So modules i can upload depend on
    him.

    Generaly we are making ETL here.

    Thanks!
