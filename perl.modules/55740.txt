     why:

    Hello there,

    I'm programming in Perl for about 6+ years. Right now, i'm
    developing a server-management software using Catalyst ( for GUI
    stuff ) and a lot of backend-perl.. Before that i did a couple of
    Database and CGI stuff and kept my servers alive with perl. Thus,
    i'm using search.cpan.org a lot and like to contribute some of my
    modules i wrote and will write.. Hopefully they might save some time
    for someone - as a lot of cpan modules did and do for me.

    However, right now i could provide some modules in the range of: *
    DBIC : legacy/native SQL queries * WWW::Curl : OO handling * and a
    couple of not (yet) very good document modules concerning
    web-applications and server-management which i first have to review
    and document One of the things i'm planning to do next is a
    Catalyst-WCAP implementation with bindings for LDAP, SQL and so on..
    which i'd like to provide at cpan

    some specs about me * mainly perl since ~2000 * 25 years old *
    germany, berlin * studying computer science at FU-Berlin,
    freelancing perl-programmer, half-day server admin and linux geek

    greets from Berlin, Vienna is calling :) Ulrich
