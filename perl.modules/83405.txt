Hi,

Can you give me co-maint on Crypt::RandPasswd please?

The original author is John Douglas Porter (JDPORTER). I first emailed =
him on 13th August, and again on 16th September, but have had no =
response. I previously emailed you (PAUSE admins) requesting co-maint 2 =
months ago (20th September).

Crypt::RandPasswd was last released 21 July 2000, and has a critical =
bug, as mentioned in my review of modules for generating passwords:

http://neilb.org/reviews/passwords.html

I emailed John saying that I'd fixed the bug, and if he didn't want to =
do a release, would be happy to release the fix.

I'll also update the pod to link to the review, and mention the main =
other modules of note.

Cheers,
Neil
