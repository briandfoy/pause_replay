I've generalized the XML::MDS2 module quite a bit. It has now evolved
into a reusable Device::Profile module along with a companion
Device::Profile::MDS2.  I'd like your approval to submit the modules
with those names.

Goal:	Automate communication between manufacturers and buyers of
	devices. The security characteristics of medical devices is
	driving the effort, though the module has been generalized to
	support other uses.

Scenario:
	1) An organization creates a set of questions that
	   characterize a device. (HIMSS created the MDS2 for example.
	   See below for links.)
	2) The manufacturers answer the questions for each device type
	   they sell.
	3) The buyer of a device receives the completed profile(s) and
	   use the information as appropriate. (To do risk assessments
	   driven by HIPAA security regulations in this case.)

Modules:
	Device::Profile::Document
		- Create device profile skeletons. (XML documents
		  actually.)
		- Store & retrieve documents using file names.
		- Validate that a document conforms to a schema.

	Device::Profile::Document::Common
		- Public convenience class methods.

	Device::Profile::Repository
		- Store & retrieve related documents using their IDs.

	Device::Profile::View::HTML
		- View a specific profile using HTML.
		- View the differences between two profiles.

	Device::Profile::MDS2
		- Populate a Device::Profile::Document with the
		  specific questions and instructions that are
		  provided by the HIMSS sponsored MDS2 (Manufacturer's
		  Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security).
