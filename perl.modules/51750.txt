Request to register new user

fullname: Jeff Nokes
  userid: EBAY
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://developer.ebay.com
     why:

    Would like to request an account for eBay Inc, to make it's Perl
    based API SDK available to the public for free. I (Jeff Nokes)
    personally am the current technical lead of the team managing the
    Perl SDK, but there may always be a need to change the person who
    owns the module on the eBay side, thus the anonymous user id and
    email.

    The Perl API SDK is similar in functionality to the Java and .NET
    versions eBay currently offers. It provided an easy way for 3rd
    party developers to plug into eBay's web services using Perl. We
    will be requesting to reserve the namespace 'eBay', with the first
    supported API protocol being 'eBay::API::XML'. In the future, we may
    offer other protocols such as 'eBay::API::SOAP' or
    'eBay::API::REST', etc.

    Thank you, - Jeff
