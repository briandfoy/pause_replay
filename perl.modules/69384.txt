The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Org::FRDCSA
  DSLIP:       adphg
  description: The FRDCSA AI Project
  userid:      ANDREWD (Andrew Dougherty)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    #frdcsa@irc.freenode.net,frdcsa@frdcsa.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am not sure whether this belongs to Miscellaneous or Bundles (or
    other). The catch is that there are over 1000 modules under the
    Org::FRDCSA:: namespace that I plan to upload. They are very
    internally coherent, but I don't have tests, etc. Also, they are
    being renamed from This::Module to Org::FRDCSA::This::Module, so
    there will be some undetected breakage where modules are required
    and objects made from evals and the like.

    The software is very useful and I am really hoping to get it out to
    the community finally after all these years.

The resulting entry would be:

Org::
::FRDCSA          adphg The FRDCSA AI Project                        ANDREWD
