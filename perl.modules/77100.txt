Hi!

Thanks for running CPAN, it is a great resource!

Yesterday, I contributed by uploading and registring a module.
However, in the PAUSE main menu, when I go to 'Edit Module Metadata',
the list of my modules is empty.  Instead, it says:

> Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to THEILING. Please
> note, only modules that are already registered in the module list
> can be edited here. If you believe, this is a bug, please contact
> modules@perl.org.

The module SQL::Yapp is registered to THEILING since yesterday.  The
namespace is registered and I see the module in all lists on
search.cpan.org.  I waited a few hours to ensure it has gone through
most automated pipelines, but it still does not appear in the list in
my account.  Is this a problem?

Best regards,
  Henrik
