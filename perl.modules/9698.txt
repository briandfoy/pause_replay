The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::SQLEngine
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Extends DBI with high-level operations
  userid:      EVO (M, Simon Cavalletto)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    DBI mailing list; Perl Monks

  similar:
    DBIx::Abstract DBIx::AbstractLite DBIx::Broker DBIx::Easy DBIx::DWIW

  rationale:

    The DBIx::SQLEngine class provides an extended interface for DBI
    database handles, adding methods that support ad-hoc SQL generation
    and query execution in a single call.

    This is the most recent version of a collection of libraries that
    I've used over the last several years to develop business data
    applications and object-relational mapping toolkits.

    Its goal is to simplify dynamic query execution with the following
    capabilities:

    * Data-driven SQL: Ad-hoc generation of SQL statements from Perl
    data structures in a variety of formats.

    * High-Level Interface: Standard operations are handled by a single
    method call each. Error handling is standardized.

    * Full API Access: Pass-through arbitrary SQL and allow access to
    entire DBI API for cases when high-level interfaces are insufficient
    or inconvenient.

    * Portability: Dynamic subclassing (via DBIx::AnyDBD) to allow
    platform-specific support for driver idiosyncrasies and DBMS
    workarounds.

    A further description of the module is in this readme:
    http://www.evoscript.org/DBIx-SQLEngine/docs/ReadMe.html

    Here's the module documentation that defines the public interface:
    http://www.evoscript.org/DBIx-SQLEngine/docs/SQLEngine.html

    To install, download the tarball and use your normal "make"
    procedure:
    http://www.evoscript.org/DBIx-SQLEngine/dist/DBIx-SQLEngine-0.002.tar.gz

  enteredby:   EVO (M, Simon Cavalletto)

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::SQLEngine       bdpOp Extends DBI with high-level operations       EVO
