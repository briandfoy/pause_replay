ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATES.
Dear sir,

I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates
or landed properties in your country on behalf of the
Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the
Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria.

Considering his very strategic and influential
position, he would want the transaction to be strictly
as confidential as possible. He further want his
identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until
the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to
have an overseas agent.

I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would
agree to act as our overseas agent in order to
actualise this transaction.

The deal in brief is that the funds with which to
carry out our proposed investments in your country is
presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank
and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to
your country or any safe account outside your country
in a convenient bank account that will be provided by
you before we can put the funds into use. For this you
shall be considered to have executed a contract for
the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into
US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you
agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of
specialisation does not matter in this transaction,
all that is required of you is a safe account and your
willingness to assist us acquire estates in your
country.

As soon as payment is effected and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring
some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as
our agent . It might interest you to note that last
year, a similar transaction was carried out with one
MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the
payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN
YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where
to be found on our getting to Taiwan. That was how we
lost US$7.5Million. So this time around , I will be
with you before the remmittance is made into your
provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow
trust to play a very minimal role until performance is
seen.

You are requested to communicate your acceptance or
otherwise of this proposal, through Air fax no.234 1 759 9191.
After which we shall discuss in details.
the modalities for seeing this transaction through.
If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly
destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of
the proposed transaction and interest of personalities
involved.

Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
Best Regards,
Dr.Ndukalu
