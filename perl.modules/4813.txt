To the PAUSE Maintainers,

My name is David Youd, and I would like to register as a CPAN author.

For nearly two years, the organization at which I work has served up data 
from GemStone (an object database for smalltalk developers) using a 
database interface module I wrote called GemStone.pm.  The module has been 
used daily for production processes.

GemStone.pm allows perl developers to send commands to the GemStone 
database as if they were interacting with Topaz (the GemStone command line 
interface).  This is a great way to build web applications when your data 
is locked away in GemStone.

The module can be found at:  http://www.youdzone.com/perl/GemStone.pm

DSLI    Description
----------------------------------------
RdpO     Interface to a GemStone object database


My preferred user-ID would be "YOUD"

While I no longer officially develop SmallTalk code, I'm submitting this to 
CPAN due to the stream of requests I receive for it.  For years, people 
have asked on Usenet and mailing lists (mostly smalltalk oriented) for such 
a program.

Here's a recent request:

Is there a Perl DBI module for Gemstone?  I thought that I had read
somewhere that a Perl module existed to access the Gemstone/S database.
Does anybody know if such a module exists and if there is where can I find
it?  Is anybody currently using it with any success?
