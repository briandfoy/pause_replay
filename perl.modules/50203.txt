The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Magick::Square
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: square image from existing Image::Magick obj
  userid:      LEOCHARRE (Leo Charre)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    newgroups perlmonks mailinglists

  similar:
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail::Fixed, Image::Magick::Thumbnail

  rationale:

    The code in the module is passed an existing Image::Magick object
    and it will create the largest possible square in the center of the
    image by cropping sides or top and bottom.

    This is useful for code I have that uses Image::Magick::Thumbnail,
    it is often desired and or useful to have non-distorted square
    thumbnails of non square images.

    A module that does something similar is
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail::Fixed, in that it will create a thumbnail
    that will be a fixed size without distortion. The problem with
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail::Fixed, is that it takes as arguments a
    path for file in and file out, plus dimention parameters. Thus, you
    point and the program makes the Image::Magick object, etc, and saves
    it - before you have any say in what else you may want to do it,
    such as put a border, shadow, whatever.
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail::Fixed is unusable for me- I have the need
    to make many thumbnails and optionally do more effects on them.

    Image::Magick::Thumbnail is a great module, it is simply a function
    that takes an existing Image::Magick object and alters it to be a
    thumbnail. It is really just a resizer- but it returns my object so
    I can keep doing something else to it... like.. making it square-
    with Image::Magick::Square, which similarly returns the object it
    received.

    I feel this little module is a handy tool that a lot of people will
    find use for. It does not do too much, it stays out of the way, it
    simple "squares" an Image::Magick object wihtout distorting it.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::Magick::
::Square          bdpfp square image from existing Image::Magick obj LEOCHARRE
