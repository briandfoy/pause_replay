The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chess::PGN::Filter
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Transform PGN(chess games) to various forms
  userid:      HSMYERS (Hugh S. Myers)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-chess@yahoogroups.com, module-authors@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The point of PGN is to act as a computer form readable by humans.
    That said, what is easy to parse, is not necessarily easy to read or
    easy to use. This module will transform PGN in, to various text out.
    PDF, LaTeX, HTML, XML and others come to mind and will be added as
    developed.

  enteredby:   HSMYERS (Hugh S. Myers)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 10 17:34:40 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Chess::PGN::
::Filter          bdpfp Transform PGN(chess games) to various forms  HSMYERS
