The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TIBCO
  DSLIP:       cdhha
  description: Interfacing to TIBCO/Rendezvous(RVRD)
  userid:      BWMCADAMS (Brendan W. McAdams)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Looking to setup mailinglists and possilby IRC.

  similar:
    CPAN contains no modules for TIBCO; looking to setup packagespace.

  rationale:

    I am actually looking for two options for namespace here: Either
    TIBCO::, or creating a Messaging:: Package and placing Tibco under
    it. I have suggested TIBCO:: As I noticed that MQSeries (MQ Being
    another highly used Messaging Middleware product) has its own
    Namespace, I thought that it might be easiest to setup TIBCO
    Namespace as well. Otherwise, it might be best to setup a Messaging
    Middleware package like Messaging::.

    I'm open to suggestions here.

    The module itself is being worked on, creating an abstraction to
    the basic functions provided by the simple modules distributed with
    TIBCO. Advanced functionality for putting together serious TIBCO
    using perl tools will be provided.

The resulting entry would be:

TIBCO             cdhha Interfacing to TIBCO/Rendezvous(RVRD)        BWMCADAMS
