No, it does not mean that at all. Did you see my next note?

Allow me to repeat.

If it seems clear that nobody uses the YYYY-WW-D format, which does
indeed seem to be the case, it makes a lot of sense to modify Date::ISO
to output the YYYY-MM-DD format instead.

My only concern is that changing the API breaks actual production code.

However, since there was a *ghastly* bug in Date::ISO for about 3 months
before anyone mentioned it to me, it seems likely to assume that the
module is not exactly getting thousands of users.

I am almost done writing my book (God be praised) and will put this on
my list of things to work on when that is out of the way. It's on my
todo list in my Palm.
