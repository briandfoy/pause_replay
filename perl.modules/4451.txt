DESCRIPTION:  Perl script to implement GUI to databases

This tool has been in use by many developers at my workplace for several months, all of whom prefer it to the "official" database GUI the company has bought.  As I was unable to find a similar tool in the CPAN archive, I would like to submit mine.
