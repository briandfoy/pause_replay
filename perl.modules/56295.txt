...can't you find the entire contents of the dist the module was
installed from using the .packlists (or rather ExtUtils::Installed)?
This should let you uniquely identify the dist file. Of course, it would
be nice if you could index the dists by md5-over-all-installed-files,
then you could simply look the dist up from the packlist; but it's
rather hard to work out what a dist will install without installing it,
and I bet half this stuff won't install on any given machine :(.

Again, a module is core iff it is listed in the core packlist.

All this stuff would be much easier, of course, if the META.yml
(corrected for this build, if necessary) was installed alongside the
packlist.
