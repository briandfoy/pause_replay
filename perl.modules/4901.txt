I would like to register the following into the module namespace.

Name                 DSLI  Description                       Info
-------------------  ----  --------------------------------  -----
Language::ML         cdpf  Implementation of ML              DSPARLING

The module is currently similar to Language::Functional, with the main
difference being that the functions are specific to ML (instead of Haskell).
I am planning on creating an implementation of ML as opposed to just
providing a package of Perl subroutines that mimic their ML counterparts.
