Subject: Module submission Image::Magick::Thumbnail::NotFound

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Magick::Thumbnail::NotFound
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: make thumbnails as http requests fail
  userid:      LEOCHARRE (Leo Charre)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    mailinglists, nesgroups

  similar:
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail

  rationale:

    The namespace choice is because it uses all the hierarchy it sits
    on. I made sure to use as much existing cpan code as possible,
    making the least 'reinventing the wheel' as possible, if any.

    I've worked doing webdesign as well as doing development for
    hosting companies. One of the things that often pops up in doing
    websites for clients is thumbnails. There are so many gallery,
    shopping cart apps, etc. That need to have thumbnails made with the
    most minimal intervention. I have had to code it in some way many
    times.

    This is the solution. It separates thumbnailing from the
    applications that work with them, entirely. This lets the server
    handle making thumbnails without having to make any changes to other
    code.

    A webdesigner can code html assuming the thumbnails will simply be
    there. The same goes for scripts. What happens is this script runs
    only on a 404 server error- therefore it runs one time per
    thumbnail. This is great for saving system resources in the long
    run.

    I know the industry can use this system, I've looked for it for
    years. I developers, webdesigners, and hosting providers will be
    very happy to have a chace to implement it.

    I have been using this on our servers for a bit, it works good on
    Suse, Fedora, and FreeBSD servers. I would like to offer it to
    everyone and see what else may need fixing.

    I put a good bit of rationale and examples in the documentation,
    and I'd be happy to put more as I get feedback.

    Image::Magick::Thumbnail::NotFound (this module) uses
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail to make the thumbnails.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::Magick::Thumbnail::
::NotFound        bdpOp make thumbnails as http requests fail        LEOCHARRE
