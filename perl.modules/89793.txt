Hi Brian,

I've tried contacting you over the WWW::Bugzilla module a few times more 
and less recently but have not yet received a reply from you.

What I'd like to propose is that you'd make me a co-maintainer or 
transferred the module to me. Unless, of course, you'd wish to continue 
maintaining it. My interest is in getting the Bugzilla 4 support patch 
in and probably other patches in the future as well.

Kind regards,
