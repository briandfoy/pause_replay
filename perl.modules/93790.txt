Greetings Modules,

I recently got co-maintainer from IAMCAL for Flickr::API. I then contacted 
Nuno Nunes (CCed) who gave me first-comer for a number of Flickr::API::etc 
modules. It is my intention to blend these together into a single 
distribution.

I uploaded a new version of the Flickr::Tools but discovered that although 
I am first-comer for the various members of Flickr::Tools, I don't have 
permissions for Flickr::Tools itself. Additionally, when looking at the 
permissions on PAUSE, I see that NFMNUNES is co-maintainer for 
Flickr::Tools but that Flickr::Tools has no owner. I think this means that 
NFMNUNES can't make me first-comer as he did for the other modules.

Can you help me get this all together, or tell me if I am doing this in 
the wrong way?

Thanks in advance,

Louis Moore
