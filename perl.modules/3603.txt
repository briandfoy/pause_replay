Great. Abandoning namespaces and files needs to be better supported
for CPAN authors, then we can start pushing things off the various
lists politely. Current state of affairs is, we keep any old stuff
unless authors actively maintain remove something. If they do not have
interest in a clean CPAN and just leave anything they have dumped into
theyr directory behind, then there is no mechanism in place to clean
up.

This doesn't seem right to me, needs to be dealt with. Thanks for
bringing up the question.
