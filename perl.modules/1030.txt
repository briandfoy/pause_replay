I am new to CGI so please excuse my stupidity. Straight to my question: =
How do I get a script or module or what ever you have that will list =
files in a directory? Basically what I want is something that looks like =
what you have at the following link.
http://cpan.valueclick.com/modules/by-category/10_File_Names_Systems_Lock=
ing/

Nothing complicated. All I want is not to recode a static HTML page =
every time I add another file to a directory. Any way you could help me =
out with this? I have already searched all over cpan's site for this =
basic information on this subject, so far in vain.

Thank you,
  Matthew Tippet
