Weird. I checked my mail logs and can't find anything.

Yeah, I read that when I was trying to come up with a name. I didn't
think it was a strict rule seeing as there already many *Simple modules
on CPAN that I use regularly.

I'd like if we could agree on a name for this module before moving
further rather than me changing the namespace, uploading to CPAN and
then getting another rejection days later.

Any objection to Data::Tree? I could then rename the description to:

	Data::Tree - Navigate and manipulate data structures like a tree

Otherwise, I'd be willing to hear some suggestions.

Alfie
