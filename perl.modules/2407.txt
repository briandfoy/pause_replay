Exactly, that's one of my thoughts.  I was a bit amuzed of how
difficult it was to navigate at CPAN to find the right module for doing my
tasks.  I'd like to have a "one-place-shopping" for date handling, storing
and manipulations, that's one of the purposes with my wrapper class.

I'd like to store dates, completely without knowing what
methods/operations I might need to do with them, and then later apply
whatever method is appropriate.

Secondly, beeing just a wrapper class, it doesn't do anything other than
beeing a wrapper class.  So Object seems like a fine name to me.
