I've just written small library that I think might be usefull as a CPAN module.  Here's my
information:

name: Peter Thatcher
email: peterthatcher@asu.edu
preferred ID: peter (petert if peter taken)
description: A module which will convert HTML into LaTeX.
module list format:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- 
HTML::Latex    bdpO  Converts HTML file to Latex file        

I'm afraid there hasn't been much discussion about it; I wish there were more myself.  To find out
more about it and it's interest level, look at http://html2latex.sourceforge.net .  HTML::Latex
was originally (and is currently used by) html2latex.  The module is packaged inside of the latest
html2latex package which can be found at
ftp://html2latex.sourceforge.net/pub/html2latex/html2latex-latest.tar.gz
