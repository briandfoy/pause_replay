what does it mean to automatically abstract something?  i suppose
i don't understand either "automatic" or "abstract" in this context.

i don't think the automatic portion is the proper top level 
regardless of the definition.  since this deals with databases,
something that starts off with a database top-level name is much
better.

the next level should say something about what it does with 
databases.  in this case it makes abstracts.

beyond that you can talk about how you do it.
