     why:

    Perljax - a perl-specific system for writing AJAX- or DHTML-based
    web applications.

    Perljax provides a unique mechanism for using perl code
    asynchronously from javascript using AJAX to access user-written
    perl functions/methods. Perljax unburdens the user from having to
    write any javascript, except for having to associate an exported
    method with a document-defined event (such as onClick, onKeyUp,
    etc). Only in the more advanced implementations of a exported perl
    method would a user need to write any javascript. Perljax supports
    methods that return single results, or multiple results to the web
    page. No other projects that we know of are like Perljax for the
    following reasons: 1. Perljax is targeted specifically for perl
    development. 2. Perljax shields the user from having to write any
    javascript at all (unless they want to). 3. The URL for the HTTP GET
    request is automatically generated based on HTML layout and events,
    and the page is then dynamically updated. 4. Perljax is not part of
    a Content Management System, or some other larger project.
