Hello! Thanks for the note.

I'm probably on vacation if you're reading this.
I should be working again in a week or perhaps a little more.

I will endeavour to reply to your letter soon thereafter.

Best Wishes,
Greg


----------- Original message follows -----------



GSLONDON (Greg London) visited the PAUSE
and requested an upload into his/her directory.
The request used the following parameters

  HIDDENNAME                 [GSLONDON]
  CAN_MULTIPART              [1]
  pause99_add_uri_httpupload [obfuscator-0.001.pl]
  SUBMIT_pause99_add_uri_httpupload [ Upload this file from my disk ]
  pause99_add_uri_uri        []
  pause99_add_uri_sub        [pause99_add_uri_httpupload]


The request is now entered into the database where the PAUSE Daemon
will pick it up as soon as possible. Allow a few minutes, and be aware
that it may take longer if other requests are running. We proceed only
one at a time.

During upload you can watch ftp://pause.perl.org/tmp/G/GS/GSLONDON
(temporary upload directory), and
then https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/G/GS/GSLONDON (final
upload directory). The logfile is in
https://pause.perl.org/perl/user/tail_log/2000
(replace 2000 with any offset from the end).
