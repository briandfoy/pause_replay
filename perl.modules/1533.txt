What does HTML::Form not do for you?  We end up with user confusion
when there are two modules that do very similar things.  At a quick glance,
it appears that you are reinventing it in HTTP::Request::Form.

[The modules guys are supposed to filter out namespaces that duplicate
existing technology, but maybe they slipped on this one...]
