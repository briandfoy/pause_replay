Agreed, mostly. The drawback is that FIPS numbers are not well known
in the international community. They can be looked up easily with
search engines, but then again, with a search engine your module can
be located from the manpage or the description line too. Still, it's
more consumer friendly to not require the use of a search engine.

jp> I'm also not sure what top-level to put it under; maybe 
jp> Crypt:: or Authen::.

If we try to be strictly correct, neither Crypt nor Authen applies,
but seeing that Crypt already contains items like ::PRSG and ::Keys,
we are in good company. The only other top level name that could fit
is Math:: I think.

On balance, I'd propose Crypt::RandPasswd.
