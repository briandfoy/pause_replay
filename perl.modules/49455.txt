The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Auth::Basic
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Basic CGI authentication interface
  userid:      BURAK (Burak Gürsoy)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Auth

  rationale:

    This module adds a simple (may be a little complex if you use all
    features) user validation system on top of your program. If you have
    a basic utility that needs a password protection or some unfinished
    admin section and you don't want to waste your time with writing
    hundreds of lines of code to protect this area; this module can be
    useful.

    Module's interface is really simple and you can only have a
    password area; no username, no other profile areas. This is not a
    member system afterall (or we can say that; this is a basic, single
    member system -- or call it a quick hack that does its job). Not
    designed for larger applications.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Auth::
