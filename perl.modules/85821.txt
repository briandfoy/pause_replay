Hi coleagues!

I have a question about CPAN installation progress. I have recently =
upload a new module to CPAN (Molevol::Complex). It is a part of my work =
in Molecular Evolution of Protein Complexes. This module needs several =
requirements to work properly, such as PAML software =
(http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html) and DSSP =
(http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/). Also it needs Bioperl and =
Bioperl-run. The two formers programs must be installed manually (not =
through CPAN), so I want that during the installation progress of my =
module, CPAN test if the environment variables $ENV{PAMLDIR} and =
$ENV{DSSPBIN} are correctly declared.

Also, I want to ask if it is possible to launch Bioperl and Bioperl-run =
installation if they are not installed, apart from the other required =
modules.

I think this questions are so basic, I am a novice in program =
distribution and I barely understand the correct configuration of =
Makefile.PL and Makefile to reach my mentioned purposes.

Thanks
