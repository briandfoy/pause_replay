replying to myself, I'd like to note that I set up a hopefully canonical GitHub
fork of the File-Remove distribution here:

* https://github.com/shlomif/File-Remove

There are already quite a few changes there.

Thanks to all the people who took part on this thread for their guidance
(and especially to Karen for pointing at the GitHub TheOpenRepository
collection). Hopefully, I'll be given COMAINT for it soon, so I can upload a
new version to CPAN and close rt.cpan.org bugs (after fixing them if necessary).

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
