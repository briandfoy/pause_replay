I've written a module that compares the content of two MySQL  
databases, in order to validate that their (returned) content is the  
same. I wrote it to check that extensive optimisation of a database  
hadn't corrupted its content in some unforeseen way, but it could be  
used in any situation where you need to check that two databases are  
identical. It works by using MySQL's MD5 and GROUP_CONCAT  functions  
to return an MD5 checksum of each concatenated field, sorted by  
primary keys, and comparing the checksums returned by each database.

I've provisionally named this module DBI::Compare::mysql. The module  
is (currently) specific to mysql, although I hope that I can make it  
work on other database engines in the future.

I found a similar module on CPAN that uses an SHA-1 checksum to check  
a database schema (rather than content) called DBIx::SchemaChecksum.

Would DBIx::ContentChecksum::mysql be a better namespace for my  
module? Should I just drop the ::mysql namespace and just state in the  
PerlDoc that it currently only works on MySQL? Or has anyone got any  
better ideas for where it could go?
