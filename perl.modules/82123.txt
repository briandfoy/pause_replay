  FYI; the Debian package [1] is currently in Debian Testing and so will
be available in the next stable release.  Also, my public repository for
it is at GitHub[2].

   Well, do you want to stay more directly associated with it?  If so,
then the 'co-maintainership" could be the way to go.  Otherwise, I'd be
happy to take full maintainership of it. (In either case; besides the
documentation issues I found, the first thing I would add will be for
the MRTG command as that's something I'm working on.)
