Hi,

Some time ago I stepped back from being a PAUSE volunteer.
Since a couple of weeks I suddenly get modules@perl.org mails again, and
the PAUSE administrative interface seems accessible to me (I didn't really
try, I don't want to mess up). Was my PAUSE status restored from an old
snapshot or something?

Thanks,

-- Johan
