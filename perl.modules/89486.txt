     why:

    I have been building a PM which covers all of the CAT (serial
    commands) to the Yaesu FT817 radio. The module currently runs
    locally and there is still some work to be done. When finished I
    would like to contribute it to CPAN. the FT450 will be the next
    radio for this task
