Hi modules@,

just a quick notice that I'll be away on a conference starting Friday
afternoon until Friday next week. I'll try to clear out all of the
old-registration related mails to the list until tomorrow afternoon. If
some author becomes impatient, please let him know that I'll be doing my
best to catch up the week after.

Best regards,
Steffen
