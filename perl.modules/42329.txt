After the significant price increases of Graco | Gusmer, now <B>Glas-Craft</B> has announced some 
fairly moderate price increases for September 1, 2005. CPI still has some inventory available at 
the old price, and will continue to sell this at the old price. <A

manufacturer. A company located in Phoenix, AZ. where it is 115° F today, has been selling 245fa 
blown roofing foam for the past 1&amp;1/2 years, and we are having zero problems with ambient 
temperature (you don’t need to keep our foam below 75° F), the foam shoots cleaner than the 141b 
blown foam in that you do not need to clean the gun tip as often as the old foam, and our yield 
is good. &nbsp;It is true that the price is higher than two years ago, but I am old enough to 
remember $ .29 per gallon gasoline and yet I still drive a car. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling the product from an applicators 
standpoint should be easy to drive home in the face of rising energy prices, the favorable wind 
up-lift characteristics, (with the hurricanes floating around in the Eastern US) and the fact 
that this is the only renewable roofing system that can last indefinitely with minimal 
upkeep.&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope this helps, if Mike wishes 
to discuss further, </SPAN></FONT><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY:

Mike here is a link to a fix for the blowing agent issue you have, I have used my version of this 
and had good results. We have tried cooling jackets with chilled water on our drums and they 
worked but we now get our product in plastic drums so that was a wasted effort. I challenge 
anyone here to find someone who is happy with their new 245 fa products&nbsp;and product support 
from dealers. I think most distributors are doing the best they can with what they have. The 
following suggestion is being made: Pressurizing the drum by a couple of psi will reduce or 
eliminate frothing of the material and the loss of blowing agent. </FONT><P style="MARGIN-TOP: 
0px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0px"><B><FONT face=Arial size=2>IMPORTANT ADVICE: make sure that you use a 
regulator with safety valve to prevent excessive pressure build up. Also, find out the maximum 
permissible pressure for the drums before pressurizing them.</FONT></B> <P style="MARGIN-TOP:

facilities would best be served by closed cell foam 2lb density. Reasons would be better control 
of depth and better air&nbsp;flow performance. 0.5 lb would be a break even due to the high rate 
of expansion and wasted depth in material. 2 lb&nbsp;could also&nbsp;be sprayed&nbsp;to a far 
smother texture and more evenly. this will produce a far better finish that will accept a topcoat 
(latex paint) at a minimum. I'm a contractor, applicator that&nbsp;has learned through many metal

re #220-6 Cindy S, Oregon</FONT></DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Closed cell 2 lb density is 
the only choice due to its tighter cell structure and greater air permeance rating. You must be 
careful we have insulated (sealed) potato storage facilities for the same effect, and it worked 
very well enough so that rodents and 2 cats suffocated in the chamber . We helped install a 
climate control system by loaning our fresh air supplied respirators to the HVAC techs. We are
