     why:

    Initially I plan to contribute a module which is a harness for web
    based application database interface benchmarking. Whereas
    DBI::ProfileDumper seeks to analyze indivual query statistics, this
    can be though of more as a web service interface which allows
    aggregate system performance to be analyzed. Instead of looking at
    the performance of a few queries, this seeks to look at the
    performance of the system as a whole in benchmarking the effects of
    different database responsiveness though a homogenous interface.
