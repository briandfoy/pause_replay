Before we build TL, we were using an in-house library named "TmmLib6".

In TmmLib6, a special variable $TL was always available so they could
instantiate various classes through the object. For instance, they
didn't have to write like this:

[  use TmmLib6; use TmmLib6::Template; my $t = new TmmLib6::Template;  ]

Instead, they didn't need to repeat enumerating "use" statement and
could redule many letters to type like this:

[  use TmmLib6; my $t = $TL->newTemplate;  ]

We have developed a lot of softwares with the structure that uses $TL
variable.

TripletaiL is the next version of TmmLib. We don't like to change the
name of $TL variable so that we can inherit the past code.

Considering that TmmLib had been named after a product of an other
company, we thought it is not appropriate for the name of an
open-sourced software. So we began to develop it as TL package and
started using it in-house.

After that, at preparation for release, we had to consider a new name
hence TL is too short to acquire a domain or register a trademark.

Currently we have the package, the archive of mailing list, tutorials
and update info available at http://tripletail.jp/
