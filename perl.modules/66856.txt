The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tenjin
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Fast templating engine with embedded perl.
  userid:      IDOPEREL (Ido Perelmutter)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Template HTML::Mason

  rationale:

    Tenjin is a pure Perl, fast templating engine with support for
    embedded Perl and many more features, akin to those provided by
    Template Toolkit. As opposed to Template Toolkit, it does not define
    its own language, instead using Perl directly, just like in PHP, for
    example:

    <?pl if ($something) { ?> <p>A pragraph with a [== $variable
    =].</p> <?pl } ?>

    Tenjin was/is developed by Makoto Kuwata at
    http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin since 2007 (under several
    programming languages), but was never on CPAN, and the perl version
    was last released in early 2008. I took Tenjin, CPANized it, and
    also wrote a Catalyst view module for it. I tride to contact Makoto
    Kuwata before doing so but never heard back from him. Anyway its
    under the MIT license so there's no problem in redistributing it.

    I believe Tenjin should be in the root namespace, basically because
    the Template namespace is, for some reason, is too strongly tied to
    Template Toolkit, which is confusing.

    Plus, though it isn't a very strong case, that's how it was
    originally developed and keeping that namespace will be an
    advantage.

The resulting entry would be:

Tenjin            bdpOo Fast templating engine with embedded perl.   IDOPEREL
