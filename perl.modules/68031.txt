The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AnyDBM_File::Importer
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Import DBM package symbols when using AnyDBM
  userid:      MAJENSEN (Mark Allen Jensen)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    bioperl-l@lists.open-bio.org (as Bio::DB::AnyDBMImporter)

  similar:
    AnyDBM_File Exporter

  rationale:

    This is an auxiliary module to (my) SQLite_File. In order to do the
    SQLite emulation of DB_File's BerkeleyDB API, and be able to employ
    AnyDBM_File to do a transparent failover, I chose to write a
    separate module to slurp a DBM's symbols into the caller's
    namespace. In this way, code written for DB_File, with $DB_BTREE,
    R_DUP, etc., could be simply converted to an SQLite solution with a
    few lines involving AnyDBM_File, but the conversion would then not
    disturb the use of DB_File/BDB, if AnyDBM_File chose DB_File.
    ANYWAY, the importer module is not dependent on SQLite_File in any
    way, and looks for symbols to export in @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK, and
    chooses sets of such symbols based on tagged groups defined by the
    Importer module, so it didn't seem natural to place Importer under
    SQLite_File. It could have general application if further *DB*_File
    modules were to be written to do emulation. AnyDBM_File does not
    presently contain any submodules. Of course, there might be a better
    solution than adding a new exporter, and as to that, I'm all ears.
    Thanks

The resulting entry would be:

AnyDBM_File::
