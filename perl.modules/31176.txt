The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AAC::Pvoice
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: create GUI applications for disabled people
  userid:      JOUKE (Jouke Visser)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, irc

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    AAC is the common abbreviation for Augmentive and Adaptive
    Computing. In other words, everything that has to do with making
    computing easier for people with disabilities. Based upon my work
    with pVoice - a speechapplication for severely disabled people, I
    created a set of modules to make it easier to create similar
    applications. Thus I called them AAC::Pvoice

  enteredby:   JOUKE (Jouke Visser)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 25 14:08:03 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

AAC::
::Pvoice          RdpOp create GUI applications for disabled people  JOUKE
