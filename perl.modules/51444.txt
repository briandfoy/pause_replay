The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SNMP::Persist
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: backend for pass_persist feature of net-snmp
  userid:      ANIAS (Anna Wiejak)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is the namespace where I would search for a module with the
    functionality as quoted below from README file:

    The SNMP-Persist module is a backend for pass_persist feature of
    net-snmp.

    It simplifies the process of sharing user-specified data via SNMP
    and development of persistent net-snmp applications controlling a
    chosen MIB subtree.

    It is particularly useful if data gathering process takes too long.
    The responder is a separate thread, which is not influenced by
    updates of MIB subtree data. The answer to a snmp request is fast
    and doesn't rely on potentially slow source of data.

The resulting entry would be:

SNMP::
::Persist         bdpfg backend for pass_persist feature of net-snmp ANIAS
