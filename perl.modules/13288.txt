The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Manifet
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: confiugre which test files to run
  userid:      BDFOY (brian d foy)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I don't like making wierd names for tests so that t/*.t runs them
    in the right order, so I wrote some stuff to populate the 'tests'
    WriteMakefile key for me. this module puts that all into one place
    so I can reuse it. With a t/test_manifest file I can specify the
    test files to run and in which order to run them.

  enteredby:   BDFOY (brian d foy)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 19 20:39:42 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Manifet         bdpfp confiugre which test files to run            BDFOY
