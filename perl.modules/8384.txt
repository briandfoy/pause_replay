The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Meta
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Meta is a class library of about 250 classes
  userid:      VELTZER (Mark Veltzer)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a full class library with classes which range from utility
    classes to UI and other classes. It has a one coherent design. There
    is no one specific thing that it does and it's rather broad. I could
    split it into several packages but then I would have to manage the
    deps between them and so long as I can maintain the whole package I
    prefer it this way. Meta is a general name which has a nice sound of
    a rich class library.

  enteredby:   VELTZER (Mark Veltzer)
  enteredon:   Thu Oct 18 21:30:32 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Meta              cdpOg Meta is a class library of about 250 classes VELTZER
