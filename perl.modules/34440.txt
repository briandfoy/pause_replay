have you looked at the new stuff with proposes a GIS:: namespace?

How about separating the "2D" (or "3D") into its own part of the
namespace?  The trick there is to figure out which interface you
want to preserve.

Having thought about this for all of five minutes, I tend to like
an interface that figures it out:

   Geo::Point->new( $a, $b );     # Get the 2D stuff
   Geo::Point->new( $a, $b, $c ); # Get the 3D stuff

If you like that, then a name like Geo::Point::2D works.
