Hello,

Could someone please advise what needs to be done to get a module into CPAN. I uploaded a module called 'Text-Banner-1.00.tar.gz' last December but it is not yet available.

I started to get email from CPAN testers but then everything stopped, the module disappeared and I cannot upload it again because PAUSE says the module is in the database:

Resulting SQL: INSERT INTO uris (uriid, userid, uri, mailto_p5p, changedby, changed) VALUES ('L/LO/LORY/Text-Banner-1.00.tar.gz', 'LORY', 'Text-Banner-1.00.tar.gz', '', 'LORY', '951950900') 
Could not enter the URL into the database. Reason: 
Duplicate entry 'L/LO/LORY/Text-Banner-1.00.tar.gz' for key 1

I do see the module in the PAUSE database if I specifically look for it, but that's not very good if someone doesn't know it exists.

I would appreciate knowing what needs to be done in order to get a module into CPAN.

Thanks,

Stuart Lory
