What I plan to contribute: Befunge::Interpreter, a fully compliant
Befunge-93 interpreter written in perl. Befunge is one of the only
two-dimensional languages ever devised. It used to have a page at
http://www.cats-eye.com, but that has since been taken down. More
information can be found at http://befunge.sourceforge.net. I have included
the spec I implemented in the tarball as bf93.txt.
Module Lising:
----------------------
Name: Befunge::Interpreter
DSLI: RdpO

I'm rapidly working on more Befunge based modules in an effort to rekindle
interest in this little toy language. If you have any questions, contact me
at xjharding@newbedford.k12.ma.us. Thank you.
