The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       STANAG
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Decodes NATO standard STANAG 4586 messages
  userid:      CAJ (Chris Johnson)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parse::Binary::FixedFormat

  rationale:

    The message encoding and decoding done here is of a format unique
    and new in CPAN, as such it will not fit under any other package's
    namespace.

    I considered putting it under Parse::Binary::FixedFormat, but
    that's just the engine that drives the module, and subject to change
    as the interface to it is being abstracted.

  enteredby:   CAJ (Chris Johnson)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun 11 16:39:15 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

STANAG            bdpfp Decodes NATO standard STANAG 4586 messages   CAJ
