The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::GaussHelmert
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: General weighted least-squares estimation
  userid:      HEUEL (Stephan Heuel)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Statistics::OLS, Statistics::Descriptive

  rationale:

    The name Gauss-Helmert comes from the mathematical model which is
    used to express the estimation problem. The Gauss-Helmert estimation
    is an iterative estimation method and is mainly used by geodesists
    (under this very name).

    Gauss-Helmert is comparable to the Levenberg-Marquardt method (cf.
    Press et al, Numerical Recipes), but can not cope with sinularities
    as easily as LM.

    A similar module is Statistics::OLS, but this module can only
    estimate the linear model y=a*x+b. Statistics::GaussHelmert is much
    more complex: it may take any model equation for any dimensions. If
    the model is non-linear, you may provide the Jacobians of your
    equation with respect to the observations and the unknowns.

    The code is not very user-friendly right now and is mainly used for
    the upcoming Math::UncertainGeometry module.
