     why:

    I am computer scientist (associate professor in bioinformatics) at
    the University of Montpellier 2 and I develop some modules in perl
    for biological data analysis. I think that some modules I developped
    may be of interest for perl community. Some of them are specifically
    dedicated to bioinformatics, and some other are not.
