Sorry for the trouble. After a lot more searching, I found Class::Classless=
,
which seems to serve about the same purpose as mine. I have already modifie=
d
my code to use it, and it still works perfectly, so Class::Classless
certainly covers my needs. I guess this is another lesson in how two people
can think about the same thing in completely different terms. This is what
makes naming modules so difficult.

I have another module that uses classless objects to perform database
queries. The objects represent tables, rather than having an entire class
represent a table, as in Class::DBI. Thus, each object contains a database
handle, a table name, column names, and has public methods for select,
insert, delete, and update. Is Class::Classless::DBI an appropriate name fo=
r
this, or would Class::Classless::DBI::Simple be better?
