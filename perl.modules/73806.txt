Which was uploaded by you at Nov 22th. The RT is reported on Nov 25th.

Wrong :(
Tassilo had uploaded a 0.23 and 0.24 (with other bugs), which he later deletes
and left only 0.25_nn - but there were people having installed 0.23 or 0.24
updating now to your repackaged 0.22 as 0.24 ... 0.26.

P::PT has critical reports, too. We'll see :)
