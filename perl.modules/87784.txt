The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Magento
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Magento Open Source eCommerce Platform
  userid:      VANHOESEL (Theo van Hoesel)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    possibly on git

  similar:
    none - really!, there is nothing related to Magento

  rationale:

    This would be the namespace anything related to Magento would go.

    I'm currently in quite a good stage already developing a backend
    that will communicate with the Magento webshops for my customers.
    Basically because their api sucks, I started writing a XMLRPC
    wrapper so, so I can write web-scrapers or other scripts to upload
    products/images and create categories on the fly.

    Also, in the development process is a CLI or Curser bases
    interface, and I would love to see a Tcl/TK version as well.

    Next to my request for a root namespace, I will request the next
    structure:

    Magento Magento::Backend Magento::Backend::Resource
    Magento::Backend::Connector Magento::Backend::App

    And to keep the namespace nice and clean it would be my advice to
    register Magento::Server where people might put nifty stuff that
    builds upon the internal MySQL database or provides extensions the
    the Zend-framework.

    Please contact me before assigning those namespaces, you might have
    good advice on how to actually deal with modules that have the same
    name as the namespace etc

The resulting entry would be:

Magento           adpOp Magento Open Source eCommerce Platform       VANHOESEL
