Request to register new user

fullname: Kevan Benson
  userid: KENTRAK
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I have an existing PAUSE id of KBENSON, but I can't seem to recall
    the password (or it was reset at some point long ago for the
    security breach or some other reason. I would like to contribute to
    the CPAN pull request challenge, but can't seem to access my
    account.

    Some email addresses that may have been associated, but don't seem
    to be receiving emails for this: kentrak@sonic.net kbenson@sonic.net
    kentrak@gmail.com kbenson@a-1networks.com

    I'm hoping there's some way to recover this account (even though
    there's nothing associated with it yet). If not, the listed id of
    KENTRAK above will suffice. Thanks!
