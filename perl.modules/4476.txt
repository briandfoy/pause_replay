        The README follows.  The Abstract describes the module pretty
completely.

--------------------------------------------------
$Id: README,v 1.1.1.1 2001/02/16 14:35:51 fletch Exp $

--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Pcap is a POE wrapper for the Net::Pcap wrapper for
libpcap.  It exists as a separate session which sends events back to a
specified session when packets are ready.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE and Net::Pcap.  The requirements are encoded
in Makefile.PL.  The NetPacket::* modules are also probably useful.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Pcap may be installed through the CPAN shell in the
usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Pcap'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Pcap

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Pcap

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Pcap can also be installed manually.  The latest CPAN
version can be found at
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/F/FL/FLETCH/> or in a
similarly named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.  The most
recent development snapshot, which only rarely contains hideous
show-stopping bugs, is available from <http://phydeaux.org/>.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
