Ok. Thanks. However, I'm packaging the distributions on Windows XP using
"nmake dist". So, there must not be a permission problem as far as I =
know
(and it looks like  I'm wrong). But, I was using Archive::Tar for tar =
and
gzip operations before (and I didn't get any indexer errors). I'm now =
using
win32 ports of GNU tar and gzip. And I don't get any error during "nmake
dist" or "nmake disttest" or "nmake test". I'll check these program's =
(tar &
gzip) options or will use Archive::Tar again.

It's a bug in your packaging. All your directories have a permission
of 666 which means that the indexer can untar your distribution but
cannot read the files.

I'd recommend, you use 'make dist' and 'make disttest' to distribute
your modules.

I apologize that the indexer is not smart enough to write a proper
report to you. On first sight a fix to that end seems to involve quite
a view parts of the code, so I must defer such a fix....
