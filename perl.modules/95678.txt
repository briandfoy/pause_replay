It sounds fine to drop the older lower-cased name from the index and to
move the corresponding 0.01 release to backpan.

It also sounds like there's an issue with the newer
Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-BioPerl releases -- since the 02packages index has:

Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::BioPerl 0.20
C/CD/CDRAUG/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-BioPerl-0.20.tar.gz
Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::BioPerl 0.23
C/CJ/CJFIELDS/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-BioPerl-0.23.tar.gz

What happened to Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::BioPerl in versions 0.21 and
later? The 0.23 release does contain Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::BioPerl
(see https://metacpan.org/release/Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-BioPerl) -- why
is it not indexed? The package declaration in the module looks fine, and I
see no 'provides' or 'no_index' metadata. Perhaps CJFIELDS only got comaint
after the 0.23 release, in which case a force-reindexing on PAUSE should
clear this up.
