The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CMMi
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: CMMi process implementation - web interface
  userid:      THUNDERA (Mauro Ribeiro)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://groups.google.com.br/group/cm-brasil

  similar:

  rationale:

    The idea of having common implementation for each automation
    perfomed at many business process culminates into a family of new
    modules grouped by its conceptual process definition, in this case
    the CMMi model from SEI/CMU.

    This new family shall be a base for mid-weight business operation,
    that are interesting in obtain CMMi Certification, without have to
    plan all SW usability, required model-metrics and plugins to their
    legacy systems. (e.g. other commercial SW that implement distinct
    parts of CMMi model definitions)

    The primary scope of use is: Inside a hybrid Win/Unix intranet
    domain.

    The primary audiance are: All light to mid-weight SW Development
    Factories, regarding their business area, that have been use the
    same support SW in their development process, trying to attend CMMi
    definitions and demands for data and quantitative analysis.
