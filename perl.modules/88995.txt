Although you're using it on large files, it seems that this module is
really about buffered reads. Maybe people would want to use it for
files other than large files. As Johan noted, though, Perl is already
supposed to do this for you.

What about File::ReadBuffer or something like that, to describe what
it's doing instead of a particular use case?
