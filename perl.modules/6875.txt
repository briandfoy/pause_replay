I'm certainly willing to do this.  Perhaps one of us could come up
with a draft spec and we could then have steel cage matches to settle
any differences ;-)

I don't think there's really any reason other than "hmmm, I wrote one,
you wrote one, we both want to release ours, whatever."  I wouldn't
mind going with either codebase, although clearly I know my own better
than that of Net::AIM.

Who wants to write the specification?  I'm probably too busy to get it
done in a timely manner, so if someone else were willing to do it, I'd
be happy.  Matthew, what do you say?  It's your baby, why don't you
run with it?
