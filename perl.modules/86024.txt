The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::AM
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: Classify data with analogical modeling
  userid:      NGLENN (Nathan Gary Glenn)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a new release of the analogical modeling classifier located
    at http://humanities.byu.edu/am/. I chose the name by analogy (heh)
    with Algorithm::SVM, which is also a classification algorithm. 'AM'
    is a commonly used acronym for analogical modeling, and I thought
    'Algorithm::AnalogicalModeling' was just too long.

  enteredby:   NGLENN (Nathan Gary Glenn)
  enteredon:   Thu May 16 02:59:51 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::AM              adhOp Classify data with analogical modeling       NGLENN
