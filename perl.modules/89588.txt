The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::R::IO
  DSLIP:       adphg
  description: Read R data files
  userid:      DAVOR (Davor Cubranic)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    PrePAN

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides a pure Perl implementation for reading native
    data files produced by R statistical computing environment.

    It provides routines for reading files in the two primary file
    formats used in R for serializing native objects:

    RDS: RDS files store a serialization of a single R object (and, if
    the object contains references to other objects, such as
    environments, all the referenced objects as well). These files are
    created in R using the readRDS function and are typically named with
    the .rds file extension.

    RData: RData files store a serialization of a collection of named
    objects, typically a workspace. These files are created in R using
    the save function and are typically named with the .RData file
    extension. (Contents of the R workspace can also be saved
    automatically on exit to the file named .RData, which is by default
    automatically read in on startup.)

  enteredby:   DAVOR (Davor Cubranic)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 18 19:22:23 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::R::
::IO              adphg Read R data files                            DAVOR
