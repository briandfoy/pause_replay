     why:

    I am planing to contribute some usefull URI modules. Like PHP's
    urlencode. Perl doesn't have any urlencode fuction. We are using
    URI::Escape for this. And i want to write a rewrite module for
    encoding URL's. This module including regional character encoding
    from the URL. For example: The documents title: 'Onur Aslan KuyruÄŸu
    Noksan'. My module encode this like this:
    onur-aslan-kuyrugu-noksan.html. This can be usefull for using
    Apache's mod_rewrite. This is my project. I didn't write this module
    yet. I am planing to write this module after joining PAUSE.
