Hello;

  I have a module (or two?) that I'd like to contribute to CPAN, and as
such this is my application for a PAUSE account.

Name:    Blaine Cook
Email:   lattice@tao.ca
User ID: LATTICE

The module that I'm primarily interested in contributing is a generic
form generator/processor. It's basically a module that provides a
generic interface for storing, displaying, processing and submitting
forms. I've mainly focused on web forms thus far, but an extension to
have interactive scripts or internet services use the system would be
relatively trivial.

At present, the module is in use for user administration tasks (and
other things customarily done with one-off custom scripts) at
wedgeweed.org.

I haven't yet packaged the script for CPAN, but I thought I'd get the
ball rolling, then do the other work. ;-)

thanks,

b.
