Matt=2C Steffen=2C=20
sorry for misunderstanding.
=20
It all started when we needed an effective way to communicate between Perl =
and C++ code at my work.
=20
As for the the official project leaded by Brad=2C I was rather dissapointed=
 that=20
1) the project started in July has no documentation=2C=20
2) in September it has perfomance problems to the state that (to quote Brad=
) "maybe we need to do a without-Moose rewrite" and
3) "unfortunately I have about zero time to work on this myself" http://gro=
ups.google.com/group/protobuf-perl/browse_thread/thread/7a2046625276df80
So=2C I've written the implementaion=2C several day discussion on modules@p=
erl.org hasn't reveal any namespace problems=2C so I've shared it on CPAN.
=20
Yuval=2C=20
what is going on with protobuf project?
Will you do the code rewrite?  Will you keep these heavy Moose backbone?
There are differences between my work and the protobuf project (e.g. mine d=
oesn't need installed protoc compliler=2C it can parse proto on its own=3B =
it allows data access both via accessors and plain hash access).=20
How do you think=2C is it possible to merge the code?
=20
Anyway=2C it's better to have two implementations than have no one.
And considering that both of them follow the standard=2C they are compatibl=
e with each other on binary level.
=20
Regards=2C
Igor Gariev.
