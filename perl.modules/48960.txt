I'd like to withdraw Bio::Pet32a as a proposed name.

Adam Kennedy made some good suggestions. Also it is mostly a data file. I'll
come up with a better idea. Maybe Bio::Data::PlasmidVector, or
Bio::Data::Plasmid::Vector (since all plasmids *may* not be vectors - not
really sure there).

An interface like plasmid_vector (  plasmid_name, references to plasmid
details maybe as a hash function reference )
Then the module can handle all the details of finding the plasmid data
The MCPrimers solver has very general potential - I am trying to decouple it
from plasmid data access

All I am really trying to do is to make the data access to vector data be
separate from my solver engine.

Rgrds, Steve Lenk
