Hello,

I've written a perl extension module to use the Reuters SourceSinkLibrary
(SSL) to extract from and contribute
data to a Reuters Realtime Triarch.

My Name: Christian Barkey
Company: HVB Banque Luxembourg S.A.
E-Maily: christian.barkey@hvb.lu
Preferred UserID: CBARKEY


I've called my Module Reuters::SSL to avaoid most name clashing hopefully
but never discussed this before on the net.
I've seen that in 1998 (search for Reuters) one other person tried to
register such a module but I think this was never done because I was unable
to contact him. So I decided to redevelop the interface and made some good
experiences with this. I think this module would be suitable for many
other banks and financial institutes.

Greetings
Christian
