I'm pretty new, too. I'm also figuring it out as I go along.

Probably, it is not. Obviously, I don't know. But much more work needs
to be done besides writing the module itself. What have you done so far?
Please be maximally specific.

There's plenty of information but it's hardly complete. It's also very
difficult, for me, to see which steps are firm requirements, strong
recommendations, possible alternates, and mere suggestions. I do not see
any one place that contains a definitive, step-by-step guide to the CPAN
module upload and release process. 

I do not understand the process clearly at all; nor do I have any basis
upon which to judge it. But I do not see why the process, however
organized, should be, for the newcomer, shrouded in mystery.
