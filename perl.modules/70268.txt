Several months ago I was finally able to contact the maintainer of Net::MySQL. I have fixed several bugs in the code, and offered to fix the outstanding bugs. He indicated that if I got a PAUSE ID he would make me a co-maintainer. I had some trouble getting the ID (NOMAD) but have had it for a bit. I emailed the maintainer but he hasn't responded yet. Is there a way for me to tell if I have been made a co-maintainer? Failing that, is there a way for you to tell? 


Thanks in advance.
