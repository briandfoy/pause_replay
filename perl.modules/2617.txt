JPIERCE
A lightweight module for dumping specific forms of data, as opposed to
Data::JavaScript's generic all purpose heavier abilities.
a/bdpf

It has been uploaded to
$CPAN/authors/id/J/JP/JPIERCE/Data-JavaScript-LiteObject-1.00.tgz

If it must be merged into say, Data::JavaScript, so be it.
However, that kind of defeats the purpose. It is meant to be lightweight.
It's a 6k module; half is documentation; that works fine and provides
several options. Whereas D::JS with it's is well on it's way to 30k.
Additionally the output differs greatly it's compactness...
I have nothing against renaming it, if necessary, but this seemed the
best choice, and has no conflicts.
