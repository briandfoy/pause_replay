     why:

    I have a couple of Win32 related perl modules I'd like to share.
    Technically, they are bug fixes/rewrites of some older modules I've
    found lying around (Win32::Daemon and Win32::Scheduler).

    I also tend to come up with a bunch of crazy ideas for PHP's
    extensions, some of them are likely to spill over into perl if I
    also have an account here.
