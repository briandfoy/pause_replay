I'm working on the Tk indexing problem Jan pointed out, so I updated
the account information on Nick's account to point back at us:

   Full Name: PAUSE Custodial Account
   Public email: ni-s@cpan.org
   Secret email:  modules@perl.org

In general, I'll start doing this for accounts where the person
disappears or declares they want to give up all of their modules. We'll
get the mail about the modules and whatnot. 

I also thought about making the secret email something like
modules+custodial@perl.org, and I can do that if we think that's a good
idea.  Is any of this going to cause a nasty mail loop? I don't think
we have any auto-responders.

We could even point the secret email at an autoresponder on a different
address. I could write a message that explains that the module has no
maintainer, etc.

If we like this idea, I'll submit a patch for the FAQ which explains
this.
