That would be possible, but the purpose of this specific module is to  
be a drop-in replacement for the old API Verisign used to publish,  
for people who are moving to newer hardware (like us...) that is not  
supported by the old binary-only APIs.  Long-term I think I'd like to  
update the Business::OnlinePayment plug-in for Payflow to use the new  
HTTP based API.
