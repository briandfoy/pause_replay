It's possible that you just never got the mail that I sent.

Olovoer asked to register AuthCAS as a top level namespace. Just
looking at the name doesn't say much and doesn't provide any context.
That's why most modules live under a general name, followed by a more
specific name.

CAS can mean several things. For instance, in my world, that means the
Chemical Abstracts Service, which also happens to be the first hit for
CAS in Google. A better name can dis-ambiguate that. :)
