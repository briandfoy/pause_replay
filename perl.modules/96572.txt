Howdy,=20

I'm experiencing some issues with a certain module named, "Badger",=20

	https://metacpan.org/pod/Badger

running under newer Perls. The module does have a public git repo,=20

	https://github.com/abw/Badger

and that repo has a fix for the issue,=20

	=
https://github.com/abw/Badger/commit/846ff0126912d7be5b756c61ad54574e1705b=
31e

but the author has not released a bug fix version to CPAN for quite some =
time now.=20

They do not seem to be easily reached using polite methods:=20

	https://github.com/abw/Badger/issues/11

I would love to gain co-maintainershp permissions to push this release =
out. I do not have goals to start up development of the module itself, =
and I do have the utmost respect towards the original author, given =
their extensive history of releases to the Perl community. In other =
words, I'm not looking to take over/steal this module from this author, =
I just want to push a release out, without having to create a new =
namespace - doing THAT won't fix my problems, as I have software =
releases that have Badger as a dependency themselves. Having everyone =
coordinate on using a slightly different module would be... messy. The =
module itself is Wizard-level to this run-of-the-mill Perl guy.=20

Would it be possible to get co-maintainership?=20
