That sounds right to me (say) Log::Dispatch::TkText to allow 
other types of Tk widget to be added later (now I know what it is
I can imagine a Log::Displatch::TkPopup which posts a dialog box for 
critical status messages only) perhaps a Log::Dispatch::Tk _could_ be 
invented and used as a base class for various Tk display mechanisms?

There is near zero chance of it being "bundled with" Tk.

But Tk can tolerate separately bundled extensions because of the way 
widget classes register themselves with Tk::Widget when their .pm file 
is loaded. If Log::Dispatch does not have a similar non-monolithic 
extension mechanism it probably should ;-)

You probably don't want to do that till it settles down.
The dependancies get messy very quickly if bundles get too complex.

I think the discussion can be held away from the list - one of us
should post the conclusion when we have one.
