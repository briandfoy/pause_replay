Hi Ken,

thanks for Locale::PO! We're using it in our
i18n workflow, and it has been working fine.

I wrote to you some weeks ago because of a
few problems we found, which are also filed
as bugs at rt.cpan.org, but got no answer:

https://rt.cpan.org/Search/Simple.html?q=Locale%3A%3APO

There are also really useful patches in RT that
can make the module more robust and complete with
regards to PO files parsing and generation.

I'm willing to take over maintainership of Locale::PO
if you don't have time for it, or don't work on it
anymore.

If I won't get any answer from you by next week,
I'm going to request co-maintainership of Locale::PO,
with the goal of getting a few fixes to the regularly
released CPAN version.
