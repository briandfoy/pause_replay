Hiya

The FCGI module you have on CPAN: http://search.cpan.org/~skimo/FCGI-0.67/

is used as the basis forFastCGI support in at least the Catalyst 
framework (and most other things doing FastCGI in perl seemingly), and 
as recently pointed out to me on IRC, hasn't been updated since 2002, 
has a number of open bugs. Debian + Openbsd both have downstream patches 
  to correct issues.

On that basis I'd like to volunteer to perform some basic maintenance of 
the module to get a new release out fixing some of the bugs in RT and 
maybe incorporating the downstream patches..

Is there a source code repository anywhere that I can work from, and is 
it possible that you could give me maintenance permission in PAUSE so 
that I could work on it and upload a development release with bug fixes 
for testing.

Thanks in advance
Tom

P.S. I'm unsure if your CPAN address is still current / valid, but can't 
find another address for you from Google, therefore I have CC'd 
modules@perl.org, as someone there may be able to contact you.
