You probably noticed that what I did was basically to embed perl in
python, not the other way around as your original plan was.  The
interfaces go between languages both ways, but with my stuff things
need to be bootstrapped from python currently.  Some more patching is
needed to make it bootstrap from perl.

Anyway, I think the Zope-free stuff of what we did should go to CPAN.
It currently lives in:

   ftp://ftp.activestate.com/Zope-Perl/pyperl-1.0.beta2.tar.gz

At the top level it uses python's answer to Makefile.PL (called
'setup.py') and inside the sub directory 'Python-Object' contains a
traditional perl XS extension. Will CPAN's indexer manage to figure
out what part of perl's Python:: namespace it uses if I upload it as
it is?

If not, then perhaps we should add some entries to the module list:

Python     bmcf    Interface to the Python API (for embedded python)
Python::
::Object   bmcO    Wrapper for python objects
::Err      bmcO    Wrapper for python exceptions
