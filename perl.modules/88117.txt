The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::RoundTrip
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: Routines to manage round trip email checks
  userid:      EINHVERFR (Chris Travers)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    We currently have modules for verifying the internal validity of
    email addresses and even checking against DNS MX records, but try as
    I might, I couldn't find any modules for managing an actual
    round-trip process. Such a process is required because it
    demonstrates not only that the email address is valid but also that
    the email box exists and that the user has access to it.

    The approach taken here is simply a queue and hand back approach
    which allows requests to be stored, and then retrieved when the code
    (currently a UUID) is provided. This can then be processed by
    resuming processing where it was before.

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::RoundTrip       RdpOb Routines to manage round trip email checks   EINHVERFR
