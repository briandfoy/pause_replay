From: rkitover@cachemiss.com ("Rafael Kitover")

Hello, my CPAN id is RKITOVER.

Net::SSH2 is broken in perl 5.10, and I've patched this:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36614

9 months ago. The author (czth) promised to look at it but nothing
transpired.

I'd like a comaint bit for this module so I can release a fixed version,
and take care of some other outstanding issues as well.

POE::Session::YieldCC has been broken for a very long time due to API
changes in Coro and POE. I've made some very simple changes to get it to
work again:
https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=43100

but got no response from the author, the module is abandoned and I'd like
to take over maintenance of it.
