The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::Dressing
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Set a theme in your Tk widget. (a dressing)
  userid:      DJIBEL (Djibril Ousmanou)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.modules/browse_thread/thread/e995fd7200f2bc34#

  similar:
    Tk::Preferences Tk::CmdLine

  rationale:

    Dear,

    Before creation of this module I have seen what already exists in
    CPAN.

    Tk::CmdLine is good. But it is not easy to use for a newbie. We
    have to set declaration before each MainWindows and it is very
    global. But it is very good.

    Tk::Preferences : I have used this module in several perl/tk
    application that I have created but, I have see some bugs for some
    widgets or children widgets. I have submitted a patch in 2009 but no
    answer. The concept of my module is very similar to this module by
    using configure method to change configuration of a widget parent (
    MainWidows, TopLevel, Frame, ...) or children (button, entry, ...).
    Some change in code have been set. The Data::DumpXML is not clear
    and I think using an XML to set configuration is not good. A ini
    file is simple and sufficient to store configuration.

    These 2 modules does not propose some default configuration files
    and I think it can be a good idea. Allow user to send sometimes an
    ini file configuration to add theme in module can be good. That is
    why I have decided to upload this module to CPAN.

    Best regards,

    Djibril
