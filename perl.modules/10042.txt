The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Shoephone::Client
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Secure Communications IO
  userid:      SHOEPHONE (Craig Brian)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    mailinglists

  similar:
    SOAP::Lite

  rationale:

    Shoephone is encrypted communication tunnel between servers, hence
    the IO root level. Shoephone communication can be a crossplatform
    method for monitoring, management, or any distributed computing.
    There will be a set of 5 perl modules, used for security, client &
    server functionality, job dispatching, and log processing. Although
    Shoephone uses the SOAP module, it differs because the SOAP
    communication protocol is transparent, only used as a multiplatform
    base communication. The name "Shoephone" is descriptive of it's
    function. Like the shoe phone in the Get Smart television show, it
    is a means for secure communication. We will make a Shoephone Bundle
    upon completion.

The resulting entry would be:

IO::Shoephone::
::Client          adpOp Secure Communications IO                     SHOEPHONE
