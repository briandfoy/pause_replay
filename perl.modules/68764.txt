If you go into:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

you can either create a co-maint or pass primary maintainership status.

t0m's CPAN id is BOBTFISH.

Alternatively, I can click the buttons for you if you would prefer - just
mail me saying so.

Thanks very much for creating FCGI.pm - much though I might be grumpy please
bleieve that I appreciate the effort that went into doing so and am grateful
that it not only existed but was freely available. We'll do our best to
look after it.
