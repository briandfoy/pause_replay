     why:

    I have a number of bits of library code I've written over the years
    which I'd like to share. These include:

    * An alternative engine to Mongoose which does lazy loading from a
    NoSQL database (note that Mongoose is specifically written to allow
    people to supply alternative engines).

    * A layer on top of PDF::API2 to produce invoices.

    but I've recently written a module for Barclays which would be
    suitable in Finance::Bank. I've e-mailed the current Barclays module
    maintainer and it may just be he integrates the code I've written
    but a PAUSE ID seems like a sensible thing to get at this time.
