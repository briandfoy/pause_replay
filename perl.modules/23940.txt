The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Wiki::Toolkit
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: A toolkit for building wikis.
  userid:      KAKE (Kate L Pugh)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    cgi-wiki-dev@earth.li

  similar:
    CGI::Wiki

  rationale:

    I'd like to move CGI::Wiki to this namespace.

    - it should have been called Wiki::Toolkit in the first place,
    since it doesn't do any actual CGI, and it is after all a wiki
    toolkit. - a rewrite is planned and a fair bit of the API will
    change, so this seems to be the right time to shift to a more
    sensible namespace. - we're going to need somewhere to put whatever
    we end up renaming CGI::Wiki::Kwiki to, and I can't think of
    anywhere better than Wiki::* - CGI::* is crowded; let's have
    somewhere particular to put wiki things. There are ways other than
    the web to access wikis - see for example Earle Martin's IRC
    WikiBot.

  enteredby:   KAKE (Kate L Pugh)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct 10 01:41:47 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Wiki::
::Toolkit         cdpOp A toolkit for building wikis.                KAKE
