1. Amazon::SimpleDB is currently being used
by Amazon's own Perl library...which has some serious
issues (as in "doesn't work") and likely won't ever
make it to CPAN.

2. I chose Net::Amazon::SimpleDB since there's
already a "Net::Amazon" that does much the same thing
for Amazon's A2S nee ECS. Net::Amazon::SimpleDB is
(in some sense) just a protocol implementation
(DBD::SimpleDB will provide all the database-iness)

Does that make sense ?
