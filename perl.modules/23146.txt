     why:

    This will be my first module submission. I have implemented the A*
    Pathfinding algorithim and wanted to make it available as something
    like Games::Pathfinding::AStar or something like that. The interface
    consists of a single exportable function which accepts a reference
    to an object encapsulating your map, your starting node, and target
    node and returns an array of node ids representing the path to get
    there. Heuristic calculations are also left to the map object making
    the AStar package as generally usefull as possible.

    Maybe this is too simple a module? Thank you for your time. I await
    your response.
