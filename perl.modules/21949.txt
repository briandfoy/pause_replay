The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Links::Localize
  DSLIP:       bdpOb
  description: Convert HTMLs to be viewable on hard-disk
  userid:      SHLOMIF (Shlomi Fish)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::TagReader

  rationale:

    As suggested by Sean Burke on modules@perl.org, I choose this
    namespace as it represents the purpose of this module. The previous
    chosen name was HTML::Hard::Disk, but it was criticized as being
    inadequate. This module localizes the links, so it fits its name,
    and it is used for HTML documents, so it should go under HTML::.

  enteredby:   SHLOMIF (Shlomi Fish)
  enteredon:   Sun Jun 22 16:26:26 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::Links::
::Localize        bdpOb Convert HTMLs to be viewable on hard-disk    SHLOMIF
