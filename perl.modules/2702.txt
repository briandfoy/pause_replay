Hi,


1) I would like to rename my module MPEG::ID3v1Tag to MP3::ID3v1Tag in
   the modules list. 

   The latest release (1.10) is already renamed, it is just that the modules 
   list hasn't been update to reflect this name change.

2) Also the MP3:: namespace is listed under section 18 Images,Pixmaps,Bitmaps
   where we might want to create an "Audio Codec/Meta-data/Utilities" section.
   There are a lot of modules under the Audio:: namespace and DOUGM's Xmms::
   would also fit in there nicely,

What do you think?
