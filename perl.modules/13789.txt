The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::BGP
  DSLIP:       anpOp
  description: Object-oriented API to the BGP protocol
  userid:      SSCHECK (Stephen J. Scheck)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    Since the Net hierarchy contains many modules which implement IP
    protocols from different levels of the OSI reference model, it seems
    natural to place a BGP module here - the only other alternative
    would be to place it at root level, which would needlessly clutter
    it. There appear to be no other modules which implement IP routing
    protocols, so choosing BGP for the module name will cause no
    namespace conflicts and the module aims to be a general and flexible
    API which would serve as a good foundation for any more specific
    BGP-related tasks, so it (hopefully) would fulfill and preempt any
    other designs on the Net::BGP namespace anybody might have.

  enteredby:   SSCHECK (Stephen J. Scheck)
  enteredon:   Mon Sep 16 01:59:26 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::BGP             anpOp Object-oriented API to the BGP protocol      SSCHECK
