     why:

    Have been working on some code mainly useful as support for website
    development. Initially looking to contribute some Template Toolkit 2
    plugins, including better support and integration with Jemplate
    (www.jemplate.net) and Javascript (jQuery etc.), and also some
    modules that work with TAP to generate statistics and HTML-formatted
    results from test runs (similar to TAP::Formatter::HTML, but
    separating the information across pages to reduce the page load
    time).
