I'm afraid there are many similar modules. 
By searching in CPAN for error and log,
many modules are logging errors, enabling try { ... } catch { ... } blocks.
There are modules using objects and someones they don't.

I don't want to say, that you did something what anybody else has already done,
but I can't decide by your description what are the differences to the other modules.
Perhaps you can give us a short synopsis.

On the other hand, Errors::Errors is a namespace like WWW:WWW or CGI::CGI or Math::Math.
The second level namespace should explain the details, not repeat the top level namespace.
What about Errors::Simple, Errors::Lite, Errors::Centralized, ...

Greetings,
