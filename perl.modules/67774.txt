The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Route
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Portable interface to the routing table
  userid:      TEQUETER (Thomas Equeter)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    What it does:

    Every OS provides its custom interface to the routing table: Linux'
    "route" utility is different from BSD's "route show", from Windows'
    "route print", etc. Parsing all these different output styles in an
    (otherwise portable) script can quickly become inconvenient.

    Net::Route abstracts the system specifics and provides a single,
    portable interface.

    Name choice:

    Given the obvious Net:: top namespace, Net::Route was the most
    straightforward choice. I also believe this is where prospective
    users will look for such a feature first.

  enteredby:   TEQUETER (Thomas Equeter)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep 22 13:36:38 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Route           bdpOp Portable interface to the routing table      TEQUETER
