Hi,

I'd like to be granted co-maintainer status on Lingua::EN::Numbers.

The current version is 1.01, release by Sean Burke 2005-01-06. He took =
over the module
from Stephen Pandich and completely rewrote it.

I wrote a review of modules for spelling out numbers in English:
	=
http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2011/09/cpan-modules-for-spelling-out-nu=
mbers-in-english.html

Lingua::EN::Numbers came out top, but I found a bug which I fixed. I'd =
like to release that fix,
and resolve at least some if not all of the open RT issues (many of =
which have been fixed anyway).

I'd also like to address some of the issues/ideas which came up during =
the review.

I first emailed Sean two months ago (12th September). I've tried =
contacting him a number of ways,
but have had no response. I recently mailed module-authors, and was told =
he's retired, with a pointer
to Pod::Simple, which had been handed over by Sean.

I had email with the three maintainers of Pod::Simple, who said:
	- they didn't have another way of contacting Sean other than his =
cpan address
	- they thought he'd handed over his modules, but perhaps not all =
of them
	- Sean may be waiting for more evidence that I'm serious about =
maintaining the module

Was co-maintainer status granted to someone else for =
Lingua::EN::Numbers, and if so,
can you tell me who please, so I can contact them.

Neil
