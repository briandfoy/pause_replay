Proposed Module:	Text::Tmpl
DLSI:			bdhO
Description:		Fast, extensible & simple templating system for C and Perl
FTP Location:
ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/D/DL/DLOWE/Text-Tmpl-0.03.tar.gz

Just recently got the go-ahead to release this module which was written
for work.  Yes, I know there are already a ton of templating modules, but
I haven't seen any that are usable from both C and Perl (which was a
requirement for this project), nor have I seen any that are as fast &
flexible as this one (simple but extensible syntax; C back-end for speed).
We've been using it at my work for about 6 months.


Proposed Module:	String::Checker
DLSI:			bdpf
Description:		Pipelined string consistency verification
FTP Location:
ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/D/DL/DLOWE/String-Checker-0.03.tar.gz

Again a work project being released.  This was written just as a simple
base for the next module to use.  Again, we've been using it for about 6
months.


Proposed Module:	CGI::ArgChecker
DLSI:			bdpO
Description:		CGI.pm aware input data consistency verification
FTP Location:
ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/D/DL/DLOWE/CGI-ArgChecker-0.02.tar.gz

Last but not least of the work releases.  To prevent myself from getting
lax about performing input data validation on CGI parameters, I wrote this
module which makes it a much simpler task.  Again, it's been in use about
6 months.

Love to hear some feedback on these... thanks!
