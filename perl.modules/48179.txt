     why:

    String::Quote - small set of quotation procedures. For instance, I
    have no needs to load CGI.pm, only for quotation (complete).
    String::Date - tiny module for parse dates by templates (complete)
    DBI::Unify - The another abstraction level under DBI: symplify often
    used operations, simplify RDBMS migrations(awaiting docs and tests
    for some database drivers) ; WEB::Auto - Form (create, check
    required, show results after correct form submit, work with RDBMS),
    Grid (create, auto sorting, auto limiting output, full navigate,
    output control "on fly", work with RDBMS), Dialog (simple dialogs)
    (porting from HTML::Mason to .pm)
