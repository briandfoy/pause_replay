The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Google::Spreadsheet::Agent
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Google spreadsheet based pipeline
  userid:      DMLOND (Darin London)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module makes use of Google Spreadsheet API, via
    Net::Google::Spreadsheets in a novel and productive fashion. It isnt
    an extension or modification of Net::Google::Spreadsheets, so it did
    not fit in that namespace. It is more a use of an existing system. I
    did not see a namespace available for modules which make use of the
    Google and Google Spreadsheets APIs in novel ways, but I figured
    that this would be something that more people in the future would
    like to do, as I have.

  enteredby:   DMLOND (Darin London)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 28 11:57:00 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Google::Spreadsheet::
::Agent           bdpOp Google spreadsheet based pipeline            DMLOND
