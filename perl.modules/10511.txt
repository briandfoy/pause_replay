The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::TimeLine
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: publish a timeline on the web in HTML
  userid:      OUBIWANN (Duncan McGreggor)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module uses HTML::Table as the basis for a perl class which
    allows one to generate the classic timeline look. Since this
    generates HTML, it seemed only fitting to use that prefix. As far as
    I can tell, no one has written an HTML timeline generator, though I
    think that I have seen one that generates timelines with the GD
    library.

  enteredby:   OUBIWANN (Duncan McGreggor)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar  7 16:42:38 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::TimeLine        cdpOg publish a timeline on the web in HTML        OUBIWANN
