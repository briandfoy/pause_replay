The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::DoMore
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Multiple SQL statements in a single batch
  userid:      EMAZEP (Emanuele Zeppieri)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::RunSQL

  rationale:

    Some DBI drivers don't support the execution of multiple statements
    in a single "do()" call. This module tries to overcome such
    limitation, letting the user execute any number of SQL statements
    (of any kind, not only DDL statements) in a single batch, with any
    DBI driver.

    No CPAN module I'm aware of offer such functionality except for
    DBIx::RunSQL, which however uses a raw split on the semicolon
    character to separate the given SQL code into the atomic statements
    it is composed of, which of course fails in a number of cases.

    DBIx::DoMore instead uses a more sophisticated algorithm, so that
    it is able to correctly handle the presence of the semicolon inside
    identifiers, values or "BEGIN..END" blocks.

    Automatic rollback in case of failure (which is optional anyway) is
    another (maybe) useful feature offered by DBIx::DoMore which
    DBIx::RunSQL seem to lack.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::DoMore          RdpOp Multiple SQL statements in a single batch    EMAZEP
