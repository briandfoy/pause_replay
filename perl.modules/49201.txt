Subject: Module submission WWW::BF2Player

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::BF2Player
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Get Battlefield 2 Player Info
  userid:      WILSOND (Dusty Wilson)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://dusty.hey.nu/

  similar:
    WWW::BF2S

  rationale:

    WWW::BF2S (I also wrote) does a similar thing, but from a different
    data source.

    This is a module that fetches and caches data from BF2Player.com's
    XML feed of Battlefield 2 player data, scores, and awards.

    It uses LWP to fetch the feed and XML::Simple to parse it.

  enteredby:   WILSOND (Dusty Wilson)
  enteredon:   Sun Jun  4 23:27:39 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::BF2Player       adpOp Get Battlefield 2 Player Info                WILSOND
