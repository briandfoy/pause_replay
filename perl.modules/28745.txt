Hi Simon,

> Has this request [for BBC] been declined?

As explained, we really try to avoid CPAN ids that are not person
related. There are several reasons for that, although we do not have a
real policy for it. And yes, we once made an exception for BBCILF.

We do really appreciate the BBC submitting modules. But even within a
company, there is usually a single person responsible for the modules,
and when this person changes job, everything can be transferred to a
new maintainer (again, a person).

So for the time being I'd suggest to submit the BBC modules under your
own id, SIMONFLK. Should we change policy, they can easily be
transferred.

Also, with the new and steadily improving search.cpan.org, the
relation between CPAN id and modules becomes less important from the
perspecitve of the users.
