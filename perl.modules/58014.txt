The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WattsUp
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Object to Configure Watts Up? Units
  userid:      ROBBAT (Robin H. Johnson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Private IRC chats thus far, will have public Git repo

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is dealing with the Watts Up? power meters as available from
    http://www.wattsupmeters.com (and seen on ThinkGeek).

    I'm not sure how best to handle the namespace issue, I don't find
    an existing root level element that indicates hardware
    configuration. I do see other namespaces like Linksys::Config and
    Cisco::*, that suggest to me hardware may have it's own root
    namespace.

    In my git repo, I've got it laid out as follows, but that's easy to
    change: WattsUp::Config - configure the device WattsUp::Parser -
    parse a file of the device output WattsUp::Daemon - takes a callback
    of what to do

    and a small daemon example that configures a unit, just trivially
    logs to a text file.

  enteredby:   ROBBAT (Robin H. Johnson)
  enteredon:   Sun Dec  2 22:13:57 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WattsUp           bdpfp Object to Configure Watts Up? Units          ROBBAT
