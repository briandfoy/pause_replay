Subject: Module submission Geo::2DPoint

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::2DPoint
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Points on the globe
  userid:      MARKOV (Mark Overmeer)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Geo::Coordinates

  rationale:

    A few modules do things with points on the globe, however they lack
    the abstraction.

    Points on the globe can be expressed in many coordinate systems,
    like wgs84 and utm (and over 200 others), and no module abstract
    from that: no one stores the coordinate system with the xy/latlong
    values.

    Geo::2D contains Geo::2DPoint, Geo::2DLine, etc. (Name-)space has
    been left free for Geo::3DPoint, where height calculations must be
    added.

    In the near future, this module will form the base for Geo::mySQL,
    which handles the 'new' geometry fields in mySQL (the WKT and WKB
    data formats).

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::2DPoint         adpOg Points on the globe                          MARKOV
