I believe that if there is nobody listed as primary (first-come/module 
list) or co-maintainer for a namespace, anybody can upload a 
distribution containing that namespace and he'll get primary 
maintainership automatically.

If that doesn't work, you can try having your release reindexed (also 
via the pause intrface) and then transfer the recovered maintainer's bit.

If everything else fails, feel free to ping us again!

Cheers,
Steffen
