Hi,

I have written a module that is useful in my current project, which I would 
like to release on CPAN. AFAICT there is no other module that does the same 
thing, but the functionality is a little unusual (well, not really by CPAN 
standards) so I am not sure. The closest thing I can find is Tie::Alias, 
although what this achieves is quite different. I would also appreciate a bit 
on guidance with naming.

The module is (currently) called Tie::BlessedAlias and its synopsis is:

This module allows you to create an alias for an object blessed into a 
different class to the object itself. This is usually useful when the class 
of the alias is a subclass of the class of the original instance, to allow 
you to create a version of an object with additional functionality.

I am uncertain about the name because of the Tie:: namespace. Perhaps the fact 
that it uses tie is just an implementation detail and it would fit better 
into the Class:: namespace.

Regards,
Thomas Yandell
