oops, the previous mail got sent without me being done for some reason.
Sorry.	

Hi, 
I just tried to upload a new version of my module ,
Net::Telnet::Netscreen.
The upload thingie worked fine, but when I tried to update the module
metadata to point to the new version, I got this message:

Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to MRAMBERG. Please
note, only modules that are already registered in the module list can be
edited here. If you believe, this is a bug, please contact
modules@perl.org.

If I go to View Permissions, I can see my namespaces though. What is
wrong? Did I miss something important?

Cheers,
Marcus.
