The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Egg::Release
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: WEB application framework
  userid:      LUSHE (Masatoshi Mizuno)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://egg.bomcity.com/browser

  similar:
    Catalyst Sledge

  rationale:

    The application framework is the one used to do the efficiency of
    work in. Therefore, when the use of it is difficult, it is useless.
    Catalyst can be very improved by this respect. Moreover, there are a
    lot of people who are using it, too and it doesn't lack information.
    However, I think that it is being limited to the end by people in
    the sphere in English of this. A Japanese information page is not a
    reason that not is. However, information such as enhancing is very
    scarce only in a basic thing almost. Therefore, most people who are
    using it think only like a high skill person. In the similar module
    that Japan made, there is Sledge. In this, modules a lot used.
    However, it doesn't correspond to mod_perl2. The use user has
    disclosed information to make it correspond to mod_perl2. However,
    if it is not a person at a high level, it is likely not to edit it.
    Then, it started the module development to solve these problems.
    Therefore, I think that the composition is very simply made. I think
    that it wants you to use this module for the introduction to the WEB
    application framework. My best regards.
