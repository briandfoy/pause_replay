Request to register new user

fullname: Olin Oden
  userid: OLINODEN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://lee.k12.nc.us/~joden/lcss/tech_tracker
     why:

    Plan to contribute the following libs:

    * Security::LibPath - Allows one to alter @INC via a secure config
    file similar to /etc/ld.so.conf. * Onetable - a library for
    developing web based database applications. * NEWT2 - This is
    basically NEWT with some bug fixes. Have not been able to contact
    original author, so I figured I would fork it and move on.

    Also, I have a PAUSE account under James Olin Oden, but I cannot
    seem to get anyone to respond to my requests to change my password.
    I think this is probably because I had set my email to a server that
    no longer exists. Anyway, a new account seems to be the most
    expedient method for dealing with this.

    Cheers...james
