The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shared
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Shared variables locally and remotely
  userid:      JRYAN (Joseph F. Ryan)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org, #perl on DalNet, #perlmonks on slashnet

  similar:

  rationale:

    My namespace choice is based on what the module does; it shares
    variables between processes locally and/or remotely. First, a
    Shared::Local object is created; it uses a socket-based tcp server
    to store data in memory. From there, Shared::Retriever objects can
    retrieve the variable provided that they have the proper access. The
    reason I picked a root namespace is that the module doesn't really
    have any common qualities that link it with any other module sets.
    In fact, Shared is simply a temporary name; any suggestions of where
    it could properly fit are welcome.

  enteredby:   JRYAN (Joseph F. Ryan)

The resulting entry would be:

Shared            adpOp Shared variables locally and remotely        JRYAN
