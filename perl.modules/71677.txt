The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Decency
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Anti-Spam fighting software suite
  userid:      UKAUTZ (Ulrich Kautz)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It is .. .. is a highly configurable policy server, content filter
    and log parser .. tries to be as easy as possible for the admin
    (YAML configuration) .. implements three different servers which can
    be deployed either on a single system or a distributed network .. is
    a middleware for third party software (spam filter, virus filter)
    and implements build-in checks (DKIM, SPF, Geo weighting,
    associations checks, archiving, DNSBLs, greylisting, whitelisting,
    honeypot, throttling, spam feeding, ..) .. highly modular for easy
    extension

    Namespace: This is not a single module, but a suite of modules
    working together implementing three different servers. It is an
    application / a framework, therefore it requires a separate
    namespace, such as Mail::SpamAssassin or Catalyst. The
    Mail::-prefix-namespace seems fitting to me, cause it is about
    mails. The application is developed using postfix, but it should
    work with any MTA using the postfix policy protocol and/or is
    capable of forwarding mail to another SMTP server (content filter).
    Alternatively Postfix::Decency might fit.

    Uniqueness: There is no module/application/framework on CPAN
    implementing this (besides the log parser part).

    Why it should be on CPAN: It combines two different levels of spam
    fighting (content filter and policy server) whereas other open
    source tools (none on CPAN, but: amavaisd-new, policyd-weight, ..)
    implement only one of those. This approach combines those techniques
    and should achieve a better result in spam recognition. Decency
    follows a strict modular structure, which allows to extend it easily
    via third party developers from CPAN. It is based on existing CPAN
    modules (POE, Moose, Mail::SpamAssasin, Mail::ClamAV, much more).
    There are commercial tools implementing those techniques as well.
    For now, the only developer is me. Being on CPAN, the perl community
    could extend/improve this implementation and help fighting spam.

    Mail::Decency: The name can be discussed, but being a solution
    implementing multiple approaches, something like Mail::ContentFilter
    or Mail::PolicyServer would not fit. Something like Mail::AntiSpam
    or such seems to generic.
