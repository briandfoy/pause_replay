Subject: Module submission Array::AsObject
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, sbeck@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Array::AsObject
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: full set of array/set operations
  userid:      SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Set::ArrayAlt

  rationale:

    This was previously released (unregistered) as Set::ArrayAlt. It
    was suggested by modules@cpan.org that it be renamed to be in the
    Array:: namespace since it doesn't deal strictly with sets.

  enteredby:   SBECK (Sullivan Beck)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 24 12:03:15 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Array::
::AsObject        RdpOp full set of array/set operations             SBECK
