hi all :)

I have a small library for using the captchas.net free captcha service
(http://captchas.net/).  there's not much to it, but it took me enough
digging and code wrangling that nobody else should need to do it again, so
I'd like to upload it to cpan.  I just have no idea where it should live.

my first thought was Net::CaptchasDotNet or somesuch.  anyone have a better
suggestion?
