I am Mr. Amey Konan Bedie the son of former president Henri Konan Bedie of Cote d' Ivorie, who was toppled in a military coup in Dec 1999, where all kinds of allegations were raised over my father's democratically elected government by the military junta of General Robert Guei for misses on the country's funds.

As a result of the coupe, he was forced to go into self-exile in France with members of the family while his close aids ran into several other countries. 

Furthermore, our private investigation revealed that the controversial Government of Mr. Laurent Gbagbo who was in the opposition party when my father was the president of cote d'Ivoire tends to tow the line of Gen.Guei in respect to the seizure of my family's assets and bank accounts. To this effect Mr. Laurent Gbagbo has requested the entire western world to furnish his government with information that will lead to the DISCOVERY/RECOVERY of any bank account Held by my father or his aids.


Switzerland and Luxembourg Government have responded to this, by

US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty Million Dollars) which was deposited into an account belonging to one of my father's companies which I was the director, which has since been deposited to a security finance company for safe keeping in November Of 2000.

It is based on this development that I have the mandate of my father to contact you and request you specifically to assist my family, by 
helping us to secure this fund deposit we have with a financial institution. This will make it impossible for the new Government in power in my country, to have access to this fund. It is also based on this fact that I am requesting you to assist us in putting this sum of money in safe keeping by accepting to receive it from the financial institution on our behalf by changing the name and signatory of the account into yours, so that it will not have any link to my family and for that reason, my country will not find it.
