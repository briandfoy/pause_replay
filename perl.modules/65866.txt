The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Outline::Lua
  DSLIP:       cdhOp
  description: Run Lua code loaded at runtime.
  userid:      ALTREUS (Alastair Douglas)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    irc.freenode.com #perl ;
    http://github.com/Altreus/outline-lua/tree/master

  similar:
    Inline::Lua

  rationale:

    Well I wanted to run user-provided Lua code. Inline::Lua only
    allows for the Lua code to be in the Perl source without a lot of
    trickery (possibly involving POE).

    Since there are a lot of Inline modules that all behave the same,
    there should be a counterpart that all behave a different way - to
    invoke some sort of compiler to "string eval" a different language.

    I was going to call it Eval:: but I thought Outline:: was better.

  enteredby:   ALTREUS (Alastair Douglas)
  enteredon:   Fri May 15 13:54:23 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Outline::
::Lua             cdhOp Run Lua code loaded at runtime.              ALTREUS
