     why:

    A framework for creating massively distributed pipelines across
    many different servers, each using the same google spreadsheet as a
    control panel. It is extensible, and flexible. It does not specify
    what goals any pipeline should be working towards, or which goals
    are prerequisites for other goals, but it does provide logic for
    easily defining these relationships based on your own needs. It does
    this by providing a subsumption architecture, whereby many small,
    highly focused agents are written to perform specific goals, and
    also know what resources they require to perform them. In addition,
    it is designed from the beginning to support the creation of simple
    human-computational workflows.
