The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::7Segment
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: hex and other characters in 7 segment style
  userid:      MANIGREW (Manish Grewal)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module involves making a simple encoding available for
    converting some text characters (e.g hex digits) into other text
    characters(their 7 segment representation). So this was of doing it
    makes it fit under Text::7segment namespace. There is a Tk::LCD
    module which is similar but I think 7segment was more helpful than
    LCD.

  enteredby:   MANIGREW (Manish Grewal)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr  2 20:09:52 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::7Segment        adpOp hex and other characters in 7 segment style  MANIGREW
