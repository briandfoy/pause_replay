the registration will stay since its valid. The reason you got the email
is that there actually is no "HtDig" implementation on CPAN since you
registered it as a general top-level namespace for grouping related
modules. You then uploaded HtDig::Config which doesn't contain a
"HtDig.pm" with a "package HtDig;" inside. Hence, my script deducted
that there is no HtDig.

Best regards,
Steffen
