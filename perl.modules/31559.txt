I agree with Brian. 

It's reasonable, in this case, to limit CPAN entropy with a new module that
differs from Syntax::Highlight::Perl only for 2 lines of code!
Moreover, since I maintain the Apache/mod_perl wrapper around
Syntax::Highlight::Perl, I wouldn't to write also
Apache::Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved! :-)

David: have you tried to contact the author?
