I've just checked and I am not getting the AdminCc mail for TermReadKey
and I don't have the permissions to either add myself as a Watcher or
take the tickets for that queue, is there any way to alter the
maintainer status either in RT or in the modules-list so that I can
access the queue usefully: before RT was upgraded I had full access to
the TermReadKey queue.
