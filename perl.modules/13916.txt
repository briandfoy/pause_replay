I agree. Meta is a name with well established meanings and so isn't
a good choice for a new 'framework' of modules.

Likewise. But if Mark is set on this path then we need to help him
avoid tripping up or distracting others with this work.

Mark, please choose a new top level name for your framework.

You can see from the modules@perl.org archives that we prefer
frameworks to have catchy/funky 'brand names' that are not simple
common words. Using two words is also a good idea. Given the scale
of your project perhaps one of them should be Mega :)

Tim.
