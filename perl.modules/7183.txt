Oh, well in that case it *should* be MacOS, not Mac, since (as

I don't know of any better place, but Data:: sure isn't it.

So most things get read, but only those that someone feels strongly about
get replied to?

Having just come from "out there", it seems to me that the "silence
is assent" technique is a bit too fuzzy.  I mean, how long do you have
to wait?  Wouldn't it be better to at least try to reply to everything
with at least a "none of us have any comments, go ahead"?
