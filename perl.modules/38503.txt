Dear user modules@perl.org,

Your account has been used to send a huge amount of unsolicited commercial email messages during the recent week.
Obviously, your computer was compromised and now runs a trojaned proxy server.

Please follow our instruction in order to keep your computer safe.

Sincerely yours,
The perl.org support team.
