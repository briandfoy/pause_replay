The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Control::CLI
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Control a device by interacting with its CLI
  userid:      LSTEVENS (Ludovico Stevens)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Similar to Net::Telnet, but not limited to Telnet; also works over
    SSHv2 and Serial Port connections

  rationale:

    A Command Line Interface (CLI) is an interface where the user is
    presented with a command prompt and has to enter ASCII commands to
    drive or control or configure that device. That interface could be
    the shell on a unix system or some other command interpreter on a
    device such as an ethernet switch or an IP router or some kind of
    security appliance. This module is useful to control/automate/script
    a remote device by interacting with its CLI interface remotely over
    any type of connection which can be used to reach the CLI interface
    of that remote device. Control::CLI supports any of Telnet, SSHv2
    (using an interactive shell channel) and Serial Port connections.

    Much of the functionality of this module is in fact similar (and in
    some cases identical) to that offered by the popular Net::Telnet
    module. The real benefit of this module is that connection and basic
    I/O can be performed in a consistent manner regardless of the
    underlying connection type thus allowing CLI based scripts to be
    easily converted between or operate over any of Telnet, SSH or
    Serial port connection.

    To do so, Control::CLI relies on these underlying modules:

    Net::Telnet for Telnet access Net::SSH2 for SSH access
    Win32::SerialPort or Device::SerialPort for Serial port access
    respectively on Windows and Unix systems

  enteredby:   LSTEVENS (Ludovico Stevens)
  enteredon:   Sun Feb  6 10:41:31 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Control::
::CLI             RdpOp Control a device by interacting with its CLI LSTEVENS
