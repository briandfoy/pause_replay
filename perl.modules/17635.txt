Greetings:

Let me start by saying I know you guys have day jobs as well, but I have to
wonder if I'm following the right procedure on getting modules registered on
CPAN.  My last couple of attempts appear to be failing miserably.

First off, my understanding about namespace registration was to submit the
standard form and wait for feedback.  I did that with Parse::PlainConfig.  As
per 04pause.html:

  The module list maintainers themselves are mostly lurkers. You need not wait
  for a response. Generally a lack of response can be taken as acceptance of
  the module name being proposed.

I want to point out that Parse::PlainConfig as a name was actually proposed by
one of list maintainers.  I accepted the recommendation, and based on the
04pause.html doc, thought that module was accepted for inclusion.

A month ago, I find out from brian d foy that my module was *never* registered
officially on CPAN, and yet I've already polluted that namespace.  And since
he's opposed to the name, I know I have no chance of getting it registered
under that name.

Fast forward to the last few weeks.  I have a new module that I'd like to
register (Class::Aggregate).  I'll warrant that I didn't fully research out my
options before proposing it (and I thank all of you that pointed me in the
right direction), but since then I've found that none of the existing modules
a) fit my feature criterion, and b) can easily be combined with other modules
to do so without considerable overhead, either.

After some discussion, at least one of you seemed open to having it uploaded
to CPAN, but wanted a name change.  I can't think of anything better, so I
took a recommendation from you guys, once again.

What I'm finding is that even if I accept your recommendations, that namespace
is *still* not officially registered on CPAN, nor can I update module
metadata via the pause interface.

I'm loathe to upload anything you guys don't approve of out of respect for the
archive.  I don't want to hijack any namespace that the community doesn't feel
is appropriate.

So, what am I doing wrong?  Can I get modules registered, or am I just
supposed to go away?  I apologise if any of you feel that I'm being a pain in
the ass.  Either tell me to go away (which I will comply with), or give me a
procedure that will work.
