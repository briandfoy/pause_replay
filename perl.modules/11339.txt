Dear Sir/Madam,

I have uploaded a small module to CPAN. I did not read documentation
carefully, so I choose a wrong namespace for my module. It is named UniLog
and uploaded to the root directory.

Could you please advice me the correct place for my module. The module
itself "...provides an unified way to send log messages on Unix and Win32.
Messages are logged using syslog on Unix and using EventLog on Win32."

Thank you very much.

With best regards,
Daniel Podolsky
