Generally speaking, you don't get a top-level namespace without a very
compelling reason.

Given the purpose of the modules, I think Lingo ought to be in the name.
And since Lingo is specific to a proprietary product, that also ought
to be in the name (thus ruling out Director and Multimedia, as being
too general).  And the Macromedia namespace might be considered to be
reserved a priori by the company.  That leaves Shockwave::Lingo.
