Hi PAUSE admins,

According to http://filippo.io/Heartbleed/#pause.perl.org, pause.perl.org
is running a version of openssl that is vulnerable to the heartbleed
exploit.  I would recommend bringing the server(s) down immediately, and
updating all relevant libraries ASAP.

(It might also be a good idea to contact everyone who has uploaded a
distribution since the exploit became public, to advise them to change
their passwords.)
