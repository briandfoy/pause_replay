The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::IDMEF
  DSLIP:       bdpOb
  description: interface for building IDMEF messages
  userid:      ERWAN (Erwan Lemonnier)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    IDMEF stands for Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format and is
    defined in a new rfc (http://www.silicondefense.com/idwg/). It is an
    XML based message format, and about to become a widespread standard
    for encoding alerts from security products.

    There are already a couple of apis written in C and java to easily
    build IDMEF messages, but non in perl, hence this new module.

    IDMEF.pm is a wrapper around an XML::Simple hash, and is
    implemented as a generic XML DTD parser, creating api calls based on
    the DTD parsed at module load time. It sounds hence natural to put
    it in the XML namespace. I did not see any subcategory of XML that
    could include IDMEF, so I assume XML::IDMEF is a reasonable
    choice...

    This module is going to be especially usefull to people who are
    developing quick scripts to export log data from a security software
    to some database or managed security service monitoring tool. For
    better spreading, I would of course prefer to list it in the module
    list, but I leave it up to you to decide if it is indeed worth it!

    Best regards,

    /erwan in the module list!

The resulting entry would be:
