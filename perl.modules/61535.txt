The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Out
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Test::Builder application for testing output
  userid:      LDAVIS (Lane Davis)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Men's bathroom wall, psychics, water cooler

  similar:
    Test::Output

  rationale:

    My rationale for using Test::Out is that it's a Test module, and
    tests output. Besides that it reminds me "Freak Out" by Avril
    Lavigne (if you sing it like the 80's song).

    Other than that you might know the old saying about how necessity
    is sometimes the mother of invention except I wasn't the mother but
    more like the second cousin once removed. Anyway, the module was
    useful for testing the output to a file by an object oriented module
    that called a SUPER parent class that I didn't want to bother
    stubbing since I figured there was a better way to do it.

    This might only work on UNIX systems, since I have no idea if Win32
    systems support a notion of dup(2) or fstat(2).

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Out             bdpOg Test::Builder application for testing output LDAVIS
