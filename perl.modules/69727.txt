     why:

    I learned perl at first when I was freshman student of univ(about
    10 years ago) in that time, I was just use a perl as a great tool
    for my works. I had no interest about perl cultures or perl
    community(aka perl mongers) but as time goes by, I've been fully
    fascinated by perl's own unique culture and community then powerful
    feature and I met many good peoples by perl mongers - SEOUL.pm /
    #perl-kr@freenode.org ( such as AERO,JEEN,KEEDI )

    so, I'd like to be a not just user but member of community. and I
    want to contribute my effort on some CPAN modules.( for now, I have
    interest about database abstraction modules - such as SQL::Abstract,
    DBIx::Simple, DBIx::Class )

    I majored Management Information Systems and Computer Science at
    university and I'm majoring Health-care Information Systems at
    graduate school and working at HIS field.

    thanks
