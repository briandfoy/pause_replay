Hi,

I noticed that some users have a CENSORED email address. E.g. RIDDLE,
ROGERHALL. Effectively, these users are not contactable. Is that
intentional?

=====

I wonder if it would be a good idea to slightly modify the
authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred form.

 * Publicly visible email address (published in many listings)

 -> Publicly visible email address (published in many listings). If
 -> you leave this empty, PAUSE will use your CPAN email,
 -> yourid@cpan.org (see below). 

 * Secret email address only used by the PAUSE, never published.
 * If you leave this field empty, PAUSE will use the public email
 * address for communicating with you.

 -> Your real email address only used by the PAUSE, never published.
 -> You *must* supply a valid and functional email address or we will
 -> not be able to reach you. Do *not* use your CPAN email,
 -> yourid@cpan.org here. Do not forget to update it here if you
 -> change your email address.

 * cpan.org has a mail address for you and it's your choice if you
 * want it to point to your public email address or to your secret one.
 * [ ... ]

 * [ ] my public email addressmy  [ ]secret email address [ ] neither nor

 -> [ ] my public email addressmy  [ ]secret email address

Just some suggestions.
