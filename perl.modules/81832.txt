The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Openmake
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface for Openmake build and job tools
  userid:      SBLANTON (Sean Blanton)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    mailinglists, chatrooms, github

  similar:
    ClearCase::*, SVN::*, CVS::*

  rationale:

    It seems y'all are moving to put 3rd party tool
    interfaces/integrators/wrappers under the App:: namespace, so again
    I'm gunning for that one. My first inclination was "OpenmakeX::*",
    since Openmake Software distributes Perl code under the "Openmake"
    namespace.

    This is a pretty straightforward module that will wrapper and
    enhance the functionality of Openmake's job scheduler and build tool
    (as in compiling Java, C and .NET code). Currently those products
    are Mojo and Meister. Since the product branding may change, I think
    Openmake is safe. It will depend on my previously proposed
    "App::Services::" services, wherever that ends up.

    Thanks

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Openmake        adpOp Interface for Openmake build and job tools   SBLANTON
