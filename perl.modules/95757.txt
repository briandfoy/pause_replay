     why:

    I'm a professional Perl Developer and still constantly work with
    CPAN modules which are sometimes outdated and have a long standing
    list of unresolved tickets. I'd like to contribute and start
    resolving some of them as they are also affecting our inhouse
    development and that would also in turn provide updated features for
    the community.

    Thanks, Tom
