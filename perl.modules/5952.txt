The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::CacheDir
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: auto ttl-based file cleanup without a cron
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    None I know of, perhaps Dir::Purge

  rationale:

    Used for file management so File:: is a good place for it. Got
    tired of worrying about a cron to do cleanup for me, and going back
    a couple months after launch to see that I never did cleanup where I
    had planned to. Works very well for session hash stuff, or file back
    up. Can also be given code refs to do things slightly different from
    the norm.

  enteredby:   EARL (Earl Cahill)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun  1 21:19:14 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::CacheDir        cdpOp auto ttl-based file cleanup without a cron   EARL
