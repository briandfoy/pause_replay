The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::YAPassGen
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Yet Another pronounceable Password Generator
  userid:      GIULIENK (Giulio Motta)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Crypt::PassGen Crypt::GeneratePassword Crypt::RandPasswd

  rationale:

    Crypt::YAPassGen allows you to generate pronounceable passwords
    using a frequency file extracted from a dictionary of words. This
    module was inspired by Crypt::PassGen written by Tim Jenness. I
    started writing this module a couple of years ago, because I wasn't
    able to make Crypt::PassGen work with an Italian frequency file. I
    then lost it on my hard drive and when I found it a few days ago I
    decided to write some tests and documentation to release it on CPAN.
    This module also offers a different OO interface and a few more
    options than Crypt::PassGen, that's why it exists. The namespace is
    choosen because there are already various modules doing the same
    tasks so this is Yet Another take on the same problem, TIMTOWTDI.
