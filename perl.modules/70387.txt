     why:

    I'd like to contribute a WWW::Gallery::Remote module providing
    access to remote API of Gallery
    (http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery_Remote:Protocol).

    There is already an existing Gallery::Remote module but it wasn't
    updated since 5 years and doesn't work with Gallery 2 and also
    doesn't have very good API, tests or documentation.

    P.S. This is a repost of a previous request (see
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2009-12/msg00349.html)
    which was apparently lost. I'm resubmitting this as recommended by
    Adam Kennedy.
