Address it how exactly?

There's no such concept as "unauthorized" for a dev release. Dev releases
don't go into the index, so positions don't apply to them.

If you have a problem with the behaviour of Graham Barr's search.cpan codebase
you'd need to get in touch with him; nobody else has access to it.
