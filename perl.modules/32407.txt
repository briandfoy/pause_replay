The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IDN::Encode
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Encoding/Decoding of IDNs
  userid:      CFAERBER (Claus A. Färber)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::LibIDN, IDNA::Punycode

  rationale:

    The "Net::IDN::Encode" module provides an easy-to-use interface for
    Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).

    While IDNA::Punycode and Net::IDN::Nameprep implement all the basic
    algorithms needed for IDNs, they do not provide functions which can
    do all of the work necessary to encode or decode domain names with a
    single function call.

    "Net::IDN::Encode" also handles email addresses as-is, extracting
    the domain name as necessary. It is planned to handle the local-part
    in the future (when there is a standard for i18nized local-parts).

    The handling of other types of names or addresses which use an
    ASCII-compatible encoding similar (or identical?) to IDNA's or which
    embed domain names (e.g. newsgroup names, LDAP common names) is also
    planned.

    The functionality provided by domain_to_ascii and domain_to_unicode
    is similar to "Net::LibIDN"'s idn_to_ascii and idn_to_unicode
    functions. However, Net::IDN::Encode does not rely on an external
    library and integrates better with perl's Unicode/UTF-8 support.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::IDN::
