The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GSM::PDU
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: ETSI - GSM PDU codec - generator and parser
  userid:      TECHCODE (Aleksandar Petrović)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    not yet

  similar:
    http://search.cpan.org/~johanvdb/GSM-SMS-0.162/lib/GSM/SMS/PDU.pm

  rationale:

    This is going to be the initial release (version 0.01) of the
    GSM::PDU module. It's the implementation of the PDU encode/decode
    standard as defined by the ETSI.

    Nicely explained here: http://www.dreamfabric.com/sms/

    Other similar modules didn't have all the PDU types generation and
    parsing that I needed. GSM::SMS::PDU is the most complete yet
    missing SMSDeliver encoding (has just decoding) and was otherwise
    not maintained since 2004 just like other modules of the same
    author.

    GSM::PDU is implemented from scratch - low level SMS_DELIVER
    generation is already done and it generates correct PDU data -
    higher level that doesn't expect from you to know all the details is
    being finished.

    Possible addition is a way to convert the widely used (cheap and
    free as it uses regular Internet IP) SMPP protocol (implemented via
    Net::SMPP) into PDU format - and maybe even the other way around -
    but will wait for feedback from people.

The resulting entry would be:
