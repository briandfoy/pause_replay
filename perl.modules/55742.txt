All,
Sorry for the delay, but as discussed earlier(see below), I am now a PAUS=
E author and have uploaded a new version of the 'NTLM' package as v1.03 (=
 https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/B/BU/BUZZ/ ). This is to rep=
lace the version 1.02 that was aparently abandoned by it's author, and ha=
s been unchanged since 2001.  =20

This seems too easy.  Is there nothing else I have to do other than uploa=
d the revised file?

Buzz.

Yep, that's everything you need to do. :)
