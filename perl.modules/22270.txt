Sorry, we were in the process of handing off maintainership of
"Text::Capitalize", but we've made a mistake and gotten ourselves 
stuck.  Is there some way we can get "Text::Capitalize" assigned 
to the PAUSE id DOOM?  Or possibly just reverted back to SYP,
so Stanislaw can try again?

Oooops... It seems that I clicked the wrong button :)

Now I am co-mantainer of Text::Capitalize but no one is
primary mantainer! So I do not have permissions to add you
as co-mantainer and neither to put myself back as primary
mantainer... Please take a look at your PAUSE account if you
could associate Text::Capitalize to yourself, if it's
impossible I think that the only way is to mail PAUSE
guys...
