The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::ECML
  DSLIP:       anpnp
  description: Implements RFC 3106
  userid:      KITTY (Ben Evans)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    ECML is the Ecommerce Modelling Language - a simple description of
    general ecommerce transactions as designed by Motorola, IBM and
    various banks and credit merchants.

    Having a perl module available which can validate (and generate, in
    conjunction with CGI.pm) form data according to this open standard
    will be of help to those building ecommerce websites.

    It belongs in the WWW (or possibly the CGI) namespace asit is of
    interest only to those doing ecommerce, and it is not complex enough
    to warrant more than a single module in someone elses' namespace.

  enteredby:   KITTY (Ben Evans)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 17 12:03:46 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::ECML            anpnp Implements RFC 3106                          KITTY
