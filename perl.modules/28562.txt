The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::TieBucketBrigade
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Ties a filehandle to a bucket brigade
  userid:      MOCK (mock)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This modules simplifies building mod_perl protocol handlers by
    tying a bucket brigade to a filehandle and presenting as an
    IO::Handle object. This allows one to use Apache and mod_perl as a
    daemon framework, and use any other protocol module which will read
    and write to IO::Handles or Filehandles in a handler I think it
    should be in the Apache namespace because it is essentially a
    mod_perl module, and that's where all the other mod_perl bits seem
    to live. To my knowledge no other module does anything like this.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::TieBucketBrigade bdpOp Ties a filehandle to a bucket brigade        MOCK
