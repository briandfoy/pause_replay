The CPAN package index (ie. 02packages.details.txt.gz) currently list
many modules as being inside perl distributions.  For example:

Data::Dumper                      2.102  G/GS/GSAR/perl-5.6.1.tar.gz

as a result, the CPAN shell tries to download perl for you when you
ask 'install Data::Dumper'.  Even worse, it leaves you not knowing
that there is an independent tarball version of it.

I submit that the CPAN index should prefer the independent tarball
version of a module over the perl distribution *even if it is of an
older version*.

For example, Data::Dumper would read:

Data::Dumper                      2.101  G/GS/GSAR/Data-Dumper-2.101.tar.gz


Ok, why?  Consider the following scenarios.

5.6.1 user, which has version 2.102, types "install Data::Dumper".

Currently they get "Data::Dumper is up to date" and under the new
scheme they'll get the same thing.  So that's good.


5.005_03 user, which has 2.101, types "install Data::Dumper".

Currently, CPAN tries to install perl 5.6.1 for them!  Well
that's not very helpful.

Under the new scheme, they're told Data::Dumper is up to date.  Which
while not technically true, it's as up-to-date as they can get without
updating Perl.  And they don't have to stop CPAN from trying to
install perl.


5.004_05 user, which didn't come with Data::Dumper at all.

Currently, CPAN tries to install 5.6.1 for them!  Again, not useful.

Under the new scheme, Data::Dumper 2.101 is installed for them.  Which
is useful!  They've got Data::Dumper, which is what they set out to
do.


Digging down even deeper is the 5.003_07 user.

Currently, it tries to upgrade perl.

Under the new scheme, it grabs Data::Dumper 2.101, but the tests fail.
Which is fine.


Consider even further this.  I release a module which has a PREREQ_PM
on Data::Dumper.  It otherwise works fine on a stock 5.004_05
installation.  5.004_05 user downloads my module from CPAN.

Currently, CPAN tries to install perl 5.6.1 for them.  Not helpful,
and it probably means the module doesn't get installed.

Under the new scheme, Data::Dumper 2.101 is installed as the prereq
and the new module gets installed smoothly.
