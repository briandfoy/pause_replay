The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::XSB
  DSLIP:       bdhfp
  description: Interface to XSB programming language
  userid:      SALVA (Salvador Fandiño García)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There was two possible choices for the module name:

    Language::Prolog::XSB Language::XSB

    I prefer the second one because:

    - XSB is based in Prolog but is not strictly Prolog and XSB authors
    don't like to have XSB referred as a Prolog system. -
    Language::Prolog::XSB is too long, and as the module itself has
    other nested packages inside, their names become even longer.

    - I don't think Language::XSB could collide with any other module.

    - Salva

The resulting entry would be:

Language::
::XSB             bdhfp Interface to XSB programming language        SALVA
