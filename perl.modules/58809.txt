Well, without necessarily making an argument either way, the=20
rationale was something like this:

The module is primarily the implementation of a network protocol=20
=E2=80=94 albeit a proprietary one =E2=80=94 and not any extended interface=
=20
to the application (Halo) as such. The Halo game server=20
distinguishes between the status protocol (number of players,=20
per-player score, gametype, map, etc.) and the actual=20
client/server protocol used when you actually play the game or=20
administer the server (i.e. the =E2=80=9Crcon=E2=80=9D protocol). There are=
=20
also many things one may wish to do with a Halo client or=20
server, that aren't directly network related.

Thus I figured this belonged in Net::*.

A new top level namespace entry for Halo::* seemed excessive.=20
There is potential for a future Net::Halo::Rcon, and an overall=20
Net::Halo namespace. The status and rcon protocols are also both=20
quite similar (but not identical) to various other game servers=20
(Quake, etc.) which opens the possibility of a Game::Status=20
module, or Net::Game::Status module, which uses protocol plugins=20
ala Net::Halo::Status.

All in all, that led me to Net::Halo::Status.


On the other hand, I don't particularly feel strongly about this=20
so if you think Halo::Status would be better I'm not in any way=20
opposed to changing the name.

Interviewer: =E2=80=9CIn what language do you write your algorithms?=E2=80=
=9D
     Abigail: English.
