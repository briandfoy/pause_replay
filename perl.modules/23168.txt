Hi!

I already sent this to upload@pause.perl.org, but probably it was the
wrong address to send to, so I'm forwarding it here as well. Please
excuse me in advance if I'm duplicating the message.

I am PAUSE user ARTHAS and I have a problem with the upload of:

Net-C6Term-0.10.tar.gz

the file is uploaded and CPAN shows it. However, in "Recent Files" the
link to it is broken, and if I search it it displays among the results,
but in a weird manner:

Net::C6Term
ARTHAS

There's ARTHAS instead of the module description, and the download link
is missing at all.

Did I do something wrong? This is my first upload to CPAN.

	Thank you, Michele.
