Hello,

I have a toolkit of perl modules I would like to publish on CPAN.   Please 
register me as an author.  My information is below:

Name: Brent Henry
Email: bshenry@hotmail.com
Preferred UserID: BSHENRY

The main thing I want to publish is a toolkit which allows you to do complex 
system monitoring of servers, networking, or just about anything and roll it 
all into a nice customizeable Big-Brother type of web interface, with 
alarms, logs, histories, etc.
