That would have been a lot easier, but I have no idea if the Django people have any plans for perl at all or are even interested.

Well DTL should stand for Django Template Language. But as I said, I can't call it that.

Django is a MVC-Framework, with Database interfaces, Object-to-relational Models, a dispatcher and also a template language. 
I'm only implementing the template lanuage, and that by specification. So every template working in Django has to work in mine too.  You could say they are both the same features in different programming lanuages. Similar to JPython and CPython if you want.

>I don't have a better suggestion at the moment.

That is the whole problem, it is just about the name, nothing else.

How about "Dotiac" : DjangO Template Interpreter And Compiler? That could serve as a name and a abbreviation. besides there is neither www.dotiac.com, www.dotiac.info, www.dotiac.org nor www.dotiac.net.
I'm gonna ask the django people about this.
