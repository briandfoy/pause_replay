Sorry for answering late.

Business::OnlinePayment::HTTPS is available from CPAN, but only as part 
of a developer release. Developer releases are those distributions with 
an underscore in their version number. They are not indexed by PAUSE and 
thus not available as dependencies from CPAN.pm. This is intentional.

You can force installing the a developer version by specifying it's path 
and name on CPAN:

   install IVAN/Business-OnlinePayment-3.00_09.tar.gz

The appropriate way to fix this is a non-developer release. I added Ivan 
to the recipients because the developer release is his.

Best regards,
Steffen
