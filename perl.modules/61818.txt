It turns out that you reached a code branch that doesn't trigger email
being sent. The reason was that your tarball has an anomaly which
manifests like so:

  % gzip -t /home/ftp/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/J/JP/JPIERCE/CGI-Imagemap-2.00.tgz               

  gzip: /home/ftp/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/J/JP/JPIERCE/CGI-Imagemap-2.00.tgz: decompression OK, trailing garbage ignored

Normally pause rewrites such tarballs to prevent unnecessary
bugreports but the code doing so was not activated for files with the
suffix ".tgz". This is fixed now, so in the future if you upload
tarballs with this defect, they will be rewritten on the fly by pause.

Could you please try to upgrade your tar installation and upload
another tarball?

Thanks & sorry for the inconvenience,
