Subject: Module submission Exception::Lite

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Exception::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: OOP exception w/ smart stacktrace,localizatn
  userid:      ELISHEVA (Elizabeth Grace Frank-Backman)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perl Monks

  similar:
    Exception::Class Exception::Base Carp

  rationale:

    The choice of namespace was made after discussion on Perl Monks
    (see "RFC: A better name for an exception handling module?",
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=878578 )

    There is an extensive discussion of how Exception::Lite fits into
    the set of exception handling modules both in that Perl Monks post
    and the pod for Exception::Lite

    In brief:

    * message - property integration - I believe this is the only
    exception handling module that uses programmer defined combinations
    of property values to generate messages.

    * localization support - message generation rules can be loaded via
    a closure or code reference, including a routine that checks locale
    - see Exception::Lite pod for discussion and examples

    * chaining - exceptions can be chained together (a la Java) to
    create a consolidated stack trace. None of the more prominent
    modules (i.e. those found via a search for Distributions on
    exceptions) support this.

    * smarter stack trace that puts the exception into the context of
    its subroutine call and what called what without clutter - nearly
    all existing modules base their stack tracing on Carp which focuses
    on the problematic line itself rather than the context surrounding
    it.

    * more comprehensive command line control. While several modules
    offer some degree of command line control, Exception::Lite provides
    more control (filtering and tab width as well as verbosity)

    * core modules only - a low level feature like exceptions shouldn't
    drag in the world (an issue with Exception::Class)

    * preservation of operator semantics - operator overrides do not
    interfere with reference equality (==). (This is an issue with
    Exception::Base which tries to address the dependency issue of
    Exception::Class)

The resulting entry would be:

Exception::
