Hi and welcome to The Straight Dope Mailing List, a weekly
bulletin from Straight Dope World HQ. We've got several 
departments, including Cecil's current weekly column, Straight 
Dope classics, staff reports by the Straight Dope Science 
Advisory Board, the latest from Weird Earl's, and whatever 
else we feel like throwing in. The mailing will offer a 
sampling of what's new at the Straight Dope this week and 
provide links so you can get the full text for any item that 
interests you.
 
Should you ever decide you'd like to leave the list, 
unsubscribe instructions will be included in every mailing
we send to you.  In addition, there will be a link at our
website at http://www.straightdope.com where you can change
your email address, put your account on hold, or unsubscribe.

We put together a mailing every Friday (usually) and our
friends at jokeaday.com send it out for free. Help us maintain 
this attractive financial arrangement by visiting 
www.jokeaday.com and saying what a nice site they have, how 
handsome Ray (the proprietor) looks today, etc. We know we 
can count on you.

Thanks for joining us!
