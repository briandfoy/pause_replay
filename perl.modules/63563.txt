Yes, I just didn't want to create a new root namespace "Django" just for 
a small template module, since I don't plan to convert the complete 
Django project to perl. (I'm not that mad)

My first idea was Template::Django, but the Template namespace is used 
by Template::Toolkit and I didn't want to create any confusion there.

Yes you can you use it for other files, every thing text based in fact, 
but it is mostly used for HTML.

Well I have no other idea on what to call it, so I'm open to suggestions.
