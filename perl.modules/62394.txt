In the process of registering PDL::Graphics::POGL,
it was suggested that some alternatives would be
better descriptive or helpful to users.  Thanks
to Steffen Mueller for the ideas.  Here is an
expanded set of alternatives with some thoughts:


(1) PDL::Graphics::POGL
    * the requested name space
    * indicates PDL::Graphics stuff
    * parallel with PDL::Graphics::TriD
    * POGL is Perl OpenGL
      * replaces PDL::Graphics::OpenGL
      * refactoring of TriD



(2) PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::POGL
    * indicates PDL::Graphics::OpenGL stuff
    * parallel with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL:OO
    * POGL is Perl OpenGL
      * replaces PDL::Graphics::OpenGL
      * not so clear on the TriD connection



(3) PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::PP
    * indicates PDL::Graphics::OpenGL stuff
    * parallel with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL:OO
    * PP might cause confusion with PDL::PP



(4) PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl
    * indicates PDL::Graphics::OpenGL stuff
    * parallel with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL:OO
    * Perl is not bad, but POGL seems better and more
        specific: this is PDL::Graphics::OpenGL stuff
        using POGL (i.e. Perl OpenGL bindings)



(5) PDL::Graphics::POpenGL
    * indicates PDL::Graphics stuff
    * parallel with PDL::Graphics::TriD
    * I prefer POGL better than POpenGL



(6) PDL::Graphics::PerlOpenGL
    * indicates relation to PDL::Graphics::OpenGL
    * may be difficult to get CaMeLcAsE right
    * I still prefer POGL to PerlOpenGL



(7) PDL::Graphics::TriD::POGL
    * does not parallel existing PDL::Graphics name spaces
    * POGL supports 2D graphics and interactive, not just 3D
    * has TriD and POGL in it (two potential sources of confusion)


After looking at them all, I actually think I
may now prefer (2) to the original suggestion for
because the main thrust of the initial TriD work
*is* to use POGL to replace PDL::Graphics::OpenGL
functionality.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this matter
since I would like the new name space to best
represent PDL excellence.

I'm willing to register the namespace for you as is, but I thought maybe
any of the following would be significantly more descriptive. What do
you think? The namespaces aren't *that* long.

PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl
PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::PP (for "pure-perl" -- maybe not)
PDL::Graphics::POpenGL
PDL::Graphics::PerlOpenGL

Let me know whether any one of those is acceptable or whether you
absolutely prefer your originally requested name.

Best regards,
Steffen
