There are several of us who handle abandoned modules. We feed for them
and care for them until they find homes. I've personally done this with
several key Perl modules. I've been doing that as a PAUSE service for
years.

As I recall, Sven originally mentioned that he wasn't sure about Matt
because he didn't recognize his name. I can vouch for him; perhaps
you'll recognize my name from the cover of several Perl books, many
magazine articles, etc, etc.

If you (Sven) don't want any of this hassle, you can just give me the
word and you won't have to think about it anymore, it will be in
capable hands, and the world will be in a much better place. You can
abandon the FCGI module, but that doesn't leave the FCGI module
abandoned. I'd glady manage the maintenance myself.

Thanks,
