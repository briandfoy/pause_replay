It may sound weird, but it has historical reasons: MakeMaker looks
into the MY namespace and handles subroutines there as if they had
been written in its own namespace so that your subroutine
MY::postamble will be executed. Its return value will end up in the
Makefile. So all you do is write something like

sub MY::postamble {
        return "# See me in the Makefile\n";
}

in your Makefile.PL

The latter. But mind you, I have no solution for that, just the
recommendation that you let the users decide where they prefer the
files installed. A safer default place might be ~/.http-webtest.
