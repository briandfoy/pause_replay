Subject: Module submission CGI::Auth::Simple

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Auth::Simple
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: simple form-based unsessioned authentication
  userid:      OPIATE (Shane Allen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Session::Auth::DBI CGI::Auth::Basic CGI::Ex::Auth
    CGI::Builder::Auth

  rationale:

    This module is similar in functionality to a large number of other
    modules, however it has significant differences from each.

    It is unsessioned, which differentiates it from all of the
    CGI::Session::Auth* modules.

    It works against a database, which differentiates it from all the
    CGI::Auth* modules that I looked at.

    It doesn't require the use of any framework like the
    CGI::Builder::Auth* module(s) imply.

    It is extremely low-overhead and very easy to use, which
    differentiates it from the CGI::Ex::Auth module, which requires
    functions to be written and passed in as hooks.

    All in all, it's a simple DB-backed forms-based pre-emptive auth
    module that can sit in front of most any web app that I can imagine.

    Additionally, I've tested it pretty thoroughly, and it hasn't
    failed me yet; whereas several of the other Auth modules that I
    tried to use before I wrote this one seemed to have significant
    issues with their documented functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Auth::
::Simple          RdpOp simple form-based unsessioned authentication OPIATE
