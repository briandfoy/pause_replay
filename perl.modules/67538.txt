Subject: Module submission Net::FluidDB

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::FluidDB
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A Perl interface to FluidDB
  userid:      FXN (Xavier Noria)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    fluiddb-users

  similar:

  rationale:

    Net::FluidDB is a Perl interface to FluidDB.

    FluidDB is a hosted database accessible through a REST API. I think
    the Net:: root namespace is a good choice because of that. There's
    no other Perl module targetting FluidDB that I know of at this
    moment.

    I guessed the chapter for databases would be appropriate, but could
    choose it, so I went with networking. It is a bit more general but
    it is fine.

    The module is quite complete and well tested for a first release,
    it is yet marked as alpha because it lacks proper documentation and
    would like to add a few more convenience methods before removing the
    alpha label.

    Cheers, and thanks for maintaining CPAN.
