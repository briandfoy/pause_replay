Ladies and Gentlemen,

considerable chemistry enterprises search for logistic solutions, in order to place 
their products economically on the market.

Other enterprises already found these solutions.

Store products in and out of production directly into containers, fixed on
our specific frames, and stationed into the field.

With this storage frame system, you displace containers easily by means of a chassis only.
For lowcost inplant stationing.

In the second mail you can find some details of the function of the Container Master storage frames.
