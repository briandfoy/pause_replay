Hi Johan,

Oooops ...

Yes, I think a renaming / clarification is quite necessary !

I think I'll rename it to Postbank_de (supposing that the .nl Postbank is at
Postbank_nl) - since opening a whole DE::-tree just for german banks ...
Hmmm - dosen't sound that bad either. I'll consider renaming it and I'll
also discuss this on Perlmonks, and then I'll decide :-)

Thanks,
