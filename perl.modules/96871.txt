Greetings all,
This will be my first submission to CPAN.  I had a name in mind, but it was
already taken.  Am struggling to find an effective replacement.

This is the idea behind the module:  You need a set of dates for a
regularly scheduled report - monthly, weekly, quarterly, etc.  Rather than
having to do all the calculations yourself, you'd send this code the
pertinent parameters, "type => MONTH, intervals => 1", and it would return
the start/end dates for, "one month back".  In January 2017, it would
return the start/end dates for the month of December, 2016.  If "intervals"
is changed to, 2, 3, 4, it would return the dates for November, October,
September, etc.

The same can be done for weeks, years, and quarters.  In the case of weeks,
you can specify the day of the week that indicates "first day of week",
usually Sunday or Monday, but all seven days are supported.  For yearly,
the starting month of the year can be specified, such as for fiscal years
which start in April/July/October.  For monthly, first-date-of-month can
also be specified, if for example, someone has a monthly billing cycle
running from the 16th through the 15th.

My initial thought was, "Date::Range" but that is already in use.  My next
thought was, "Date::Range::Endpoints.

Any helpful feedback/ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Terry
