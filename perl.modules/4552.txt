Dear Sir/Madam,

I'd like to register a namespace on CPAN for an alpha project I am
currently working on. I'm pretty sure that there would be some
demand/interest within the community (although I have not had my work
discussed publically before)...

name : Gully Burns
email : gully@usc.edu
homepage : http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~gully,

see http://riposte.usc.edu/kmrg/insecureStuff/projects/vpdb.htm
for an example of project work on sourceforge (which has been largely
superceded by the currently proposed work)

preferred userID: GULLY

Basic description:

pUML (pron. 'pummel').

Object oriented UML support for PERL based on Rational Rose's REI
interface. Upload facilities from Rose (using OLE) will be combined with
ODBC links to provide engineering capabilities to and from different
database and object oriented programming applications (including Perl,
XML, ODBC, JDBC).

DSLI: cmpO
(not sure I fully understand what 'support level' means here)

Thanks, I look forward to putting something back into the community that
has helped me so much in the past.

Gully
