            This affects your MARC/XML releases. It looks like this is
            what happened in the past:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>User BBIRTH first released the distribution MARC-XML,
              which contained the module MARC::XML</li>
            <li>User ESUMMERS took over the distribution, and renamed
              the MARC::XML module to be MARC::File::XML, and added

              name renamed MARC-XML.</li>

            <li>Then in 2017 you renamed the distribution to be
