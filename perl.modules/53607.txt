Rob,

I emailed you around 3 months ago with patch for Cache::FastMmap and
native Win32 support, where you said:

Seems like you never got round to it - so in the iterests of relasing
the code, I will be asking for temporary co-maint if you dont reply by
the end of the month (31st March - two weeks)

Hope to hear from you soon.

Ash
