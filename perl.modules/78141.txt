Subject: MIDI::Tab package orphaned but in need of patching

Hello,

I would like to assume control over (or be granted co-maintainer
privileges for) the MIDI::Tab package.  I have a couple simple but
crucial patches for it, but the author is no longer reachable (as the
bounce notice below shows).

If this is not the correct way to ask for this, would you point me in
the right direction (like poking a PAUSE admin, possibly)?

Thank you,

Hi Rob,

I read in the docs how one can add other general MIDI percussion
patches to %drum_notes, but when I went to do so, I discovered that
this variable is not actually accessible. =A0If you change the lexical
"my %drum_notes" to "our %drum_notes", it can be modified, as
described in the package documentation.

Thanks,
