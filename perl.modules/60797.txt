Without even looking I can say, yes, if you generate lib.pm at
runtime, the indexer cannot index it. Would you be able to provide a
META.yml with the provides field? The intent was: if this is there,
then the indexer does not get triggered at all and the META.yml wins.

I sse you're using MakeMaker which does not provide support for "provides".

I remember that there is a workaround around this limitation. I used it here:

              ($ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION >= 6.3002 ?
               (EXTRA_META => <<EMETA,
repository: "https://pause.perl.org:5460/svn/cpanpm/trunk"
EMETA
               ) : ()),

Ugly as hell, but works. I took it from RT ticket 30098.
