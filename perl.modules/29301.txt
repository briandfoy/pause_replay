This email is a follow-up to my emails of March 4th and 5th, all 
having the same email subject.  Have a look at them to see the 
context for what I say here.

I am writing to let any interested parties know what I actually did 
do concerning the matters I asked about, where there were several 
instances of multiple package declarations within a single module. 
The modules in question were: Locale::KeyedText, SQL::SyntaxModel, 
Rosetta.

1. I removed all of the "::_::" from the package names that contained 
it, so for example SQL::SyntaxModel::_::Node became 
SQL::SyntaxModel::Node.

2. I removed the obfuscation so all of the package names not get indexed.

3. Any "*::Shared" private packages were removed as their own 
package, and merged into the module name-sake package.

4. I added a documentation section called CLASSES IN THIS MODULE just 
beneath the DESCRIPTION in each module, to spell out what packages 
are declared, so someone knows what they can invoke and what names to 
not use for their own modules.

5. I did *not* split up the modules so that each package was in its 
own; it did not seem appropriate (though I won't rule it out some 
time in the future).

The changed versions have all been uploaded to CPAN, yesterday or earlier.

So thanks to the 3 of you that gave me feedback, and to all have a good day.

This thread is now closed.
