The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Pngslimmer
  DSLIP:       bmpfp
  description: Improve compression of PNGs
  userid:      ACMCMEN (Adrian McMenamin)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    http://png.transpero.net and
    http://transpero.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pngslimmer

  similar:
    Not aware of any

  rationale:

    (I asked for this space about 6 weeks ago and didn't get a reply as
    such)

    This code takes PNGs (typically those generated on the fly) and
    uses adaptive filtering and compression to attempt to make them
    smaller. In spaces where network latency is high or connection
    speeds are low - such as java for handheld devices (eg phones), the
    tradeoff between size and delay for the additional computation is
    good.

    I've been working on this for about a month and a half now and it
    is working well. I'm not aware of anything similar - eg PerlMagick
    will compress images but doesn't seem to filter them and will
    certainly not strip out the non-essential chunks in the way that
    Image::Pngslimmer does. I have been able to double the compression
    ratio on Image::Magick generated PNGs through filtering and the
    stripping saves a typical 50 - 200 bytes (important in a charge by
    the byte environment such as a phone connection).

    When I asked for the namespace before it was suggested that a more
    generic type space might be the best idea eg Image::Slimmer::PNG and
    similarly for JPEG. But that was merely posed as a question - if
    that's what people want fine, but I haven't had a definitive answer.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
