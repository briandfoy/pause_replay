The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perl6::Subs
  DSLIP:       adppl
  description: Define subs in w/named parameters like Perl6

    Perl6::Parameters is limited and missing significant Perl 6 features

  rationale:

    With Perl 6, Perl will finally have a modern subroutine definition
    style in which programmer can conveniently declare named, optional,
    and positional parameters and their types. Perl6::Subs brings Perl 5
    as close as possible to the Perl 6 style of subroutine declarations.
    It's processing is not limited to to the parameter list, but to the
    entire subroutine declaration; thus its "Subs" name.

    While the existing module Perl6::Parameters handles named parameter
    lists, Perl6::Subs improves on it in many ways.

    First, Perl6::Parameters doesn't handle subroutine traits, while
    Perl6::Subs translates C<method foo> to C<sub foo : method>;
    Perl6::Subs also knows that methods have invocants, so if you don't
    specify one yourself, you automatically get C<$self>.

    Second, Perl6::Parameters doesn't really use the Perl 6 style. What
    Perl6::Subs (and Perl 6) would call C<sub foo (Array $a)>,
    Perl6::Params would call C<sub foo (ARRAY $a)>, where "ARRAY" is
    (more or less) a Perl 5 type name.

    Third, Perl6::Parameters has no support for significant Perl 6
    parameter features like optional and named parameters (e.g. C<Array
    ?$a, Array +$b>), parameter traits (e.g. C<Array +$a is required>),
    and parameters with arbitrary class types (e.g. C<MyClass $c>).

The resulting entry would be:
