This mailbox only accepts messages from people in my address book.

Follow the link below for instructions on how to add  yourself to my addressbook so that you can send me email.

Please accept my apology for the inconvenience.   If you feel that you should have already been in my address book, I apologize again -- it's possible that I made a typo when I added you, or that my address book is out of date and you are using a new address now.

The automated process at the link I mentioned above is really quick, you should be able to send me email in just a couple of minutes.

Cheers,
Jonathan
