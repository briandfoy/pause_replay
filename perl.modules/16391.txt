Hello World,

Name:		Kevin C. Krinke
Email:		kckrinke@opendoorsoftware.com
CPAN UID:	KCK

I plan on contributing User Dialog Perl Module (http://udpm.sf.net) to
the wonderful world of CPAN.

Description: Perl extension for User Dialogs
 UDPM strives to be full-featured and robust in everything to do
 with simple end-user interfaces. Care has been taken to provide
 a clean OO interface to common command line utilities as well as
 providing a native ascii mode simulating the various interface
 widgets.

Not that it really pertains to CPAN all that much but I just thought I'd
mention it; I also wrote SSH ManaGeR (http://sshmgr.sf.net) and sometime
in the future I'll be creating a PM of some sort to compliment the
utility. My main reason for mentioning it is that it's completely Perl
(aside from the fact that it's a wrapper for ssh) and depends upon the
CPAN module AppConfig.
