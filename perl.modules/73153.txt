The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Classless::C3
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Classless object system framework
  userid:      JWILLIAMS (John Williams)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::Classless

  rationale:

    This implements a classless object system, very similar to
    Class::Classless.

    There are two major differences. One is that Class::Classless::C3
    relies on Algorithm::C3 to determine the inheritance tree, which
    outsources the most complicated part of the code.

    The more important difference is that there is no $callstate object
    passed around in Class::Classless::C3. This means methods can be
    written in exactly the same way methods are written in other perl
    objects. The job formerly done by $callstate is now accomplished
    using Sub::Name.

  enteredby:   JWILLIAMS (John Williams)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 20 19:44:10 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::Classless::
::C3              RdpOp Classless object system framework            JWILLIAMS
