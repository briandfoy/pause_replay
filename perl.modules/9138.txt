04_pause.html says that you should submit:

* your name=20
* your email address=20
* your homepage if you have one=20
* your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9 characters
  long, all uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed.=20
* a short description of what you're planning to contribute

You've submitted the first and last item; I'd suggest you also submit
your preferred email address, your homepage (if any) and a preference
for a PAUSE ID.

Cheers,
Philip
