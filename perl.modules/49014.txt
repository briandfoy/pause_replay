The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::UTV
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: api to retrieve utv account information
  userid:      PSINNOTT (Peter Sinnott)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB Business::CanadaPost
    Business::OnlinePayment::2CheckOut

  rationale:

    Programmatic interfaces to web sites seem to be located below
    Finance::Bank or Business. As this module provides an interface to
    the account information of UTV Internet customers and there
    currently are no modules below Business::ISP I propose to name it
    Business::UTV. Not placing the module in a specific business
    category also has the advantage that non traditional isp information
    such as phone call details do not feel out of place.

  enteredon:   Wed May 24 22:47:35 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::UTV             adpOp api to retrieve utv account information      PSINNOTT
