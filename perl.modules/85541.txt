Hi again Pieter,
=20
Sorry to keep hassling you, but I was wondering if you were any closer to r=
eleasing an update for Template::Mustache to CPAN?=20
=20
Our coding standards require that we don't have any warnings generated by o=
ur code or dependent modules, and unfortunately this may mean we can't cont=
inue using Template::Mustache in our project if its not being maintained.
=20
As previously offered, if you don't have time to look after Template::Musta=
che then I am willing to take on responsibility for co-maintenance of it, a=
nd would of course respect your existing work and only apply the patch to r=
emove the warnings as suggested by yanick on github (https://github.com/pva=
nde/Template-Mustache/pull/12).
=20
I look forward to your reply.
=20
Regards
Ian Kent

I already have a PAUSE account:

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Hi Pieter
I just wanted to ask if you were still maintaining Template::Mustache on CP=
AN?=20
There's been two bug reports on GitHub for around 6 months relating to Perl=
 warnings for incorrect use of length - I was hoping you might be able to u=
se the pull request (https://github.com/pvande/Template-Mustache/pull/12) w=
hich includes a fix and upload an update to CPAN? Our apache error logs are=
 being filled with these warnings at the moment, and it would be better if =
we could avoid fixing this locally.
Kind regards,
Ian Kent
