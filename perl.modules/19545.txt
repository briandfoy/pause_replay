I *did* that, but no official sactioning of the module has been forthcoming.
As I've said in previous conversations on the list, I'm not going to just
upload whatever modules I feel like, I'll only pollute the namespace I'm
granted by you guys.

Look, I'm a big fan of CPAN and Perl in general, and I appreciate the
opportunities I've been given to give something back in other modules.  I just
want this system to work.

All I expect is this:  either "register" the module so it shows in the pause
interface, or tell me no, you don't think it's a worth-while addition to CPAN.
And take a few weeks to make up your mind, if need be.  But don't leave me
hanging indefinitely when I have other modules that need to know what module
to use (i.e., is it going to be bundled with my other modules in a
non-polluting namespace, or will it be available on CPAN).

If those expectations can't be met (and I don't think they're unreasonable),
let's find a way to recruit the community to help out.  As always, I'm more
than happy to help in any way possible.  But you need to give me a chance.

I'm sorry, but the last three modules have been a bear to get onto the pause
interface where I can more properly manage them (updates to meta-data, etc.),
even though I've been following the pause guidelines faithfully.
