I have a module, working name Hook::WrapSub.

It is very similar to Hook::PrePostCall.

The main difference is that the interface is not
object-oriented.  It also provides a bit more
power and flexibility.  You may read the docs
on-line at 
http://www.dctd.saic.com/~jporter/Hook-WrapSub-0.02.html

I am soliciting comments on the name.
Even if you have no issues with the current name,
a note to myself to that effect would be
appreciated.

Also, comments and discussion on the merits of
this module are welcome.

Thanks for your time.
