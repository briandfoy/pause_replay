The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Highlighting of Perl Syntactical Structures
  userid:      DAVIDCYL (David Liu)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Not known.

  similar:
    Syntax::Highlight::Perl

  rationale:

    Syntax::Highlight::Perl is apparently no longer maintained by its
    author. I have fixed a few bugs and would like to share this
    improved version. It's pretty much self-explanatory why the new
    module is called Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved.

  enteredby:   DAVIDCYL (David Liu)
  enteredon:   Tue May  4 03:29:32 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Syntax::Highlight::Perl::
::Improved        RdpOp Highlighting of Perl Syntactical Structures  DAVIDCYL
