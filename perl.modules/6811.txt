The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::PseudoHash
  DSLIP:       bmprp
  description: Emulates Pseudo-Hash behaviour via overload
  userid:      AUTRIJUS (Autrijus Tang)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    telnet://bbs.elixus.org/,
    http://bbs.elixus.orgtelnet://bbs.elixus.org/,
    http://bbs.elixus.org/, p4://p4.elixus.org/

  similar:
    Tie::SecureHash fields

  rationale:

    Due to its impact on overall performance of ordinary hashes,
    pseudo-hashes are deprecated in perl v5.8, and will cease to exist
    in perl v5.10. The "fields" pragma will change to use a different
    implementation.

    Although the Pseudo-hashes: Using an array as a hash entry in the
    perlref manpage recommends against using the first-element-as-index
    behaviour, it's doubtless that many brave souls still wrote codes
    that utilized it, and fears that the elimination of pseudo-hashes
    will require a massive rewrite of their code.

    As one of the primary victims, I tried to find a drop-in solution
    that could emulate exactly the same semantic of pseudo-hashes, thus
    keeping all my legacy code intact. So "Class::PseudoHash" is born.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::PseudoHash      bmprp Emulates Pseudo-Hash behaviour via overload  AUTRIJUS
