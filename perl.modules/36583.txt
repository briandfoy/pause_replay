	I'm looking for feedback on a new perl module's name.

	Background:

	    MDS2 is shorthand for Manufacturer's Disclosure Statement
	    for Medical Device Security. It is a new standard format to
	    describe a device's security capabilities.  Manufacturers
	    will be creating thousands of these between now and a HIPAA
	    compliance deadline of April 2005.  Healthcare providers
	    will need to process all of the documents too. Automation
	    will help everyone.

	    http://www.himss.org/asp/ContentRedirector.asp?ContentId=59072

	Proposal:

	    XML::MDS2	A container for the modules below.

	    XML::MDS2::Document

		The class for creating, validating, and modifying an
		instance of the MDS2 document.

		Given the tight schedule, the underlying
		XML::LibXML::Document will be exposed to the caller for
		direct manipulation.

	    XML::MDS2::Repository

		The base class for storing and retrieving MDS2
		documents. Initially likely to only have the derived
		class XML::MDS2::Repository::Files.

	    XML::MDS2::CGI

		A convenience class that ties the document & repository
		classes to CGI::Application for a quick and dirty web
		system to create and update MDS2 documents.

	I could make the case that the module should not have the
	preceding XML::, but I'm reluctant to create a top level like
	MDS2 for such a specialized need. There may be future efforts to
	automate communication between medical device vendors and their
	customers, but even if that does come to pass, I'm not sure what
	a better high level bucket would be.

	Comments?

		Scott
