Hi,

I'd like to adopt the Text-Format distribution from GABOR:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Format/

"GABOR" has not updated any of his modules since 1998. G=E1bor, if you're t=
here,=20
can you approve of this request?

What I'm planning to do is:

1. Convert Text-Format0.52 to Text-Format-0.53 (with a dash).

2. Modernise the build system (Module::Build, META.yml, etc.)

3. Add keywords and resources.

4. Modernise the code in the POD.

5. Fix some typos in the documentation.

6. Add more top-level files.

7. Fix or close the only bug in the rt.

=2D------------

I'm making use of Text-Format in one of my distributions.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
