The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PNI
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: a node based visual programming environment
  userid:      FIBO (Gianluca Casati)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://perl-node-interface.blogspot.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    PNI stands for Perl Node Interface.

    It is my main project, my contribution to the great Perl community.
    Node programming is really interesting since makes possible to
    realize a program even if you have no idea about programming.

    Think about genetic researchers, for example. They need to focus on
    protein chains, not on what a package is. Maybe they can do an extra
    effort and say the world "variable" or "string" or even "regular
    expression" and that makes them proud, but they don't care about
    inheritance.

    I would like to have PNI namespace registered (or at least
    PNI::Node ), I'm planning to start a community that help me writing
    new nodes.
