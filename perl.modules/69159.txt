Hi!

I'm still worried about the IDNA-related modules and their maintainer =
status on CPAN. I'm currently just co-maint for IDNA::Punycode and =
Net::IDN::Nameprep and therefore a bit reluctant to just release a new =
(non-developer) version without asking. However, this means that perl is =
still lacking a IDN implementation.

Tatsuhiko-san, if you're no longer interested in maintaining these =
modules at all (I think you've indicated something like that in the past =
IIRC), would you be so kind and give me primary maintainer status? I'd =
also like to finally register Net::IDN::Nameprep in the modulelist.
Then, what about Encode::Punycode, which is currently broken? If you =
don't mind, I'd like to request maintainer status for that, too.

Robert, do you wish to remain co-maint for IDNA::Punycode and =
Encode::Punycode?

Thanks, Claus

PS: The dev versions are available here:
