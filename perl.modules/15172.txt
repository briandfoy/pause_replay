Actually it raises the opposite issue... A general guideline for
modules is that they should be named for what they do not how they
do it.

So the "WebService" category should only be used where "what the
module does" is closely related to the fact it uses a web service.

Given what I've said above and what I understand of your module it
seems like Lingua:: would be the best category to use.

So I'd suggest something like Lingua::LEOTranslate, or perhaps a
Lingua::Translate::LEO module that offers both a minimal plugin
to Lingua::Translate and also a more full-features API for applications
that "use Lingua::Translate::LEO;" directly.

Tim.
