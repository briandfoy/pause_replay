Abhijit / Raphael,

The module distro Storable is out of sync between CPAN and maint-5.22.
P5P is first come on this dual life module along with you 2 as
co-maints. I'd like to offer to update this module on CPAN to keep it
in sync. If you're ok with that, I've already done the leg work to get
the module ready to update so I'd just need co-maint. I'd probably
bump this to a devel release and do a release to testers before I
release it as 2.53

https://github.com/toddr/Storable

If you'd rather do the release yourself, please feel free to steal my
work in the above repo.

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
