The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::ACL
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Generic access-list/route-map module
  userid:      LORENSEN (Martin Lorensen)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    If enough public interrest - a malinglist will be created.

  similar:
    Data::ACL Decision::ACL Net::BGP Cisco::Reconfig

  rationale:

    Its a generic access-list/route-map with my focus on networking and
    routing. More spcificly the module was developed to use with a
    Net::BGP based routeserver.

    I thought of:the following prefixes:

    Data:: (Like existing Data::ACL) Decision:: (Like existing
    Decision::ACL) Net::BGP:: (Some modules will be specialized to the
    Net::BGP module) Net:: (Its main use will be networking stuff)

    The suffix or name of the module:

    AccessList (Most features is about this) RouteMap (It's a RouteMap
    as well) Policy (It's the focus and covers both AccessLists and
    RouteMap) ACL (Access-Control-List, Used elsewhere, and shorter)

    I seatled for the Net:: prefix since the focus is on matching
    network and routing data - and not spcificly BGP.

    I seatled for the ACL suffix since it's a uften used term and used
    in other module names. The policy/route-map functions are just more
    complex ACLs with side-effects.

  enteredon:   Mon May 26 07:46:36 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::ACL             cdpOp Generic access-list/route-map module         LORENSEN
