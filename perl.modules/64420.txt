Brian,

I just noticed this message in the archive. rvdp@cpan.org did not
work before. I have fixed that.

That's fine with me.

Yes, TL1ng should be fixed. However, I think two modules makes sense.
TL1::Toolkit has some higher level functions like get_inoctets(),
get_alarms(), get_crossconnects(), etc. The connecting, login and
logout and output parsing functions are similar to TL1ng. I have a
version of the TL1Toolkit module that calls TL1ng for these functions.
Does that make sense?
