Thanks for the report. I've gone to PAUSE and transfered the user-id
to that module to you.  You should be able to upload/register/whatever
and then, since yours has a higher version it'll become the default
for downloads and break the link with previous DBI distributions.

Once it's all sorted I'd suggest announcing to dbi-users and -announce.
