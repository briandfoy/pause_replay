Subject: DBM::Deep: Request for comaint status

From: sprout@cpan.org (Father Chrysostomos)

There are a number of bugs in DBM::Deep that I would very much like to  
see fixed. Some of these were reported over 5 months ago. I do  
understand that all work done on DBM::Deep is entirely voluntary, and  
that the maintainers may not currently have time to spare. And I am  
very grateful for such a useful tool. So, to help out, I would like to  
request comaint status for this module, so that I can make bug-fix  
releases. Would either Mr. Kinyon or Mr. Huckaby be amenable to this?  
Please let me know.

Thank you.

Father Chrysostomos
