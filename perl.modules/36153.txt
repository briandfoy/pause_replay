Subject: Module submission DBA::Backup

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBA::Backup
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Manage automated database backups
  userid:      SEANQ (Sean P. Quinlan)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    There are some modules to manage backing up files, but none for
    backing up databases from live servers.

  rationale:

    I had developed a working module for managing automated backups of
    databases on a MySQL server. I administer a number of MySQL database
    on a few different servers for different clients. I wanted an
    inexpensive way to robustly back up my databases. This solution used
    the MySQL servers own tools to manage flushing logs, dumping
    databases and such, and keeps a number of previouse backups in
    rotation, not just of the databases but of the logs. Once on the
    files system standard tools could, if desired, be used to move the
    backups to tape, DVD, etc.

    The module was originally named MySQL::Backup. I brought the module
    up for discussion on the module authors list to see if placing it
    under the MySQL namespace was appropriate and to get general
    feedback about the module. I was moderately suprised at the level of
    interest. Once I was convinced that reorganizing the module so that
    others could use the same framework to write plugins to manage
    backups of other server types and DBIx was ruled out as a root level
    namespace, I brought up DBA:: as a possibility. Tim Bunce thought it
    was an appropriate name space for cross-database DBA support
    modules, and Christopher Hicks has generously supplied a mailing
    list for it, perl-dba@fini.net.

    Thanks, as always, Sean
