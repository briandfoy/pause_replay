Hmm. This issue has bitten me, too. A while ago, I requested the "FFI::"
namespace, for Foreign Function Interfaces for Perl. I have a base FFI
module, and I anticipate further modules (by myself and others) relating to
FFI functionality.

There were a number of comments made, mainly by Tim Bunce, on the issue.
Specifically, we discussed the name, and whether it was appropriate for a
top-level namespace. My understanding of the conclusion was that Tim was
ultimately persuaded that the name was acceptable. There was no further
comment, so I uploaded my module. But since then, I have not seen the FFI
namespace appear on CPAN, nor has my module been put there.

Have I misunderstood or missed some part of the process? There is nothing on
04pause.html which implies that there is more I need to do. Is the lack of a
formal "we have accepted your request for a namespace" message an issue? If
so, what do I need to do to get such a formal agreement?

Again, I have no problem with discussing my reasons for wanting a top-level
namespace. I am open to persuasion that another, lower-level, namespace
would be more appropriate (but I believe that I have arguments against most
of the obvious choices). But I don't know what part of the process I have
missed. (Or is it just lack of tuits on behalf of the people in charge?)

Thanks,
Paul.
