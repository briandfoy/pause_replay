Subject: Module submission CtCmd

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CtCmd
  DSLIP:       RdhOo
  description: Rational ClearCase Interface
  userid:      RATL (Rational Software)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    ClearCase International Users' Group; cciug@rational.com

  similar:
    ClearCase::Argv IPC::ClearTool

  rationale:

    CtCmd bcause "ct" is the commonly used alias for "cleartool", which
    is too difficult to type.

    Since the module requires a shared object built against previously
    installed Rational product, it is not compatible with with or
    related to the two modules above, although David Boyce that he has
    created new versions of the above modules that will be able to
    invoke CtCmd.

    We would like to distribute with the Common Public License v0.5.

    Following is a copy of some email between me and Jarkko from last
    summer:

    Though-- the name CtCmd is not ideal (according to the usual module
    > naming practices, a two-level name is usually better, the first
    part > telling the general category). But if the naming convention >
    CtSomething is well-recognized in the ClearCase community, I guess >
    it's kind of an okay name.

    Also, just to be absolutely clear: the only kind of software
    allowed in CPAN is software covered under any of the the
    OSI-approved "free" licenses (http://www.opensource.org/ ). I'm
    certain you are fully aware of this, but I'm just being real
    cautious when getting email from a commercial software company...
    please acknowledge whether you do want the CPAN account for the
    CtCmd.

The resulting entry would be:

CtCmd             RdhOo Rational ClearCase Interface                 RATL
