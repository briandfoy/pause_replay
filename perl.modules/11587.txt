Hello,
    I was getting some modules from cpan and found what I *believe* to
be some errant links.

    Specifically, I was on
'http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html'.  Down at the 'Digest'
section, if you click on some of the items in that section,
(::HMAC,::SHA1, to name a couple), you get sent to the page for AxKit,
rather than the HMAC or SHA1 page.

    Please lemme know if I'm smoking crack as I'd prefer to know if
that's really the way it's supposed to be.  Thanks!

-Joe
