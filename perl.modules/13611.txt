Hello.

CGI modules are in CGI::, HTTP modules are in HTTP::, HTML modules are
in HTML::, IO in IO::, SDL in SDL::, WWW in WWW:: and XML modules are
in XML::.

However, POD is in Pod::. Is this because POD isn't really Plain Old
Documentation? perlpod and the camel book seem to support this
theory. A lot of people I know get confused that it isn't actually POD
(and POD::). When did POD become Pod?

Thanks, Leon
