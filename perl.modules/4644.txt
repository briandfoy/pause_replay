Initial contribution
--------------------
Proposed module name: Tie::DxHash
DSLI: Rdpr
Description: "Keeps insertion order; allows duplicate keys"
Discussion: I wrote this module in order to facilitate the use of 
more complex mod_rewrite rules in Apache configuration files written 
with PerlSections.  I originally proposed this to the mod_perl 
mailing list (see 
http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/182/2000/2/0/3371477/, which 
includes a synopsis of the module's use).  I said at the time that I 
would contribute this to CPAN but did not get round to it until now.  
I received a mail from someone a couple of days ago asking why he 
could not find the module on CPAN.  This served to prick my 
conscience :)

Regards
Kevin
