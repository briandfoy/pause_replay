I'm starting a project, hopefully under a new namespace like  Mail::Bulk (Mail::Bulk::Factory) that is geared towards sending multiple emails through various templating systems out to REGISTERED customers. These emails could be monthly sales notifications, batched order confirmations, shipping notifications, or anything else requiring a many-to-one relation of recipients-to-templates.

The system will be based on various types of queues (Directory, DBI, POP3, MQueue) of incoming requests (from marketing, from sales, from order processing, from shipping type departments).  Each request is verified, transformed via a given templating language plugin (find-replace, Mason, Mail:BulkMail, TTkit, XML/XSL, etc), and then sent out for delivery.  Another part of the process will deal with bounced messages, and reporting stats or completion notifications back to the requesters.

Thanks,
-=Chris
