The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Application::GDGraph::lines_ap
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Perl extension for CGI::Application
  userid:      JNBROOKES (Jon Brookes)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net

  similar:
    CGI::Application::PhotoGallery CGI::Application::Mailform
    CGI::Application::MailPage

  rationale:

    This module 'is a' CGI::Application and as such would logically sit
    under the CGI::Application name space as do other such applications
    that 'inherit' from this parent class.

    Functional description and rationale as follows:

    This module is written with a view to its use in the area of
    performance and availablity management of small to large computer
    systems where data such as CPU, disk, swap usage are more easily
    interpreted when plotted as graphical images. This need not be the
    only application of this module as any numeric 'tabular' data may be
    plotted using this method.

    Although it is easy to generate graphs 'on the fly' using GD and
    the Perl module GD::Graph, having a re-usable module that can be
    customised and rapidly deployed throughout a web infrastucture can
    cut out a lot of 'cutting and pasting'.

    The combination of CGI::Application, CGI::Session and GD::Graph
    into this 'wrapper' module seeks to make this task easier and
    quicker.

    An on line graph together with an HTML page in which to render it
    that is itself 'template driven' should be easy to set up within the
    framework that this module has to offer. Session state data is
    maintained by CGI::Session so there is little need to transfer
    complex 'CGI parameter based' data between the outer web application
    and this module. Thus data transfer is simplified and potentialy
    more secure.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Application::GDGraph::
::lines_ap        adpOp Perl extension for CGI::Application          JNBROOKES
