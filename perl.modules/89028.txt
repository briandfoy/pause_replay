Although you're using it on large files, it seems that this module is =
really
about buffered reads. Maybe people would want to use it for files other =
than
large files. As Johan noted, though, Perl is already supposed to do this =
for
you.

What about File::ReadBuffer or something like that, to describe what =
it's
doing instead of a particular use case?
