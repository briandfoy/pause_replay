Looks like we enter the crossplatform issues here. Linux doesn't have 
EMT signal. I guess I'll go with the rest of the signals and polish the 
module on the go as people use it and send patches in.

I've tested all these manually, since the same manpage on linux doesn't 
include that info.

I think this name describes the best its functionality:
Debug::FaultAutoBackTrace

But long names are painful, any preferrable shortcuts?

Debug::FaultAutoBT
Debug::FaultABT
Debug::FABT

Yes, yes, I didn't want to use dump() because it doesn't give you a 
useful backtrace. My module calls a few functions before it segfaults:

   #0  0x4039f781 in crash_now_for_real (
       suicide_message=0x403a0120 "Cannot stand this life anymore")
       at SIGSEGVFault.xs:9
   #1  0x4039f7a3 in crash_now (
       suicide_message=0x403a0120 "Cannot stand this life anymore",
       attempt_num=42) at SIGSEGVFault.xs:16
   #2  0x4039f824 in XS_Debug__SIGSEGVFault_segv (cv=0x84ecda0)
       at SIGSEGVFault.xs:25

I use it in the documentation to explain what is a backtrace, how you 
can figure out where the problem is. dump()'s bt on C-level is too short 
to be useful in teaching.

I guess I'll call it then Debug::DoSegFault.

Thanks Tim!
