Apologies for not responding to your original inquiry Lukas, it slipped
through the cracks.  I assure you I wasn't being hostile in missing the one
email you'd sent on the matter.  :)

Are you talking about using my namespace for a different purpose, or for
the same functionality?

If this is for different functionality, I don't think re-purposing existing
namespaces in CPAN is a good idea in principle, since any code using the
module would break in a spectacular and explodey ways when upgraded.  I
wouldn't want that, even for this module; others might not view my code as
silly as I do.

If you are talking about implementing the same functionality using the same
conventions and provably better underpinnings, I like the idea.  However, I
wouldn't want the module to suddenly be incompatible with older perls only
for the sake of using a new perl feature.  Source filtering gets a bad rap,
but this module is so simple in its usage of it that I can call the code
relatively bulletproof.  I'd like to see what you have to replace it.

Hi,<br>
<br>
I want to upload a module I&#39;ve written to CPAN. My preferred name for i=
t would be &quot;Quote::Reference&quot;. Obviously that&#39;s not possible =
because you&#39;re already using this name. (To be honest, I actually uploa=

I wanted to ask you if you&#39;d agree to rename your module and let me tak=

Your documentation says the module is just a silly experiment and you don&#=
39;t expect anyone to actually use it. And it uses source filtering, which =
can cause mysterious failures in code. For these reasons I assume you&#39;r=
e not overly attached to the code.<br>


<br>
My version is based on the &quot;pluggable keyword&quot; mechanism in newer=
 perls (so it doesn&#39;t break), and of course I intend to use it in real =
code. :-)<br>
