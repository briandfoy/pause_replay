The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::IEAutomation
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Internet Explorer Automation
  userid:      PRASHANT (Prashant Shewale)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups

  similar:
    Win32::IE::Mechanize

  rationale:

    Even if this module uses the same COM interface as that of
    Win32::IE::Mechanize, it is very much differnt. It is having lot of
    rich methods that makes it user friendly. This module tries to give
    complete automation for web applications using Internet Explorer on
    Windows platform.

    It is written in object oriented format and contais lot of user
    friendly methods to access and control webpage objects (like
    textfields, buttons, radios, checkboxes etc). While accessing
    webpage controls one can use internal html attributes like name, id,
    value etc. And in addition to that it is having options like
    'beforetext', 'aftertext' which makes it very user friendly.

    Most importantly it supports 'Frames', 'Popup window' which is
    limitation in Win32::IE::Mechanize.

    Mechanism for interacting with windows dialogs like 'Security
    Alert', 'Confirmation dialog box', 'Logon dialog box' etc. is added.
