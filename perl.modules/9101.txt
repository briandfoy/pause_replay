I just spoke with Tels, the author of Math::BigInt.  He was puzzled
why 02packages.details.txt.gz was reporting Math::BigInt version 0.01
inside perl to be the latest version.

Digging around a little inside 03modlist.data.gz, it seems CPAN thinks
it's owned by MARKB.  There is no MARKB, however he owns Math::BigInt,
Math::BigFloat and Math::BigRat.  Math::BigFloat has the same problem
as Math::BigInt, 02packages points to 0.02 inside perl.  Math::BigRat
I can't find anywhere.

I've come upon this problem so often, the CPAN index pointing at weird
versions of modules.  I have a feeling it's a symptom of CPAN trying
to protect module ownership.  TELS doesn't "own" Math::BigInt, so it
won't display his "rogue" release.  Unfortunately, CPAN is often wrong
about who owns a module.  Either the transfer of ownership wasn't made
officially via PAUSE, or something got corrputed along the way.

This ownership protection is supposed to prevent an unofficial version
of a module from appearing on the CPAN index in the event of two
authors quarreling over a namespace.  Worse, it's *causing* the very
problem it's trying to prevent!  I've had trouble with this myself
numerous times (and still am with certain modules).

I believe the problem of rogue versions to be a non-problem.  I've
never had a problem.  I've never heard of there being a problem.
The only times I know of there being a problem it was either a
mistake/oversight or the two authors resolved it amongst themselves
(without having to wait in line at modules@perl.org court).


So just junk it.  Just pick the highest numbered (preferably non-core)
release.  Its simpler, its easier to understand, its right more often
than the current system, and perhaps most importantly, conflicts can
be resolved without them waiting for the CPAN cabal to get around to
fixing it.
