Might be rubbish, I don't know if the public might be interessted ... or
if anything equivalent already exists.  Anyway I wanted to feed the
database with data from a tab-separated file, and I wanted to keep the
needed SQL code in the same file - so I sort of made a new file format
mixing SQL and data.  I find it a bit nicer and easier to hand-edit than a
file with "INSERT INTO" at each line.  Finding a good name, and a 
description which is under 44 character long seem to be a bigger
challenge than writing the code :)

the things more efficiently, nor better - but for some weird reason even a
three years old computer is considered inadequate for doing anything at all.
