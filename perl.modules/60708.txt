Hello,

I should like to ask about the current state of Time::HiRes.  I've submitted a
patch to Jarkko Hietaniemi, but he says that he doesn't support the module any
longer, zefram@fysh.org does. The latter email seems to be out of reach for the
last 2 weeks. Also, the module is published under Jarkko's name anyway, so even
if zefram@ would publish new version, it will be in unauthorized state.. But as
I'm getting here in business that is not mine, I'd just like to ask who should
I ping, because it's not clear from CPAN info. At the very last resort I can
take the module responsibility, if noone else is interested.

-- 
Sincerely,
	Dmitry Karasik
