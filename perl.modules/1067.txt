One other thing that would probably be worth knowing about Log::Dispatch
is that it only works with perl 5.005 or greater (it uses pseudo-hashes
and compile time object typing).  This may or may not be relevant but
since this is somewhat unusual for CPAN modules I thought people should
know this.  It tends to make including it in other distributions (like Tk
or whatever) undesirable, I suppose.


Sorry for the double post.
