Subject: Module submission Time::Piece::MySQL

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Piece::MySQL
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Adds MySQL specific methods to Time::Piece
  userid:      DROLSKY (Dave Rolsky)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    with Time::Piece author, Matt Sergeant

  similar:

  rationale:

    This provides some simple MySQL-specific methods for Time::Piece
    objects. I discussed it with Matt Sergeant and he didn't have any
    qualms about me uploading this module.

    BTW, the module list still has Time::Object listed, but that
    namespace has been retired in favor of Time::Piece, by fiat of the
    pumpking.

  enteredby:   DROLSKY (Dave Rolsky)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 11 20:12:33 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::Piece::
::MySQL           bdpOp Adds MySQL specific methods to Time::Piece   DROLSKY
