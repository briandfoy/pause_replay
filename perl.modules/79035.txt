Merry christmas and happy new year!

Though.

Can anyone give an advice on what should be done
in case my program was dependent on the module
which was deleted from CPAN?

Can I bundle it with my program without getting 'Permission missing'?

Thanks in advance for advices,


Petya.

ps: yes, I know I chose bad name for the CPAN package,
I'm considering moving it to App:: namespace, are there
better choices?
