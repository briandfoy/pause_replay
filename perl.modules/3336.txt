	First, unless you can read my mind, you have no knowledge of

	There's a massive amount of confusion in thw world.  Renaming
	my module something else will not reduce that confusion by any
	significant amount.

	Additionally, I've also /patiently/ pointed out that my
	software is, first and foremost, a C++ library.  In /that/
	namespace, my chosen name is sufficiently unique.  And, again,
	said library just so happens to have a Perl language binding
	thrown in for free.

	A single developer isn't going to use both my package /and/
	somebody else's simultaneously anyway.

	When I submitted the module, the module-powers-that-be could
	have rejected it: they didn't.

	There simply aren't enough synonyms in English that accurately
	describe what my module does.  Therefore, the only resort would
	be to contrive a name that has nothing to do with what the
	module does.  (For instance HTML::Mason is a bad name.  Can you
	tell what that does from the name?  I can't.)  I don't want to
	pick a meaningless name just so it's unique.  Sorry.

	- Paul
