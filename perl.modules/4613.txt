I have just uploaded a module that I have been working on for some time.

First, I apologize.  I choose a Namespace without checking with PAUSE
first.  If this namespace won't work out (it's available, but I don't
know if it is reserved), I can work on changing it in my cvs to another
repository name.

The name I have choosen is Net::Server.  The module includes full
documentation, Makefile.PL, supported modules and test scripts.

Net::Server is has some similarities to Net::Daemon and
NetServer::Generic, but seeks to combine the good qualities of these and
add an extensible (class oriented) API ala concepts contained in
Net::FTPServer and in the Apache Webserver.  Some key benefits are
PreForking server (NetServer::Generic has this but does not have the
back end structure to make it suitable for expansion.), multi port
accept (allows the server to bind to and accept on one or more ports on
the server, easy expansion via hooks, easy adaptibility using class
inheritance.

The tar ball has been uploaded into authors/id/R/RH/RHANDOM.  The
current file is Net-Server-0.46.tar.gz.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
