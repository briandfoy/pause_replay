I know... but coming up with a better one is _hard_...

Bunch is interesting in that at least doesn't suck too hard.

And it also starts with Bun, so it's sort some level of superficial 
similarity.

I think it's better than Collection:: at least... So Bunch it is unless 
someone comes up with something better. The only other one I had was 
Assembly:: but that has some C# connotations now :)
