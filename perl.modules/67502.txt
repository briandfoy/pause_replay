Nobuhiro: I just granted you co-maintenance permissions for the 
Font::FreeType namespaces. Make sure to read 
http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/04pause.html#takeover for our policy 
on how to deal with other people's code. The gist is that we ask you to 
treat other people's work with the respect it deserves. :)

Geoff: If this reaches you and you object to the action, please note 
that this is reversible. Just let us know.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
