There is a 0.69 at http://search.cpan.org/~byrne/SOAP-Lite-0.69/

But it contains a module SOAP::Packager that cpanid BYRNE does not  
have permission to upload. Permission is given to KBROWN due to first- 
come

But you will not see this dist under /dist/SOAP-Lite/ because it  
contains unauthorized modules.

I do not see WWW-Mechanize-1.26.tar.gz  in

http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/P/PE/PETDANCE/

but it is on backpan at

http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/P/PE/PETDANCE/

Did you delete it via PAUSE ?

Not all mirrors update at the same interval from the CPAN master. So  
some will appear to be older than others.

search.cpan.org monitors mirrors for "freshness" and any download  
link is redirected to a mirror which should be new enough to have the  
required file.
