The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Htauth
  DSLIP:       adhfp
  description: Authentication and encryption for http
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    CGI::Htauth offers a variety of authentication mechanisms to the
    CGI programmer. The main subroutine is &authenticate($config)
    $config can be either a string or a filename, and looks a bit like a
    simple router configuration, with different authentication modes to
    be offered to different IP addresses or ranges. Possible modes
    include allow, deny, password and challenge-response. CGI::Htauth
    uses Crypt::Tea, CGI::FormBuilder and CGI.pm. From a JavaScript
    browser, The user is authenticated by encrypting a random challenge,
    so the password is never transmitted, and subsequent traffic in both
    directions is encrypted. Timeouts are handled and there are built-in
    buttons for logout and password changing. Originally CGI::Htauth
    used a module of mine called CGI::Htui (analagous to Term::Clui) to
    handle the forms, but over the last couple of months I have ported
    it to the already-existing CGI::FormBuilder which provides similar
    functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::Htauth          adhfp Authentication and encryption for http       PJB
