Summary: I'm not against the module. I just don't see how "Quick"
has anything to do with it.

It can be the third argument to process(), too.

    my $tt = Template->new;
  
    $tt->process( 
      \ "My name is [% name %]", 
      { name => 'brian' }, 
      \$output );

Well, with your method, you have to create another object for every
template that you want to process. It seems that your method
requires a bit more work.

I'm not sure what you mean by variables being in scope. I don't see
how that effects either one (or if it does, it's the same).

It seems Template is just as quick. Again, I think there's a better
name than "Quick".
