The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Use sql or orm objects to build a gtk2 Gui
  userid:      RAPPAZF (François Rappaz)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    gtk-perl mailing list <gtk-perl-list@gnome.org>

  similar:
    Gtk2::Ex::DBI; Gtk2::Ex::Datasheet::DBI

  rationale:

    NAME Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker - Use sql or an object-relational mapper to
    get data from a database and build a gtk2 Gui using a glade file

    SYNOPSIS

    use My::Form; use Rdb::MyTable::Manager; use
    Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker::RdbDataManager use Gtk2 -init; use
    Gtk2::GladeXML;

    my $builder = Gtk2::Builder->new();
    $builder->add_from_file($path_to_glade_file);

    my $data = Rdb::MyTable::Manager->get_mytable(query => [primary_key
    => {eq => $self->{pk}}]); my $dman =
    Gtk2::Ex::Linker::RdbDataManager->new({data=> $data, meta =>
    Rdb::MyTable->meta });

    $self->{form_for_my_table} = Gtk2::Ex::DbLinker::Form->new({
    data_manager => $dman, builder => $builder, .... });

    DESCRIPTION

    The aim of this module is to automate the process of tying data
    from a database to widgets on a Glade-generated window. All that is
    required is that you name your widgets the same as the fields in
    your data source. Step for use:

    1) Instanciate a xxxDataManager object that access the database and
    contains the rows to display to the Form or Datasheet modules.
    Currently there are three way to access the database: plain sql +
    DBI, Rose::DB::Object, and DBIx::Class

    2) Instanciate a Gtk2::GladeXML object 3) Instanciate a
    Gtk2::Ex::Linker::Form object or a Gtk2::EX::Linker::Datasheet that
    displays the data from the DataManager using the glade file.

    You would then typically connect the buttons to the methods below
    to handle common actions such as inserting, moving, deleting, etc.

    This module is the same as Gtk2::Ex::DBI and
    Gtk2::Ex::Datasheet::DBI except that database access can be made
    using plain SQL or the ORM mentioned above. Other ORM could be added
    if needed. The developer of Gtk2::Ex::DBI is not interested + has no
    time + no needs for including these change in the original modules
    unfortunately.
