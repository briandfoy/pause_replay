That's good to hear. However, please use the "Request PAUSE account"
link on pause.perl.org
(http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id) to request an
author ID. It'll be processed asap by the bunch of PAUSE admins who
check for new accounts. Just use the same rationale as in your mail and
you'll be fine.

Best regards,
Steffen
