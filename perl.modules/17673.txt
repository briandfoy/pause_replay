I have a module that does multiple regex substitutions in parallel
safely, like this:

    $str = subst($str,
               qr/([0-9]*[1-9])/ => '${1}0',
               qr/([0-9]+)0/     => '$1',
                )

(Adding zeroes to numbers that don't have them, and taking them off
numbers that do).

I now call it Regexp::Subst::Parallel.  Would there be a better name
for this module?

Also, would there be a better interface?  Should it be object
oriented?

Thanks,
Luke
