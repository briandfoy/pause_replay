Hi Elliot

I see the problem. You've used:
package AnnualCal;
instead of:
package Wx::App::AnnualCal;

I did not check any other source code.

I had a look at your MANIFEST, and it looks good, but perhaps it's a 
design fault in DistZilla that it doesn't cross-check something like 
this. IMHO it should at least give you a warning.

So, just edit the necessary files, bump the version #, upload and wait.

If it's ok, then log on to PAUSE and delete the previous version. 
Actually you should always do this, although it might be a good idea to 
keep any previous (successful) around for a while, along with the latest 
one.

Cheers
