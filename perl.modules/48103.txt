I see where you're going there, but Easy really is the right
name. It really just handles mundane things like reading the
user/pass from .my.cnf and re-connecting/re-preparing sth's when
the dbh has gone away...  Thus making DBI easier.  ::Simple
maybe?

I thought DBIx was for extensions.  Perhaps I was mistaken.
There doesn't seem to be a DBIx.pm to read about anywhere.

Could you suggest some other place to put it perhaps?
