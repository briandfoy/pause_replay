Hello,

Following Adam Kennedy's advice, I'd like to request co-maintainership
of Text::WikiFormat.  I have been submitting bugs with patches to
rt.cpan.org for Text::WikiFormat since Sept. 1st, with no response.  I
sent an email to the author on Sept. 5th via his/her CPAN email address
(chromatic@cpan.org), the only one I could locate.  There were several
open bugs on rt, none of which had been touched since their creation,
over 3 years ago for two of them and over two years for the third.

I have several bug fixes and a set of backwards compatible enhancements
that allow parsing of wiki text with html mixed in which I have been
maintaining as a fork for another module I am working on, but I would
like to get the required fixes and enhancements to Text::WikiFormat
uploaded so I can push my new module.

Thanks,

Derek
