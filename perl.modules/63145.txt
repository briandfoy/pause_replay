     why:

    A module for configuring HP and Cisco devices in parallel using a
    templating system over ssh, telnet or using a console server. It
    works particularly well for doing mass upgrades/changes on a lot of
    devices at once. E.g. upgrading the firmware on ~200 switches. It
    can be easily extended to handle other vendors/device types. It is
    usually able to automatically discover the device type (or it can be
    manually set) and apply configurations to devices using both
    generic, per-device-type/model and host specific configs. It also
    does user definable variable interpolation.
