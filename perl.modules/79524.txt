Firstly I favour a name like Module::Metadata::* because:
o It'll be data about modules
o There are several modules in that namespace already (including 2 of mine)

For the last part (the *), I'd use Metacpan, as in 
Module::Metadata::Metacpan since that's the source of this particular 
data. Of course, other sources may come into it, but Metacpan remains 
the primary source (I'm assuming). Either way, I feel it's a fairly good 
name.

Secondly, Neil, if you want send me the code and I'll clean it all up 
and turn it into a stand-alone module
