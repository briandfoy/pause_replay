     why:

    To begin with: Locale::PostalAddress.pm, an i18n/l10n module for
    postal addresses. From the README:

    DESCRIPTION

    This module converts postal (snail mail) addresses between an
    unstructured country-neutral format (an array of character strings)
    and a country-specific format that's hopefully meaningful by postal
    authorities, courier/delivery services, residents, ... of that
    country for postal address entry. It should handle most countries
    out of the box with only minor or technical divergences from
    approved bulk-mailing formats; if needed, country-specific code can
    be added to make it fully conformant to those formats.

    The intended audience for this module is anyone needing to handle
    most addresses in a recognizable country-specific format, without
    going into the full generality and complexity that UPU standards
    would appear to require.

    There may be more later, either as authored modules or as
    contributions or suggestions for existing modules.
