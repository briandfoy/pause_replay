The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::JHash
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: 32 bit int hashing using Jenkins Algorithm
  userid:      JFREEMAN (Dr. James Freeman)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Digest::Foo-Bar-Baz

  rationale:

    Although MD5 and co are of course very good and fast hashing
    algorithms, from time to time a shorter hash may be appropriate. The
    Jenkins hash fills this niche and shows very good dispersion within
    its range - 32 bits (unsigned int)

    It is implemented in C with an XS interface and is about 2-3 times
    faster than using say Digest::MD5 with substr or unpack to get a 32
    bit hash.

    Here is a link to the algorithm details:

    http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html

    There is an extensive discussion there of the merits of various
    algorithms in different situations including this one.

  enteredby:   JFREEMAN (Dr. James Freeman)

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::JHash           Rdcfp 32 bit int hashing using Jenkins Algorithm   JFREEMAN
