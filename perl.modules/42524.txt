Well, you made a point. Until you mentioned the example in postal codes=20
validation, I was not convinced about the usefulness of multi-national
code validation. But postal codes are more universal than codes
for tax payers and other specific ids which usually matter only within=20
a certain country.

I think it is natural for an author to add support to concepts
related to his/her own country. And within the country, the
national domain Business::<Country> would be unifying from
the national point of view. But with respect to concepts like
postal code, nothing prevents a module with a traversal point-of-view
which despite a name like Business::PostCode looked for
Business::<Country>::PostCode modules. Probably you won't
get the situation you mentioned to load an only module. But if
Business::PostCode was made a distribution and so
Business::BR::PostCode, Business::PT::PostCode, etc.
were also made as modules (because the authors would be
warned about that possible border-crossing reusability),
a bundle could be written to load many of them simultaneously.

Well, I am just wondering. Actually I have not approached
the problem of validating Brazilian post codes, which apparently=20
seems to depend on huge databases (which shamelessly are
not publicly available nowadays, unless for individual queries).

Best regards,
Adriano.
