The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Alice
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: An IRC client that can be viewed in WebKit
  userid:      LEEDO (Lee Aylward)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    nowhere yet

  similar:
    None that I know of

  rationale:

    This is an IRC client that runs persistently in the background,
    either locally or remotely. You can view it by loading up a web
    browser and pointing it at the built in web server. It will serve up
    a tabbed interface, with the most recent 100 messages for each
    channel. It uses a long streaming HTTP request to push out updates
    in real time.

  enteredby:   LEEDO (Lee Aylward)
  enteredon:   Wed Aug 19 18:51:18 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Alice           bdpOp An IRC client that can be viewed in WebKit   LEEDO
