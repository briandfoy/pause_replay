Your (the admins) position has been noted.

The above is a verifiably dishonest statement. Nobody else is involved 
at this stage and has not been for years.

I explained my reasoning for the lack of transparency, and am repeating 
it here again:

If the above is not satisfactory to the PAUSE admins - then I am afraid 
your only option is to administratively prevent me from doing that, as 
outlined at the start of this email.

As suggested in an earlier email: the PAUSE admins (as the only 
legitimate concerned party at this point) would likely benefit having 
this question asked in a wider forum ( the DBIC mailing list and/or 
other channels ). Essentially someone has to trigger a "vote of no 
confidence", otherwise this entire exchange is just a time consuming farce.

At this point the layout of various positions seems clear. My own plans 
remain as described earlier: I plan to continue work for a bit longer, 
and go through with my original plan of action, baring an uproar from 
the user community.

RIBASUSHI
