The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBD::Neo4p
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: DBI-compliant interface for REST::Neo4p
  userid:      MAJENSEN (Mark Allen Jensen)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl.dbi.users, neo4j (Google Groups)

  similar:
    REST::Neo4p

  rationale:

    DBD::Neo4p will be a DBI interface to my REST driver for the neo4j
    graph database server (REST::Neo4p, REST::Neo4p::Query). There have
    been requests to have something more 'query-centric', rather than
    object-centric, for dealing with neo4j in Perl. It's an interesting
    project and should be pretty useful.

    I did what I was told in DBI::DBD and wrote the user group that I
    was planning to create a new DBD, but alas did not receive a
    response. Post wasn't even moderated in. So, hoping to take control
    of my own destiny here.

    Thanks for the consideration- MAJ
