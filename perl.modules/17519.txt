The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::IDP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: OOP interface for parsing IDP files
  userid:      ASCOPE (Aaron Straup Cope)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Over the weekend I got distracted long enough to rediscover the
    Internet Dictionary Project (IDP) and wrote a Perl OOP interface for
    searching the various English to Foobar files.

    At least one person I exchange email with thought it was
    interesting, so I figured I would shared it with the CPAN.

    I am open to suggestions for a more suitable name for the package.
    Text::IDP didn't seem quite right, though.

    see also:

  enteredby:   ASCOPE (Aaron Straup Cope)
  enteredon:   Mon Feb  3 13:56:38 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
::IDP             RdpOp OOP interface for parsing IDP files          ASCOPE
