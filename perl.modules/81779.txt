     why:

    We are working on a live BGP security monitor called BGPmon.
    Currently, we are working with the Australian government on the
    project and would like to use CPAN as a distribution system while
    the modules are being built and tested. Afterwards, the code will be
    free to whomever would like to add on to it.
