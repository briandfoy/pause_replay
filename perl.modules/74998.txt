The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       R::YapRI
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Yet another perl R Interface
  userid:      BOMBARELY (Aureliano Bombarely Gomez)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/solgenomics/yapri

  similar:
    Statistics::R

  rationale:

    R::YapRI, 1- because it is an language interface between Perl and
    R. 2- because there are more than one R-Perl interface such as
    Statistics::R or R::Writer. 3- It is different, or at least i think
    that it is because it works with blocks that can contain more than
    one command and can be combined. Also it runs the commands through R
    command line loading them using < instead source() R function. 4- It
    has a lots of test... probably it is not bugs-proof, but test a lot
    of things. 5- Why not Statistics::R::YapRI ? It is longer, and R
    could be more than simply Stats, we use for Bio too (annotate
    genomes with bioconductor). R itself is a language beyond a program,
    so in the same way that can be found C:: or Python:: make sense find
    R::
