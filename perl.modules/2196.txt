It will be XML::XSLT - current version is 0.21 on PAUSE,
latest "release" from Sourceforge is 0.22.

Guess I should tar up what I have and stick it under 0.01 or
something - it's little more than negotiation at this stage.

Yeah, I should check how they're going.  I tossed that in as
the only other thing I have that's project-worthy.  Last time
I looked that was just a direct replacement for the command
line tool, while mine provided locking and user control too.

Then again, mine is full of yucky "magic" stuff for the
network I wrote it on.

Thanks for your prompt response!
