There's already been work on this in MooseX::AutoDoc - and if you want to
start a separate effort then it should also be in the MooseX:: namespace
since it's an extension rather than part of core Moose.

Is it worth coming to talk to #moose on irc.perl.org or the moose@perl.org
mailing list before writing code that's already been at least part
written? :)
