Well, first of all, CPAN is just a carrier.  People upload their code,
and it is not checked for IPR issues or anything of that sort.  Well,
they do have to pick a licensing scheme for it.  We are very hesitant
to touch people's code submissions for any reason, and given that we are
a distributed archive, we are legally a very curious entity indeed.  The
authors themselves are responsible for their submissions, and they must
do any changes.  If an author really and truly becomes unreachable, we
may after a prudent wait eventually do something directly.

Secondly, the website http://www.anvari.org/bio seems to be up and
responding right now.  Roozbeh, I'll send you the author's email address
privately.  If the author really is uncooperative (which I doubt because
he had the original code attributed) or unresponsive, please feel free
to contact us at cpan@perl.org again.
