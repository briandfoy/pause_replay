GMail::Checker sounds definitely fine.
*nods* I'm using the POP interface through SSL.
Mmmm, this could be done quite easily. The module would follow a path
different from what it was originally meant to be, but yeah sure.
In that case, I'll have to check if there is anything that helps
differentiating the archived/labeled messages. The messages don't seem to be
tagged.

I'll work it that way ;)
