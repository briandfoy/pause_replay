I posted this to comp.lang.perl.misc as suggested in
one of the perldoc's, and just noticed this email
address in another post, so here goes (I'm leaning
toward 'Mail::TNEF' since its sort of a Mail-Tool):

Brief history:
I email myself something with an attachment FROM
a unix system TO a windoze system. The attachment
is just Base64 encoded text.

I use Net::POP3 or Mail::POP3Client along with
MIME::Parser to get the attachment and decode
the Base-64 encoding, and I find out
my simple attachment has become a Base64
encoded TNEF (Transport
Network Encapsulated File) file ( Arrgh! ).

Thus, TNEF.pm was born. The question is, where
to put it? Should it be MIME::xxx, or Net:xxx or
File::xxx or Mail::xxx or what?

The file is already MIME encoded as Base64 and
then needs further decoding, so I'm not sure it
belongs under MIME::, and I think it has too many options
for MIME::Parser to automatically handle the functions.
Its usually going to be used on email files so maybe it should be
under Mail::...
TNEF has 'Net'work in the name so maybe it should
go under 'Net::'   :)  This is the least likely choice I know :)

I just need to decide where it goes, document it ( Like all
good programmers do ;-)   ,  and upload it. Also need to
make it installable like most other modules are, I haven't done
this and am reading the perldocs on this, but some direction
(where should I be paying attention) would be helpful.

TIA,
Douglas Wilson
