The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Class::Rig
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: An API~Driver for Test::Class
  userid:      BYTEROCK (John Scoles)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Idea is to have a single API that has a large set of 'Basic'
    test methods and then for each system you want to test you have a
    'Test Driver'

    Will work on the same pattern as DBI->DBD

    Will be based on

    Test::Class www::Selenium

  enteredby:   BYTEROCK (John Scoles)
  enteredon:   Wed May 18 01:18:46 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Class::
::Rig             cdpOg An API~Driver for Test::Class                BYTEROCK
