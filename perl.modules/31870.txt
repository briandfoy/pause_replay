The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Med
  DSLIP:       MdpOg
  description: Medical image file read, process, write
  userid:      ACRABB (Andrew Crabb)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    alt.image.medical

  similar:

  rationale:

    Medical image files are different from regular image files in that
    they contain a large amount of technical and demographic information
    in a header. Also, the image information is frequently encoded in a
    unique fashion. There are many medical image formats, each
    different, each requiring a unique decoder.

    I already have a module currently published at SourceForge as
    DICOM.pm, it is the first (and to date only) Perl module for the
    Dicom med image format, the most frequently used format. It's been
    out for three years. I plan to re-package this as Image::Med::DICOM.
    I also have Med::Image::Analyze for the Analyze file format,
    probably the second most commonly used format. I plan to add four or
    five more formats as Image::Med::XXXX.

    Thanks
