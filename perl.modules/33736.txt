     why:

    Dear Sir/Madam, What i am trying to do is to create a script which
    will enable users to send SMS through their applications through the
    various free and paid servers present eg. of www.goyali.com and
    www.clickatell.com . Also in mine another script i will enable
    webmasters to provide their users ability to receive the emails on
    their mobile as an SMS. This is a very new concept and i know how to
    integrate it with the servers of goyali.com ,clickatell.com etc..
