I see. Well, we had concluded you were missing-in-action, but apparently you
were not. brian d foy has already given me COMAINT , and I made this new
release:

https://metacpan.org/release/String-Random (0.23).

COMAINT is short for co-maintenance and means the co-maintainer can make su=
bmit
new releases for the namespace, as well as close or change the status of bu=
gs
reports on rt.cpan.org. A co-maintainer possibly has some other privileges.=
 See:

http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html

In any case, I set up a git/GitHub repository for String-Random here:

https://github.com/shlomif/perl-String-Random

I used https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpangitify for doing that and then
added some commits of my own. Pull requests are welcome there.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
