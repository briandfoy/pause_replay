Hi all,

The bank that I've been working for has given me permission to open
source one of the main projects I've put together, as since I'm leaving
they like the idea of continued support and I like the idea of being
able to reuse it without the usual contract enforced restrictions.

Part of the condition is uploading it to CPAN, it would probably also
need to stay in its current name space (since the bank wants the CPAN
modules to be completely compatable with its current deployment.

What I'm trying to find out is will using the ProcessControl name space
cause a problem (ProcessControl.pm and several sub modules) - I can't
see anything on CPAN using that space and while there are similar tasks
covered in other modules none implement the concept in quite the same
way (hence the reason I had to put the modules together, I'm not one for
reinventing the wheel unecessarily)

If you could le tme know your thoughts,

Many thanks

Simon Day
