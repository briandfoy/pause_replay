From: cpan@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

With the recent arrival of the CamelPack and a sane Win32 CPAN 
installation option, and some decent building blocks in the form of 
File::ShareDir, File::HomeDir and File::UserConfig, we now see the 
much-improved possibilities for writing quite decent and well behaved 
Win32/Unix/Mac desktop applications that can be installed directly from 
CPAN.

Indeed, I have someone writing a proof of concept "Perlpad" (notepad 
cloned in Perl) as we speak.

The only problem is I have no idea where to put it?

Do we actually HAVE a namespace for desktop applications like this?

I'd rather not use Perlpad.pm and have every desktop application (of 
which I plan to write a couple) using branded names.

Thoughts on a top level namespace to hold these programs in (current or 
future)?
