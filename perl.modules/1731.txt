I don't see much difference between the two.

I think I'd prefer Apache::XML::* or something.  I do not like cryptic
top-level names, and I do not like acronyms for top-level names (unless
they are widely known, standards, etc.).  FWIW, that wouldn't mean needing
to change the name of the mailing list, and fixing the modules and docs is
almost as easy as a global one-liner.  :-)
