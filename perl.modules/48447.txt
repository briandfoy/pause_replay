     why:

    A perl interface to the PortAudio audio I/O library. Various other
    sound or video related modules, hopefully eventually making perl
    able to be used as a complete framework for developing applications
    for real-time and nonlinear multimedia content creation. Probably
    modules relating to version control, specifically subversion, and
    release engineering. Probably also a generic "utility" module.
    Probably some web stuff.
