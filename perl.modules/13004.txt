What signals result in the core dump? BUS SEGV PIPE ABRT? any others?

Currently the module traps only SIGSEGV, hence the name. Can you really 
fork and fire up gdb on SIGBUS and other SIGs?

The point of this module is that there is no core involved here ;) But I 
guess it's fine, assuming that the module gets extended to other signals 
as well.

The module also includes Debug::SIGSEGVFault which dereferences a NULL 
pointer and causes SIGSEGV. how should it be renamed then? 
Debug::CoreDump? I guess I could release it separately. I bundled it up 
because it's needed to test Debug::SIGSEGVTrace. What do you think?

BTW, meanwhile I put it on CPAN here:
http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=SIGSEGVTrace

It cannot be used, because the sighandler must be assigned on the C 
level. If you do it on the perl level, under 5.8.0 it won't work because 
of the way the signals handling is delayed in 5.8.0.
