Hello

Since some people are interested in the possibility to edit the data
displayed by ObjScanner, I've created 2 new widgets to do that.

The first is Tk::DataEditor:

DESCRIPTION

This widget provides a GUI to edit the attributes of an object or the
elements of a simple hash or array.

The editor is a L<Tk::ObjScanner> with additional function to edit data.

When the user double clicks (with left button) on an item, the
value of the item will be displayed in the HList.

If the value is a scalar, the scalar will be displayed in the text window.
(Which is handy if the value is a multi-line string)

Use the right button of the mouse of an element to modify its
value. Depending on the context, you will also be able to delete the
element or to add a sub-element.


The second is Tk::DataEditorDialog:

DESCRIPTION

This widget is a L<DataEditor> within a L<DialogBox> widget. I.e. it
will appear in its own top-level window when you invoke the Show()
method like the FileDialog widget.


Before I upload them to CPAN, I'd like to be sure that the names are
acceptable. (I know that I'm officially the Ptk list maintainer, but
I prefer to have an approval from other people before I decide alone
to create a new module name ;-)

So unless somebody tells me otherwise, I'll upload these modules to
CPAN next week.

Cheers
