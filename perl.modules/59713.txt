From: WEBMASTER@SIMPLEMOOD.COM (Dan Muey)

Hello,

I've attempted contact with these authors for very simple fixes to  
make their modules useable again with no luck.

Authen::LibWrap (this rt report is over a year old)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=25239

Math::Units (view build test results, its been failing since at least  
2002)
   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=34138

I was hoping you might appoint me co-maintainer so I can upload fixed  
versions and hopefully make these excellent modules useable again.

Thanks!
