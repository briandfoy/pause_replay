Subject: Module submission Compress::BraceExpansion

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Compress::BraceExpansion
  DSLIP:       bdpfb
  description: creates a human-readable compressed string
  userid:      VVU (Alex White)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module does not perform brace expansion (if it did, it
    probably should have been located in the Shell:: heirarchy). It
    attempts to do the opposite--which might be referred to as 'brace
    compression', hence the location it in the Compress:: heirarchy. The
    strings it generates could be used in a shell, but are more likely
    useful to make a (potentially) human-readable compressed string. I
    chose the name BraceExpansion since that's the common term, so
    hopefully it will be more recognizable than if it were named
    BraceCompression.

    If anyone has other name suggestions, please contact me.

    For more info, see here:

    Thanks!
