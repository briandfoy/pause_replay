Tap, tap, tap, "Hello, is this thing on?"  ;)

*** If the following has already been resolved and we're just not
aware, I apologize for rattling the cage again.  ***

My quest to get SuffixTree patched up began around August 17th.  On
August 26th I was able to track down the author, and on the 27th he
agreed to pass along co-maint privileges so that I could take care of
some long-standing issues.  However, he has been unable to log into
his PAUSE account to make the change in permissions.  He's lost his
credentials, and the email address associated with the account is
defunct.

On September 8th I sent a message to modules@perl.org requesting
assistance in this issue.  I checked with Mr Yona on Sept 19th, and he
hasn't heard back from anyone at PAUSE who might restore his access so
that he can add me as a co-maintainer, nor have I.

I'm sure it's in the best interest of the users of CPAN to have
"abandoned" modules adopted by someone willing and able to keep them
well-maintained.  We have a willing author, and a willing maintainer.
What we don't have is the the ability to fix the PAUSE login issue
ourselves, and consequently, can't get the co-maintainership
privileges changed without someone from PAUSE stepping forward to give
us a hand.  If I'm sending this message to the wrong place please let
me know so that I can direct my messages correctly.

Author:  Yona Shlomo <yona@cs.technion.ac.il>
Your willing co-maintainer: Dave Oswald <davido@cpan.org>

Thanks in advance for taking a few minutes to work with us in getting
the module back on its feet.

Dave
