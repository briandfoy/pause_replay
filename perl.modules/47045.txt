Hi,

I have been the maintainer of the Db::Documentum module and namespace for
sometime now.  However, when I uploaded a recent update, the indexer told me
I have insufficient privileges to update the Db::Documentum::Tools module.
This is clearly wrong as Db::Documentum::Tools has always been a sub-module
of Db::Documentum.  Can you correct this so the module is properly indexed?
Thank you.
