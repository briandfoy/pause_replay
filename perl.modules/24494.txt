The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Socket::MsgHdr
  DSLIP:       bdhOa
  description: sendmsg, recvmsg and cmsghdr
  userid:      MJP (Michael J. Pomraning)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Socket IO::Socket File::FDPasser

  rationale:

    Extant modules either don't present or don't fully present
    message/control capabilities of modern socket implementations.

    (N.B.: Socket::MsgHdr also scribbles (send|recv)msg into the
    IO::Socket namespace, for people who prefer that sort of thing.)

    Other names for this module in previous, unreleased incarnations
    (Socket::SendRecvMsg, IO::Message, others.) didn't quite fit, were
    misleading, or lead to namespace proliferation.

    The chosen namespace should be somewhat intuitive -- struct msghdr
    becomes ...::MsgHdr object. cmsghdrs are kept as mundane datatypes
    (no blessed ...::CMsgHdr, at least, not yet).

  enteredby:   MJP (Michael J. Pomraning)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 12 07:43:39 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Socket::
::MsgHdr          bdhOa sendmsg, recvmsg and cmsghdr                 MJP
