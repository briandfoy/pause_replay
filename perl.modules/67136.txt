The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::FastGF2
  DSLIP:       Rdhfg
  description: Fast Galois Field GF(2^8|16|32) math module
  userid:      DMALONE (Declan Malone)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnetraid/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wanted to write modules to implement Rabin's Information
    Dispersal Algorithm (or Reed-Solomon codes) using Galois Field
    arithmetic. I decided to split the code between a Math library which
    does all the elementary operations in the Fields, and a Crypt
    library which implemented the actual crypto algorithms. The names
    Math and Crypt seem to be the standard for maths and crypto module
    naming. I chose the name FastGF2 to indicate that the library was
    optimised (runs C code via XS, and also it's optimised for
    particular fields that fit into words of size 8, 16 or 32 bits,
    rather than allowing arbitrary polynomials) and that it works with
    Galois Fields of characteristic 2. There doesn't seem to be any
    other module for doing these types of calculations. While the choice
    of fixed polynomials might make this module unsuitable for
    particular applications, there are still probably plenty of
    applications which it could be useful for. I've included a sample
    application which implements Shamir's secret sharing scheme as an
    example.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
