That's whaat I now do in SQL::Statement (including instant fixes),
two years after taking the module. I don't want to do the same mistake
on other modules again :)

Having test-cases is the most important thing for me (that's why
the co-working with Tux works so great - he's very good in creating
test cases which I can use to fix the issue easily). You'll help me
a lot when you can do this.

Great - finally I profit by this chaos :D
So I see that I get up my svn quicker (I don't like the repo-structure
on svn.ali.as - I work with branches and tags and bundle the structure
for each module: mod/trunk -- mod/branches -- mod/tags).
