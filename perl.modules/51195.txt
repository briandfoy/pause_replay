Ah, ok. So CPAN is more thought for pure libraries than Perl written
applications installing via Makefile.PL?

My intent was to submit the application including the libraries into
CPAN to ease installation for user by offering installation via
CPAN.pm like e.g. psh or dbish.

Thanks for the feedback.
