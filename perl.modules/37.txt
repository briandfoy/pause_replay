And just who are these programmers who object to typing 20 or 30 characters?

Another suggestion would be to make it easier to write transitive modules.
Once I get my namespace manipulation module approved by modules@perl.org
<mailto:modules@perl.org> , I would be happy to create it. Then you could
write a bundling module, like this:


		package MyCompany::CGIBundle;
		use MyCompany::CGI::BobsCode::Foo;
		use MyCompany::CGI::Test::Bar;
		use MyCompany::CGI::BobsBetterCode::Foo2;
		....
		use NameSpace::Transitive;

And then people could just write:

		use MyCompany::CGIBundle;

to get all the symbols that were exported into MyCompany::CGIBundle
re-exported into their own namespace.

		The WHOLE POINT of the module/pragma is to make
Really::Long::Namespaces::That::Programmers::Hate::To::Type *alot* easier to
use without cluttering up their program with FQPNs. IMHO, it only adds noise
to the code.
