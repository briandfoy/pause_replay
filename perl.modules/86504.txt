  It suddenly occurred to me that no more than a few modules providing exact 
statistics are needed. Thus the rest would some kind of space/time/precision 
tradeoff.

  So I can really use the Statistics::Descriptive:: namespace without worry. 

  I would like to specify algorithm in the name instead of just "approx", 
though. The "Bucket" part was a total mistake, it's great that I realized it.

  What about Statistics::Descriptive::LogScale? 

  P.S. I'm crossposting to module-authors@ as Shlomi suggested in his reply to 
my initial post.
