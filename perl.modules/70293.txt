Indeed, we have always discouraged corporate accounts for these reasons
but of course we allowed that many corporate accounts that could not
easily be recognized as corporate accounts. SIXAPART is just too damn
well known so we recognize the corporate body immediately.

I'm tempted to simply let them choose what they want and if they later
want something else, they can get that too. I read it such that miyagawa
wants a second account and chooses the name sixapart. I see no need to
make that difficult for him.
