The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FUSE::Server
  DSLIP:       RdpO?
  description: Custom FUSE server creation
  userid:      IAMCAL (Cal Henderson)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    FUSE-light mailing list: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fuselight

  similar:

  rationale:

    (FUSE is a protocol for Macromedia Director's multiuser
    client-server communitcation). This module provides FUSE server
    capabilities which can be easily extended by registering handlers
    for FUSE commands. The module handles connections, and maintains an
    internal hash of connected users, exposing only user IDs through
    it's interface. This module is perl only.

    The name Net::FUSEServer may be a better choice, but i'm also
    writing FUSE::Client to emulate client behavior. Opinions welcomed.

    FUSELight is an open-source java alternative to Macromedia's
    multi-user server with addtional features. This perl version adds
    even more features, with the ability to hook it up to the DBI for
    database authentication and storage.

The resulting entry would be:

FUSE::
::Server          RdpO? Custom FUSE server creation                  IAMCAL
