Dear Maintainers,


I would like a CPAN account as follows:

Name:            Ian Boreham
e-mail address:  ianb@ot.com.au
[no homepage currently]
User ID:         IANB

Contributions:

I intend to upload modules for the purposes of:

.. Unpacking and packing binary data in a more flexible and extensible manner 
than unpack and pack currently allow.

.. Gernerating vector graphics in arbitrary output formats.

Thank you for your consideration.

Regards,


Ian
