nothingmuch@alter.org, or nothingmuch@mac.com (the prior is preferred for important mail)
homepage is being programmed thoroughly. much work ahead...
preferred user-ID is 'nuffin'
I plan to contribute a full text search engine, which i've made plugin-able, for multilanguage use, multi file format use, and other nifty stuff i haven't seen in free engines. these nifty things require reworking from scratch, so i just wrote a new one.
i've only been perling for 2 years, and this is a first real project, that i feel should go to the public, but i doubt i'll stop at that...
