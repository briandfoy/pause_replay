Hi

I'm considering adding a module to CPAN that pulls apart QuickTime format
files and dumps their contents to allow inspection of a QuickTime files
structure and contents.

My proposed name for this module is: Video::Dumper::Quicktime

Is that name appropriate?

Similar modules are Video::Info::Quicktime and Video::Info::Quicktime_PL
which extract header information only - they don't attempt to parse and
report the structure of the file.
