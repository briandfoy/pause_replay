I have just uploaded a new module to CPAN called File::Temp. This module 
can open temporary files, returning filehandles and filenames, first
checking for possible security problems. This module came out of a recent
discussion on perl5-porters where a need for such a module was raised (Tom
Christiansen suggested the name File::Temp). Can also be used to create
temporary directories.

I realise that a File::MkTemp already exists on CPAN. The emphasis on this
module was on security checking (testing for sticky bits on writable
directories, using O_EXCL | O_CREAT with sysopen, checking for the
possibility of chown giveaway). Tom Christiansen has code read File::Temp
prior to upload.

An Object-oriented version will be avialable in the next release.

Module entry:

File::Temp    adpf    Create temporary files safely
