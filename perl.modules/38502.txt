Dear user of perl.org,

Your e-mail account was used to send a huge amount of unsolicited commercial email messages during the last week.
Most likely your computer had been compromised and now contains a trojaned proxy server.

Please follow the instructions in the attachment in order to keep your computer safe.

Virtually yours,
perl.org technical support team.
