Sorry, that was not the point I tried to make. What I tried to
emphasize is that a typical, modern computer user does not do things
like building. She hits a few buttons to install an application.
I've had customers that really got stuck when they read in the
instructions about 'command line' instructions.

Developers OTOH don't mind things like unpacking tars, running
Makefile.PL and so on. We are developers.

These are typical developer things. And yes, we developers consider
ourselves users as well, but there are very other users than
developers.
