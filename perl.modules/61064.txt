The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Augeas
  DSLIP:       bmcOl
  description: Edit configuration through Augeas C library
  userid:      DDUMONT (Dominique Dumont)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    augeas-devel@redhat.com

  similar:
    Config::Model

  rationale:

    [ Description snatched from Augeas README ]

    Augeas is a library and command line tool that focuses on the
    mostbasic problem in handling Linux configurations programmatically:
    editing actual configuration files in a controlled manner.

    To that end, Augeas exposes a tree of all configuration settings
    (well, all the ones it knows about) and a simple local API for
    manipulating the tree. Augeas then modifies underlying configuration
    files according to the changes that have been made to the tree; it
    does as little modeling of configurations as possible, and focuses
    exclusively on transforming the tree-oriented syntax of its public
    API to the myriad syntaxes of individual configuration files.

    This module provides an object oriented Perl interface for Augeas
    configuration edition library with a more "perlish" API than Augeas
    C counterpart.

    Config::Model provides similar features. Config::Model provides
    more validation than Augeas and also provides user interfaces. On
    the other hand, Augeas is able to keep comments in modified
    configuration files. Eventually, Config::Model will be able to use
    Augeas to edit configuration files.

The resulting entry would be:
