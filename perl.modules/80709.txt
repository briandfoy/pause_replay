     why:

    I've been working on a rather large distribution lately to
    interface as an API wrapper for a specific web service; after having
    developed this module, and preparing to submit it to CPAN, I'd
    actually rather like to continue developing so hopefully I can push
    more modules to CPAN in the future and possibly help the community
    out.
