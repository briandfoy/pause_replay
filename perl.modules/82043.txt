The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Thread::Workers
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Pool of worker threads fed by a boss thread
  userid:      PANIKAL (Kal Aeolian)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    blogs.perl.org

  similar:
    Thread::Pool, dep heavy, thick code, and doesn't play nicely with
    non-thread-safe modules

  rationale:

    Its a pool of threads in a Boss / Worker model. The Boss feeds the
    Workers 'work'.

    Threaded Workers is another way of looking at it, but
    Thread::Workers seems appropriate, though I'm up for suggestions if
    another name is appropriate.

  enteredby:   PANIKAL (Kal Aeolian)
  enteredon:   Mon Sep  3 18:34:48 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Thread::
::Workers         adpOp Pool of worker threads fed by a boss thread  PANIKAL
