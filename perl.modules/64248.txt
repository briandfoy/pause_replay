Howdy.

I was speaking to the owner of this module (Dave Plonka) and he's ok 
with me assuming (co)ownership (that's on a separate thread).

I've looked at a couple of bugs that have been making the package not 
behave as it should (these are day-1 bugs):

http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20219

http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=14244

In both cases, the software doesn't behave as one would reasonably 
expect it to according to how the API is defined.

The current release is 1.014, and it came out 3+ years ago.

I can either bump the release to 1.015, but then I'd need to add 
mechanism to the import list to say "yes, I'm aware of the new behavior 
that comes with this release and I'm ok with it...", or else do a major 
version bump to 2.000 as a way of warnings people that things might have 
changed.

Is there a preferred way to handle this scenario?

Thanks,

-Philip
