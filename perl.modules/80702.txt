     why:

    I would like to publish a module that converts from common ASCII
    characters to similar-looking Unicode code points. This produces
    text that is still readable to an English reader, but forces
    application-wide Unicode support that could otherwise be overlooked
    by English-speaking developers. This process is known as
    Pseudo-localisation.
