Request to register new user

fullname: Earle Martin
  userid: HEX
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://downlode.org/
     why:

    I already have a number of CPAN modules under the username EMARTIN.
    I picked EMARTIN because at the time I wasn't allowed to register a
    three-character username. I have always hated EMARTIN as a username.

    This is a repeat request. The first time I tried, I was ignored;
    the second time, months later, it vanished into the ether and didn't
    even reach modules@perl.org.

    I humbly request to be allowed to change my user name once and
    permanently.
