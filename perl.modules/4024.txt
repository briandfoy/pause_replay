Have you considered CGI::Application::MailURL instead of MailPage? If
I understand correctly, it does not necessarily send a page, but it
sends a URL, either as a link, as HTML, or as text.

Does it use Mail::Mailer (from Graham Barr's MailTools) or did you
roll your own?

We're working very hard to improve our response time. Stay tuned.
