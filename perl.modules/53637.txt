Hi,

I have a module called Apache2::PictureSupply which I guess would need a 
less cutesy name for upload to cpan. Perhaps Apache2::Image::Supplier or 
Apache::ImageSupplier or something else.

It's an Apache2 response handler for images (png, jpeg, etc) which 
modifies the image on-the-fly according to a predefined (in apache conf 
or perl) action found in the path_info part of the url. Modified images 
are cached so the work is only done for the first request or after the 
source file has been updated.

You only have one version of an image in your htdocs. Then ask for 
thumbnail, medium-sized, monochrome, etc versions where needed.

It uses Image::Magick and may sound a bit like Apache::ImageMagick 
(which is a apache 1 module). But this takes a different aporoach. Where 
AIM lets the client do whatever he wants with an image (causing possible 
cache flood and server load), this module only allow predefined 
modifications.

It supports extension of image modifiers through plugins.


EXAMPLE

It's currently in use on the www.bernardherrmann.org site; mainly for 
resizing but the module can do whatever Image::Magick can do.
