The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cache::Static
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Caching without freshness concerns
  userid:      BRIANSKI (Brian Szymanski)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Mason XML::Comma

  rationale:

    An excerpt from: https://chronicle.allafrica.com:8080/scache/

    Cache::Static is a perl module that allows for the substantial load
    reduction of caching software without the delay in freshness
    necessitated by time-based caching software.

    Cache::Static allows the developer to specify what sorts of
    dependencies (files, database rows, XML::Comma docs, times, etc.)
    are associated with a given calculation (typically a webpage or
    component thereof). If none of the dependencies have been modified,
    Cache::Static returns the last result of that calculation. If,
    however, any of the dependencies are found to have changed, the
    output of the calculation may change, and Cache::Static lets the
    software re-calculate, inserting the new value in its cache.

    Cache::Static excels under extremely heavy loads, but it also does
    better than (or complements) time-based caching when either a)
    resource intensive pages are loaded seldom (and a traditional cache
    has already expired) or b) pages are not easily broken into
    sub-components (or reverse proxies are invalidated by cookies). This
    approach can save resources regardless of workload type.
