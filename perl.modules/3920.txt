       a description of what you're planning to contribute 
       for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry,
which is: Development stage,
       Support level, Language used, Interface style (see the
modulelist), and a 44 character
       description). 
       for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send a concise
description that helps us to
       categorize the issue so we can forward your mail to the
maintainers of the corresponding
       archive branch. 
       It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about
where you have discussed some
       or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was at
least a little bit of interest. We
       are quite open for submissions, but we owe our users at least
some rudimentary quality
       control. If your work has never been discussed publicly, then
it's extremely difficult for us
       to make our judgement whether to accept the submission or not. 

I'm planning on submitting a script that acts as an ftp client
replacement so that the ange-ftp package of emacs can use ssh as its
transport. Details can be found on
http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/ange-ftp-over-ssh.html.
