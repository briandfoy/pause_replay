Subject: Re: Old CPAN namespace registration for Marpa

From: jeffreykegler@mac.com (Jeffrey Kegler)

This module was just the subject of an exchange of emails with  
Andreas.  I request
that the status quo be maintained for another few months.  Here's my
justification:

Marpa has been on the back burner for many years, but three developments
have brought me to full-time work on it.  First, there's new work on  
this type
of parser (Earley's) suggesting the major problem (speed) can be  
overcome.
Second, with the maturity of XS, the arrival of C::Inline and the  
coming of Perl 6,
the internals support this application required may now be available  
-- the necessary
support wasn't available when Marpa was first conceived.  Third, I'm  
between jobs
and able and ready to work on it.

Over the years, Larry Wall, Randal Schwartz and Allison Randal have all
expressed interest in this project.  I believe a "wait and see"  
approach is
justified.

I've hidden the top-level "Marpa" namespace, so it does not pollute  
the visible
namespace.  I'd think the name is unlikely to have any other use, and
any such use might confuse, so I believe reserving it is justified,  
at least for
the next few months.

I will not unhide the top-level Marpa namespace without consulting  
the PAUSE authorities.
I realize the situation with top-level Perl namespaces is very  
different from when I
first (in pre-PAUSE days) reserved the name.  (In fact, it might be
good to have an enforcement mechanism which requires PAUSE admin  
authorization
for any change in first-level namespace visibility, and I'd be happy  
to be subjected
to such a restriction.)

thanks, jeffrey kegler
