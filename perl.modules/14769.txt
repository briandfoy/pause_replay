The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VFS
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Virtual File System
  userid:      SCOTT (Scott Penrose)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    VFS is a wrapper driver that provides virtual file system access to
    many underlying file access systems, from Local Files, FTP, SCP to
    WebDAV, it can even make things that are not files look like a file
    system.

    VFS is written around the idea that there are many ways to do this.
    One way is to use the many perl modules already out there and
    provide this one polymorphic view of the world. Another is to use
    one of the many (not so portable) libraries such as GnomeVFS.

    VFS is currently being written and has two libraries intended to be
    released.

    1) Pure Perl - using other perl modules to implement the underlying
    structure.

    2) XS to GnomeVFS - to allow for the more advanced functionallity
    of VFS

    The Pure Perl version should work nicely cross platform, but the
    GnomeVFS version is far more bound to a smaller set of platforms.

    The common subset of features is working, FTP, WebDAV and Local are
    working in Perl, and a basic XS binding to Gnome VFS is passing most
    tests.

The resulting entry would be:

VFS               cdpOp Virtual File System                          SCOTT
