Subject: New module namespace requests [Approx::Sub & GlobWalker]

From: dave@dave.org.uk (Dave Cross)

I've mailed this list a couple of times before about my Sub::Approx module, but have had no response.

We've had a bit of discussion on hte subapprox mailing list and have decided that we will rename the module to Approx::Sub. This is because the we plan to work on Approx::Array, Approx::Hash, etc (in fact one of the list memebers already has a prototype of Approx::Scalar).

I have therefore just uploaded the first version of Approx::Sub to my CPAN directory.

I've also abstracted the glob-walking ocde that is fundamental to Approx::Sub into another module called GlobWalker - this is also in my CPAN directory.

I'd therefore like to request that the following modules are added to the modules list.

Name            DSLI Description                             INFO
--------------- ---- --------------------------------------- ----
Approx::Sub     Rmpf Call subroutines by approximate names   DAVECROSS
GlobWalker      bmpf Examine the contents of typeglobs       DAVECROSS


Thanks,

Dave...
