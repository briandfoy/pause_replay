That's coming from Net-Daemon-0.43. As in: Verbatim. There is no "actual 
CPAN web page".

It's taken from the released version of the module. As in: From the 
tarball. To update it, update the module and upload it. Then it'll 
automatically propagate to search.cpan.org.

I'm not aware that there were fundamental changes to the *threading 
model* between 5.8 and 5.10. There were certainly a lot of bug fixes.

Without reading the above thread: Suggest to the guys who identified 
your problem that they can take over the module. If they agree, log into 
PAUSE and assign co-maintenance for them.
