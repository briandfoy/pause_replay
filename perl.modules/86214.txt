The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hash::HPath
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Utility's for Hash of Hashes using Key Path
  userid:      JERRYMBC (Jerry James)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Hash::Path

  rationale:

    Hello,

    The already existing module having only one function to get the
    value from HOH (Hash of Hash), But i plant to have 16 functions (For
    first release) for do different operation on HOH of any depth and
    complexity. it include getting hash value , update new value, update
    hash with new key and value , get all keys and value, get all child
    hash ....etc.

    And Another main difference is that existing module uses array to
    store the path, here i am using a scalar string to represent path (
    almost same was as that of XML::XPath module uses path of tag name).

    I definitively get the motivation from XML::XPath module.

    The main advantage of using path concept for HOH is that its help
    Perl programer to create and process HOH of any depth dynamical with
    out any difficulty.

    I request your approval for this module. Any way i started my work,
    hoping to get your approval.

    Thanks and Regards Jerry James
