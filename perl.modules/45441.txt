This doesn't seem like a particularly great name. The (vaguely) general 
structure for module names is Noun::Adjective.

This isn't really about "tested HTML". My initial impression was it was 
something to do with snippits of validated HTML and combination thereof.

This is really about HTML template widgets... with testing.

Thoughts on an alternative name, or are you absolutely certain you want 
this name?
