a lot of the stuff you seem to extract isn't necessarily in a 
header, so I think "Header" should nto be part of the name.

this also sounds like it does not necessarily deal with files, but
image, audio, or movie data.  You didn't mention any plain text
sorts of files, for instance.  Maybe "File" is too general?
