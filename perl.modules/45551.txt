Hi Tom

How wide in scope is the code you have. Do you think it could be built 
on or extended to cover all of most of the field of risk analysis reliably?

If someone were to want a risk-related addition that wasn't supported by 
your module, would they most likely be building their solution on top of 
or within the Risk view of the world?
