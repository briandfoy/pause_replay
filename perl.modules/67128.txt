Hi Joseph,

apologies for the late reply. I missed your mail earlier.

Nit picking: It's been uploaded to PAUSE. Otherwise it wouldn't be on 
CPAN. search.cpan.org in turn is just a web interface that's generated 
from what's on CPAN.

I just checked. The guy who registered the namespace is not the one who 
actually uploaded it. Apparently, it was registered after the initial 
upload:

module	userid	fullname	type	owner
UUID 	BRAAM 	Peter J. Braam 	first-come 	LZAP
UUID 	LZAP 	Lukáš Zapletal 	modulelist 	LZAP

Please read http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover for the 
official procedure (and its motivation) for module takeover.

In a nutshell: What we need to see is "proof" of how you tried to 
contact the original author(s). Just send them a mail with modules@ in 
CC and contact us again a few weeks down the road. Then we can transfer 
ownership of the namespace. Thank you for your patience in this, but 
such issues are delicate and require care.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
