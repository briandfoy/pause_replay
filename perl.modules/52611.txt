Mike:

On the suggestion of brian d foy at CPAN I'm resending this request  
so that we can resolve the situation sooner rather than later.

I was wondering if you have any interest in releasing a new version  
of MARC::Record [1] to CPAN from CVS on SourceForge [2]. There hasn't  
been a release since Dec 2004 but development has continued afoot  
since then.

The reason I ask is that the Evergreen people [3] have spent the last  
2 years building an open source ILS for the State of Georgia [4] and  
they are dependent on some functionality that is in the CVS trunk.  
Their install process is a bit stymied because the M::R on CPAN is  
way out of date. I also get routine emails from M::R users around the  
world who don't understand why the latest/greatest isn't on CPAN.

Evergreen isn't alone: the Koha opensource library system also relies  
on heavily on MARC::Record. If you aren't interested in this I (or  
possibly someone at ESILibrary) would be willing to take over  
ownership of the module--or at least co-ownership so that updates can  
be pushed out to the CPAN world at large.

Let me know what you think.
