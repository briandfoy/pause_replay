Hello,

The link below to the password change page did not work.  The error I =
received was "

"You tried to authenticate the parameter ABRA=3DJWHITE.[...], but the =
database doesn't know about this token."

(this an automatic mail sent by a program because somebody asked for
it. If you did not intend to get it, please let us know and we will
take more precautions to prevent abuse.)

Somebody, probably you, has visited the URL

    https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=3Dmailpw

and asked that you, "JWHITE", should get a ticket that enables the
setting of a new password. Here it is (please watch out for line
wrapping errors of your mail reader and other cut and paste errors,
this URL must not contain any spaces):

    =
https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=3Dchange_passwd;ABRA=3DJWHITE.f=
f4978d10dfbf13f9f0e6dfab4b8ae0f

Please visit this URL, it should open you the door to a password
changer that lets you set a new password for yourself. This ticket
will expire within a few hours. If you don't need it, do nothing. By
the way, your old password is still valid.

Thanks,

The PAUSE
