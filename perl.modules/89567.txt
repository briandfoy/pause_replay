Hi Modules... or whoever is on the receiving end of this.

This is MIKER	 Michael Robinton

I'm the author of several modules and have co-author status on 
Net::Interface.

I took over this module several years ago and re-wrote it completel 
to add numerous new features and capabilities, with the assistance 
and advice of Jens Rehsack  REHSACK

I have limited resources to further develop this module and Jens has 
kindly offered to take over primary responsibility.

The orginal author that started this module has not been heard from 
since for years and we have been unable to contact him. Please either 
remove him as primary or at a minimum, grant Jens Rehsack co-author 
status so he can maintain Net::Interface.

Thanks,

Michael Robinton
MIKER
