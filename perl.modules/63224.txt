The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Gnaw
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: create grammars, parse text with subroutines
  userid:      GSLONDON (Greg London)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parse::RecDescent

  rationale:

    The main difference between Parse::Gnaw and other parser packages
    is that Parse::Gnaw allows the user to define grammars and parse
    text using nothing but normal perl subroutine calls.

    There is no intermediate parser language like regular expressions.
    Even Parse::RecDescent has it's own language for defining grammars
    and then create the parser as some opaque code reference.

    subrules with Parse::Gnaw are simply perl subroutines. Grammars are
    defined using Parse::Gnaw functions such as "a" for "alternation",
    perl strings for literals, and array references to group different
    pieces of a grammar.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
