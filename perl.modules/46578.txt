     why:

    I am contributing a module called Citi.pm. It contains methods that
    log in to a citibank credit card account online using WWW::Mechanize
    and HTML::TokeParser and provide information like statement balance,
    monthly statement information, minimum payment due, etc. A Citi.pm
    module that has several methods: login ($user, $pass) -> logs in a
    user to a citibank credit card account get_balance -> pulls balance
    get_statement -> returns 2-dimmensional array storing monthly
    transaction data. I will be adding more methods in the future. The
    methods described can be used in a perl application designed to
    organize one's financial information without having to deal with the
    intricacies of logging to the online account, dealing with
    dirty/incorrect HTML and pulling the important data in clean format
    for various uses.
