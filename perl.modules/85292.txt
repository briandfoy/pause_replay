The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Eve
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: An object oriented framework with events.
  userid:      ZINIGOR (Igor Zinovyev)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Github repo: https://github.com/zinigor/eve

  similar:
    Catalyst Mojolicious

  rationale:

    This module is meant to be a traditional MVC-style application
    framework that relies heavily on dependency injection, test driven
    development and in future will use asynchronous event support. It is
    designed to have a uniform object oriented interface for all objects
    and uses abstractions for all foreign libraries and data providers.

    Hopefully it will include a lot of plugins and abstractions to
    support different databases, template engines, input protocols and
    so on. That is why I think this module requires a standalone
    namespace and that it must be a proper name.

  enteredby:   ZINIGOR (Igor Zinovyev)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 24 10:21:12 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Eve               bdpOg An object oriented framework with events.    ZINIGOR
