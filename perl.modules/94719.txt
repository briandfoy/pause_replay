     why:

    Games::Literati has had an unfixed bug since reported by GBROCK in
    2007. I have a bug-fix, as well as feature improvements. I am in the
    process of searching for the original 2003 author, to ask for
    co-maint (and, if not available, will be asking to adopt), but will
    need a PAUSE ID to do either.
