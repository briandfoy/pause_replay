Hi Andy,

could you please accept my apologies that we get to you so late in the
game, but the last days were dominated by so many different workloads
that we're still in the process of claims assessment instead of fixing.

I believe you're still expecting something entirely different from
"being in TKML" than it is. "Being in TKML" only means that you can
pass permissions to others, not that you automatically _have_
permissions. It means that these people can act on modules owned by
TKML like admins, not like owners. You are an admin, but if you upload
Tk.pm, it will not be indexed. Being an admin gives you a different
kind of rights. It's a bit like in IMAP. For indexing purposes you
must be owner or co-maintainer, not admin.

Andy, as you can see when following this thread back on
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/ this was a major
accident and a chain of misunderstandings.

It's my great desire to get things back into a state that is more or
less equivalent to the state before but unfortunately I'm not sure
what exactly is broken right now. Given this as a "letter of intent"
can you help us identify further courses of action?

Nope, as I said above, for indexing you need to pass over ownership or
co=maintinership, not a group account.

I'd like to remove nothing before we have reached the status quo ante.

It would good if we all could get over that.

What about the following procedure: Everybody tells me *what* they
think needs be done (not necessarily *how* it can be achieved). I'll
then try to do all that myself in the hope that I know best how PAUSE
works:). After that I'd report on sucesses and failures, and we rinse,
repeat until everybody is happy with the result.

Please let me know what you consider broken at the moment. (I'm not
yet trying to fix anything because I must be sure that we do not take
contradictory measures)

Thanks,
