The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Menus
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Create Powerful CMD Enviroment Menus
  userid:      REEDFISH (Brian Kelly)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms

  similar:
    Cmenu

  rationale:

    Menus.pm was written to provide perl programmers with a SIMPLE
    utility for doing Menus in the CMD environment without Curses, and
    using nothing but native perl. The resulting interface is simple and
    will work in ANY CMD enviroment - even native DOS. Yet with this
    module, users can manipulate large amounts of data, and navigate
    multiple levels of menu interfaces that can build dynamically based
    on user or programmatic input. It is perfect for situations where
    powerful, customizable Menus are needed or desired, but where time,
    resources and expertise are in short supply, and/or where more
    complex (or "flashy") Menus via GUI's or Cmenu is simply overkill.
    If there was a "MENU" category that contained both Cmenu and Menus -
    that would be perfectly acceptible. However, since Cmenu has it's
    *own* category, and Menus wouldn't really *fit* in a Cmenu category,
    my request is that the Namespace - MENUS - be created, or the
    Namespace - MENU - be created that will encompass BOTH Cmenu and
    Menus.

The resulting entry would be:
