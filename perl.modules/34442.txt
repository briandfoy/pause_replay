No, I didn't know about that.  But what I see there are two things:
  1) it follows the Geo::Coordinates approach: one class per
     projection system
  2) no movements in the last 6 months

However, there are at least 200 projections, and they often have
their own specific parameters.  Therefore, "my" points have
two values plus a projection name.

I started out with Geo::Point, beautiful name, but realized how much
more complicated the Geo 3D (with altitude) is: much more complex
calculations.  To leave room in the name-space to develop a (separate)
module for that, I added the 2D name part.

   Geo::2D->newProjection(latlong => ...);
   my $point = Geo::2DPoint->new($x, $y, 'latlong');

The projections are handled by the existing Geo::Proj4 library.  But
the abstraction I create is really useful.

When a country's is described in geo-coordinates, you are talking
about thousands of points.  It is bad for performance to add 3D
checks and complications to those points. That's my most important
reasoning behind that '2D' thing.
