Hey modules,

I recently revamped POE::Component::SNMP and in discussions with the
previous owner of the module, TCAINE, he decided to bestow ownership
on me.

Now we're having trouble getting CPAN to accept uploads of this module
from me.  He has apparently logged in and changed the permissions, but
I'm still not seeing POE::Component::SNMP in the list (altho a
submodule, ::Dispatcher, was indexed as having no conflicts).

What makes this particularly frustrating was the TCAINE had retired
PoCo::SNMP!

I have attempted to re-upload the same distribution of my program, to
no avail.  Should I increment the version number (0.90 -> 0.91)?
Lemme know!

(Thanks in advance :-)
