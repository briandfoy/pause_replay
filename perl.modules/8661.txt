That's great to know. Actually having a copy of the standard, rather
than just working from various people's interpretations of something
they read about someone else who had glimpsed a copy of the standard,
would be really helpful. As I said in my earlier note, I will be glad to
change the default behavior of the module, as soon as I have sufficient
tuits. The latest version from CVS is on CPAN, and if someone wants to
submit a patch, I'd be glad to apply it. I'm not trying to be
argumentative at all. Having an output format containing something that
nobody will actually understand seems a little odd to me. But I simply
don't have the time to work on it this month.
