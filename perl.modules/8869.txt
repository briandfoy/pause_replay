The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Lister
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Multidimensional Struct to HTML Nested List
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI DataDumper

  rationale:

    CGI.pm's ul, ol, and dl functions are nice, but they only go skin
    deep. HTML::Lister dereferences internally and recursively calls
    itself to create nested HTML list entities from multidimensional
    constructs. It can be used to generate HTML from a complex
    structure, or even simply for debugging purposes, by dumping the
    contents of a CGI or session object straight to the browser.

    DataDumper performs a similar function, but it does not format the
    results as HTML for a web browser. Using it inside a web page for
    active browser-based debugging necessitates a PRE tag, and, besides,
    it can't aesthetically be used for non-debugging purposes, whether
    aesthetics stop most CGI programmers or not.

    I chose the namespace HTML::Lister because the module generates
    HTML from perl data structures and the HTML it creates is composed
    of the three main HTML list entities, UL, OL, and DL. Basically, it
    makes HTML lists.

    I believe my module should be listed in the module list because
    nothing else does what it does by itself.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
