Anyone have any name comments on this? It's pretty much the same semantic
space as URI, URI::URL etc., so the top-level category seems reasonable. 
I wonder whether it should perhaps be more specific, as it's really only
addressing HTTP query strings, but URI::Query::HTTP and alternatives seem 
pretty clumsy. Maybe it becomes a facade if we want to support other types
of query string down the road. 

Any comments?

Cheers,
Gavin
