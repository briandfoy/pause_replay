I like the more descriptive name, but the package is not just for
polynomials, it is for any function=2E I do plan to build on this to provi=
de
functions to work with polynomials=2E Perhaps Math::Function::Roots, and t=
he
next modules could be Math::Polynomial::Roots? Is changing the name as
simple as removing the one package and uploading a new one?

Regards,

Spencer
