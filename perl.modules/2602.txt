Hello,

The modlist says, "Send mail to modules@perl.org before you upload, so we
can help you select a name."  So...

I have a set of modules for grabbing bug-related data out of a Bugzilla
database (see <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla/>) and reporting
on them.  The modules do not provide 'update' abilities -- just reporting
-- and the package includes one script (with more possibly to come) to
send out reports (through CGI, cron | /bin/mail, etc.).  The functionality
is not provided by Bugzilla and may be considered an extension to that
package.  The purpose is mostly to help development teams track progress
in closing bugs over time (in other words, are we creating more bugs than
we close?).

I've been calling the package (and the main module) Bugzilla::Reports.  I
imagine one of these categories might be appropriate:

  3) Development Support
  7) Database Interfaces
 23) Miscellaneous Modules

What do you think?

Thanks, and hi to Andreas if he's still around.
