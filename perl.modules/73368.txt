The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PerlPanel
  DSLIP:       bmphg
  description: Lean, easily extendable applet panel
  userid:      NICZERO (Nic Sandfield)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/perlpanel-devel/

  similar:

  rationale:

    PerlPanel is a framework (for UI applets) that lets the user plugin
    pre-existing applets or their own home-grown applets. Hence it is
    similar in provision to the likes of 'Catalyst' and
    'CGI::Application', but sits mostly as a client-side application.

    The core is PerlPanel.pm; the real value I would provide to CPAN
    users is under PerlPanel::Applet::* The applets are released
    separately and individually, and this is where most of the CPAN
    activity would be.

    The framework is already very stable, but there is much activity
    around improving existing applets and adding new ones, many having
    dependencies on other CPAN modules.

    This is one of my first packages ready for CPAN, so I am prepared
    that I might need to provide more explanation, or perhaps a change
    of direction.

    yours, Nic
