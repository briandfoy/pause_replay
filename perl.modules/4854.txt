I would like to contribute a module to CPAN for controlling GPIB
based test equipment from Perl.  GPIB is the standard interface on
electronic test equipment like logic analyzers, spectrum analyzers, etc.
This module has been in common use for a couple of years and is
available on my website.  People sometimes having trouble finding
my website, so I think it's time to contribute it to CPAN.

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
gpib           MdcO  Access GPIB test equipment from Perl         JEFFMOCK


There is not a common location for discussion on the net, but it
is sometimes discussed on the "labview" mailing list, sorry I don't
have more info.

I would like to use the namespace "gpib" for my modules.  I have a base class
module "gpib" and subclassed modules for various pieces of test equipment
like "gpib::hp33120a" (hp33120a is popular piece of test equipment from 
Agilent).
