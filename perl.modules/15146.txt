Sure, whatever.

I just want a name, any name.

I don't know what the process is though: is modules@perl.org advisory
and I make the decision, or is it manditory?   

Tie::Hash::ComputedValue is fine with me.  So is Tie::LookupAsFunction.

I hadn't considered going three levels deep.  The suggestion of
Tie::Hash::ComputedValue leads me to have a pair of favorites:

	Tie::Hash::Computed
	Tie::Hash::Function 

So, if modules@perl.org is advisory and nobody has strong objections,
I'll use Tie::Hash::Function.  If it's more than advisory, then
please guide me.

Thanks,

-Dave
