This message I posted to module-authors recently may help explain:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/module-authors@perl.org/msg01752.html

(I could have cross-posted it here. I certainly meant to at least
tell people here that an important discussion was happening on
module-authors. So thanks for bringing this up now. Well timed.)

I'd recommend all modules@perl.org subscribers read that message.

Module List *document* was maintained by hand.  When managment of
the Module List *data* was automated there was a desire to automate
maintainance of the document but the document had a slightly richer
structure than the data. That small hurdle meant automation never
happened and the document was left unmaintained.

Around the same time search.cpan.org became functional so the
document had less relevance and busy people had other things to do.

I'll happily conceed that the *document* isn't important these days.
But I feel strongly that the *principle* (of moderated naming and
categorization) is.

The main pieces currently missing are:

1. Automated handling of module registration. [Where has that got to?]

2. Better integration of registration data into search.cpan.org
   So registration details are includes in search results, for example.

3. A 'fast path' process to register many modules that are in
   widespread use but are not registered. So then the majority of
   modules are registered and 

The alternative is just to give up. Seriously. We could just stop
banging our heads against authors uploading half baked ideas with
half-baked names (which are "self explanatory" to them).

The hope would be that out of the anarchy would rise some new
form of organization[*] (in the broadest sense) that would help
hapless users find what their looking for.

Do we want to do that? [I'm asking this question in all seriousness.]

Tim.

p.s. I think the term "Module List" should be deprecated in favor
of talking about "Registered Modules" and "module registration" etc.

[*] Presumably based on metadata, rantings, editorial reviews, download
stats and/or whatever else people can come up with.
