The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::Drawing
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Position the nodes and edges of a graph
  userid:      GENE (Gene Boggs)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    "pound perl" (rhizomatic IRC)

  similar:
    None exist, actually

  rationale:

    I chose Graph::Drawing::* because 1. the name of the mathematical
    discipline is "graph drawing", and 2. There is a top level namespace
    called "Graph" already.

    Graph::Layout might be a more meaningful name, but due to
    historical reasons, that would be misleading and possibly annoying
    to the purists out there.

  enteredby:   GENE (Gene Boggs)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun 28 03:03:58 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::Drawing         cdpOp Position the nodes and edges of a graph      GENE
