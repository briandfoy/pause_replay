Can we at least take proactive action and delete the PAUSE index items
for that directory so we get no collateral damage while DOMIZIO
patches up his Makefile.PL files?  That won't stop anyone from saying
"install DOMIZIO/Danger-Stuff.tar.gz", but at least people won't run
across the modules by accident having seen them in the recent modules
list.  I had installed a few of them myself, for example.
