The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Script::Daemonizer
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Turns your script into a UNIX daemon process
  userid:      KROMG (Giacomo Montagner)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup

  similar:
    App::Daemon, Proc::Daemon, Net::Daemon, Daemon::Simple

  rationale:

    As stated in description, this module is meant to easily turn a
    script/program into a daemon, yet it has some configurable
    behaviour. It tries to fully cover the basics of daemonizing, but
    also to NOT include other features (such as process control, or
    specific network features) and, for the sake of simplicity, it tries
    to provide useful defaults, to allow fast usage without the need to
    go through time-consuming documentation (like that of Log4perl).
    It's written looking at how a "standard" UNIX daemon behaves, trying
    to implement tha same behaviour via a single sub call (daemonize()).
    To summarize, I tried to get the best from other daemonizing
    modules, strip what I think is superfluous, and implement what I
    think they lack. Sources are available at
    https://github.com/kromg/Script-Daemonizer

  enteredby:   KROMG (Giacomo Montagner)
  enteredon:   Wed Jan 16 16:50:57 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Script::
::Daemonizer      Rdpfp Turns your script into a UNIX daemon process KROMG
