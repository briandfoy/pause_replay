Steffen / cosimo, thanks for the note. I have for several years been  
planning to get back to this old love of mine but have simply not had  
time to do so. I had been planning to swap out to xml::sax because the  
dom parseing could well be the source of your leaks.

I'd be very appreciative if you could fix the issues you find.

The source tree is on sourceforge. If you like I can give you  
developer status there.

Patrick.
