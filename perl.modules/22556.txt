The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WML::Easy
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: Creates quick WML content
  userid:      CARTER (M Carter Brown)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Wireless Chat, and Messageboard:
    http://www.mcarterbrown.com/index.wml

  similar:
    WML::Card WML::Deck

  rationale:

    The module I'm currently working on will allow users to create a
    new WML page, with one line of code. They can then print out
    information from their HTML database, or something new, use the
    module easily convert HTML code to the appropirate WML script, and
    then end the page.

    Allowing anyone to easily run a WML information site or even a
    dynamic site as the one that was built here:
    http://www.mcarterbrown.com/index.wml where I have a Wireless Mesage
    Board, and a Wireless Multiple Chat rooms, built on the basis of
    this module.

    The other modules that I listed above are also good. But also very
    complex. So complex so, that you really need to know WML well.

    I'm writing it so that even the most novice module user can easily
    create a WML page, hence the WML::Easy

  enteredby:   CARTER (M Carter Brown)
  enteredon:   Sat Jul 26 19:37:42 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WML::
::Easy            adpfg Creates quick WML content                    CARTER
