Hi there,

about a month ago I used PAUSE's webform to register the
AutoLoader::Register namespace. It looks as though this request hasn't
yet been processed. The following is the data previously entered by me:

  modid:       AutoLoader::Register
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Autoloads only registered methods
  userid:      VPARSEVAL (Tassilo von Parseval)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    AutoSplit, SelfLoader

  rationale:

    AutoLoader::Register takes via import() method-names along with
    either closures or stringified anonymous subs and makes itself a
    superclass of the class use()ing it. Calls to any of the registered
    methods will compile the code and mungle it into the caller's
    namespace so that further calls to the methods wont trigger the
    AutoLoader::Register::AUTOLOADER again. Apart from that it allows
    for custom exception-handling if an unknown method has been called.
    More to it, you can have AutoLoader::Register import arbitrary
    methods from arbitrary classes into your own class without the
    necessity of setting up an inheritance-relation. It provides its own
    can()-method so that even autoloaded methods will be correctly
    reported (as opposed to UNIVERSAL::can)

I am not quite sure (nor dogmatic) about chapter 2 of the modlist...it
would certainly fit in there but the specification as core-module makes
me a little uneasy about that. Alternatively, chapter 20 (control flow)
would be fine as well.

So could please someone pick up this request? Thank you.

Tassilo
