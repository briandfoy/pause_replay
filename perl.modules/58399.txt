re: http://cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_adopt_module

I'll post something to a newsgroup as soon as I setup my news account at work, 
per the above link.

X12::Parser is a module to parse the ANSI X12 format which is used for various 
bits of data exchange with places like insurance companies and other large 
organizations.

The maintainer has been unresponsive to my emails (via his CPAN address, which 
as far as I know is his only available contact avenue) to process diffs or 
take over the maintainership for 3 weeks now, so I am requesting to adopt the 
module. It should be noted that the module hasn't seen a release since 2004. 
While my intent is to fix a few minor bugs initially, a deeper look at this 
code suggests that a larger rewrite might be beneficial. I'm not sure if that 
much detail matters or not for this process.

Ideally, I would like to get the original author involved in any changes; if 
you have better luck than I have had contacting him, please inform me.
