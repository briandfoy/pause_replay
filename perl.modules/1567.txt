From: ned@bike-nomad.com (Ned Konz)

I looked at the 4/6/2000 version of the modules list, and I didn't
see Archive::Zip. I sent mail on 3/21 asking to get on the list;
perhaps I was too late for this revision. Anyway, here's a copy
(updated) in case you didn't get it:

Hi, I'd like to add my module to the module list.
My CPAN ID is: NEDKONZ.

Here's the info:

Archive::Zip adpO  Provides an interface to ZIP archive files.

>From the README:
--------------
The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
read, and write Zip archive files.

Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.

Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and
enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or
other attributes queried or modified.  Their data can be compressed or
uncompressed as needed.  Members can be created from members in existing
Zip files, or from existing directories, files, or strings.

This module uses the Compress::Zlib library to read and write the
compressed streams inside the files.
--------------

I have posted pointers to the comp.lang.perl.modules and
comp.lang.perl.announce newsgroups.

I have uploaded it to PAUSE:

/authors/id/N/NE/NEDKONZ/Archive-Zip-0.07.zip
/authors/id/N/NE/NEDKONZ/Archive-Zip-0.07.tar.gz

Several people are actively using this module under several different
operating systems including Linux, Solaris, and Win32.

Thanks.
