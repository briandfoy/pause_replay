The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::CELL
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Configure, Error-handle, Localize, and Log
  userid:      SMITHFARM (Nathan Cutler)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://sourceforge.net/p/perl-cell/discussion/general/

  similar:

  rationale:

    Configuration, error-handling, localization, and logging may seem
    like diverse topics. In my experience, however, they are closely
    interrelated. Together, they constitute "minimal basic
    infrastructure" for mid-sized applications.

    In other words, if I'm writing an application, it makes sense for
    it to: * have sane defaults pre-set by the application developer *
    have the defaults be easily overridable by the site administrator *
    have elegant error handling (no dying, croaking, etc.) * be
    object-oriented * be localizable into multiple languages in a
    straight-forward manner, without having to rewrite anything * log to
    syslog in a way that makes it easy to capture the application's log
    messages in a separate logfile

    There are lots of other things applications can be, do, and have,
    but in my mind, these features are fundamental. What is more, they
    are interrelated and it makes sense (to me) to have them together in
    a single, re-usable package.

    Originally I intended for the package to be named "CELL", but
    App::CELL will be just fine. I'll be happy to rename it to something
    else, as per your suggestion, as long as the name doesn't get too
    long.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::CELL            adpOg Configure, Error-handle, Localize, and Log   SMITHFARM
