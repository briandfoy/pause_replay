I think Adam already told you we wouldn't approve this one.

Despite what the code might do, the name doesn't mean anything to the 
programmer who sees it. A good name tells other people what the module
does.

You might consider Acme::Steal, since that namespace holds several
other experimental modules that people don't actually use. :)
