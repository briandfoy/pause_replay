I should note that https://metacpan.org/author/GABOR (=3D the earliest auth=
or
and not to be confused with https://metacpan.org/author/SZABGAB )=E2=80=99s=
 address has
been bouncing and I also recall having problems contacting him when adopting
https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Format . He seems to have disappeared.

Thanks for the note about the File-Remove repo on GitHub, Karen! I'll start
from there.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
