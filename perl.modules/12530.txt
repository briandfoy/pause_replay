The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Timber
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Simply write messages to screen and/or file
  userid:      KEVINRICE (Kevin J. Rice)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)

  similar:
    Log::Agent, Log::Dispatch, Log::Logger (and several others) are
    somewhat similar

  rationale:

    During programming, I've found a myself writing functions to log
    messages to the screen or to a file. This was always about 35-lines
    of subroutine I re-used everywhere. Lately, though I enhanced it a
    bit and made it a module so I could retrofit it into all my old
    code.

    I've always had a need to log to both the screen and to a file with
    different logging levels. The other logging modules were either too
    complicated to set up or to simplistic for my needs, but I did have
    to add in some basic features. Overall, though, the goal was
    simplicity of use.

    Log::Timber has the following features:

    1. Writes messages to the screen and/or to a file. 2. Logging
    (threshold) levels are numeric (0=silent, 8=verbose). 3. Different
    log levels can be set for screen and file. 4. Formats can be
    different for screen and file. 5. Formats can include caller() &
    time() prefixes (configurable). 6. Log's filename can be specified
    or can be __FILE__ (changes during execution). 7. Configurable to
    (add / not add / strip all & re-add) CR/LF to end of each line. 8.
    Configurable to add HTML markup to ease viewing in HTML viewer.

    The 'cute' name may make it memorable. If people hate the name, I'm
    happy to change it to Log::BasicLog.

    But, I figure the idea of a logging function that does what most
    people need, in one module, with a simple interface, is a useful
    thing.

    It's OO perl. I'll make sure it's nice, has good tests, etc. It'll
    be brain-dead simple to install and use.
