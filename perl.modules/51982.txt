Hi everyone,

sorry for asking again, but does anyone know of any alternative contact
information for Bernd Dulfer?  I've been trying to contact him
regarding his Sybase::RepAgent and Sybase::TdsServer modules.  If I'm
unable to contact him, I'll ask to take ownership of the modules.

thanks

jason
