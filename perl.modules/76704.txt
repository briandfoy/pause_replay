The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CLI::Startup
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Simple initialization of command-line script
  userid:      BUDNEY (Leonard R Budney)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Getopt::Long, Config::Simple

  rationale:

    Good command-line scripts always support command-line options using
    Getopt::Long, and /should/ support default configuration in a .rc
    file, such as Config::Simple supports. At minimum that should
    include a --help option that explains the other options. Supporting
    all this takes quite a bit of boilerplate code. In my experience,
    doing it right takes several hundred lines of code that are
    practically the same in every script.

    CLI::Startup is intended to factor away almost all of that
    boilerplate. In the common case, all that's needed is a single
    hashref listing the options (using Getopt::Long syntax) as keys, and
    a bit of help text as values. CLI::Startup will automatically
    generate the command-line parsing, reading of an optional config
    file, merging of the two, and creation of a hash of the actual
    settings to be used for the current invocation. It automatically
    prints a usage message when it sees invalid options or the --help
    option. It automatically supports an option to save the current
    settings in an rc file. It supports a --version option that prints
    $::VERSION from the calling script, and a --manpage option that
    prints the formatted POD, if any, in the calling script. All the
    grunt work is handled for you.

    CLI::Startup also supports additional options to disable any of
    those options EXCEPT --help, and to specify default options. It
    slightly enhances Getopt::Long behavior by allowing repeatable
    options to be specified /either/ with multiple options /or/ with a
    commalist honoring CSV quoting conventions. It also enhances
    Config::Simple behavior by supporting options with hashes as values,
    and by un-flattening the contents of INI files into a two-level
    hash.

    For convenience, CLI::Support also supplies a die() and warn()
    method that prepend the name of the script and postpend a newline.
