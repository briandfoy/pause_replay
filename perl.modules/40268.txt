     why:

    I have written a perl module and provided a rough POD documentation
    footer and would like to contribut it to cpan. It consists of a
    database format, in plain text, that allows for special delimiters
    and other features that are specialized for specific types of data,
    such as simple ID numbering schemes and other uses. It is intended
    to be extendable and very easy to use for developing rudimentary
    databases. I also have other modules I would like to contribute, but
    at this time I am still in the process of looking for bugs and would
    like to contribute more in the future.
