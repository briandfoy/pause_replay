The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Ellipsoid
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Lat, lon calculations on earth's surface
  userid:      JGIBSON (Jim Gibson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Geo::Distance Geo::Coordinates

  rationale:

    There are several other geographical calculation modules in the Geo
    namespace.

    This module implements a known algorithm for accurately calculating
    range and bearing between two locations on an ellipsoid (the earth)
    given by latitude and longitude. The closest existing module is
    Geo::Distance, but that uses approximations and provides other
    functions, such as searching for closest points. The proposed module
    is more accurate but slower, and it provides the inverse task of
    calculating a location given a reference location and the range and
    bearing from the reference location. The proposed module
    (Geo::Ellipsoid) could be used by Geo::Distance to provide more
    accurate results.

    The Geo::Coordinates module documentation says that it is
    incomplete and not to use it.

The resulting entry would be:
