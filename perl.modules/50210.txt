Hi
I have got myself into a bit of a mess with my username.

I originally registered my preferred user id 'ICYDEE' when I was at the 
Oxford University Press but my registration did not come through before 
I unexpectedly finished my contract there so I no longer had access to 
my OUP email address. This meant I cannot complete my registration 
process or request a new password.

Since I had a module I wanted to upload I created a new account 'ICD' 
which I have used since.

However, I much prefer to use my id ICYDEE since this is one I have used 
elsewhere for nearly 10 years.

Is there any way you can help me to gain access to ICYDEE without me 
having access to my Oxford University Press email address (which as far 
as I know is now disabled)?

Regards
Ian Docherty
