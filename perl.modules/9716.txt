   FYI Here is the reason why I picked MacOSX:: RELUCTANTLY.  Mac:: 
should work on both world but mine does not.  Aqua:: is the Name of UI 
so it should belong to modules that does things like Tk:: or Qt::.
   The biggest contender was Darwin:: but BSD world of MacOS X is the 
prime example that's wrong.  If Darwin:: were appropriate, native /bin/ 
commands would have treated resource fork like MacOS. Oh well....
