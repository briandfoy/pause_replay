That would be extremely useful, as the last CPAN update was in 2002.

Taking the 0.67 and building a quick git repository from it got me to  
here:

http://goatse.co.uk/~bobtfish/FCGI/.git
(gitweb at http://goatse.co.uk/~bobtfish/Gitalist/script/gitalist.fcgi/summary?p=FCGI%2F.git)

The patch from OpenBSD looks totally worth applying and a no-brainer  
so that's in master, and there are two other patches which I've put in  
branches which look reasonable, but could do with a little more work  
before I'd apply them.

I'll put some more work into brushing these up and taking a look at  
the other RTs in the queue later this week, hoping to rebase my work  
onto the more current code when it becomes available.

Cheers

P.S. Apologies for breakage in the gitweb viewer if you try and use it  
- I don't think diffs work at the moment, it's a somewhat alpha  
project to convert gitweb.cgi nearer to sanity..
