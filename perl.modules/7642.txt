I uploaded Test-More-0.08.tar.gz about a month ago.  For some reason
it hasn't been symlinked into modules/by-module/Test/.  This might
have something to do with it's odd nature.


A while ago I merged together Test::More and Test::Simple into a
single tarball Test-Simple-X.YY.tar.gz.  The Test-More-X.YY.tar.gz
line of tarballs was discontinued.  Unfortunately, people looking for
Test::More still found the Test-More tarballs, downloaded and
unknowingly installed very old versions of Test::More.

Ah ha!  I'll make a final version of Test-More.  When you run
Makefile.PL, it will just print

************************************************************************
Test::More is now distributed in the Test::Simple tarball.  This is
NOT a new version.  There will be no more seperate Test::More
distributions.

If you want a new version, download the latest Test::Simple tarball.
Better yet, use the CPAN shell and it'll just figure it out for you.

This installation will now puke and die.
************************************************************************

and die.  So you can't accidentally use an old version.

This may have confused the indexer.


What's the proper solution here?  Ask one of you to manually apply the
symlink, or simply delete all the Test-More tarballs via PAUSE?
