Subject: Module submission Statistics::Sequences::Turns

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences::Turns
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: Kendall's test for turning-points
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil

  similar:
    Statistics::Sequences::Joins and Statistics::Sequences::Runs

  rationale:

    This module implements a test of randomness that is suitable for
    data of the continuous numerical type, where it is meaningful to
    speak of values, on trial i, that might be higher or lower than the
    value on trials i - 1 and i + 1; the trial's neighbours. It is
    particularly commended for time-series, testing if a numerical
    sequence shows systematic rather than random oscillations.

    Provides an alternative conceptualization of how a numerical
    sequence might oscillate between higher and lower values than in the
    Runs and Joins test, while not being limited, as are the latter, to
    testing dichotomous/binary data.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Sequences::
::Turns           RnpOp Kendall's test for turning-points            RGARTON
