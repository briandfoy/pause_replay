I don't know if Mr King will assume this is some kind of plot, but I have to
object to either 'Import' or 'Exporter::Import' being considered for his
module, as they are both presently being considered (or so I imagine) for a
module I submitted some time ago.

While I have every sympathy for the people reading modules@perl.org
<mailto:modules@perl.org> , I find it very difficult to deal with such an
arbitrary and silent system. Without seemingly constant badgering, no email
is forthcoming from the members of that list - whoever they may be. And that
is a second point. The star chamber techniques employed by the list do
little to put someone at ease. The only person who has really communicated
to me from that list has also implied that they have no decision making
authority.

I don't think anyone can make a strong positive argument about the quality
of the CPAN module naming policies when there is a by-category index to the
repository. But I think the blame for any naming faults lies in English, not
in Perl.

		I'd prefer a name below Exporter:: or Alias:: and not a root
level
		namespace, either Exporter::Import or Exporter::Importer. Or
I'd even
		prefer to have it split into two modules with one doing the
aliasing,
		maybe Alias::Package and the other one does the globbing in
@INC,
		maybe Alias::Package::WholeSale or some such (the latter
being meant
		ironic but without a smiley).

		If you'd split it into two, I'd expect, people would be less
annoyed
		by the invention. I personally regard only the wholesale
directory
		importing stuff as misguided, but I'm not going to repeat
the
		arguments that have already been said about that.

		This question always arises when somebody exports or when
somebody
		imports, so I'd like to keep Exporter as the top level.

		We are not talking about including, we are talking about
namespace
		sharing which is quite a normal thing in the perl world.

		I believe this doesn't count as a strong argument.
