Hi modules people

I'm currently trying to sort out the situation regarding the
distribution of XML:SAX::Base.  My question is: did it work?

The back story is that XML::SAX::Base was released on CPAN, but some
time later Matt Sergeant did a release of XML::SAX that included the
XML::SAX::Base distribution as a subdirectory.  This meant there were
two versions of XML::SAX::Base on CPAN.  I subsequently took over
maintenance of XML::SAX and was blissfully unaware of the conflict and
continued to make releases of XML::SAX with XML::SAX::Base included.

The problem was reported to me quite some time ago but I have only just
made time to resolve it.

The action I took was to create a new release of XML::SAX::Base using
the files out of the XML::SAX distribution since these seemed to include
a number of small fixes applied since the 1.04 release on CPAN.  I also
created a new release of XML::SAX (0.99) without the XML::SAX::Base
subdirectory and with an added dependency on XML::SAX::Base version
1.05.

I then uploaded the two releases in this order:

  XML-SAX-Base-1.05.tar.gz
  XML-SAX-0.99.tar.gz

I'm not sure if the order of uploads is important.  I chose that order
because I wanted to be sure that the dependency for XML-SAX was
available at the time of the upload.

I wonder however if the CPAN indexer may have ignored my XML-SAX-Base
upload due to the presence of the version included in the then-current
release of XML-SAX.

Please let me know if I need to do anything more to resolve the issue.

Regards
Grant
