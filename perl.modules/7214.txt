    As someone who adds a lot of the new users, I need to see the new
user notices, so that I don't waste my time trying to re-add users that
somebody else took care of.

    I don't usually have much use for the user update messages, but some
of them matter to me (particularly when an author has asked me how to do
something unusual or complicated with their account or a mailing list).
And if you don't want to read them, there's always procmail . . . .

    - Kurt
