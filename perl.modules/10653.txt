I wish to rescind the following namespace request.  It seemed like a
good idea, but when I tested under Windows, case-insensitive filenames 
got in the way. "use Constant" is equivalent to "use constant" under
Windows (and for all I know, some other platforms).

I have renamed the module to Readonly.pm, and will upload it under
that name, and will redo the namespace registration under that name.

I apologize for any trouble this has caused.
