All -

    I am resubmitting my amended request to register Tree as a module
name. Per Adam Kennedy's response that he wished to see what some of
the current Tree::* authors feel, I contacted them. The following have
responded:

    Stevan Little (Tree::Simple, Tree::Binary, Tree::Visitor::*)
    Sean Burke (Tree::DAG_Node)
    Kyle Burton (Tree::MultiNode)
    Yosef Meller (Tree::Numbered, Tree::Numbered::DB)
    Brian Jepson / Aaron Mackey (DBIx::Tree)

    I contacted these authors specifically because their modules are
the primary ones suggested when a question like this comes up on
Perlmonks. Other than HTML::Tree (which is outside the scope of this
project), I couldn't find any other modules that had been recommended.

    The response, for the most part, has been one of support. I am
already a co-maintainer on Tree::Simple and Tree::Binary. Sean, Kyle,
and Yosef have all offered co-maintainer status for their modules.
Brian Jepson indicated that he would be willing to add that status,
but he needed to discuss it with Aaron Mackey, the current
co-maintainer.

    My intention with regards to these distributions is to provide one
more release that modifies documentation only. The documentation would
be updated to state:

    This module is now considered deprecated. No more releases will be
made. Instead, please use Tree. If you need it, there is a compat
layer provided at Tree-Compat.

    I will be released a 0.99_02 developer release to CPAN this week.
It will be in three distributions with a bundle available.

Tree:
    Tree.pm
    Tree/Fast.pm
    Tree/Binary.pm

Tree-Persist:
    Tree/Persist.pm
    Tree/Persist/Base.pm
    Tree/Persist/DB.pm
    Tree/Persist/DB/SelfReferential.pm
    Tree/Persist/File.pm
    Tree/Persist/File/XML.pm

Tree-Compat:
    Tree/Compat.pm
    Tree/Compat/Tree/Simple.pm
    Tree/Compat/Tree/MultiNode.pm
    Tree/Compat/Tree/DAG_Node.pm

Bundle-Tree - the bundle for the prior three distributions.

    With regards to the current Tree::Binary distribution, it's
version is 0.07. Within the Build.PL for Tree, there will be a check
to see if the Tree::Binary v0.07 is installed. If it is, I will ask
the user if they wish to continue the installation, noting the
deprecated nature of the module.

Thanks,
Rob
