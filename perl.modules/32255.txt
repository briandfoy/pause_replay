The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OOPS
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Easy OO to DBMS mapper for complex data
  userid:      MUIR (David Muir Sharnoff)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Pixie MLDBM::Easy ObjStore Object::Transaction

  rationale:

    This module has the potential to be very widely used. It makes perl
    data persistent with no fuss, complication, or forthought.

    OOPS stands for Object Oriented Persistent Store. It's also a word
    that reflects the difficulty in building the module.

    I have previously asked for naming suggestions.

  enteredby:   MUIR (David Muir Sharnoff)
  enteredon:   Tue May 11 05:32:56 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

OOPS              RdpOo Easy OO to DBMS mapper for complex data      MUIR
