     why:

    package XORT (XML Object Relational Translator)

    1. modules which dump relationship database data into xml format,
    which have similar structure as db schema.

    2. xml tree diff tools which compare two xml file guided by db
    dumpspec file. here the xml files dump from db and have similar
    structure as db schema, so it has 'clue' how to identify 'unique'
    node of many children nodes, compare children nodes between two
    'same' nodes only, then recursively compare sub-nodes.

    3. xml validator/loader which load xml files into db directly.
    Again, those xml files dump from db guided dumpspec file, so it
    'know' how to load correctly into db.

    4. we have extensively use those modules in flybase project, which
    exchange genomic data between xml and db. It is generic enough to be
    use any relational db as long as schema follow certain rules.
