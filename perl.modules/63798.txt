The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perlwikipedia::Module::ImageTester
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Image and copyright plugin for Perlwikipedia
  userid:      DCOLLINS (Dan Collins)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Uses various methods of analysis of an uploaded file on the English
    Wikipedia to determine its copyright status and check to see that
    applicable policies are being followed. Can also tag violations, fix
    problems, and notify uploaders. Currently only functional on the
    english version, however I'd like it to be on CPAN so that other
    users can localize it to their own wiki.

The resulting entry would be:

Perlwikipedia::Module::
::ImageTester     bdpOg Image and copyright plugin for Perlwikipedia DCOLLINS
