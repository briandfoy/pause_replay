Mark,
=20
It is good to see your modules in Meta::* being actively developed. =
However I have some qualms about the whole project.
=20
I cannot find any documentation as to what functionality the module =
hierarchy is supposed to provide. It's various subhierarchies do not =
seem related in any particular way.
=20
Thus, I cannot see why they should occupy a namespace together, =
especially a to lever namespace with such as 'Meta'. In fact the only =
reason for them to be under 'Meta' is that there is a company with that =
name.=20
=20
If that is the case, the right place for it would perhaps be =
'Acme::Meta' or somesuch.=20
=20
But if they don't really belong together at all (they don't seem to), =
just put the subhierarchies in the namespaces where they belong, and =
maintain a bundle 'Bundle::Acme::Meta', 'Bundle::TheMetaCompany' or =
somesuch.=20
=20
Or better yet, just distribute the programs from the =
http://www.cpan.org/scripts section and have them state in their =
installation guides which modules are prerequisites.
=20
=20
Sorry if this comes out a bit harsh; I really do appreciate that people =
publish their work on CPAN, as that is the #1 reason why perl's so damn =
wonderful.
=20
I just think it's important that CPAN be used as more than just the =
workarea of every-and-all (however clever) perl developer. I'm not =
advocating any particular quality control over CPAN (the only module I =
maintain there is one of which I am particularly unproud), just a =
minimum of respect for everybodys time and mindspace.
=20
=20
regards,

ps. In no way do I represent the opinion of anybody but myself here; =
especially not of the company through which I send this.
