Request to register new user

fullname: Mark Palmer
  userid: PALMER
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I'm the author for the IPPhone module (MRPALMER), but I'm no longer
    able to login. I would like to fix a bug that was submitted 2 weeks
    ago. My old employer was IBM but I no longer work for IBM so the
    email address on my account is not valid.

    If I could keep the MRPALMER userid, that would be preferred.
