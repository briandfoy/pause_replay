The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::PerlySense
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: IntelliSense for Perl
  userid:      JOHANL (Johan Lindström)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    use.perl.org, it's own mailing list, the parse-perl mailing list

  similar:
    Some modules that analyze an executing Perl program (not quite the
    same), CPANXR is similar in approach in that it also uses PPI

  rationale:

    Devel::PerlySense is an IntelliSense style utility for editors.
    Conveniently navigate and browse the code and documentation of your
    project and Perl installation. It's currently integrated with Emacs
    (like this: http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=27275&cid=41512),
    but other editors/environments could benefit as well.

    I suggest the Devel:: namespace because it's related to Perl
    development (duh :) in a fairly general way.

    /J

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::PerlySense      bmpOp IntelliSense for Perl                        JOHANL
