The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::HideConsole
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Hide Windows console window for GUI apps
  userid:      PHATWARES (phatWares LLC)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I chose to name this module "Win32::HideConsole" because it uses
    both "Win32" and "Win32::API" modules, and the "HideConsole" part is
    a good description of what it does.

    This approach is a unique way to hide the Windows console for GUI
    applications. Other methods I have seen typically involve altering
    "perl.exe" somehow to get rid of the console when running a GUI
    application. But this simply uses some Win32::API calls to do the
    same job.

    Also, there is a problem when using the "hide console" option on
    ActiveState's "PerlApp" and when the resulting application is run on
    Windows 7. Using this module (instead of the "hide console" option
    in "PerlApp") solves that problem.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::HideConsole     Rdpfp Hide Windows console window for GUI apps     PHATWARES
