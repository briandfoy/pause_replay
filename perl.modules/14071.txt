Every wonder why the simple truth of God¹s Word almost never gets talked about in most pulpits?  Basic Word stuff like why it is not okay to ordain practicing homosexuals and lesbians as priests and clergy?  Why abortion is not okay?  Why practicing liars will never get into heaven?  Why real salvation demands true repentance and even Truth?  Why Christians may be headed for hell instead of heaven despite what they believe?

Ever wonder if the trinity is really a hoax designed to take God¹s people away from His Truth?  The words of Jesus may surprise you in this regard if you actually believe the trinity.  If you believe that Jesus is God, you owe it to your own soul to check out the website below.  With so many Christian souls headed directly for hell, do you even care?

If you do care, you can find out the truth about the Bible and why the trinity is not God¹s Truth.  The source?  It¹s all in the Bible and I will show you exactly where you can find it yourself.  Don¹t take my word, I¹ll give you God¹s Word!

I don¹t write this email lightly.  Your eternal soul or the very soul of someone you love may be at stake.  Even if you or they call themselves a Christian.  I also need your support to get the Truth of God¹s Word out to the World.  That means to Christians, Jews, Muslims and non-believers.

Check out the link below and see for yourself God¹s Word and how it speaks directly to these serious issues of our day.
