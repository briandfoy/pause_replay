     why:

    The Glade2::App Perl module allows an entire Gtk2-Perl application
    to be contained in a single XML file. This file can be XML only or
    XML embedded in a perl script. The distribution consists of a Perl
    module, used to activate the application, and a perl sciprt used to
    build the XML file from a directory tree.

    Glade2::App depends on the perl modules Gtk2 and Gtk2::GladeXML.
    The GUI builder Glade2 is used to generate the application
    framework. And the supporting Perl code is grabbed from a directory
    tree.

    There are a few modules like Glade2::App, but this module is
    current and unique in that it takes a project directory tree and
    crunches it into a single XML file or Perl script containing XML.
