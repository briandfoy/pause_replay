I for one am all for Brian taking over this.  As a historical note, I tried and 
tried and tried to get in touch with GMPassos with no avail.  I sent a similar 
request as Brian's that never seemed to result in action.  In the end, I decided 
to release an unauthorized release rather than fork the existing module.  


I would say that this is an important language interface module and needs to be 
maintained.  If Brian is up to the task, it would be a good service to the 
community.

Regards,

Chris

Subject: Request to take over Statistics-R

Dear CPAN admins,

I am writing to request permission to take over the Statistics-R distribution.

The author, Graciliano Monteiro Passos (GMPASSOS; CC'ed to this
message) has not released a new version of this module since 2004
(0.02). Any attempt to contact GMPASSOS has failed.

There appears to be continued interest in this module (4 cpan
ratings), though the bug list continues to increase (13 bugs listed)
as the module remains unmaintained. This has resulted in an
unauthorized release by Christopher Brown (CTBROWN; CC'ed to this
message) in an attempt to push bug fixes to the public.

Most recently I received an email from Stefan Lang (CC'ed to this
message) asking if I could aid in getting a workable version CPAN
installable. Stefan has requested my help due to the fact that I've
already taken over maintenance of another of GMPASSOS modules
(Geo::IPfree) in order to do bug fixing.

Should my request be granted, I would do the following:

* Create a github repository
* Import GMPASSOS's last release
* Merge CTBROWN's changes
* Process the remaining RT queue
* Release version 0.04 to CPAN

From that point on I would do my best to field user requests to ensure
the module remains in a usable form.

Thanks in advance,

--
