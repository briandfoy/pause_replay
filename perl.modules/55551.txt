It does not have to be in BioPerl in order to be in the Bio:: namespace.

In fact, the BioPerl guys have seen the light so far as monolithic 
packages go, and will be themselves splitting up BioPerl.

I believe I've also seen pre-existing interfaces of some sort of pubmed 
in the BioPerl package.

It might be a good idea to co-ordinate this with them, even if it is 
separate.
