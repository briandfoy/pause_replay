I'll include the description from the POD below.  The complete POD is pretty
long.  It can be found here:

http://members.mint.net/turner/db/html/SQL/DBI.html

By the way, the module itself lives here:

http://members.mint.net/turner/db/SQLDBI-latest.tar.gz

This module provides methods for doing manipulating database tables.  It
provides methods for all of the more important SQL commands (like SELECT,
INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE, DELETE).

It endeavors to produce an interface that will be intuitive to those already
familiar with SQL.

Notable features include:

  * data_source generation for some DBD drivers.
  * Can check to make sure the connection is not stale and reconnect if it is.
  * Controls statement handles for you.
  * Can delay writes.
  * Generates complex where clauses from hashes and arrays.
  * Shortcuts (convenience functions) for some common cases. (Like
    select_all_to_hashref.)
