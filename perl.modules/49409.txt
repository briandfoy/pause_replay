I'm relying just to this module but my points apply to all of the four 
Time:: modules you have registered for.

Almost all date and time functionality has most-recently occured withing 
the domain of the DateTime:: modules.

As you don't have any community entries listed for these, I would 
appreciate it if you could have a talk to the DateTime:: guys (and 
particular the DateTime.pm author) first before registering these, to 
sanity-check your ideas.

That's not to say that I won't register them, just that we generally 
prefer that modules in crowded and contentious areas (date and time for 
example) have been peer-reviewed first.
