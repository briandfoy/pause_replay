I would like to register as a PERL MODULE developer. I plan to contribute
modules dealing with MAIL and am talking to Graham Barr about possibly
becoming the responsible author for Mail::Alias. We are planning to merge
his old Mail:Alias module with a new Alias module I have written that will
add several new features to the package while maintaining compatibility for
users of the old module.


Thanks,


Tom Zeltwanger
