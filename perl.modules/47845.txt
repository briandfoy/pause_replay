Adding ::Simple to a name doesn't really tell people much. If your
class isn't even similar to DBIx::Class, that might even be misleading.
I suggest finding a name that highlights the core feature of your

Most of the templating engines can already do that sort of thing for
you, so you can just give them a filename.
