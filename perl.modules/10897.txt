The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::HanExtra
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Extra sets of Chinese encodings
  userid:      AUTRIJUS (Autrijus Tang)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    the perl-unicode list, used by core perl Encode.pm

  similar:

  rationale:

    Perl 5.7.3 and later ships with an adequate set of Chinese
    encodings, including the most used "CP950", "CP936" (also known as
    "GBK"), "Big5", "Big5-HKSCS", "EUC-CN", "HZ", and "ISO-IR-165".

    However, the numbers of Chinese encodings are staggering, and a
    complete coverage will easily increase the size of perl distribution
    by several megabytes; hence, this CPAN module tries to provide the
    rest of them.

  enteredby:   AUTRIJUS (Autrijus Tang)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar 29 07:12:04 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::
::HanExtra        bmpOp Extra sets of Chinese encodings              AUTRIJUS
