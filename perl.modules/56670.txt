Ah, hadn't thought about this code for quite some time.  I started writing a 
'Classical Cryptography Tool Box' module just for fun back in 2002. I had most 
of a first release written at that time (missing some documentation) that 
supports 5 or so encryption methods. Then I got distracted with other things and 
never got back to it. Here's the start of the README:

> Crypt::CCTB is a collection of Perl modules consistently implementing

I don't know how useful this would be to people (I've never received any email 
asking about this package).  I'm willing to clean up what I have and release it. 
  If there is interested I would even continue work on it.   But I'd like your 
thoughts on whether it's worth releasing.
