This site <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html> seems to
differ and claims that the default is YYYY-MM-DD.  Maybe this was
changed from YYYY-WW-DD in later editions of the standard.
Unfortunately I can't check against the standard itself, cos ISO don't
publish them online.  Ain't it great working against proprietary
standards :-)

Cutting the space budget really restores my faith in humanity.  It
eliminates dreams, goals, and ideals and lets us get straight to the
business of hate, debauchery, and self-annihilation.
