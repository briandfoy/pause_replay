Request to register new user

fullname: Benjamin R. Haskell
  userid: BENIZI
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://benizi.com/
     why:

    This is request #2. (I'm assuming that I just got overlooked
    somehow? If there's something else wrong, I'd appreciate any
    feedback. Via email or benizi on perlmonks)

    original:
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2009-11/msg00059.html

    There was a module I wanted to upload back in November, an
    interface for accessing the WordNet lexical database flat file
    format. (cf. http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ )

    Differences from existing WordNet modules: 1. designed 'in-house'
    while working on the team that developed WordNet 2. more
    object-oriented than the others

    And now (what reminded me that I'd never received a reply), I'd
    also like to publish a simple module for accessing X11 Resources.

    Thanks, Ben
