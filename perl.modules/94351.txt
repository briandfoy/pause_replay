standalone Perl module...</div>=0A<blockquote id=3D"replyBlockquote" webmai=

you for clarifying this. I will create a core <a target=3D"_blank" href=3D"=
http://Ginger.pm">Ginger.pm</a> for this purpose and include it. Really it =
should be there anyway in order to describe the purpose and arrangement of =
the 'Ginger' namespace.</div><div><br></div><div>I assume that I can still =
release other deeper modules in the same package, ( Ginger::Reference::... =
), and they will properly be accepted? I already do see them CPAN, but I do=
 not see updated permissions in Pause.</div><div><br></div><div>Some additi=
onal questions that I don't see answered elsewhere, for you or anyone else =
on the list who can answer these:</div><div><br></div><div>1. I want Ginger=
::Reference to be reserved for official ginger modules. In order to make th=
at be true, do I need to also release a 'Ginger/<a target=3D"_blank" href=
=3D"http://Reference.pm">Reference.pm</a>' module in the release to ensure =
people don't add random things under that namespace?</div><div><br></div><d=
iv>2. Is it acceptable to create a 'Ginger::WebApp' namespace, and suggest =
people place Apps created using Ginger inside of that? Obviously they could=
 simply place them in the normal 'App' namespace, but I feel like it may be=
 more meaningful to home them in Ginger since they will have strong depende=
ncies upon many modules under Ginger. I say 'Ginger::WebApp' and not 'Ginge=
r::App', since 'Ginger::ShellApp' should be applications that can run under=
 a command line.</div><div><br></div><div>3. I created 'Ginger::Reference' =
to contain all the modules that are the 'Reference' implementations for cor=
e functionality of the framework. I say 'Reference' because I want people t=
o be able to write different implementations that still function with the s=
ame API. I was thinking of having those go under 'Ginger::Custom'. The advi=
ce being that the custom modules names would mirror the reference modules n=
ames. So, someone would create 'Ginger::Custom::Log::Log4J' and it would ac=
t similar to 'Ginger::Reference::Log::Default'. I want to keep user impleme=
ntations separate namespace wise so that it is clear what the "official" in=
teractions are among the core modules.</div><div><br></div><div>4. One of t=
he facets of the Framework is that it is meant to facilitate having whole w=
eb applications live in CPAN. Install a 'Ginger::WebApp::...' and it will f=
unction completely just by running a tiny script calling it. As a result, t=
hose applications will need to be serving out JS libraries. I was thinking =
of having something like "Ginger::Lib::Web::JS::JQuery", and actually placi=
ng a module containing the JQuery distribution itself. Is it acceptable for=
 me to home entire JS libraries in CPAN for this purpose? I thought of havi=
ng them download automatically from the internet, but there are people runn=
ing CPAN behind firewalls where they cannot reach the internet. If I did th=
at those people would not be able to use the WebApps as internal applicatio=
ns as easily.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks again for all help with this.=
