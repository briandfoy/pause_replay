The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attribute::GlobalEnable
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Auto export attribute functions globally
  userid:      CMONSON (Craig L. Monson)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Primarily build in global hooks to allow users to centralize global
    attribute wrappers, and auto export them to any modules that wish to
    utilize them. Also needed a way to enable and disable at compile
    time so the code would remain fast in a 'production' type
    environment. Using attributes also keeps the code much cleaner. The
    driving force was primarily for debugging / Benchmarking, but I
    suppose this could be used for anything really.

  enteredby:   CMONSON (Craig L. Monson)

The resulting entry would be:

Attribute::
::GlobalEnable    bdpfp Auto export attribute functions globally     CMONSON
