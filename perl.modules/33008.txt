     why:

    A configuration file reader module that uses a grammar from
    Parse::RecDescent. The grammar is large enough to encompass almost
    every type of config. It can even read multiple styles into the same
    hash tree.

    I was thinking of calling it Config::Magic (Config::Auto is taken).
    It's done (though I'm the only one who has tested it), and I'll
    upload it as soon as I'm approved unless I hear that I should wait.
    I wrote it because I wasn't satisfied with the flexibility of any of
    the config packages I could find in CPAN.

    Example input: Section 1 { [Section 4] #Comment style #1 //Comment
    style #2 ;Comment style #3 Monkey:1 Monkey=>2 Monkey:=3 <Section 2>
    Foo = Bar Baz { Bip:1 Pants==5 } </Section> <Tasty Cheese="3" />
    <Section 5> Foo=Bippity,boppity,boo </Section> } Output (from
    Data::Dumper - fit into space) $VAR1 = { 'Section 1' => { 'Tasty' =>
    { 'Cheese' => '3' }, 'Section' => [ { 'Foo ' => 'Bar', 'Baz' => {
    'Bip' => '1', 'Pants' => '5' }, '2' => {} }, { 'Foo' => [ 'Bippity',
    'boppity', 'boo' ], '5' => {} } ], 'Section 4' => { 'Monkey' => [
    '1', '2', '3' ] } } };
