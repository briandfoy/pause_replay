Please ignore my stupid question, because once I feel stupid enough to ask =
a=20
question and send it, a few minutes later, I figure it out.

My CPANPLUS source fetches are failing with ftp://ftp.cpan.org, and I'm new=
 on=20
the list that I can't get a the moment.

Sorry.

Subject: Bundle modules with CPANPLUS
Date: Sunday 14 May 2006 18:14
=46rom: "Eric R. Meyers" <ermeyers@adelphia.net>
To: modules@perl.org

Hello,

I realize that this is perl.org, and not cpan.org, but I'm guessing that th=
is
is the right place to ask my question, and if it isn't a namespace issue,
then please direct me to an appropriate address if you have one.

My Bundle::Modules stuff is working well with CPAN::Shell::Default , but not
with CPANPLUS::Shell::Default, and while there are a significant few bundles
like Bundle::Bugzilla listed in the module-list datafile called
03modlist.data.gz, my Bundle::Modules stuff and a lot of the other bundle
modules are not listed, and can't be installed using CPANPLUS.

Can you tell me anything about installing bundles with CPANPLUS, that is
different than using CPAN.

Thanks,

Eric
