Subject: Module submission Set::Hash

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Set::Hash
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Hashes as objects, including set methods
  userid:      DJBERG (Daniel Berger)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc, irc

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows you to manipulate hashes as objects, calling
    methods on those objects. It also includes various set methods, both
    using method names or overloaded operators, using key-value pairs
    together as a single item. Lastly, it uses the Want.pm module so
    that proper method chaining can be used.

    The name Set::Hash was chosen because it acts as both an Hash and a
    Set.

  enteredby:   DJBERG (Daniel Berger)
  enteredon:   Sat Nov 27 18:58:20 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Set::
::Hash            RdpOp Hashes as objects, including set methods     DJBERG
