Guess who it is again ...

Anyway, another module.  I would've put all these messages in one
but I didn't *plan* to actually work on all these modules that I
use at home to get them ready for CPAN in one night.  Insomnia
rules OK ... *sigh* ...

This module is a *simple* interface to Festival speech
synthesizer.  Festival actually has a Perl client module that is
included with the distribution, which is named Speech::Festival.
But I find that module difficult and confusing to use, and
over-complicated for most of my needs, I use it occasionally, but
mosts of the time this one is plenty.

This module is *much* simpler to use (you don't, for example,
need to use any of Festival's Scheme functions in your code,
which IMHO is a big plus!), on the other hand, its much less
featured than Speech::Festial.  Perhaps Speech::Festival::Simple
would be appropriate?  What do you think?


And yes, I *will* give you status and description strings for all
these modules once they're properly named and I've written the
test code for them so they can be entered into the modlist
properly :).  Actually, I would've done it tonight but my ISP is
upgrading foo and so I'm off the net and can't get a hold of the
tutorial and info that tells me exactly what information gets put
in that dammed four letter thingy!



Thanks again,
Ricky the chronic insomniac
