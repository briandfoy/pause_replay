The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Client::TCPMulti
  DSLIP:       bdpOd
  description: Light Multiple Socket Interface for POE
  userid:      TAG (Scott McCoy)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    #poe @ irc.freenode.net

  similar:
    POE::Component::Client::TCP

  rationale:

    This module is designed to be used in place of
    POE::Component::Client::TCP for instances that may make multiple TCP
    connections simultaniously. POE::Component::Client::TCP is capable
    of this, however its overhead is increadably greater since you must
    spawn a new session for each client connection. The goal of
    ::Client::TCPMulti is to accomplish all of the multiwheel
    connectivity within a single session, the reason for it being a
    seperate module instead of a suggestion for replacement of
    ::Client::TCP, is to manage all of these wheels with a single
    session, the API is slightly more complex, however not greatly,
    ::Client::TCP is still a better solution for working with only a
    single socket, since overhead will not be affected and the API is
    more simple.

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Client::
::TCPMulti        bdpOd Light Multiple Socket Interface for POE      TAG
