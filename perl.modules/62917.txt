Astro-SIMBAD-Client was uploaded today (with the offending namespace in a separate file), and PAUSE now lists Astro::SIMBAD::Client::WSQueryInterfaceService as "first-come", rather than"co-maintained". No manual intervention or further action necessary, and nothing (to my knowledge) up anyone's sleeve.
