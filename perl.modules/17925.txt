The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::InputRepository
  DSLIP:       bmpOg
  description: Widget backend for storing/manipulating text
  userid:      CORLISS (Arthur Corliss)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    I haven't found a module that will act as a text repository for
    fixed-width font rendered widgets (GUI/Curses/etc.). What this
    module provides:

    1) Cursor tracking/manipulation (transparently access/manipulation
    in either string ordinal index mode or (row, column) coordinates)

    2) Input management (methods for character/string input,
    backspaces, deletions, etc. from the cursor position)

    3) Output formatting (automatically line wraps, expands tabs,
    handles left/center/right alignment, etc.)

    4) Search/Replace functionality (from cursor position, optionally
    wrappping to the beginning)

    There's a ton of formatting/parsing modules, but none that I could
    find that concern themselves with #1 & #2, which are extremely
    important to widget writers. #3 is implemented internally for
    performance reasons (tab expansion and line wrapping, for instance,
    is about 4-5 times faster than Text::Tabs + Text::Wrap) plus the
    need to preserve characters (Text::Wrap will strip newlines from
    adjacent lines that may comprise a paragraph). #4 is also
    implemented internally since they depend/affect cursor position.

    That's the justification for my request for inclusion.

The resulting entry would be:
