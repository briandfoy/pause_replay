The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hash::MuliKey
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: hashes whose keys can be multiple
  userid:      FXN (Xavier Noria)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org,comp.lang.perl.modules,freenode#Perl

  similar:
    Tie::ListKeyedHash

  rationale:

    Rationale for name: On the one hand I'd seach for "multikey" myself
    if I was looking for such a module. On the other hand I see Tie:: as
    putting an implementation detail in the name. I prefer the name of
    my module just suggests what is about. But this can of course be
    discussed to conform to any naming policy in CPAN.

    Rationale for approach: Tie::ListKeyedHash uses a hard-coded nested
    hash created with eval() when needed behind the scenes. As a
    consequence you cannot set $hash{'foo'} = 1 and $hash{'foo','bar'} =
    3, because perl tries to assign the key 'bar' to the hashref '1',
    which results in an error.

    In Hash::MultiKey keys can be truly multiple:

    $hash{foo} = 1; $hash{"foo", "bar"} = [0..7];
    $hash{"foo","bar","baz","zoo"} = { key => "value" };

    has just three keys. It also accepts arrayrefs for a better
    performance and to allow keys containing $;.

    Since values in the internal structure are just a slot in the
    corresponding tree node, the last example does NOT result in a new
    key ["foo","bar","baz","zoo", "key"], %hash is standard in that
    regard, it just assigns multiple-keys to scalars, as usual.

    Best regards to all!

The resulting entry would be:

Hash::
