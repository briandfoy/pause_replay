The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VCI
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO Interface to Version Control Systems
  userid:      MKANAT (Max Kanat-Alexander)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://vci.everythingsolved.com/

  similar:
    VCS

  rationale:

    VCI ( http://vci.everythingsolved.com/ ) is designed to be a
    generic abstraction for version-control interfaces. It may be
    implemented in other languages than Perl in the future.

    The name "VCS" is already taken. I spoke with Greg McCarroll, the
    maintainer of "VCS", and he blessed my module, saying that he wanted
    to re-write VCS to be object-oriented, but didn't have the time. He
    offered to let me call my module "VCS2", but that still creates a
    new root-level namespace, and wouldn't make as much sense in other
    languages.

    Also, VCI drivers are implemented in the VCI::VCS namespace, and
    VCS2::VCS would be slightly awkward and confusing for users, I
    think.

    VCS::VCI would be confusing--is it a driver for the current VCS
    module? And "VCS::VCI::VCS" would be even more confusing. :-)

    The name "VCI" is modeled on "DBI", so Perl users should already be
    familiar with the convention.

    I've discussed it a fair bit on irc.perl.org, mostly in #moose, but
    that's not going to be the primary support channel, so I didn't know
    if I should list it above.

  enteredby:   MKANAT (Max Kanat-Alexander)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 27 20:46:39 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

VCI               adpOp OO Interface to Version Control Systems      MKANAT
