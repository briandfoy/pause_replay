This is an excellent suggestion. I suggest and endorse

US_DOD::STD2167A

I like your suggestion of US_DOD instead of Military very much and
will may the change when I get back from the beach tonight.

US_DOD identifies the originating activity that burns large amounts of
tax dollars, better than Military. Most other US departments and agencies,
whatever,  other countries, whatever will revise and copy it and put their
own id on it. US_DOD makes sure the right activity gets their deserved
credit for their contribution, if contribution is the correct word.

STD stays for Standard. Being the civilized world Athens of bureaucracy,
the US_DOD has standards, specs, DIDs,  whatever.  2167 cites a
large number of Data Item Descriptions (DID) that I have available for
the same top level.

The STD is fluff attribute. US_DOD and 2167 uniquely identifies it from any 
other
document in the universe in accordance with engineering drawing standards.
The A  is a revision number in accordance with engineering drawing standards.
Thus, I am opposed to a top level of Standard.

If I use my real name I own it. This is for the general public. Using a pen 
name
means I do not own but contribute. The pen name is of a friend I admired and
had the honor of knowing for 11 years, 9 months. I hope to meet him again
in 30 to 40 years but I may never see him again.

How about a new chaperid:

chapterid:   XX (Software_Development)

and putting Test:: and US_DOD::  and a few others in the new chapterid.

Just as much $ or more is spent on logistics and development tools then
on the core developers and design activities. A separate chapterid could
provide some more focus.
