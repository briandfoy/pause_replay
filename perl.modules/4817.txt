Subject: Indexer problem on search.cpan.org or on PAUSE?

It's been more than 36 hours since I have uploaded Devel::Datum to PAUSE,
and although the file appears in my CPAN directory, I am unable to locate
it on search.cpan.org:

	http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Devel%3A%3ADatum

Gives no reply.

This module was originally registered to CDE, but he gave it over to me
(RAM) for now.  Would that be a cause of problems?

P.S: On an unrelated topic, but still linked to search.cpan.org, I don't
understand how the categorization database is updated.  It seems to follow
CPAN module classification (!), but, for instance, Getargs::Long does not
appear in the Option_Parameter_Config_Processing category, and Devel::Datum
does not show up in the Development_Support category.

I've checked, and those are the categories setup on PAUSE for those modules.
