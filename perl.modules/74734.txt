Hello.

I've worked on Audio-TagLib 1.50_01 to the point where it installs with=20
taglib v1.5 without any test failures.  I'd like to release this as=20
version 1.50 and then go on to make it compatible with taglib v1.6.x.

This would be easiest if you would authorize me to be co-maintainer.=20
Alternatively, if you would prefer to maintain sole control of the=20
source, I'd be happy to forward to you the modified sources.

Either way, I'd appreciate a reply.

Best regards,

Geoffrey Leach (GLEACH@cpan.org)
