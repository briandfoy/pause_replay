Subject: Module submission Regexp::Common::debian

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Regexp::Common::debian
  DSLIP:       adprl
  description: regexps for Debian specific strings
  userid:      WHYNOT (Eric Pozharski)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have a project that I must keep on developing. This project
    became a way bloated to be anyway touchable. It needs refactoring.
    Accidentally, B<R::C::d> happened to be the first such refactored
    part. Since B<R::C::d> is anyway a module, I found no reasons to
    stay off uploading. B<Regexp::Common> provides a base API (that's
    pity it's dead upstream). I fear that some day B<R::C::d> will
    become too big and will need splitting too.

  enteredby:   WHYNOT (Eric Pozharski)
  enteredon:   Wed Dec 31 12:09:33 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Regexp::Common::
::debian          adprl regexps for Debian specific strings          WHYNOT
