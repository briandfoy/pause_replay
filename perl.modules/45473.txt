Don't apologize. It's not your fault. See below.

As for a new message, how about:

Nothing in this distro has been indexed, because according to META.yml this=
 
package does not provide any modules/scripts/etc.

Now I understand.

Yes, now you've indicated where to look :-)).
It's a problem with Module::Build. Look at the last line of META.yml:

generated_by: Module::Build version 0.24

I just used V 0.2611 and now it says:

provides:
  Javascript::MD5:
    file: lib/Javascript/MD5.pm
    version: 1.05
generated_by: Module::Build version 0.2611

I will check all my modules, and release new versions where necessary.

Luckily, the 2 Javascript modules are the only ones of mine which do not=
 appear 
in 01modules.index.html, which makes me think (fingers crossed!) they are=
 the 
only 2 with this problem.

I agree - it depends. There seems no way to determine automatically why it=
 is 
empty.

For the past:
I'm reluctant to suggest you take on more work, but perhaps the best=
 solution is 
a quick script to examine every distro (someone must have done that before)=
 and 
report which ones have a problem with this 'provides' statement. Then the 
authors could be emailed, as a once-off.

For the future:
Anyway, a more specific error message as I suggest above would at least=
 point 
users to the source of the (potential) problem.

I'll post a warning on the Module::Build mailing list about this.
