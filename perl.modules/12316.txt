Yes, indeed, it has to do with change of ownership. Simon has
requested to take over maintainance but Gisle has not yet confirmed. I
believe this is only an oversight and so I made SIMONW co-maintainer
of WWW::Chat. I hope this is OK for everybody.

If it is OK, Simon can force re-indexing on PAUSE and the problem is
solved. If there are any open questions, please let us know.
