The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Xymon::Client
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to xymon/hobbit client
  userid:      DAVIDP (David Peters)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Xymon/Hobbit has a lot of perl scripts, interfaces etc that have
    been floating around for some time however everytime someone needs
    to monitor smething new, they start from scratch or use cut and
    paste. The intention it to save time and effort by building these
    scripts and libraries on top of standardised interfaces and
    utlities.

  enteredby:   DAVIDP (David Peters)

The resulting entry would be:

Xymon::
::Client          bdpOp Interface to xymon/hobbit client             DAVIDP
