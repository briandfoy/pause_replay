Steffen & etc.

There has been two different people approach me about maintenance of  
sdl perl this month. What I am going to do is watch who displays an  
ability to stick around and contribute for than a few months. I've  
handed off control twice before and ended up with it reverting to me  
each time.

I am more than willing to push bug patches to CPAN, but the last  
serious round of contributions were never finished, resulting in a  
broken build system, etc.

So while I am taking offers in good faith, I am going to hold off on  
blessing any new maintainers until I am confident we won't end up back  
where things got stuck 4 years ago.

Dave
