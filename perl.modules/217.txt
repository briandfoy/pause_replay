The code

    package Math::3d;

was until recently a syntax error. I do not remember which version of
perl made it legal. But it's probably not a good idea to write a
module in a namespace where you will get complaints regularly.

The module list has a namespace ThreeD, which seems to be in "idea"
status for a very long time, so I'm not sure if we should continue
with that. I was never fond of "ThreeD" namespace, it looks a bit
silly, but we didn't come up with a better idea at that time (which
was May 97).

Would you have a better idea this time?
