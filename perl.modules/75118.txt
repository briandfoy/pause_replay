The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unicode::Casing
  DSLIP:       cdhpp
  description: Override uc(), lcfirst(), \u, etc.
  userid:      KHW (Karl Williamson)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    p5p, #p5p, will be in 5.14 docs

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    Perl 5 has the ability to override the case-changing functions,
    like ucfirst(), but it suffers from a number of defects, such as
    working only on UTF-8 encoded strings, not working at all on the
    in-line double-quotish \U and allies, and most importantly very
    undesirable scoping rules. As a result, it is being deprecated in
    5.14 with a planned removal in 5.16.

    I am writing a small module to give better functionality and
    scoping. We decided on #p5p to not include it in the core, I would
    like to get the name nailed down soon so that it can go into the
    5.14 docs. I have no idea what the best chapter would be; and am
    open to other proposals than mine for a name.

The resulting entry would be:

Unicode::
::Casing          cdhpp Override uc(), lcfirst(), \u, etc.           KHW
