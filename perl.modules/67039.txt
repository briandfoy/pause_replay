Subject: Request to adopt abandoned FLTK module

Hi!

I'd like to take over maintenance of the abandoned FLTK module. I
started trying to contact the original author (ID: MKENNEDY) several
months ago and all attempts have failed. Early this week, I started
the official clock and put out a request on PM in case any monks had
up-to-date contact info but nothing new has turned up. Unless he has a
valid secret email address on PAUSE, reaching him directly seems
unlikely.

The distribution itself has not been updated since its release in 2000
and doesn't build against modern fltk2 libs.
