The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::Diff::Apply
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Apply one or more Algorithm::Diff diffs
  userid:      ANDREWC (Andrew Chadwick)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::Merge

  rationale:

    * Name

    This is a resubmission of Algorithm::ApplyDiffs, which I originally
    submitted on Mon, 5 May 2003. After discussion with Ned Konz, the
    maintainer of Algorithm::Diff, and Arthur Bergman, I've decided to
    settle on Algorithm::Diff::Apply as the complete name of this
    module.

    * Other modules

    ** Algorithm::Diff

    A::D::Apply applies the diff sequences generated by diff() in this
    module. Algorithm::Diff does not contain a routine for applying diff
    sequences.

    ** Algorithm::Merge

    Features a diff3() and a merge(), which you could argue does the
    same thing as A::Diff + A::Diff::Apply. However A::Merge::merge()
    only merges the three-way differences between an original and two
    descendent revisions. A::D::Apply's routines are not limited in this
    respect: you can apply the diffs from an original array and one or
    more descendents together, albeit at the risk of harder-to-solve
    conflicts appearing.

    Like Alg.::Merge, Alg.::ApplyDiffs has a conflict-resolution
    callback which can be used to resolve conflicts during application,
    or just inject conflict markers.

    * Future

    Now the fun bit. I plan to work the Alg.::ApplyDiffs code so that
    it can reduce conflicts. There are even certain cases that can be
    optimised away cleanly:

    >>>>>> src_diff_x Hello world >>>>>> src_diff_y Hello world <<<<<<

    for example. Currently it spits that out as a conflict, even though
    it patently isn't: all derived revisions contain the same text at
    the same point.

    A::D::Apply's diff-based approach lends itself to greater analysis
    and optimisation.

    * Discussion

    I've floated this once on comp.lang.perl.modules, and will make a
    proper announcement there once it's finalised.

    I've contacted the aothors of both other modules, and Ned Konz has
    responded. He's happy with my parking A::D::Apply under his
    namespace.

    So response from anyone else, so I'm concluding from this that they
    don't have any problem -- or rather, that they have no explicit
    objections with my uploading this module.

The resulting entry would be:
