modules@perl.org is really the wrong address for this. You should have 
posted to the PAR module's mailing list. (par@perl.org) Answers to this 
should go to me and the PAR mailing list only, please.

However, I'm kind of involved in that, too, so here goes:

You can install a binary of PAR::Packer (for the latest ActiveState 
build!), which includes pp, from Randy Kobes' PPM repository, so you 
don't need to compile it yourself. In the ppm shell (or GUI), add the 
repository http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/ to your PPM repositories. 
Then install the PAR-Packer package. Detailed instructions can be found 
on Randy Kobes' ppm page http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/.

If you still cannot execute a pp command in your shell afterwards, try 
searching your hard drive for it. Perhaps your ActivePerl installation 
is somehow broken and doesn't include the right directories.

Best regards,
Steffen
