Subject: Net::OSCAR using deprecated features in perl 5.12
To: Matthew Sachs <matthewg@zevils.com>, MATTHEWG@cpan.org

From: toddr@null.net (Todd Rinaldo)

Net::OSCAR is using deprecated perl features. I've opened RT #55801 -
"use of defined %hash deprecated in perl 5.12" to track this. There
are also some other RT items that probably need to be looked at.

I notice Net::OSCAR hasn't had any attention since Feb 2006. My guess
is that maybe you have had other priorities and of course CPAN often
get's pushed to the bottom of the list. I'd like to offer to assist
with maintenance of the module by fixing this and other RT items with
obvious fixes.

If you're open to this, you can just add TODDR as a co-maintainer or
maintainer in http://PAUSE.perl.org and I will do the needful from
there.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
