I just saw this suggestion now.

At this point it's moot but, FWIW, Time::Video::SMTPE might imply  that 
it's a hardware interface for "video" timecodes (that means 29.976 FPS).

I say hardware interface because, from what I recall, SMPTE's timecode 
spec is really concerned with the wire representation of the timecode.
