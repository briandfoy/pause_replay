Hello Modules@perl.org,

     I am preparing to release a module for developing interactive video
experiences, typically used within a web page.

     The module allows for easy development of CPL (Coincident Programming
Language) files within Perl. CPL is an XML language that is processed either
by a flash player on the web page, or by HTML5 Javascript. A downloadable
CPL Flash player is being made available with this distribution.

     The internal name we have used is CPL.pm. At the highest level it is
meant to be something akin to CGI.pm, but for creating interactive CPL
rather than CGI/HTML.

     Other candidates that have been briefly considered are Video::CPL and
CGI::CPL.

     Video::CPL seems wrong because most of the existing CPAN Video::
modules are working with video files. CPL is two levels away from this;
either Flash or the browser will be dealing with the actual video data. CPL
is in turn directing either Flash or the browser.

     CGI::CPL seems incorrect. Many programs may use both CGI.pm and CPL.pm
. But there is no direct connection between the two, and it is reasonable
and sensible to create CPL files using CPL.pm, without CGI.pm or using the
CGI interface generally.

     For those reasons I'm thinking of posting it as CPL.pm. Comments?

Thank you,

Carl Rosenberg
