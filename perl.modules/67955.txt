     why:

    Dozens. An SMTP module for creating/sending email via SMTP in an
    extremely simplified way, a File::Temp::Seekable (hybrid class of
    File::Temp and IO::Seekable); Yet another base-class implementation;
    if anybody besides myself digs it; A transitive differential merging
    module, which correctly and consistently merges diffs from the same
    ancestor (similar to interdiff, but actually works; and allows
    working from files, or multi-line strings)

    Lots of stuff... Basically anything I've worked on in my personal
    time and know to be 100% free of potential IP entanglements, and
    feel would be useful to the perl community.
