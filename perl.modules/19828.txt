     why:

    Hi ,

    I am intending to contribute a module that shall aid in migration
    of data from sybase or informix to Oracle.

    The Migration projects of the sort usually requires creation of
    control files for the tables in Oracle and my module can create
    control files for all the tables in Oracle Schema .

    The data from Sybase or Informix databases , when required to be
    loaded , requires the control files as they cannot be imported
    otherwise.This is usually a long process to write control files for
    many tables manually.

    This module can create control files for one or more tables and can
    set date attributes for any column of the table or for all the date
    columns of the table.The Default attributes can also be added.

    The miscellaneous advantages are that the column names and
    datatypes are always correct for their spellings and the column
    order is also by the column id and hence the control files are apt
    for the position of the columns.

    use CreateCtl; my $CreateCtl = new CreateCtl;
    $CreateCtl->set_dbh($dbh); $CreateCtl->set_path($path);
    $CreateCtl->set_date_format($format,@tables);
    $CreateCtl->CreateCtlFiles();

    __END__

    Also , I am intending to address methods to port the data for these
    known data format changes.

    The Method that ports the Date format .

    The date format which is usually "Mon DD YYYY HH:MI:SS:mls[A|P]M"
    in Sybase or informix and in Oracle it can be "Mon DD YYYY
    HH24:MI:SS", so I have written a routine to do this transformation
    for the data files that come from the sybase or Informix databases.

    The Method that transforms the ^M characters from the data.
