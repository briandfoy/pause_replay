I recalled hearing you say you'd fixed this, so maybe you're unaware
that it's still broken.

When I've installed POE-Exceptions-0.04.tar.gz, I still get the
warning to "upgrade" this module because my POE::Kernel::Exceptions
at 1.0528 is "older" than the version 1.7 in POE-Exceptions-0.03.tar.gz

Please delete 0.03 from the CPAN (and perhaps earlier versions), or release
a new distribution with an increased version number.
