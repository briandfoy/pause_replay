The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Sudoku::Trainer
  DSLIP:       cdpnp
  description: Train on detecting Sudoku stategies
  userid:      WITTROCK (Klaus Wittrock)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Games::Sudoku::CPSearch

  rationale:

    SudokuTrainer helps in "training by doing". It runs until it
    detects the desired strategy. Then it pauses without reflecting the
    consequences of the finding on the visible Sudoku board. The user
    knows that the strategy can be found there. If he can't, he may ask
    for clues. The aim is to find the strategy with minimum help.
    SudokuTrainer also helps to get over an obstacle while solving a
    Sudoku puzzle. It shows the next strategy that may be applied. For
    users that don't know about strategies (the majority of Sudoku
    players), it shows the next value to be inserted. SudokuTrainer
    never uses trial and error, thus restricting to Sudoku puzzles that
    can be solved by logic (have a unique solution). All other Sudoku
    programs on CPAN are Sudoku solvers. Games::Sudoku::CPSearch uses
    some strategies for solving. SudokuTrainer can solve the majority of
    Sudoku puzzles, but this is only a side effect.
