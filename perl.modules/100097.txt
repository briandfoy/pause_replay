Hi Thierry,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I emailed you back in August 2017 =
about an issue in PAUSE that we were hoping to resolve, and are looking =
to complete the resolution of very soon.

> I=E2=80=99m working through tidying up permissions conflicts that have =
been caused by the fact that PAUSE now consider package names case =
insensitively (due to case-insensitive filesystems, as on Windows and =
MacOS X). PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let these situations occur now, but we =
have some historical cases. I=E2=80=99m sorting these out so that we =
don=E2=80=99t need code in the toolchain for dealing with permissions =
conflicts.

We=E2=80=99re working on changes to PAUSE where if you have an indexing =
permission on =E2=80=9Cfoobar", and then rename it =E2=80=9CFoobar=E2=80=9D=
, all permissions on =E2=80=9Cfoobar=E2=80=9D will be automatically =
changed to the equivalent permissions on =E2=80=9CFoobar=E2=80=9D. This =
will prevent various clashes that have happened over the years.

> You have first-come permissions on both URPM and urpm.

But only the =E2=80=9Curpm=E2=80=9D module appears in the CPAN Index.

The URPM module is one of just two modules in the URPM distribution. =
Presumably if someone was going to install this distribution from CPAN, =
they might want to run =E2=80=9Ccpan URPM=E2=80=9D or similar? They =
can=E2=80=99t do that right now though, because URPM isn=E2=80=99t in =
the index. Are people more likely to install a linux package to install =
it though?

The urpm module is one of many modules in the urpmi distribution. That =
distribution doesn=E2=80=99t contain a urpmi module, so people can=E2=80=99=
t run =E2=80=9Ccpan urpmi=E2=80=9D to install that distribution. The =
urpm module is listed in the CPAN Index. How likely is it that people =
might want to run =E2=80=9Ccpan urpm=E2=80=9D to install the =
distribution?

Do you know how people are likely to install your distributions? Will =
they do it using a CPAN client, or using a linux package? Even if you =
believe most people will install from linux packages, we still want the =
most likely behaviour to work on CPAN as well.

The change that we=E2=80=99re going to make won=E2=80=99t stop you from =
having these two modules (urpm and URPM) in two different distributions, =
this only relates to indexing permissions, and thus which of the modules =
will appear in the CPAN Index.

Right now both of these modules aren=E2=80=99t in the CPAN index anyway, =
only urpm is indexed:
Only =E2=80=9Curpm=E2=80=9D is in the index, so someone can run =E2=80=9Cc=
pan urpm=E2=80=9D to install the latest =E2=80=9Curpmi=E2=80=9D release.
But you can=E2=80=99t run =E2=80=9Ccpan URPM=E2=80=9D to install its =
latest release.

Once our proposed change is released, then PAUSE would index whichever =
of URPM and urpm was most recently released. If you=E2=80=99d prefer =
that URPM is the module that=E2=80=99s always indexed, you could just =
ensure that the =E2=80=9Curpm=E2=80=9D module is never indexed. The =
easiest way for you to achieve this would be for you to add the =
following to the META_MERGE clause in Makefile.PL for that distribution:

        no_index =3D> {
            package   =3D> [ =E2=80=98urpm'],
        },

Hopefully this would result in minimal impact on the end-user experience =
for people using your distributions. What are your thoughts on the =
above?

Cheers,
Neil
