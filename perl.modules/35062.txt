The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Repgen
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: DBI-based report generator
  userid:      TOLIKL (Anatoly K. Lasareff)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The package implements class DBIx::Repgen, which is simple report
    generator from data received from relational database by some
    select-statement. Such a report can contain hierarchical grouping by
    field values, record counters and cumulative totals (sums) of
    numeric fields for each group as well as for the whole report,
    group's and reports headers and footers. Each rerort part formatting
    may be set as literal string, arguments of C<sprint> function or be
    a code reference.

    As far as I can see there is no modules in CPAN with similar
    functionality.

  enteredby:   TOLIKL (Anatoly K. Lasareff)
  enteredon:   Wed Sep 22 09:46:08 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Repgen          bdpOp DBI-based report generator                   TOLIKL
