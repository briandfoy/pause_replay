I have over the course of the past few months performed many 
perl-5.6.0 installations with the inclusion of the following 
modules 

Bundle::libnet
Bundle::CPAN

URI
HTML::Tagset
HTML::Parser
MIME::Base64
Digest::MD5
Net::FTP
LWP

DBI 
DBD::Oracle

Starting Monday afternoon a change happened. I am no longer able 
to install these modules with out libnet and CPAN triggering an
auto installation of perl-5.6.1  This is true of Net::FTP and LWP
also. A number of us have worked to try and isolate this issue 
without useful results. The lower level versions of the modules 
do not appear to have a version change for some time. 

The last successful build with out this behavior was on Friday, 
April 6, 2001. I would appreciate any assistance in this matter 
you can provide. The middle modules are no longer triggering this
behavior only LWP, Net::FTP, libnet, CPAN

Please let me know if a work around or other solution is available.
If this is not the correct area to direct this matter to, kindly 
advise a more appropriate place. 

Thank you, 
Sandra
