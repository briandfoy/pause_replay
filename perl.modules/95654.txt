     why:

    I use the NIST-NVD-1.00.00 module and like to enhance it with more
    feature, such as matching the cpe name in regex mode instead of
    exact matching. Because in most case user doesn't know the exact cpe
    URN (including major version, minor version, release and edition
    number), but he does know the vendor and product name. The code's
    changeset is within one single function, and keep the input/output
    unchanged, and original logic is still running well with very tiny
    performance lost. I haven't contact the module maintainer, since I
    want to be familiar with perl's CPAN community culture and rule.
    Thank you in advance.
