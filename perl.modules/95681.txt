Subject: PAUSE permissions conflict between SELF and self modules

Hi Damian,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

Your Class-Delegation distribution includes a SELF package, and you have =
ownership of the SELF namespace as a result. But this now clashes with =
GUGOD=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cself=E2=80=9D package, which is in his =
=E2=80=9Cself=E2=80=9D distribution. His distribution has dependent =
distributions on CPAN, whereas yours doesn=E2=80=99t appear to.

It looks like the most appropriate solution would be for you to rename =
the SELF package to something else which isn=E2=80=99t already taken, so =
I can then drop your permissions. This would resolve the conflict, which =
currently means that GUGOD=E2=80=99s distribution isn=E2=80=99t fully =
indexed. Or you could delete it from CPAN, but I don=E2=80=99t know =
enough to say whether that=E2=80=99s an appropriate course of action.

Would you be happy to refactor your Class-Delegation distribution?

Cheers,
Neil
