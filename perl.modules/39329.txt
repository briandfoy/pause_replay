The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::SpaceTrack
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Fetch orbital elements from Space-Track.org
  userid:      WYANT (Tom Wyant)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    There really hasn't been a lot of advance planning with this
    module. The U.S. passed a law last year forbidding the
    redistribution of the orbital elements of artificial satellites and
    other miscellaneous space junk. I had been using Dr. T. S. Kelso's
    Celestrak web site (http://celestrak.com/), but Dr. Kelso's web site
    has been advising a switchover to the new Space Track web site,
    which requires registration.

    The problem here is that various people, including Dr. Kelso, have
    been maintaining observing lists, and there has been some
    uncertainty on how well the new site (http://www.space-track.org/)
    will support these. Dr. Kelso himself has been taking the problem
    seriously enough to publish software to merge his observing lists
    with the Space Track data, with (he says) the co-operation of the
    Space Track people. But Dr. Kelso's software is Windows only.

    So I started my own project based on LWP::UserAgent, which was
    submitted to PAUSE March 26. Now, I have no idea where the Perl
    astronomy-related modules crowd hangs out, though I suppose I could
    canvass the authors of other Astro:: modules. It also turns out that
    Dr. Kelso received, on March 25, permission to continue to
    redistribute modules for a year. So the need is not as great as it
    has seemed prior to this weekend. But both Dr. Kelso and the Space
    Track staff have been encouraging.

    I realise this is not the strongest justification, but I thought I
    should at least get my request submitted along with my module.

The resulting entry would be:
