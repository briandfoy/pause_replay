Hi,
I am about to submit a module but I have some problems.

First  one is a small problem, but I need advise. My module generate HTML
Tables. Since HTML::Table already exist, I want to use a name like
CGIBIN::Table or HTML::Tbl is this OK?

Second problem is more complex and I don't know how to resolve. The Table
module
internally uses two other modules called Node.pm and Date.pm written by me.
How am I going to bundle them together. All the documentation I have talks
about creating a module by using  h2xs for a single module.

Help please !!

Seyhan :-)
