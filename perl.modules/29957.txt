The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PhoA::Filer
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Read/writes files from PhoA-program
  userid:      HOLROY (Even Holen)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    http://openpage.ru/phoa/en and
    http://forum.ural-link.com/index.php?action=vtopic&forum=9&sortBy=0&page=0

  similar:

  rationale:

    PhoA is a freeware Photo Album program, developed in Delphi Pascal
    7.0, where the developer has released the file structure of the
    album files, these are called PhoA-files. I've already built a php
    interface to this structure, and want to build a Perl interface.

    I'm not quite sure whether this is a good namespace, but as far as
    I could tell by a glimpse through the module list, it seems like a
    good idea to have a separate namespace for the PhoA-application.
    It's not commercial, but more related to imaging.

    The module I'm building first is a general read/write module, which
    most likely will deliver a object tree ready for other (not-written)
    modules to use. In the future I'm foresee modules like
    PhoA::Relocator, or PhoA::WebBuilder, and so on.

    If you have suggestions as to a better namespace, please give a
    response. ;-)
