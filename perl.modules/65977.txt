Subject: Module submission HTML::Heretical
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Heretical
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Higher order HTML generation
  userid:      AUFFLICK (Mark Aufflick)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Will be: Perlmonks, Blog, public SVN

  similar:
    HTML::*

  rationale:

    In terms of any other modules that use lambdas/subs & higher order
    concepts for html generation, I'm not aware of any and a scan of the
    first 300 hits on search.cpan for html didn't find any.

    In terms of other modules that generate html: HTML::* !

    The name comes from a few angles. Firstly, I'm using a similar set
    of ideas to those presented by Avi Bryant in his famous "Web
    Heresies" presentation at OSCON 2006. Secondly, there are so many
    HTML generating modules it doesn't seem useful to use a generic name
    that explained the purpose or appropriate to lock out a generic name
    that might be wanted for a more main-stream module. Thirdly there's
    something implicitly heretical about Perl that suits :)

    Mark.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
