this looks like Device:: stuff to me, and I think choosing a name to
allow other modules to mix in the name is better.  If you create a 
Cisco::FooRouter module, other people can add stuff under that namespace
that does something else with the same device.

Does everything have to be under the same namespace?  For instance, the
LWP package actually has many namespaces in it.  Your modules may have
uses beyond this task. :)

For things like this, I would break down the name:

   Cisco::HW7500::Parser
