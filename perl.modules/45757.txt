The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: A tree datastructure
  userid:      RKINYON (Rob Kinyon)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailing lists, Perlmonks

  similar:
    Tree::Simple, Tree::DAG_Node, Tree::MultiNode, Tree::Nary

  rationale:

    Adam Kennedy has already discussed this with me. I will be taking
    over all the above distributions from their respective authors
    (except for Tree::Simple which I am already a co-maint) and will be
    deprecating them at the request of the respective authors. I have
    also written a compatibility layer.

  enteredby:   RKINYON (Rob Kinyon)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov  7 14:52:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tree              RmpOp A tree datastructure                         RKINYON
