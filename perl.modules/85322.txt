This is a prime example of why I got kicked off the list.

You put out something completely false and unsupportable like the above.

I will quote a manpage, like 'perlpragma':
NAME
       perlpragma - how to write a user pragma

DESCRIPTION
   ***A pragma is a module which influences some aspect of the compile time
       or run time behaviour*****
       ....  of Perl, such as "strict" or "warnings". With
       Perl 5.10 you are no longer limited to the built in pragmata; you can
       now create user pragmata that modify the behaviour of user functions
       within a lexical scope.

-------------
If you bothered to look at the pod documentation for 'mem', you would
see 2 examples of how it influencing compile and runtime behavior.

That's ALL it does.

It cannot be anything other than a pragma as it has no functions other
than what is DEFINED to be a pragma.

Thus any suggestions that it be re-cast as a function would be bad
engineering design / practice.   That you would actually think I would buy
into something so obviously wrong defines the nature of disagreement on
with some people on p5p.  I attempt to adhere to some semblance of good
design -- nearly all of my suggestions to p5p were to make it more regular,
or easier to use.   Here I suggest a simple pragma that alters compile and
runtime behavior.  Then you want to change it and call it something else.

That's just wrong.
