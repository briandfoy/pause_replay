     why:

    I am working on the set of modules providing an easy way to access
    and manipulate the contents of D64 disk images and T64 tape images
    (C64 virtual archives). D64::File::PRG is my first module of this
    set, it provides operations necessary for handling individual C64's
    PRG files, which are the smallest building blocks for those images,
    and is ready to be uploaded to CPAN. Upon completion I would like to
    successively upload all my new modules into CPAN. In my real life I
    am working as a Perl developer for an American telecommunications
    company.
