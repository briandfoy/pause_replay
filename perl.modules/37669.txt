Your message to CYBERIA-L-request@LISTSERV.AOL.COM  has been forwarded to
the "list  owners" (the  people who  manage the  CYBERIA-L list).  If you
wanted  to reach  a  human  being, you  used  the  correct procedure  and
somebody will contact you shortly.

However,  if you  were  trying to  send  a command  for  the computer  to
execute, please read on.

The CYBERIA-L  list is  managed by a  LISTSERV server.  LISTSERV commands
should   always  be   sent   to  the   "LISTSERV"   address,  which   is:
LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM. Commands sent to the CYBERIA-L-request address
are simply forwarded  to the list administrator, who will  assume you are
going  to read  this message,  learn  the error  of your  ways from  this
automatic  response,  and resend  the  command  to the  correct  address.
Therefore, if your message was a  LISTSERV command, you should now resend
it to LISTSERV@LISTSERV.AOL.COM.
