I'd like to be registered to the Perl Authors Upload Server - PAUSE.

I understand that what is needed is:

    *   your name
    * your email address
    * your homepage if you have one
    * your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9 characters long, all uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed.
    * a short description of what you're planning to contribute

To answer the above:

- BATAVUS
- The module I'd like to contribute is a simple mod_perl Apache handler that produces dynamic content and thumbtabs of a directory tree of jpeg files. I started writing it a few months ago and have since noted that others have done similar modules. One example is Randal L. Schwartz's Sept. 1999 'Web Techniques' column http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/WebTechniques/col41.html. His is a bit more in depth than mine. I prefer'd to keep it a bit more simple. Anyhow, I noted that no-one had placed such a handler on CPAN. I'd like to do so, if CPAN is an appropriate place for such a handler. An example of JPGShow in actual use is on my home page under pictures (http://www.tildesoftware.com/philip/pics/). The current name space I have it installed under is Tildesoft::JPGShow. If it's seen as something CPAN worthy, the name space is not something I'm particular on. It might fit better in CPAN under Apache::JPGShow?

Anyhow, thanks and regards,

Philip Greer
