The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PBJ::JNI
  DSLIP:       anhOp
  description: An interface to Java virtual machine.
  userid:      PING (Ping Liang)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Nothing directly comparable.

  rationale:

    The name PBJ (Peanut Butter and Jelly) tries to imply that it is
    advantageous to bridge both Perl and Java together. It could also be
    a short name for Packages to Bridge Java.

    PBJ::JNI is the first package available in the PBJ suite of
    modules. In the future, it is my hope that there will be wrapper
    modules for some good Java libraries that are built on top of this
    PBJ::JNI package.

  enteredby:   PING (Ping Liang)
  enteredon:   Tue Jan  1 21:21:45 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

PBJ::
::JNI             anhOp An interface to Java virtual machine.        PING
