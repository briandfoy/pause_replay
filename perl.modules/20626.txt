    Well, then, you are wrong. :)  They are not compatible.

    It was, yes, possible to be merged into L::M::L::G yesterday, since
at that time I was only trying to solve the problems of L::M::L::G.  But
not now.  Currently I'm working on a subclass of Locale::Maketext, so
that it works exactly "both the gettext and Locale::Maketext way".  It
is designed solve all the major problem of Locale::Maketext, including:
gettext-tools compatibility, encoding conversion, etc.  It'll be
possible to share the system MO files with other C/PHP... application to
some extent.

    I believe L::M::L::G can benefit from my L::M::G code, but that's
not my purpose.  L::M::L::G's interface doesn't make sense.  It runs at
a pre-processed stage, which is not reasonable, and is not easy for a
lot of users.  Application authors have to read the PO file in a BEGIN
block, at least as currently documented.  But L::M::G is a subclass of
Locale::Maketext.  It is thus transparent to the application authors, in
the sense of "both GNU gettext and Locale::Maketext".

    After all, working entirely at the pre-process stage in a BEGIN
block is entirely not acceptable in mod_perl.  L::M::L's interface
itself simply doesn't work.  It tries to serve the variety, in the cost
of simplicity and efficiency.

    In my L::M::G, methods like bindtextdomain, textdomain are
implemented.  The encoding method will have significant meaning to the
output.

    Sorry the documentation is not ready yet.  It was finished about 12
hrs ago, but I have to rewrite it entirely now for the new OO methods. 
Although the coding is nearly finished.  I think the above infomation
should be enough to explain the existence of a new L::M::G.

    By the way, can anyone that remind me a module that can tell the
best default encoding (and all possible encodings) for a language tag?
For ex, zh-tw -> Big5, zh-cn -> GB2312, ja -> Shift-JIS, en-us ->
US-ASCII.  I18N::LangTags doesn't seem to help.  Maybe I had missed
something.

    Another thing:  Autrijus, I had written to you a couple of days
before about your ngettext patch to Locale::gettext.  I haven't heard
from you yet.  Any news?  I'm still waiting.
