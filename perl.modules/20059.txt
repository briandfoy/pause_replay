Perhaps something else without 'informix' in it - see my email about
trademarks.

No problem.

Don't forget that some modules in the list pre-date newer
namespaces or were in widespread use before getting listed.

So take the module list itself only as a imperfect guide :)

These days DBIx::OracleSequence would probably be Oracle::Sequence.

I'd like to avoid more database-specific modules going into DBIx::*
as that's really meant for database *I*ndependant extensions to the DBI.
But I can't complain too loudly as I haven't been around to beat
that drum much.

Tim.

p.s. My thanks to all who look after modules@perl.org these days.
