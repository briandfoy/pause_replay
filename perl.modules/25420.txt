Thanks. Now I look at search.cpan.org I see the Archiving_and_Compression
section is actually called "Archiving Compression Conversion" so that's okay.

There's aren't any Convert:: modules in the module list that relate to
coordinates. But there is a Cartography:: namespace containing just
Cartography::Projection::GCTP and a Geo::Coordinates::* namespace.

Geo::Coordinates::VandH seems good.

Tim.
