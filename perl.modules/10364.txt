Hello,

I'm Vlad Simionescu, a programer at Softwin, Bucharest.
I am trying to find the best way to use a COM component from Perl (a custom
COM component, not an OLE object). I searched the documentation of
ActivePerl 5.6 and the site of ActiveState the best I could but couldn't
find anything better than doing it through a C interface which I call via
XS. I asked at perlbug@perl.com and they directed me to your site. As much
as I could see, there is nothing here either, except maybe for the things
related to CORBA (the CORBA::... modules and the CORBA Perl mailing list).
Now, I'm not very good at CORBA, but as much as I could see, it doesn't seem
to be what I need.
Could you please tell me if you know a good way to use a COM component from
Perl ?

Thank you.
V. Simionescu
