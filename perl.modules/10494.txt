Well, I apologise for this. I think Lars has been a bit stressed out
(who hasn't :-) and I've already concluded that this is probably a
misunderstanding.

    Ned> Still, I intend to come up with a new version as soon as I

Well, if you'd wait a little I'll get back to the amavis list and try
to coordinate what is required and try to sort out some patches after
talking to you again.

Stephen Zander has also mentioned including Archive::Zip's
functionality in Archive::Tar. I don't know what you think about that
?

Thanks for the reponse,

Sincerely,

Adrian Phillips
