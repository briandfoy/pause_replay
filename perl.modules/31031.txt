Up and doing!
Many will detest you if you spend all your love on yourself.
The natural man has only two primal passions, to get and to beget.

Modules, medication without perscription only here

The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.
Life is real! Life is earnest! And death is not its goal. Dust thou art, to dust returneth, was not spoken of the soul.
Our friends are generally ready to do everything for us, except the very thing we wish them to do.
Lawyers are like rhinoceroses: thick skinned, short-sighted, and always ready to charge.
