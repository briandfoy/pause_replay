Request to register new user

fullname: Jonathan Wright
  userid: MYSTERYTE
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://neuralspace.com
     why:

    want to upload Gallery::Remote::API, an interface for connecting to
    a Gallery (PHP web photo album) installation via it's Remote
    Protocol.

    It's an alternative to the existing Gallery::Remote, which appears
    to have been abandoned in 2004, was never finished, and doesn't work
    with newer versions of the software.
