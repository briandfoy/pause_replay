The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attribute::Curried
  DSLIP:       bdpha
  description: curried functions
  userid:      SEANO (Sean O'Rourke)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Attribute::Util

  rationale:

    D'oh -- just found the form. Currying is a useful idiom to add to
    Perl, and one not currently supported by any modules (that I can
    find). I believe people who are comfortable with functional
    languages can benefit from using this, and those who are not can
    learn by playing with it.

    /s

  enteredby:   SEANO (Sean O'Rourke)
  enteredon:   Sat May 11 18:03:49 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Attribute::
::Curried         bdpha curried functions                            SEANO
