Hi,

I'm Tony Cook, and my preferred CPAN user ID is TONYC, and my preferred
email address for CPAN email is tony@develop-help.com.  I don't have a
home page I'd care to advertise much at the moment.

I'm planning on developing some graphing modules that use the Imager image
manipulation module.  Initially a pie chart, but eventually other graph
types as well.

Tony
