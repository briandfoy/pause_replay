Taking these concerns into account, I have some suggestions for your
review. To make it easy for you, I've anticipated your replies - bearing
in mind that I have to think of all the possible audiences for a module
in cpan, and come up with a name that will appeal and inform all these
audiences, whoever they might be; that I must not use a name that comes
up with any unsavoury references via Google (the arbiter of all
knowledge), even if the name is accurate; and that I may not be guided by 
what anybody else has done on cpan in the past with naming a module for
they could all be wrong and I should do much better.

Statistics::Diachronics::Pot - "No. Some people might have to look up
diachronics."

Statistics::Sequences::Pot - "Yes, it's specific and easy to understand.
... But no. It sounds like sequential analysis, and suggests time series, 
and this is presumably more specific. And then it should probably be
under Math if it isn't. But try 'Statistics::Sequency' on me. It is
unique, and it rhymes with 'Statistics::Frequency'. But you propose the
idea, and I'll tell you what I really think."

Statistics::Streaks_and_Slumps::Pot - "Yes, it's very descriptive, and
even spells out some applications. But some people might think it's just
for sports scores. Or it could be too cute for others. Try harder."

Statistics::Bunches  - "Yes, it speaks to me. But does that mean it has
the Wald-Wolfowitz test for runs in it too? And that other one for joins
in data? Just what kind of bunches is this? You must be more specific."

Statistics::Succession - and then Pot, Joins, Runs and whatever else can
find a home under there. - "A good strategy. But are they all about
succession? Runs and bunches of potential energy, yes, but joins, they
come in sequences more than in succession, surely!"

Statistics::Exponential::Potential - "Almost, but no. It reminds me of
'Handy::Dandy' and I think we have enough of these cutesy names. And
don't you mean 'Potential::Exponential'? And then shouldn't this module
be in bed with 'Radioactive::Decay'?"

Statistics::Pot - "Statistic-Pot? That kind of rings a bell. You mean
that one from Schmidt about the exponential decline of potential energy
that comes in sequences and makes sense of streaks and slumps? I've heard 
so much about it and feel I know it well already. But I've lost all interest."


A final idea. How about a new family of modules be created - e.g.,
"Homeless," or "Orphan," or "Refuge" - where modules such as this one,
that will never get the perfect name, that will never get past first
base, can reside for a time until adoption by some kind family.
