 I am currently writing an interface to the ESO Astronomy catalogue
library (it's called SkyCat). This is astronomical standard for processing
source catalogues and dealing with astronomy image servers. The module is
currently in development (it works for a subset of the library) but I
would like to upload a pre-release version to CPAN and get it listed on
the modules list.

My PAUSE ID is TJENNESS

The description is:

Astro::
SkyCat   cd+O  Interface to ESO SkyCat library      TJENNESS
