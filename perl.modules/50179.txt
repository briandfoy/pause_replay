The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Eksblowfish
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: the Eksblowfish block cipher
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Crypt::Blowfish

  rationale:

    Eksblowfish is a variant of the Blowfish cipher, modified to make
    the key setup very expensive. ("Eks" stands for "expensive key
    schedule".) This doesn't make it significantly cryptographically
    stronger, but is intended to hinder brute-force attacks. It also
    makes it unsuitable for any application requiring key agility. It
    was designed by Niels Provos and David Mazieres for password hashing
    in OpenBSD. The algorithm is described at
    <http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos/provos_html/node4.html>,
    in the Usenix paper that presents the password hash algorithm.

    I'm ultimately implementing the Eksblowfish-based password hashing
    algorithm, but along the way it seems useful to provide a Perl
    interface to Eksblowfish itself. I plan to distribute a crypt() that
    does the hash algorithm in the same distribution as
    Crypt::Eksblowfish.

    I noted Crypt::Blowfish as being related, because Eksblowfish is
    based on the Blowfish algorithm. They encrypt and decrypt in exactly
    the same way, only the key setup is different. Nevertheless that's
    quite a lot of difference. It might be possible to make the two
    modules share some code. I think trying to share the interface would
    be very confusing, though, so I'm proposing Crypt::Eksblowfish as a
    distinct module from Crypt::Blowfish.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::Eksblowfish     adcOp the Eksblowfish block cipher                 ZEFRAM
