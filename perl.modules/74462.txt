Hello Farkas,

I've been trying to reach you but ain't got no answer. I'll wait another
couple of days, and if there is no answer I'll just move forward and apply
for a take-over of the module. If you do see this message before that, and
you still intend to maintain that module, please scream - even a short note
will do - and I'll wait.

Cheers,
Alexei
