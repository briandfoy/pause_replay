The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Markup
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: 3 Modules (Tree, TreeNode, and Content)
  userid:      BPRUDENT (Brandon Prudent)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://lackluster.tzo.com:1024/sites/content-x

  similar:
    XML::Parser, HTML::Parser

  rationale:

    The first two modules (which are ready to be released and will be
    later tonight or tommorow (11/06/03)), Markup::Tree and
    Markup::TreeNode are modules similar to XML and HTML ::Parser. In
    fact, these modules are required. Markup::Tree is a unified way to
    access Markup documents in a clean, easy and intuitive fashion.

    The last of the modules, Content, is currently being written based
    on the previous two modules. The intent of Markup::Content is to
    extract HTML content from static pages or websites. A
    proof-of-concept can be found at:
    http://www.sf.net/projects/content-x

    I wouldn't mind putting this under another namespace, except I
    don't know what it would fit under :(. I couldn't find any other
    modules that unify markup.

    Any comments, questions, or otherwise can be sent to:
    xlacklusterx@hotmail.com.

    Thanks for your consideration :)
