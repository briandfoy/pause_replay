Hi,

I requested a PAUSE id on January 12th. Since I haven't heard back
yet, I thought I'd give a "gentle poke," as per the instructions. If
I'm being overly impatient, please forgive me.


Here is my request to be registered as a PAUSE developer:

name :Russell B Cecala
email address: russellcecala@netscape.net
homepage: None
preferred user-ID on CPAN: CECALA
short description of what you're planning to contribute :
I would like to contribute a Lunar Lander video game
written with Perl/Tk.  This script requires Tk and 
3 modules I developed (Vector2D Viewport and Clip2).
I think this script demonstrates the ease and fun
of coding in Perl/Tk.

I am also would like to contribute some 3D graphics
modules base on Tk::Canvas.

Thank you! 
Russ
