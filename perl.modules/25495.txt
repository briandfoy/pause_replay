     why:

    HTML::SimpleTemplate, a module similar in functionality to
    HTML::Template but with significantly different design goals.

    While HTML::Template is very effective at displaying whole pages,
    it is somewhat heavyweight and consequently not optimal for
    displaying pages which must be formed from repeated calls to many
    seperate templates.

    This is particularly the case when writing content management
    systems - it is very difficult to express the conditional display
    logic of these systems with HTML::Template, and conversely, very
    easy to express it in Perl itself.

    HTML::SimpleTemplate is specifically targetted at occasions where
    many (perhaps dozens) of seperate template calls will be used to
    construct one page; it is not necessary to create a new object for
    each template and the syntax is deliberately convenient both on the
    Perl side and in HTML.

    I enjoy HTML::Template and appreciate the work that has gone into
    it; I do use it and will do so again. However I do believe that the
    goals of HTML::SimpleTemplate are sufficiently different to merit
    having a seperate existence.

    NOTE: I am not entirely happy with placing this module in the
    HTML:: namespace as it is completly agnostic as to the type of
    content it displays - for instance, plain text, CSV or XML (or even
    executable/perl!) would all be possible.
