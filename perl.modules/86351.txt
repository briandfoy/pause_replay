The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VM::EC2
  DSLIP:       RdpO2
  description: Control the Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus Clouds
  userid:      LDS (Lincoln D. Stein)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/lstein/LibVM-EC2-Perl

  similar:
    Net::Amazon::EC2

  rationale:

    This is a pretty complete implementation of the
    Amazon/OpenStack/Eucalyptus REST API, including support for
    autoscaling, VPCs, elastic load balancing, cluster instances, spot
    pricing, and devpay.

    IMHO it is more object oriented than the existing Net::Amazon::EC2
    module, as objects that are returned from calls are "live" and
    support their own methods. For example, if you ask a Volume object
    for the instance attached to it, you get an Instance object that
    provides methods for accessing information about that instance.

    The module has been in production use for about a year now, and has
    an active and engaged development group working via GitHub at the
    address given above.

The resulting entry would be:

VM::
::EC2             RdpO2 Control the Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus Clouds LDS
