Dear Module People,

I have written a module that I would like to submit to CPAN.  It's a =
small
module that allows you to check that all callers to a subroutine or =
method
have specified an acceptable number of arguments, with the options to =
die
or just warn with an appropriate error message if they haven't.  There's
also an option to turn it off without having to remove the "hooks".

Name: Kevin Michael Vail
Email: kevin@vailstar.com
Preferred user ID on CPAN:  KVAIL

Module description:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info=0D=
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Check_Args     Rdpf  Check argument count in subroutines          KVAIL

I have not yet discussed this anywhere, but I've been using it in quite =
a
few projects at work.  I will start a discussion on
comp.lang.perl.modules, though.

I did search the archives for something like this before I started =
writing
it.  Tentatively I've placed it in the Module:: namespace, because it's
most useful for people writing modules, but that may not be right.

There are some other things I'm using that may be useful, too, once I
check to be sure they aren't already present.

Thanks,
Kevin
