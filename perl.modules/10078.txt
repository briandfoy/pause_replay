Welcome Vladimir Trushkin,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

    DIOGEN

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      Vladimir Trushkin
  email:     trushkin@iname.com
  homepage:  
  enteredby: Kurt D. Starsinic

....
}

Note the fields from and to are filled with same address modules@perl.org.
Where a message with my password went is not known to me, so, please could
you resend it to my registration e-mail.

Thank you!

----
Best Wishes,
Vladimir
