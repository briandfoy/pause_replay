The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Rolling
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Implements flexible rolling log files.
  userid:      FAIRLITE (Mark Luljak)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are several logging modules out there, but many are overkill,
    and also seem to require "outside maintenance". This module does
    away with that need, letting you set reasonable boundaries for your
    logfile size, and taking a "fire and forget" approach until you need
    your data. This is ideal for programs where you'd be looking at log
    information from the short term, without archival need.

    The namespace is relatively obvious as a choice, as it describes
    the purpose and functionality quite succinctly and accurately.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::Rolling         RdpOa Implements flexible rolling log files.       FAIRLITE
