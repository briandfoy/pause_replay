     why:

    Build LTSun 2.0 using RESTful happiness backend neutral allowing
    all platforms beginning with LAMPerl (later with python, php, ruby,
    etc).

    LTSun 1.0 was built and developed started around 3+ years ago. It
    is fairly crufty at this point and not well abstracted on the
    different technology layers. Source released last year October 2007.

    Abstract Title: Front-end Web Management System (as opposed to a
    back-end Web Management System like Drupal, Exponent, etc.)

    Abstract Summary: Portable WYSIWYG tool built for auto-SEO, easy
    integration, easy setup, aesthetically pleasing interface,
    auto-caching minification gzip etc, 100% compatibility with all
    major browsers, and ***the most intuitive user experience
    possible***(above all else).
