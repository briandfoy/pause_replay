Hi Shlomi,

Thank you for contacting me.

I apologize for the extremely long period of neglect. Actually I don't 
use Perl anymore and have not looked at this module in years. Moreover, 
the RT ticket queue for thsi module appears to be owned by someone else, 
so I did not get any notification when issues began accumulating.

For starters, I have created a public git repo for this module, and 
back-imported all of the past versions:

https://github.com/vandry/Perl-Locale-gettext

Next, I knocked off a few of the easy bugs and created a new release:

http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/P/PV/PVANDRY/gettext-1.06.tar.gz

Some of the remaining bug reports are also straightforward but will 
require a little bit more time than I have today or over the upcoming 
weekend to conscientiously fix. Others are things like build problems 
under operating systems I don't have and can't test for, or else 
possibly unreproducible or obsolete. In all honesty, again since I don't 
really code in Perl anymore, I'm not likely to work on those.

You are welcome to comaintain this module or even take it over. How do I 
set that up?

I see. I'm sure writing "same as Perl" for the license must have been 
recommended by somebody at some time or else I probably would not have 
done it. Obviously it was a long time ago. I am no legal or licensing 
expert. I have no idea what license would be best.
