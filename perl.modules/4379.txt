I have a module which I have provisionally named Data::Hexdumper.  It is
intended to help people working with binary file formats by enabling them
to dump the data in various useful formats like dumping bytes, shorts
or longs, and allowing for big-endian and little-endian displays.

Any comments before I upload it?

IMO it does *not* conflict with the existing Data::HexDump (which isn't
in the 'official' list anyway), as it takes a rather different approach -
no objects to start with, and it allows a *lot* more flexibilty.
