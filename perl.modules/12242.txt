The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Random
  DSLIP:       iupfp
  description: Randomly selection of a file
  userid:      BIGJ (Janek Schleicher)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tie::Pick Tie::Select Data::Random

  rationale:

    In CGI scripts I often want to show the content of randomly choosen
    file. I'm too lazy to write always something like

    my @files = (<*.*>); my $rand_file = $files[rand @files];

    or

    opendir DIR, "/foo/bar/" or " ... "; my @files = grep /\.txt$/,
    (readdir DIR); closedir DIR my $rand_file = $files[rand @files];

    Especially, I'm too lazy to do it with recursive directory
    structures. More important, the main idea is hidden, because all I
    wanted is something like:

    use File::Random;

    my $rand_file = random_file(); # or my $rand_file =
    random_file(-dir => '/foo/bar', -recursive => 1, # or -r => 1 -check
    => qr/.../ # or -check => sub {-M < 7});

    I'm also often more interested in the content of the randomly
    selected file, than in the file itselfs. So I'd like to have a
    function like

    my @lines = content_of_random_file();

    For laziness, I also want to add a simple method

    my $rand_line = random_line("fname");

    (like in the Perl Cookbook).

    I think, this module will be usefull and I couldn't find such one
    in CPAN.

    From a linguistic view Random::File would be a better name, but I
    don't want to create a new Top Level Domain quite only for such a
    little module. Also File::Random express very good, what the module
    stand for.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Random          iupfp Randomly selection of a file                 BIGJ
