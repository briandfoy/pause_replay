Sorry, this seems to has fallen between vacation and fest. The better
address for such requests is modules@perl.org and in general it is
good to document in a public place how many unsuccessful attempts have
been made to contact the previous maintainer. rt.cpan.org seems like a
good place to maintain such a view for posterity.

In a case like this, where the "current" release is from 1998
different rules might apply though.

In any case you must first become CPAN author or tell use under which
ID you are already CPAN author. Visit

    https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=request_id

for becoming registered author.

Thanks for your interest and sorry for the delay.

Hi,

The maintainer for the Net::LDAPapi perl module has been unresponsive to 
contact for several years.  I know from discussion with Howard Chu, that 
apparently CPAN believes some folks at Netscape were now the maintainers? 
However, Netscape (as far as its directory technologies go) has been sold 
off to the RedHat folks.  And, they apparently never updated Net::LDAPapi 
either, since the same release that has been there for years is still there.

I would like to be made maintainer for the module.  What would it take to 
have that be done?

Thanks,
Quanah

So does it take over a month to get a response?
