public discussion:

Mostly in the context of InterMezzo (http://www.inter-mezzo.org)
development lists.  SetFS and UUID are simple wrappers that I don't
think could be done better.

XDR is a different approach to the Sun RPC implementation done by
`perlrpcgen' already in CPAN.  XDR focuses on exposing the XDR buffers to
programs which can exchange them in their own way, rather than using
predefined transports.  It also is written exclusively in Perl, using
a Perl object model, rather than as a C wrapper.

Thanks,
