Hello,

Well, as far as I understand these sendmail log entries it seems as if the
recipient address is considered to be only one address instead of two.
Otherwise sendmail would generate two seperate log entires, one for each
recipient. I suspect that the adress concatenation with comma and without
space prevents a seperate treatment but I am not sure about that...

It is a fact that the mail never reach wolf@cpan.org despite that mail
address works correctly. If the problem is the concatenation as described
above the result should be that no CPAN contributor receives these mails. So
I wonder if others can acknowledge this...
