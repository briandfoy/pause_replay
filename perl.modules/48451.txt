Subject: Module submission Template::Plugin::ByDate

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plugin::ByDate
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: TT filter for in/excluding based on date
  userid:      DMCBRIDE (Darin McBride)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace is largely chosen for me if I want it to be usable by any
    TT user. The final package name is malleable, but was just the first
    thing that came to me on perlmonks.

    This can be compared to Randal's embargo code (shown at
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=541256 ). The uniqueness
    of this approach is that it allows somewhat-readable text for the
    dates to compare against, instead of trying to figure out the
    unix-time that you want to compare against and coding that into your
    template instead.

The resulting entry would be:

Template::Plugin::
::ByDate          bdpOp TT filter for in/excluding based on date     DMCBRIDE
