The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Diff
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: data structure comparison utility
  userid:      GCAMPBELL (George Campbell)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    mailing lists

  similar:
    Algorithm::Diff Data::Compare

  rationale:

    Data::Diff provides in depth comparison and reporting on the
    differences from two arbitrary data structures.

    unlike Algorithm::Diff, Data::Diff treats arrays as unordered
    collections of data in trying to find the best possible match. In
    future versions of Data::Diff I'm planning on incorporating
    Algorithm::Diff by using it on the input arrays thought the use of
    options provided by the user. Data::Diff is from the start designed
    to work recursively on perl data structures.

    unlike Data::Compare, Data::Diff not only tells you that the two
    data structure are different but how they differ. There are several
    methods that do operations on this information that i've found
    useful and it is easily extendable to include more functionality in
    future versions.

    I feel that the these three modules solve sufficiently different
    problems and that the addition of this new one will benefit others.

The resulting entry would be:
