Hopefully I am not butting into an existing conversation here.  I
thought as others were voicing their support for updating the cpan M::R 
module, I would add my support as well.  It's not just large projects 
such as Koha or Evergreen who find these modules useful.  We here at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have found these modules 
extremely useful for smaller projects as well.  I've used it several times 
for small, one-off projects as well as larger ones.

This is also a particularity key time to have the "latest and greatest" 
available via cpan.  Some of the features, such as better utf8 support, 
are sorely needed.  Recently Urbana-Champaign has just upgraded it's 
Integrated Library System (ILS), allowing far better unicode support than 
before.  Unfortunately, there are not many (software) libraries can handle 
these features.  In addition, the library world is increasingly seeing the 
value in experimentation and there is a need for good tools to support 
these efforts.

The current module is a lifesaver and I'm grateful to people like Andy 
Lester, Mike O'Regan, Ed Summers and Brian Cassidy and the others who 
have made the module the excellent tool it already is.  It would be great 
to ensure that it doesn't languish at this crucial time.

ps.  I'm not sending this email in any official capacity of the University 
of Illinois or speaking for it in anyway.  Just speaking as an interested 
developer who uses it in his daily work.
