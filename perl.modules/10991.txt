Hello PAUSE maintainers!

I would like to register at PAUSE.

Name:        Andre Bonhote
Mail:        andre.bonhote@linux.ch
Homepage:    http://perl.problemlos.ch/ (not up yet, don't try)
Pref. UID:   ANBON or ABON or ABONHOTE
Description: As I am the proud owner of a digital camera, I have
             hundreds of photos at home, lying around well-sorted
             in different folders. Currently, I am using a quite
             big Perl script to create thumbnails & midsize images,
						 daily thumbnail-pages, monthly and yearly calendar pages.
             The purpose is finally to have a chronologically sorted
             searchable photoalbum. My goal is now to write a neat module
					   to do this. Nothing's done yet except the framework, so
             don't expect anything in the near future. I didn't find
						 anything similar to this on cpan.

						 The second thing is a module depending on
						 Net::Telnet::Cisco and Net::SNMP. It's performing different 
						 tests on Cisco routers. I wrote it for my company here,
             it's going to be in production soon, but I have to check
						 with my CEO to publish it. This one is finished and
						 working.

TIA

Andre
