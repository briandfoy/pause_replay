to the PAUSE maintainers,

This message follows up on others regarding namespace registration requests.

My author name is DUNCAND.

I had originally uploaded a distribution called "libdwg" to PAUSE on 
2000 July 23rd.  Since then, the modules within have been further 
developed and I have decided to release them as 4 separate 
distributions instead of 1, so that people who only want some of the 
modules don't necessarily have to take the others.  Also, the 
distribution names are now more descriptive of their content.

Please disregard all of my earlier registration requests where they 
differ from those presented here.  Since July, the collection has 
matured, some modules have been added and others removed.  I am quite 
sure that the list is now stable and elegant, and that the following 
modules will remain true to these descriptions for the long term.

During the last 10 days I had uploaded these 4 new distributions:
	- Class-ParamParser-1.0.tar.gz    - 1 module
	- EventCountFIle-1.0.tar.gz       - 1 module
	- CGI-FormGenerator-0.9.tar.gz    - 6 modules
	- CGI-WebsiteGenerator-0.3.tar.gz - 9 modules

Here is the standard DLSI for the 17 modules, grouped by 
distribution.  Please note that all of these are working and tested 
and in active use now by me (see http://www.DarrenDuncan.net and 
http://www.chronology.net).  The modules in "beta" are ones that I 
consider complete but aren't tested by other people, and those in 
"construction" I plan to add features to yet, but they should go to 
"beta" within a few months.

Here is a full sentence description for each one, which I am hoping 
some of you will read and then suggest good one-liner "Descriptions". 
I have trouble summarizing too much.

Class::ParamParser - Perl module that provides complex parameter list 
parsing for
subclass methods.

CGI::EventCountFile - Perl module that interfaces to a tab-delimited text file
for storing date-bounded counts of occurances for multiple events, such as web
page views.

HTML::TagMaker - Perl module that can create any HTML tags, as well 
as groups of
or just parts of them, and complete html headers or footers.

HTML::FormMaker - Perl module that maintains a predefined html input form
definition with which it can generate form html, complete with persistant and
error-checked user input, as well as formatted reports of the user 
input in html
or plain text format.

CGI::HashOfArrays - Perl module that implements a hash whose keys can have
either single or multiple values, and which can process url-encoded data.

CGI::SequentialFile - Perl module that interfaces to a common text file format
which stores records as named and url-escaped key=value pairs.

CGI::WebUserInput - Perl module that gathers, parses, and manages user input
data, including query strings, posts, searches, cookies, and shell arguments,
as well as providing cleaner access to many environment variables.

CGI::WebUserOutput - Perl module that maintains the components of a 
new web page,
including HTTP headers, with which it can assemble and output 
complete page HTML
or redirection headers.

CGI::WPM::Globals - Perl module that is used by all subclasses of 
CGI::WPM::Base
for managing global program settings, file system and web site hierarchy
contexts, providing environment details, gathering and managing user input,
collecting and sending user output, and providing utilities like 
sending e-mail.

CGI::WPM::Base - Perl module that defines the API for subclasses, which are
miniature applications called "web page makers", and provides them with a
hierarchical environment that handles details for obtaining program settings,
resolving file system or web site contexts, obtaining user input, and 
sending new
web pages to the user.

CGI::WPM::MultiPage - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base and
resolves navigation for one level in the web site page hierarchy from a parent
node to its children, encapsulates and returns its childrens' returned web page
components, and can make a navigation bar to child pages.

CGI::WPM::Static - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base 
and displays
a static HTML page.

CGI::WPM::MailForm - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base and
implements an e-mail submission form with unlimited questions.

CGI::WPM::GuestBook - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base and
implements a complete guest book with unlimited questions that also e-mails
submissions to the website owner.

CGI::WPM::SegTextDoc - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base and
displays a static text page, which can be in multiple segments.

CGI::WPM::Redirect - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base 
and issues
an HTTP redirection header.

CGI::WPM::Usage - Perl module that is a subclass of CGI::WPM::Base and tracks
site usage details, as well as e-mail backups of usage counts to the 
site owner.

Thank you,

// Darren Duncan

BTW, is it customary to get responses to requests like these, or are 
they only done if people feel like it?
