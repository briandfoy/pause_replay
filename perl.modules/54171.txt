The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Iterator::BreakOn
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Implements flow breaks over an iterator
  userid:      VMORAL (Víctor Moral)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    madrid-pm@pm.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module works on generic iterators although its main aim is
    works with DBIx::Class resulsets.

    It can be adapted to other types of iterators and for that reason i
    think that his place is under the Iterator namespace.

    Ah, the module is not derived from Iterator.pm nor compatible with
    him.

  enteredby:   VMORAL (Víctor Moral)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 25 08:39:14 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Iterator::
::BreakOn         RdpOg Implements flow breaks over an iterator      VMORAL
