The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Mmap::Simple
  DSLIP:       adhfp
  description: Memory mapping made simple and safe
  userid:      LEONT (Leon Timmermans)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Sys::Mmap

  rationale:

    There are two major differences between this module and Sys::Mmap.
    1. The interface is optimized for common usage patterns. 2. This
    module is safe yet fast. Sys::Mmap offers two interfaces, one is
    fast, but can segfault if not used correctly, the other is safe, but
    reportedly 10 times slower. Sys::Mmap::Simple is both fast (as long
    as it is used properly) and safe. 3. It will automatically unmap the
    file when the scalar gets destroyed. Sys::Mmap leaves this to the
    programmer.

    It may be possible to port back features 2&3 to Sys::Mmap, at a
    cost of losing compatibility with older perl releases (ppport
    suggests 5.7.3 is oldest supported version).

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::Mmap::
::Simple          adhfp Memory mapping made simple and safe          LEONT
