The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Graph
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Create interactive CGI-based graphs
  userid:      MCHANG (Max Chang)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Nowhere yet...

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are several graphing modules available, but none that are
    CGI-based. Using a CGI makes it possible for the user to interact
    and have more control over the graph, allowing features such as
    zooming, panning, selection, etc. The graphs themselves are drawn
    using GD::Graph.

    If you would like to see an example, go to
    http://carrier.gnf.org/publications/CGIGraph/

  enteredby:   MCHANG (Max Chang)
  enteredon:   Thu Nov 29 00:29:49 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::Graph           adpOp Create interactive CGI-based graphs          MCHANG
