PRESS RELEASE

NEW FIELDS RESPONDS TO ARBIL SECURITY CONCERNS

WASHINGTON, DC -- March 18, 2004 -- Responding to ongoing security concerns surrounding next month’s 4th Rebuilding Iraq Expo in northern Iraq, New Fields officials today emphasized the company’s commitment to taking all measures necessary to ensure a smooth, incident-free event.

There is no part of Iraq that is one hundred percent safe, but New Fields chose Arbil as the location of its April 26-29 Expo due to its role as the heart of a region of the country that has enjoyed considerable autonomy for more than a decade. Since the 1991 Gulf War, American protection has enabled northern Iraq to develop a vibrant economy independent of Ba’athist control. During preliminary visits to Arbil earlier this year, New Fields representatives were overwhelmed by the high level of pro-American sentiment in the city.

Despite Arbil’s reputation as one of the safest cities in the country, security remains a major concern for New Fields. The company is working closely with the Coalition Provisional Authority, Iraqi government agencies, and other relevant authorities to maintain a safe environment. 

Safe entry into Arbil for exhibitors is also a top priority in the lead-up to the Expo, New Fields representatives noted. New Fields will charter at least two passenger and one cargo flight from Dubai, UAE to Arbil, Iraq for exhibitors on April 24. Return flights will leave Arbil on April 30. While companies must make their own travel arrangements to Dubai, routine non-stop flights to the UAE city exist from Newark and London. By chartering flights from Dubai to Arbil, New Fields is providing a safer alternative for travel to Arbil than overland routes.

The Arbil event will feature hundreds of exhibitors from Iraq and around the world and will be highlighted by Iraqi business leaders eager to share information about their successes since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

The first three conferences in the Rebuilding Iraq series brought hundreds of attendees from dozens of countries to Washington DC to network and hear an impressive array of speakers, including representatives of the Iraqi Governing Council, notable Iraqi entrepreneurs, and representatives of American prime contractors.
