The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Magic
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Recognizes configuration files, makes a hash
  userid:      RUSTYP (Rusty Phillips)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    prev: comp.lang.perl.modules next:
    comp.lang.perl.announce,suggestions?

  similar:
    Config::Auto

  rationale:

    The reason for the namespace choice: 1) It's a config module, so
    should go under the "Config" root. 2) It attempts to be a "do what I
    mean" type module - doing the best it can to figure out any kind of
    config, so it's "Magic." I might have called it "Auto" if that
    wasn't already taken.

    Uniqueness: Config::Auto separates detection and tree building into
    two separate steps - sending the text off to other modules once it
    detects the file type. This parser does not; it merely includes
    every kind of config in it's Parse::RecDescent grammar and creates a
    tree from that. Failure to parse completely with the grammar
    indicates a bad detection rather than a score-based heuristic.

    This gives two distinct differences from Config::Auto: 1) This
    module is more flexible, allowing for hybrid types and types that do
    not have supported submodules in Config::Auto. 2) It is slower.

    Of course, it is also "competing" with all the specialized config
    modules whose format it can read (it can read Apache, Ini, CSV,
    space separated, XML, equals separated, and a lot of formats that
    currently have no names), and it's only advantage over those is that
    it can read them all.

    It should be included in the module list because as far as I know
    it is the most flexible module in existence for reading
    configuration files.

    I might also add that I am calling it beta only because I've been
    the only one to test it. There are probably remaining bugs, but if
    so they're in my blind spot.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Magic           bdphp Recognizes configuration files, makes a hash RUSTYP
