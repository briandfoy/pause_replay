I like the idea, but I don't see how it has anything to do with CGI,
unless you also want it to specifically separate the CGI headers
from the message body, then start testing. For instance, the headers
don't have to match extactly (in order, field name case, and so on).

If that's the case, *::CGI sounds fine, although *::HTTP might (might)
also fit, but so might *::RFC822 (or whatever number they are using
now).
