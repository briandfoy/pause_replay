The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fuse::PerlSSH::FS
  DSLIP:       bnpfp
  description: Mount a remote filesystem via FUSE + PerlSSH
  userid:      CLIPLAND (Clipland)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://github.com/clipland/fuse-perlssh-fs

  similar:
    Filesys::Virtual::SSH

  rationale:

    The mounting script perlsshfs found in the distribution and its
    backend module Fuse::PerlSSH::FS is meant as a drop-in replacement
    for sshfs, written in Perl. The primary goal for now is to add
    extended file attribute functionality (xattr) to the mounted
    filesystem and only later to achieve the full feature-level of
    sshfs.

    Why would I want to use perlsshfs and not sshfs?

    The sole motivation behind doing this is that sshfs won't support
    extended file attributes (xattr) anytime soon, as it relies on
    openssh's "internal FTP server". SFTP doesn't expose functions to
    manipulate extended attributes on remote files, thus the sshfs
    developers tend to ignore xattr. (Although there's a patched version
    of sshfs floating around that in turn requires a patched version of
    openssh..)

    In case the cpan maintainers would like to gradually move modules
    to the Filesys::Fuse:: namespace (away from top-level Fuse::), just
    drop us a note and we release this module as
    "Filesys::Fuse::PerlSSH::FS".

The resulting entry would be:

Fuse::PerlSSH::
