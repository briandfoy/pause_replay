The report is misleading, sorry for that. I'll try to change the
script that creates it.

What it means is that cpan2rpm-2.011.tar.gz does not contain any
modules and as such not any package statements. As it is a tarball
around a script, this is exactly what you intended and there's nothing
to fix on your side.

I'll add a line counting *.pm files.

I'll try instead if there is at least one *.pm file:

  No package statements could be found in the distro (maybe a script
  or documentation distribution?)

and will not send a report at all if there is no *.pm file.

Other suggestions welcome.
