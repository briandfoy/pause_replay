On 23jan2002 and on 20may2002 and then on 4july2002 I wrote about
the "Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to PJB" message
I was getting when I tried to "Edit Module Metadata". There should
be CGI::Htauth, Term::Clui and Crypt::Tea.  There has been no reply.
 
Until recently the modules did still appear in 00modlist.long.html
but now they have vanished from there too.
 
And yet, I am able to upload new versions and delete old ones, and
receive the usual confirmatory emails. The modules still appear
in $CPAN/authors/id/P/PJ/PJB so I'm still working on them and
they have been through several significant revisions since 23jan.
 
CPAN obviously isn't working for me.  Why not ?  Can it be revived ?
What can I do to help ?  Have I been evicted without being informed ?
Do I need to ask to re-register the namespaces and if I do will it
work any better ?

Assuming that there is no answer to this email, I will send one further
such email in about ten days time and then give up working for CPAN.
