The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Paranoid
  DSLIP:       Rdphg
  description: Paranoia support for safer programs
  userid:      CORLISS (Arthur Corliss)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module started out as a library of taint-safe and secure
    functions, but has evolved over the years into more of an
    application framework that uses the same conventions, and where
    possible, builds higher level interfaces that leverage the core
    Paranoid benefits, whether it be for concurrent access BerkeleyDB
    databases, process management, or Filesystem operations.

    In a nutshell, I've got newer code versions of registered modules I
    maintain on CPAN that I haven't released simply because they all now
    leverage the Paranoid framework instead to avoid duplicating that
    common code internally.

    As to my choice of top-level namespace, it made sense to me, but
    I'll be paranoid and say none of you will agree with me. ;-) There
    doesn't appear to be a Framework::* namespace in existence right now
    where wider scoped code bases like this really belong.

    I'm sure none of this clears up the point of these modules, so let
    the questions begin.

The resulting entry would be:
