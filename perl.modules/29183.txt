The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Algebra::Symbols
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Symbolic Manipulation in Perl
  userid:      PRBRENAN (Philip R Brenan)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Symbolic

  rationale:

    Math: its in the domain of Mathematics Algebra: the package
    appertains to the area of Mathematics designated Algebra. Symbols:
    the objects managed by Algebra are symbolic references to sets. It
    might be tempting to call it Sets instead of Symbols, but I think
    this would disappoint downloaders as they would expect to see set
    operations like union intersection etc. Calling it Numbers would
    also disappoint as although complex numbers are represented, it is
    their symbolic manipulation that is of interest rather than numeric
    calculations. 'Symbolic Processing' is a generic term for this
    subject area (see Math::Symbolic) so Symbols somewher in the name is
    appropriate. Possibly: Math::Symbolic::Algebra would be a reasonable
    alternative although this would mix things up for SMUELLER's
    packages.

  enteredby:   PRBRENAN (Philip R Brenan)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar  5 20:14:25 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Algebra::
::Symbols         adpOp Symbolic Manipulation in Perl                PRBRENAN
