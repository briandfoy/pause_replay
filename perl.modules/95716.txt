Subject: Tidying up CPAN author directory

Hi Nikolay,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that =
we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master[*]. This is =
caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author =
directories. So we=E2=80=99ve identified the authors who can free up the =
most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

Your CPAN directory has some old releases of FamilyTreeInfo:
 http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/M/MI/MISHIN/
Deleting all of the old releases could free up nearly 57M. Note that =
everything you=E2=80=99ve ever released to CPAN will always be available =
in your BackPAN directory:
 http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/M/MI/MISHIN/

You could also delete old releases of POD2-RU while you=E2=80=99re there =
as well :-)

There are at least 2 ways we can make this happen:

1. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
2. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

If you give me permission, I would delete anything that=E2=80=99s not =
the most recent release of a distribution. When marked for deletion, =
you=E2=80=99d have 3 days to check and revert anything you=E2=80=99re =
not happy with, before PAUSE would actually delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil

[*] This is a temporary problem, which will eventually be resolved with =
more diskspace, but in the meantime we need to help out the NOC by =
freeing up some space.=
