it looks like they transfered.  however, they are not registered
modules, so they do not show up as such.  Register the namespaces to
see them show up in all of the PAUSE features. 

Also, the modules in CPAN show up based on who uploaded that version,
not who currently owns the namespace.  You won't see an update on
CPAN until you upload a version.

Let me know if you need any more help.
