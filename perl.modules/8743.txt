That approach is tempting but doesn't scale well as everything in
the world gets its own DTD eventually...

We have a similar problem with Net::* now all the world is networked.

I'd prefer XML::* to be reserved for *very* generic and/or *low level*
XML manipulation modules.

Anything that's related to a single DTD should probably live elsewhere.
