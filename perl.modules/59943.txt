The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unicode::Mongolian
  DSLIP:       cdpfg
  description: Mongolian Encodings
  userid:      BAYNAA (Bayanzul Lodoysamba)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    forum of http://www.openmn.org/

  similar:
    no similar module exists yet.

  rationale:

    Classical Mongolian Script was standardized within the scope of
    ISO/IEC 10646 in 1999. However, there is no standard libraries
    regarding the classical mongolian has been released under GPLv2 yet.

    To fill the gap, currently we are interested in developing a new
    module for converting Unicode strings in classical mongolian script
    into different encodings.

    Mongolian is a cursive script, so individual letters in a word are
    joined together. In addition, the actual written form of each
    individual letter in a word generally depends on the position of the
    letter within a word.

    The standard encoding in the ISO/IEC and Unicode standards in fact
    codes only the Basic Character Set, together with special
    punctuation symbols and numerals, but does not explicitly encode the
    variant forms or the ligatures since the correct variant form or
    ligature can, at least in most cases, be determined from context.

    Hence, our module will perform that convertions between: Basic
    Character Set <-> Presentation Set & Ligatures Basic Character Set
    <-> Transliteration in Latin characters.

    We believe that this module should be listed under Unicode as
    Unicode::Mongolian, as it is the basic implementation of Classical
    Mongolian Script under Unicode standard.

The resulting entry would be:

Unicode::
::Mongolian       cdpfg Mongolian Encodings                          BAYNAA
