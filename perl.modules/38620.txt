Subject: Automated Reponse from DALnet's Services Team
Errors-To: dev-null@DAL.NET
Reply-To: dev-null@DAL.NET
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: dev-null@DAL.NET ("DALnet's Services Team")

This e-mail is an automated response to a mail that was sent to an address 
related to the DALnet IRC Network's registration services. Your e-mail was 
not received by a real person. This automated response includes information 
for the majority of e-mails to which it is a reply for. Please check below 
for information related to your particular situation. 


VIRUSES: 
        It seems that one of DALnet's e-mail addresses may have been used as the 
"From" address in a mail that contained a virus. Your system may have 
automatically responded because of this. 

ENFORCER: 
        If you attempted to e-mail someone with the address enforcer@dal.net, you 
did not correctly get their e-mail address. You saw what was an automated 
client enforcing the registration of the true nickname holder. You may have 
not actually been talking to the real user of that nickname, but your best 
bet in contacting them would be by leaving them a memo online. 

SPAM: 
        If you have received this e-mail as an autoreply to a piece of spam that 
you sent to an @dal.net mail address. Consider this your notice to remove 
all listings you have for any/all e-mail addresses that fall under the 
dal.net domain. 

HOW TO REGISTER: 
        If you are having a problem with any of DALnet's registration commands, 
or  are simply wondering how to register a nickname or channel, you need to 
go online and join the channel #operhelp and a Network Operator will assist 
you. Should no one be available there to help you, please try #dalnethelp 
as there are often helpful people there as well. 

GENERAL ASSISTANCE: 
        If you are searching for an e-mail address to provide you with answers, 
please try help@dal.net. 

CLOSED CHANNEL: 
        In cases of severe abuse, there are times when the administration finds 
the need to close a channel. We do not entertain requests to reopen them. 
If they are to be reopened, they are done so completely randomly, they are 
not given to any person in particular, and they are usually done once it 
seems there is no continued interest in the channel. Do not continue to ask. 

KICKED/BANNED/ETC FROM A CHANNEL: 
        Channels on DALnet are run by users, such as yourself. The founder of the 
channel and his/her SOPs and AOPs have complete control over who is allowed 
to be in their channel. If you find you are having a problem, you must 
speak to one of them. If you do not like how a particular channel is being 
run, you can find another one, or create your own. 

BANNED FROM THE NETWORK: 
        If you appear to be blocked from connecting to the network, the auto-kill 
(Akill) message that is sent to you when you connect contains contact 
information related to your particular situation. Please follow the 
instructions given to you. 

YOU WANT TO BE AN IRCOP: 
        We thank you for your interest, however we are not taking any requests for 
such access. 

PROBLEM WITH SERVICES AND/OR NETWORK STAFF 
        If you have a problem with the functionality of DALnet's Services (other 
than how it is being used by a channel founder to enforce that channel's 
policies), or you have a problem with how a Network Operator (not channel 
operator) is using their access to services, please contact the Services 
Root Administrators (sra@dal.net). If your problem is with a Network 
Operator, but not services related, please contact their admin directly.

Thank you, 
-DALnet Staff
