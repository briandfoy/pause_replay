     why:

    I have added a new type of ListBox module for a system here at work
    and figured that it could be useful to others. It is a standard
    implementation of the ListBox except that it is ternary as opposed
    to binary in operation, meaning that there are three possibilities
    for an option: unselected, selected, doubly selected. Was an easy
    fix, but thought someone else might could use it as well.
