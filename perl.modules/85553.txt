The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::MitM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Man in the Middle - log/tweak TCPIP messages
  userid:      BAVELING (Ben Aveling)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://prepan.org/module/nXWJ8Y9sBje

  similar:
    Net::Proxy POE

  rationale:

    The module operates at the TCPIP network level - it isn't specific
    to any particular application level protocol - it works with http or
    webservices or telnet or ... .

    I did consider TCPIP::MitM but Net:: seems to be the more commonly
    used. (There is a developer upload at TCPIP::MitM - I'll delete it
    and re-upload it as Net::MitM unless there is a better suggestion.)

    Man in the Middle is, I've found, the best way to explain the
    concept to people (this module is based on a script I've been using
    for over a decade). It was originally caused Tap, as in wire-tap,
    but tap has so many meanings that it isn't as helpful as the
    slightly longer MitM. "Man in the Middle", spelled out in full is a
    bit long, so ::MitM seems like a sensible choice.

    There aren't any modules I can find called mitm, but the term is
    used in the documentation of a couple of other network related
    modules, so I think the concept is well understood, at least in the
    target audience.

    Net::MitM can be used as a proxy, and the script it is based upon
    has been useful for that purpose. So there is some overlap with
    Net::Proxy. But being a proxy isn't the main purpose of Net::MitM.
    Net::MitM is more of a development tool, to help
    debug/code/test/performance test Client/Server applications. And it
    doesn't have the firewall awareness that Net::Proxy seems to have.

    POE appears to provide a lot of features which could maybe be used
    to implement something more or less like MitM, but not out of the
    box.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::MitM            bdpOp Man in the Middle - log/tweak TCPIP messages BAVELING
