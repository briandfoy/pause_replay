The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TeX::AutoTeX
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Automatic TeX processing
  userid:      TSCHWAND (Thorsten Schwander)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    LaTeX::Driver

  rationale:

    This module is used by arXiv (http://arXiv.org/) to automatically
    process a wide variety of TeX and (PDF-)LaTeX source packages. arXiv
    processes more than 600,000 scientific papers with code used in this
    module.

    It interfaces with comprehensive TeX installations like TeXLive and
    allows to generate PostScript and PDF from (arbitrary) TeX sources
    based on file type and dependency analysis and application of a
    collection of heuristic rules.

    Our approach is unique in that it doesn't require individual
    configuration or Makefiles or specific rule sets.

    The namespace TeX::AutoTeX makes it clear that this is a interface
    to TeX and captures the automatic nature of the processing.

    We have had many request to publish the code for people to inspect
    and use for their own purposes.

The resulting entry would be:

TeX::
::AutoTeX         bdpOp Automatic TeX processing                     TSCHWAND
