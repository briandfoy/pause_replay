Thank you Douglas,

That change solved my primary concern, the .pl files can now be viewed and saved.

Now, the server treating them as text on one hand is fine because they actually 
are text.

(On a tangent, the convention of a web server automatically executing files it 
finds in web dirs is a dangerous default and web servers should never execute 
anything except when whitelisted.)

However, I believe it can be worthwhile to take an extra step and force it to be 
a "download".  This makes the behavior consistent with the tarballs which 
conceptually they are an alternative for.

I was going to say that a primary benefit of "download" is that the file keeps 
the original file datestamp on my computer when saved rather than being changed 
to "now" if one were to click it and then choose "Save As".

However, I found that an easy workaround is to right-click on the link and 
choose "Download Linked File" etc from the contextual menu, and then in that 
case the original datestamp is preserved.

Considering that, I would be fine either way, and in fact leaving things as they 
are now may be more beneficial to people that just want to quickly browse the 
source as if it were a README.

Thanks again.
