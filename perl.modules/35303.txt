     why:

    Main contribution will be to the ppmd library written by Salvador
    Fandino. I have rewritten the c++ library to make it more general
    purpose and compatible with zlib. I have then made appropriate
    changes to the perl code (and these have been broadly agreed by
    Salvador).

    However, Salvador will shortly be going on extended honeymoon and
    is happy for me to maintain the module in his absence, but obviously
    requires me to have a cpan account to grant access permissions to.

    I hope this is enough detail?
