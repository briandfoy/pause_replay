The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::ConnectDots
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Translate identifiers between databases
  userid:      DBURDICK (David Burdick)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    CVS repository at:
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/isbiology/ConnectDots_cpan/

  similar:

  rationale:

    This data-integration/translation software is targed mostly at the
    biological field, though its use is easily generalized. As such, the
    package comes with several parsers for biologically related
    databases. Thus the Bio:: prefix.

    'ConnectDots' refers to the proccess which the module achieves:
    connecting identifiers across multiple databases. This software
    allows databases to be joined on common identifiers, and then be
    queried for translations where those databases align.

    The approach used is unique in that it provides a small query
    language to join databases and extract translations. The query
    language is general, thus eliminating the need for custom parsing
    for each outcome.

    This type of software does not currently exist on CPAN thus I
    believe it to be a worthy submission.

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
