From: damian.k.green@medtronic.com ("Green, Damian")

Earlier, I sent the following bug report, which is still valid, but I
would like to ammend my recognition for a fix...

The problem was that the last element in the list being passed in was
not being added to the output when it should have been... So instead of
removing the "next;" as I suggested before, the following needs to be
added right before "return @out;" :

	if ($prev && $ctr =3D=3D 1){	#<---takes care of last element
in the list
		push(@out,$prev);
	}

Sorry for the confusion,=20

Damian
