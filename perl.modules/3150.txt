I'm planning to contribute my syntax-compatible "make" replacement,
makepp, which is a fairly large perl program with features like
automatic include scanning, repositories and automatic variant build
handling, advanced signature checking (MD5 checksums, remembers build
command and rebuilds if the command changes).  I wanted to put this into
CPAN because it is designed to be extended by writing perl code--you can
embed perl code in your makefile, write text substitution functions in
perl, and easily incorporate perl functions to do automatic include file
scanning for other languages.  For more details see
http://lnc.usc.edu/~holt/makepp.

Thanks for your attention, and for maintaining the perl archives.
