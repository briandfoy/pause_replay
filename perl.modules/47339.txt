Subject: Module submission Math::Sparse::Matrix

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Sparse::Matrix
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Sparse Matrix Operations in Perl
  userid:      TPEDERSE (Ted Pedersen)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nlp at umd mailing list (nlpatumd@yahoogroups.com)

  similar:
    PDL::Sparse Math::MatrixSparse

  rationale:

    The module Math::Sparse::Matrix will provide support for sparse
    matrix operations in standard Perl. The main functionality that we
    intend to introduce initially is to transpose sparse matrices, and
    do other elementary manipulations (like finding the size of the
    matrix, the row and column sums, etc). Over the long term, we would
    like the functionality to be similar to that provided in
    PDL::Sparse. The difference between our module and that is that we
    will use standard Perl and not PDL. We also have some of the same
    goals as the module Math::MatrixSparse, but this module appears to
    be unsupported, and only had 1 release (version 0.01) in 2002.

    This module will make use of methods provided in
    Math::Sparse::Vector. Our rationale for the namespace Math::Sparse
    (instead of Math::Matrix for example) is that the sparse
    representation is key to our module, and we do not intend to add
    support for dense matrices. We will have code in Math::Sparse that
    is used by both Math::Sparse::Vector and Math::Sparse::Matrix.

The resulting entry would be:
