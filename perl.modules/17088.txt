Don't recall getting this message. but.... no - sorta.... I suppose you
could use it with any type of hash, but what would be the point? It was
written to implement the cookie encryption scheme needed for secure
cookies per the guidelines for Apache::AuthCookie. In addition to that,
I've used it with Apache::Cookie to make other information carrying
cookies, including a mini shopping cart module that I'll probably
release eventually as well though it's pretty dumb code as modules go.
There is no requirement per-se for module "Apache", it's just apache
oriented but could be used with CGI::Cookie in a similar fashion. Would
you like to suggest another name that might be more appropriate?

Michael
