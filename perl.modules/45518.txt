The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ETL::Pequel
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Data processing (ETL) Perl program generator
  userid:      GAFFIE (M Gaffiero)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pequel/

  similar:

  rationale:

    Why ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)? There does not currently appear
    to be a namespace that reflects datawarehouse/datamining/ETL/OLAP
    development and tools. DBI is not quite it because itâs more
    database specific, whereas ETL tools could be cross-database and
    also relate to raw and ASCII data processing independent of any
    specific database type. ETL/Datawarehousing tools are not only used
    to extract and load data into databases. A major part of the ETL/DW
    process consists of data transforming, cleansing, statistics,
    aggregation, frequency analysis, data-process distribution, etc.

    Pequel is a comprehensive data processing/transform system. It
    features a simple, user-friendly event driven scripting interface
    that transparently generates & execs highly efficient Perl/C code.
    The generated program can be modified (though no modification is
    required) and executed independently of Pequel. Its scripting
    interface is simple enough for non-programmers to use. Its
    object-oriented base class design will allow experienced developers
    to easily extend the Pequel language with new event (section) types,
    macros, aggregate types, etc.

    Pequel will generate Perl programs for: data transforming, data
    cleansing, distributed data processing, statistical analysis,
    aggregation, apache CLF log file processing, and other data
    processes.

The resulting entry would be:

ETL::
::Pequel          bdpOg Data processing (ETL) Perl program generator GAFFIE
