Thanks for the points.  It was a toss up for me between
options 1 and 2.  You've convinced me about the utility
of a meaningful name for non-developers.  Based on the
additional input:

Name:  PDL::Graphics::OpenGL::Perl

   PDL -- a Perl Data Language module
   Graphics::OpenGL -- deals with graphics and OpenGL
   Perl -- indicates Perl based OpenGL
              (POGL is more precise but since the point is
              to use the Perl OpenGL module, this should
              be easier to remember)

ChapterID:  06-Data Type Utilities

   Keep the new namespace with PDL since it is intended
   to unbundle some of the current monolithic PDL functions.

Regards,
Chris
