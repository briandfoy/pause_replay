The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree::Predicate
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: predicate trees, usually for SQL
  userid:      MARSHALL (David Marshall)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://wiki.github.com/dwmarshall/perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    Working on Bugzilla at Yahoo!, I found a need to improve the
    performance of dynamically-generated SQL queries with large,
    unwieldy predicates. This module was created to deal with those,
    changing predicates with lots of ORs into a series of predicates
    that can be UNIONed together to form a logically equivalent query.

  enteredby:   MARSHALL (David Marshall)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr  6 23:35:15 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tree::
::Predicate       bdpfp predicate trees, usually for SQL             MARSHALL
