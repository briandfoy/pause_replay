The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::GopherRepellent
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: keep those pesky gophers out of your dists!
  userid:      RWSTAUNER (Randy Stauner)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::RJBS

  rationale:

    =head1 RATIONALE

    I built my own PluginBundles after my ini files started getting
    unruly.

    It also made sense to me to build a separate PluginBundle for
    C<$work> which could use this one and then set a few attributes.

    This bundle is essentially C<BeLike::RWSTAUNER>. (Who would want to
    do that?)

    It is subject to change.

    I am still new to Dist::Zilla and uploading to CPAN and am trying
    to learn how to make good/quality/kwalitee modules.

    Therefore this bundle may be useful for others who aren't quite
    sure what they want or how they want it, but would like to have as
    much generated as possible to make a "complete" dist.

    Beyond that audience this may be mostly for my own use (and for
    people I work with who are less inclined to roll their own), but
    perhaps my choices and documentation will help others along the way
    (or encouarage someone to set me straight).
