Hello,

can you help me with this:

I found some errors in a module (CGI::FormBuilder) but all my attempts to  
contact the author failed.
I have the fixes and would like to incorporate them into the source or  
have somebody else do that.
What is the proper way to reach this goal?

Thanks in advance

	Wolfgang
