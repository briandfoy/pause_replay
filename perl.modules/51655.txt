Greetings.

Pod::HtmlEasy has not had any maintenance since 2004. I've taken it =20
upon myself to create a development version, (Pod-HtmlEasy-0.08_01 in =20
directory GLEACH) which has repairs for all outstanding bug reports and =20
a couple of minor enhancements. If you wish, please take the changes. =20
However, if you do not wish to continue maintaining Pod::HtmlEasy, I'd =20
be willing to take it on, and will request co-maintainership if I don't =20
receive a reply from you.

FWIW, here is what I've changed.

0.08_01 2006-09-25
       - Changes made by GLEACH
       - Minor cleanup in test.pl
       - Replaced test/1.simple.html; S<> formatting was incorrect.
       - Updated test/2.graphic.pod; source of test file, made it a jpg
       - Added test/graphic-file.jpg
       - Added test/3.bugs.pod
       - podhtmleasy.pl: added shebang and fixed warnings. [6062]
       - HtmlEasy.pm fixed warnings [6062]
       - HtmlEasy/Parser.pm fixed warnings [6062]
       - Added support for X<...> [20078]
