Dear Sir,

With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe
youwould be of great assistance to my children and me.

I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of
KONOBO in the KEREMA local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the
wife of Late DR. MUNDI A. KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced
loyal to Major John Paul Koromah because he was the Director General
National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra Leone. Few days
before my husband was assassinated, he  instructed me and my children
(Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately, before the
powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG) forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I managed to escape to Republic of Lome (Togo), through the help of my
husband’s friend.
We came into Republic of Lome (Togo), with some valuables including a cash
sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two
trunks boxes which I have deposited with a Trust
Company here in Republic of Lome (Togo) and special arrangement has been
made with the currier company who will freight the money to your country.

Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for
the future of my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this
fund from the Trust Company, after which the fund will be deposited into
your
account for investment in your country. You should also help us to source
for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.

We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I am
being monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will
advice you to have the deal concluded with my son who is presently in London
for this purpose. Please contact my son on this emails: ibrahim@inbox.lv /
ibrahim@mailbox.as, Fax: 442079002816 immediately you receive this letter
to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and
transferring same into your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions.

Note: There is no risk involved in this business.

Remain Blessed,

MRS. ANNE  KOJO
