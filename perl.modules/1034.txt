Net::FTP uses classes under the Net::FTP:: namespace, so I am
not sure that is a good place for this module. Also it would
seem that this module does not "extend" Net::FTP or get used by
Net::FTP like all other modules under that namespace.

Also I would suspect that anyone looking for this module on CPAN is not
likely to look for it under Net::FTP, but instead under a namespace
that is related to MVS or JES. I would suggest something like
MVS::JESFTP
