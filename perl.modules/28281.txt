The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Digest::Tools
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Tools for digest versions of mailing lists
  userid:      JKEENAN (James E Keenan)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org; comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    Mail::Digest::Tools provides useful tools for processing mail which
    an individual receives in a 'daily digest' version from a mailing
    list and stores locally. Within the Perl community, digest versions
    of mailing lists are offered by such sponsors as Active State,
    Sourceforge, Yahoo! Groups and London.pm. However, you do not have
    to be interested in Perl to make use of Mail::Digest::Tools. Mail
    from any of the thousands of Yahoo! Groups, for example, may be
    processed with this module.

    Given the module's objective, the rationale for choice of namespace
    should be fairly evident. The secondary level namespace 'Digest' is
    provided to allow for future development of other approaches to this
    problem. However, should you believe that this module should be
    farther down in the directory tree, I would be willing to consider
    suggestions for a tertiary level namespace as well.

    I have been developing and using the code for this module for over
    three years and so it is really more mature than 'alpha'. I have
    written over 20 pages of documentation, but a test suite remains to
    be done.

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::Digest::
::Tools           adpfp Tools for digest versions of mailing lists   JKEENAN
