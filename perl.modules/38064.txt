The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SSN::Validate
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Module which does SSN validation on AAAA-GG
  userid:      KMELTZ (Kevin Meltzer)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Started as just something I needed, which didn't seem to already
    have a module for. I made it a while ago, and based on emails I get,
    people are using it. I'd also like to have more in the SSN
    namespace, such as SSN::SSDI for the Social Security Death Index.
    SSN was my obvious choice, since it deals with Social Security
    numbers.

  enteredby:   KMELTZ (Kevin Meltzer)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb  1 17:39:35 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SSN::
::Validate        RdpOp Module which does SSN validation on AAAA-GG  KMELTZ
