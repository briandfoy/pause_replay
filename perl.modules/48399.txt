Hi there,

I attempted to upload a new version of SUPER this evening, but PAUSE responded 
with this error message.  According to the permissions there, P5P has 
permissions.  I took over maintainership from Simon Cozens in 2004 -- to my 
knowledge there has been no change in permissions.

-- c

The following report has been written by the PAUSE namespace indexer.
Please contact modules@perl.org if there are any open questions.
