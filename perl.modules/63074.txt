Hi!

I'm already doing this whenever possible. I sending patches to module
authors for many years, and nearly all was accepted. But quality of most
CPAN modules isn't acceptable for me (I rant about this on perlmonks some
time ago), and that's why I wrote my own and why my modules use only few
CPAN modules.

    Maybe everything is ok with CPAN modules quality, and it just me who
    have ill understanding of word 'reliable' meaning... As example, I did
    survey on CPAN some time ago, and find __ONLY__ module (except my)
    which use CLOCK_MONOTONIC for timers (it was module EV). As result,
    I'm right now rewriting my modules working with event loop to use EV
    instead of my own pure-perl epoll-based event loop. So, you see, when
    I find good enough for me CPAN modules - I'm happy to drop my own and
    start using CPAN modules instead.

If you ask me - I'd prefer that all CPAN module authors stop writing new
modules and help improving and reorganising existing modules - that will
render CPAN much more useful than just adding new modules. But looks like
nobody want to do this work, developing new things much more interesting
than fixing old things... and nobody pay for this 'not interesting' work.

I live a lot of years without uploading my modules to CPAN (though they
was available for free from my website, later from my CPAN::Site mirror).
But now I'd like to release some software, which use these modules... and
to make life easier for users of that software I've to provide them
ability to install required modules in usual way - from CPAN.

So, improving existing modules _instead_ of uploading own isn't an option
for me right now.

</OT>

Chances are problem I faced with POWER::Utils isn't unique, so I'm still
looking for recommendations how to solve it in best way. If this list
isn't suitable place for such questions - please point me to another
place. If there will be no answer, I'll probably use both solutions -
inline some functions from POWER::Utils to other modules and try to
release other functions as separate modules on CPAN.

Ok, thanks. I'll rename it to 'With' and try to register name space now.
I hope if there arise better ideas it will be possible to delete module
later to avoid cluttering in top level CPAN names...

Yeah, I already find this thread:
    http://www.mail-archive.com/modules@perl.org/msg01544.html
It's very explanatory, and I think it's good idea to have quotes from it
somewhere near
    https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_04about#registering
