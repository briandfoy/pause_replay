Austin,

I would like to do some cleanup on the module IO::Stty.

I notice IO::Stty hasn't had any attention since 1998. My guess is
that maybe you're overwhelmed with other priorities and of course CPAN
often get's pushed to the bottom of the list. I'd like to offer to
take over maintenance of the module.

If you're open to this, you can just add TODDR as a co-maintainer or
maintainer in PAUSE and I will do the needful from there.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
