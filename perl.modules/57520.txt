Yes, I had forgotten about that. Is there a chance I can get that  
account renamed?

Unfortunately, I tried logging into HAWKALOOG and seem to have lost  
the password, and the e-mail address (doug@hawkaloogie.com) is no  
longer functioning. I don't know how I can actually prove that one  
was me except by admitting that, yes, that stuff posing as code was  
me # years ago.

If there's no way to change that account name, and no way to change  
that account password without more proof of identity, I'll need the  
new login anyway.
