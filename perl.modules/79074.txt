Hi Brian, nice to hear from you, thanks for the answer.

Do you think the original author deleted modules by himself? I thought
maybe his code got somehow "banned" from cpan (all of his modules are gone).

I will try to contact him, surely.

If I receive no answer from the author, what name would you suggest for the
rereleased module? Maybe there is some special namespace for that?

Regards,

Petya.

<br>
There are a couple things you can do.<br>
<br>
1. Ask for maintainership of the module from the author and re-release<br>
it.<br>
<br>
2. Grab the module from BackPAN and re-release it under a new name,<br>
