I am working on the following:

Exporter::
::Options       adpO  Extends Exporter to handle use-line options  YSTH

Calendar::
::Hebrew        cdpO  Hebrew calendar conversion/manipulation      YSTH

Exporter::Options comes out of a discussion on cplmod where I
suggested adding simple options capability to Exporter.  IlyaZ and
others rightly responded that this would be better done with a
separate module extending Exporter.

Calendar::Hebrew is my attempt at making available to others routines
I wrote for a script I've been using.  This original script makes only
limited use of objects and I've been working on expanding that.  It
uses some classes under Calendar::Hebrew, to whit: ::Date, ::Year,
::Moadim, ::Parasha, and maybe more to come.

By the way, $CPAN/modules/04pause.html says module descriptions can
be up to 45 characters, but it looks like there is only room for 44.
