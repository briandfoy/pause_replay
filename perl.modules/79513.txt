Hi,

At the start of each CPAN module review I do, there is a table of =
summary information for all the modules reviewed. Ron suggested that the =
module which builds up this information be released to CPAN. See an =
example at http://neilb.org/reviews/constants.html

At the moment this is part of the mash of code I use to construct the =
reviews, but I could pull it out to a small distribution, which would =
probably have two modules in it:

One which talks to MetaCPAN, gets the RT summary file, and talks to the =
CPAN dependencies service.
The other which is a data object, one per module.=20

At the moment I have everything internally under a CPAN::Curation:: =
namespace, but if released separately I don't think that's appropriate.

CPAN::Module::Metadata for the data class?
CPAN::Module::GetMetadata for the builder? =
CPAN::Module::Metadata::Factory?

I don't really like the second name, but can't think of a better one off =
the cuff.

There are a number of modules which do related things, but I couldn't =
find one which does this, when I started. Questions:

Is there an appropriate module / distribution that this could be fit =
into?
Does this make sense to have as a separate dist?
What are good names for the two classes?

cheers,
Neil
