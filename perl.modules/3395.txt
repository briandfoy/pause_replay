Hi,

yes, you are right, there is a huge amount of config modules on CPAN, but
most of them are part of another package or they does not fit our
requirements. In fact we needed a generic module, which supports nested
blocks,here-docs and multi-options(named blocks or multiple identical
options with different values which will returned as array) and does
not require additional modules.

IMHO it is not suited for Apache:: namespace(and it has nothing to with
apache, it just uses a similar format because most people are familiar
with it), but I found a module named CONFIG::Hash(but it supports only
key/value pairs) - if it is ok, I would like to contact the author of this
module if we can merge our modules.
Btw, does it have a special case why the CONFIG Namespace is all
uppercase?


Thanks,

=09Thomas
