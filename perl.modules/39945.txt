  rationale:

    For ETL applications, we often need to extract or collect data
    records, then use them to insert into, delete from or update on the
    target table based on some criteria. This module provides a series
    of functions to perform inserting, updating and/or deleting.

The resulting entry would be:

Oracle::
::DML             adpOp provides functions for Oracle batch DML      GEOTIGER
