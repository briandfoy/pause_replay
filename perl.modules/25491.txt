The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sparse
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Supporting sparse data structures in Perl
  userid:      AMRUTA (Amruta Purandare)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nlpatumd@yahoogroups.com

  similar:
    PDL::Sparse requires PDL while Sparse is developed using regular
    Perl

  rationale:

    We notice, there are various modules that implement computations on
    dense data structures like dense matrices and vectors. These do not
    work very efficiently and cosume lot of time and memory when the
    input matrices/vectors are of a large order like in tens of
    thousands. Many applications use huge data structures that are often
    very sparse and where storing 0s or non-content values is an
    unnecessary burden on programs that involve heavy computations on
    such large sparse data structures.

    The main focus of Sparse module that we are proposing here is to
    provide operations on large sparse data structures in Perl. We plan
    to provide methods on sparse vectors and matrices in this.

    We found only one module PDL::Sparse that supports sparse data
    structures however it requires installation of PDL which is a very
    big module itself.

    Sparse module is developed in normal Perl and requires no extra
    installations other than Perl language.

The resulting entry would be:

Sparse            RdpOg Supporting sparse data structures in Perl    AMRUTA
