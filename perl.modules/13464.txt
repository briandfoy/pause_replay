The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::FedExDC
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: Interface to FedEx Ship Manager Direct
  userid:      JPOWERS (Jay Powers)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Business::FedEx

  rationale:

    FedEx has released a new method of communicating with their Ship
    Manager server via SSL POST. FedEx calls this service "FedEx Ship
    Manager Direct Connect"
    (http://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/).

    Business::FedExDC will provide the necessary communication using
    LWP and Crypt::SSLeay. This new service is much easier than the
    previous module (Business::FedEx) as it will talk directly to FedEx
    and there is no need to install FedEx's JRE-based API.

    Additionally, Business::FedExDC allows full "non-Win32"
    functionality. In the previous version, non-windows users had to
    proxy to a windows box.

    Thanks, Jay Powers
