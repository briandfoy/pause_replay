The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Shm
  DSLIP:       adhhp
  description: Easily keep variables in SysV shared memory
  userid:      KCODY (Kevin Cody-Little)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    #perlshm on FreeNode

  similar:
    IPC::Shm::Simple IPC::Shareable

  rationale:

    This module allows a variable to be in shared memory simply by
    using the following syntax:

    use IPC::Shm; our %variable : shm;

    It uses IPC::Shm::Simple as its backing store, Storable as its
    serializer, and relies on smart caching to maximize performance.

    The similar IPC::Shareable uses a tied/reference syntax and expects
    locking to be done manually. Although this module can be used in
    that way, here we aim for simplicity.

    Lexicals can be stored in shared memory, but without a reference to
    them, they aren't really shared. This module will translate
    anonymous references so that a shared lexical can be pointed to by
    another shared variable.

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::Shm             adhhp Easily keep variables in SysV shared memory  KCODY
