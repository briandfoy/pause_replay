Subject: Module submission Multimedia::SDP

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Multimedia::SDP
  DSLIP:       adhOl
  description: SDP Parser and Generator classes
  userid:      WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Session Description Protocol is a standard way to describe
    multimedia sessions (see RFC 2327).

    This module is divided into two main classes:
    Multimedia::SDP::Parser and Multimedia::SDP::Generator, the first
    parses SDP descriptions and the second generates them
    programmatically. They link to a C library called SinisterSdp using
    XSubs.

    I originally proposed SDP::Parser and SDP::Generator, but Brian D
    Foy recommended against them citing their nonspecifically, and I
    have to agree with him (Bluetooth, for example, has its own thing
    called "SDP," and there are probably a few other common technologies
    using that acronym as well).

    This name seems pretty accurate and descriptive. Yes, SDP isn't
    exactly multimedia, but it describes it, which I think is close
    enough.

  enteredby:   WGDAVIS (William G. Davis)
  enteredon:   Mon Oct  4 05:34:59 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Multimedia::
::SDP             adhOl SDP Parser and Generator classes             WGDAVIS
