Andy, have you spoken to the Geo::Gpx author about taking over that 
distribution to add the functionality that you need?

It might be that he would be happy to give you the module outright.

Further, Are you sure that "Generate GPX files" is the correct description?

Also, generally "Parse" is the most often-used term for parsing modules, 
and so something like Geo::Parse::GPX may be more appropriate.
