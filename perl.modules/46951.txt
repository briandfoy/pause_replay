Well, may be, but your doc specifies that :

  The format of config files supported by B<Config::Generic> is inspired
  by the well known apache config format. Additional features are
  advanced syntactic verification using a specfile, here-documents and
  flexible access methods.

As a matter of fact, I don't think that your module can handle INI
style config files (e.g. like kdmrc for instance)

So, some might think that the *Generic* part of the module name you
suggested is misleading. (ok, Config::General name is also misleading,
IMHO)

So, is there a way to mention that your module is dedicated to
Apache-like syntax ?

Hmm, this feature is quite close to the Config::Model module I
registered some weeks ago. Although I've completely separated the
parsing and validation part.

May be we should compare our notes...

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/config-model for more details and
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/config-model/config-model-core/README?rev=1.1.1.1&view=auto

Cheers
