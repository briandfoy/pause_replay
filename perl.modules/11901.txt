Description: I have written a module to access to a Hylafax-Server
             over network. It based on the module Net::FTP.
             I named it Net::Hylafax.
             With this module you can submit facsimiles to the
             server, you can get informations about the server
             and his queues, you can manage jobs on the server a.s.o.
             Additionally I have written two scripts with this module,
             to show, how you can use this module and to use these
             scripts to get some informations about a Hylafax-server
             and to send a fax over a Hylafax-server.

With kindly regards.

Frank Brehm
