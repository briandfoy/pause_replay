Hi brian d foy ! I'm from São Paulo, I was one of the people that organize 
the São Paulo Perl Workshop, and I met you this year in the event. :-)

Yes. I do this, but the time to do that is 3 days, and backpan and all the
mirrors can get the file.

Now, the files removed from cpan, backpan, metacpan and pause. Thank's
for you answer and everybody of cpan team, I'm very surprise with the
community.

Offcourse, I use Dist::Zilla to manage my modules in CPAN, but I make
a big mistake with 'dzil release' and I send the module to CPAN, and I
can remove from the cpan 'fast', when I see this in prompt (the upload)
to cpan... I go to the pause.perl.org, but the time to delete the file
that I just upload is 3 days, so the file is get index to search.cpan,
apper in mirrors of backcpan and metacpan.

Again, Thank's everbody for the help. 

Ps.: In annex, my dist.ini file of project, I'm writing an email to
dist zilla people, to change the phrase from 'do you to process
this release now ?' to 'do you want to upload to cpan ?'. Maybe,
someone can make the same mistake I made.

Thanks for you answer!
