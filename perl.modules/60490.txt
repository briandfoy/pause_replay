G'day modules list,

Quick sanity check here.  I understand the App:: space is the recommended 
space for modules that are essentially applications.  I've put together a 
little labour-saving program that plays Windows MineSweeper for me.

Am I correct that App::SweeperBot would be considered an appropriate 
namespace for this application?

Many thanks,

	Paul
