i dont know of a standard name for this file format. i call
it 'nv'.

somebody noted that it would be useful to see the api. here
is a list of methods:

# takes an optional properties obj to use as default
new

get_property

# populates the object from a stream
load

# returns an enumeration of property names, including any defaults
property_names

set_property

# serializes the object to a stream
store

see.. a whole lotta discussion over something really simple
:) i could certainly use Storable or Data::Dumper or
whatever but yes, the file format is the important part.
properties objects are mostly used as far as i can tell for
specifying configuration data, so the file format is as
simple as possible, so as to allow complete bozos to
reconfigure the application:

# this is a comment. i love comments.
my.chunk.o.data:	its value \
      consists of all of this whole string

my instinct is still to go with Data::Properties and to just
dump it in the corner for folks who might be familiar with
the name and its context and file format from java.
