Most people aren't looking to classify their frameworks by names. You
mentioned Catalyst and others; they didn't choose their names because
they didn't find a general noun to place their modules under. They
aren't trying to classify their modules in the era of "Search".

You can upload your module where you like, but I don't think other
people are going to follow you.
