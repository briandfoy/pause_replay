Hi Dave Oswald

Thanx for the explanation. It's clearly frustrating. I don't have as 
much experience as the other PAUSE admins, so I'll wait for one of them 
to respond. My initial reaction is that 30 days is still a bit too short 
a wait time. Nevertheless, it is important, so if anyone says do it, 
I'll do it...
