the requirements are:

   * descriptive name

   * obvious name

   * name that allows for expansion of namespace

"Auth" is very general.  what sort of authorization?  you can make that
more descriptive by being more specific.

"Vtui" is also very general.  my command line is already a command line
interface.  how is your interface different?  what is special about it?

I suggest what i have already suggested:

   CGI::Auth::NameOfAuthType

   Term::UI::NameOfUIType
