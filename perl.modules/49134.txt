The namespace is fine, the web framework area is so overpopulated that 
"brand names" have become the only way to manage it now.

Generally the bundling is considered bad. If you can install from CPAN 
_already_ you can certainly handle normal CPAN dependency installation.

CPAN is considered the canonical source and so the most normal method is 
used.

If you wish to distribute an aggregate distribution that contains all 
the dependencies, feel free to put it on your website, or anywhere else 
you like (and even link it from inside the main distribution) but 
putting it on CPAN is not really a good idea.

On the plus side, there are even tools out there that will automatically 
compile this all-in-one distribution for you.
