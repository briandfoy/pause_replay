Hello Brian, Robert,

That's fine by me. I haven't seen any messages about this for years  
but I'm happy to see it continue. Do let me know if there's anything I  
can do to help.

Please would you pass on to the new owner that the main reason that  
development stopped was a legal note from the post office about the  
postcode data distributed with the last release. I undertook not to  
distribute it any more, since I could not prove that it contained none  
of their copyright  (and neither, as it turned out, could the people I  
got it from, despite their earlier assurances). I can give you the  
story if you like, but the short version is that any new release would  
be well-advised to find a new sample data set or manage without.

Best wishes,

will
