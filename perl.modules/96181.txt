We repeat: by PAUSE admin fiat, this is no longer true.  Saying it
repeatedly will not make it true.

I considered preemptively escrowing DBIC primary permissions with ADOPTME
pending the outcome of these discussions, but felt that might discourage
you from participating further and might show unfair bias against your
ideas and moral authority, which is not our goal.

However =E2=80=93 make no mistake =E2=80=93  unilateral transfers will be u=
ndone unless we
feel satisfied that the principles we have established for an orderly
resolution have been honored.

The rest of this email is an attempt to assist in consideration of those
principles.

If by "announcing your plans" means things like [1], it's possible that you
think you have clearly conveyed your plans in a way that isn't what came
across to others.  Quoting from that link [1]:

To me, that sounds like a general departure statement.  It doesn't sounds
like a plan for DBIC.  It certainly doesn't sound like "I'm going to freeze
DBIC", which from your earlier email [2] was the first hint I got of an
actual plan:

That's not "I'm leaving CPAN and will be letting others take things
forward".  That's "I'm kicking out everyone already involved and freezing
the project."

Has that *specific* plan been previously articulated anywhere?  If so, I
missed it in your footnotes.  Has it been publicly discussed in a DBIC or
other public forum?  If so, please share (or reshare) links.

So barring evidence of that discussion anywhere within the DBIC community,
my hypothesis is that this communication gap is behind at least part of the
current disconnect about succession plans.  You said:

> there has been a huge 9+ months "discussion period" during which
> nobody (besides mst) came forward expressing concerns regarding my plans.

What prompted the current dispute was not any specific plan =E2=80=93 it wa=
s the
lack of any discussion of specifics.

You say nobody has come forward to object.  Consider that nobody has come
forward in support, either.

This is the fundamental issue that concerns PAUSE administrators =E2=80=93 =
that a
significant directional change to a project as important as DBIC is being
done without public discussion of specifics.  Having been made aware of the
situation in greater detail, *we are expressing concerns regarding (that
part of) your plan*.  It is now no longer just Matt.

We don't oppose your plan.  We oppose the lack of transparency around an
important decision for an important CPAN project.

We, too, encourage other maintainers and/or community members to join the
conversation.

You also said:

> #4 is not an ideal, but a viable chance for the user community to come
together and take responsibility
> for steering things further.

I'd love to hear more about how you think that might work, as it sounds
like exactly what the PAUSE administrators think would be beneficial to
resolving this situation.

Regards,
David
