The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UML::State
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: draws state diagrams from simple text files
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    UML::Sequence

  rationale:

    This module is part of my continuing attempt to produce text based
    ways to produce UML diagrams. UML::Sequence draws sequence diagrams
    from simple text files, or by actually running the code. UML::State
    draws state diagrams from simple text files.

    I don't like to point and click. I would rather have Perl work for
    me. With UML::State I can draw a state diagram in a few minutes,
    then edit it with vi whenever it needs maintenance. The output is in
    SVG which can be converted easily to PNG or JPEG with free tools.

    I don't think there are other state diagram tools on CPAN.

The resulting entry would be:

UML::
