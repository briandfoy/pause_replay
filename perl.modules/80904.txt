The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Async
  DSLIP:       incOp
  description: Win32 Async IO and threads on any event loop
  userid:      BULKDD (Daniel Dragan)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2012/06/msg9672.html

  similar:

  rationale:

    Per the module-authors post, the library allows events to be
    delivered to many event loops (anything that has a C API and is
    thread safe, and is a event loop from a Perl level). The events are
    Win32 kernel async I/O on kernel file handles and kernel sockets,
    along with kernel thread synchronization objects, and from events
    from C APIs that use thread pools were the C callbacks run in dozens
    of random short lived threads. Currently its impossible to do any
    kind of async File I/O or receive events from random threaded C
    libraries on Perl on Windows. Since the Windows C Standard Lib
    doesn't support non-blocking I/O, and "select" supports only socket
    handles, no cross platform Perl event loops on Windows support
    non-synchronous File/Disk I/O. Native Windows thread synchronization
    primitives are unusable outside of the Win32::IPC event loop and
    Win32::IPC module were they come from, my module fixes that. Of the
    dozen async/non-blocking event loop modules on perl every one of
    them use BSD, POSIX, or Linux specific APIs that are not available
    on Windows. The design of my module does not use ithreads at all, so
    the module is not for using multiple processors for data processing,
    it is only for receiving events. No objections were raised to name
    Win32::Async. Currently I have integration into Glib/GTK, Wx,
    Perl/TK, Tkx/Tcl, Win32::Gui, Win32::IPC and perl signals event
    loops so far and have tested the module with 1 perl interpreter
    having 1000s of async pending file I/O operations in the kernel but
    its a long way from being publishable.

The resulting entry would be:
