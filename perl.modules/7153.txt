The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::DE::Konto
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Validating german bank account numbers
  userid:      TINITA (Tina Mueller)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    de.comp.lang.perl.misc

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is a commercial module which hasn't been updated recently, so
    I came up with the idea to implement it my self.

    The BLZs (Bank-zip-codes) are published by the national bank with a
    check-method ID quarterly. The descriptions of theese methods are
    published, too. There are 98 different check-methods.

    At the moment I've implemented methods 00 to 27, some are tested,
    but I don't have test numbers for all the methods, so I need a
    little bit more testing and, of course, the rest of the methods,
    28-98.

    I would be glad about any feedback, also if something like this
    exists for other countries, too. I just know there are mofules for
    checking credit cards, and one for norwegian bank accounts.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::DE::
