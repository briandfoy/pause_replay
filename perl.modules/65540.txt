From: cnehren@pobox.com (Christopher Nehren)

Received a report from dandv on magnet that this module won't install.
Tried it myself and got the following:

$ cpan Net::IDN::Encode
CPAN: Storable loaded ok (v2.18)
Going to read /home/apeiron/.cpan/Metadata
  Database was generated on Thu, 23 Apr 2009 05:26:59 GMT
CPAN: YAML::XS loaded ok (v0.32)
Going to read 18 yaml files from /home/apeiron/.cpan/build/
CPAN: Time::HiRes loaded ok (v1.9711)
............................................................................DONE
Restored the state of 18 (in 0.0075 secs)
Running install for module 'Net::IDN::Encode'

  The module Net::IDN::Encode isn't available on CPAN.

  Either the module has not yet been uploaded to CPAN, or it is
  temporary unavailable. Please contact the author to find out
  more about the status. Try 'i Net::IDN::Encode'.

Seems to me that the .pm file is in the wrong spot, though I could be
wrong.
