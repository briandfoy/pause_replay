The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::InsideOut
  DSLIP:       Rdppp
  description: Comprehensive inside-out object support
  userid:      JDHEDDEN (Jerry D. Hedden)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:
    Class::Std

  rationale:

    This module provides comprehensive support for implementing classes
    using the inside-out object model.

    The module implements inside-out objects as anonymous scalar
    references that have been blessed into a class with the scalar
    containing the ID for the object. Object data (i.e., fields) are
    stored in hashes within the class's package and are keyed to the
    object's ID.

    This module offers all the capabilities of Class::Std with the
    following additional key advantages:

    1. Speed - As fast as blessed-hash objects for fetching and setting
    data, and 2.5-4.5 times faster than Class::Std.

    2. Threads - Class::Std is not thread safe. Object::InsideOUt is
    thread safe, and thoroughly supports sharing objects between threads
    using threads::shared.

    3. Flexibility - Allows control over object ID specification,
    accessor naming, parameter name matching, and more.
