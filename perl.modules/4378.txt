Hi,

I've taken over maintenance of Business::CreditCard from Jon and uploaded
Business-CreditCard-0.22.tar.gz to CPAN.  It is identical to the current
0.21 version, except it includes MakeMaker installation. 

What do I need to to do have this module indexed such that it is picked up
by CPAN.pm?

Also, Business::CreditCard is on the Module List; if you could update
the maintainer, that would be great.  My CPAN id is IVAN.

Thanks!

I hereby dub you the new maintainer, then.  Thanks, and sorry for not
having the time to reply earlier.
