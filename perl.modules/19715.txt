The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Binder
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: map of key-values for simple unification
  userid:      HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    will be featured on my site, on irc, and will be used by future
    modules

  similar:
    (found no other simple term-unification methods)

  rationale:

    (See pod ABSTRACT and README) A Binder is a special map of keys to
    potential values; it supports non-conflicting unification against
    other Binders or terms. Each key term in the Binder may be unbound
    (associated with an undef value), or bound to a defined scalar
    value. Unbound keys may be bound to anything, and bound keys may
    only be bound to identical values. Attempts to bind a new set of
    values succeeds completely or fails without changes.

    This module is of general usefulness, but will be a dependency for
    upcoming HALLEY modules to be submitted later.

  enteredby:   HALLEY (Ed Halley)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 24 12:57:27 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Binder          bdpOp map of key-values for simple unification     HALLEY
