The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DISCO
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: DISCO client interface
  userid:      WENZ (Christian Wenz)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provide functions to interpret DISCO. DISCO (short for
    Discovery) is a pseudo-standard by Microsoft for Web Services. A
    published .disco file, which is an XML document that contains links
    to other resources that describe the XML Web service (e.g. an HTML
    description or a WSDL description), enables programmatic discovery
    of an XML Web service. Many .NET Web Services expose this
    information; the module creates a simple API access to the
    information within these file types. I am not to sure about where to
    put the module, since there is no "Web Services" category yet. SOAP
    has its own new rootlevel namespace. Maybe one could put this into
    the XML namespace, but I am uncertain about that.

The resulting entry would be:

DISCO             adpOp DISCO client interface                       WENZ
