I made a request about a week ago and have neither received a positive nor 
a negative response -- for which cpan and pause proclaim as a good sign 
since no one disagrees with the notion. I see my modules parsed and loaded 
into my author directory www.cpan.org/authors/id/K/KI/KITDEKAT/ and the 
category directory 
www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/03_Development_Support/Perf/KITDEKAT/ yet 
i dont see Perf::Stopwatch  listed in the 
http://cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html page. I at first thought that 
it was an automatic part of the pause namespace creation process, but i 
havent seen it yet and i was wondering what else is required before it 
becomes visible on the main module listing. I am able to install from the 
cpan shell, but if someone is browsing for it on the website, then they 
will not see it.

Thank you for your time...
