The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RPM::Make::DWIW
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Create RPM from a specification hashref.
  userid:      ABLUM (Asher Blum)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:
    RPM::Make::Simple Youri::Package::RPM::Builder RPM::Make
    Software::Packager::RPM

  rationale:

    Namespace choice: in amongst the existing RPM-making modules -
    without being confusingly similar to any.

    Uniqueness: None of the existing modules meet the criteria I want:

    * Driven by a single spec hashref. A single static method turns the
    hashref into an RPM.

    Among other things, this means you can trivially use a JSON spec.
    (See JSON::DWIW)

    * Lets you specify empty directories to create at RPM install time.

    * Lets you specify the permissions, owner and group of each file
    and directory in the spec hashref.

    * Lets you specify dependencies and pre/post install scripts.

    * Fails on errors.

    As far as I can see, shoehorning the missing bits into any of the
    existing modules would be quite awkward. The API would have to
    change.

The resulting entry would be:

RPM::Make::
::DWIW            adpfp Create RPM from a specification hashref.     ABLUM
