I'm still catching up, sorry for the long silence on this thread.

The form for namespace submission makes that clear to the user from
the beginning. It reads:

    Name of the module

    Please try to suggest a nested namespace that are based on an
    existing root namespace. New entries to the root namespace are
    less likely to be approved.

and goes on further down:

    Rationale

    Please discuss your reasoning about the namespace choice, the
    uniqueness of your approach and why you believe this module should
    be listed in the module list. Especially if you suggest a new
    rootlevel namespace you are required to argue why this new
    namespace is necessary.

I expected the extra work would come when somebody answers them after
the submission that the name is inappropriate. Currently answering is
the only way to veto a namespace. Any admin can approve by clicking,
nobody can disapprove without voicing an opinion. That seems
reasonable to me.

Can you suggest a different procedure?
