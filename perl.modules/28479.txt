Request to register new user

fullname: David Ljung Madison
  userid: ZZZZZZZZZ
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://MarginalHacks.com/
     why:

    I've already sent this and received a "Welcome new user DAVEOLA"
    message that claimed:

    > Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see
    the > separate mail you should receive about right now)..

    But I still haven't received the email.

    I tried "Forgot my password" but that didn't work either.

    Can someone resend the password approval email?
