The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Planner
  DSLIP:       cdpOa
  description: A Planner Perl Interface.
  userid:      WVARGAS (Walter Vargas)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    Mailinglist, SVN repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    To manipulate Archives Planner[1], transform a file.planner to
    tables in latex and tickets in Request Tracker and TRAC.

    In the necessity to handle projects with free software tools, the
    tasks of these projects are loaded and handle in a Planner[1], but
    after to load them in planner, is necessary to turn these tasks into
    ticket of some motor to manage projects, like Request Tracker or
    Trac, and soon to generate reports of these tasks and project in
    something like LaTeX.

    At the moment a NAMESPACE in CPAN for Planner does not exist, I
    assume the commitment, to maintain the code free of bugs in this
    namespace.

    Thanks.
