The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weather::YR
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Lookup weather forecast from api.yr.no
  userid:      HOVENKO (Knut-Olav Hoven)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Weather::Com Weather::Google Weather::Underground

  rationale:

    Weather::YR can fetch and process weather forecast information from
    api.yr.no.

    Weather is a shared namespace between other packages, such as
    Google and weather.com. I guess Weather::YR fits in there with the
    others.

    YR.no supplies weather data from the entire world.

  enteredby:   HOVENKO (Knut-Olav Hoven)
  enteredon:   Sat May 24 14:51:48 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Weather::
::YR              RdpOg Lookup weather forecast from api.yr.no       HOVENKO
