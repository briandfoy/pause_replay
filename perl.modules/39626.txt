I suppose it could be.  In UML terms the module could be seen as an
'Actor' interacting with the system under test.  However, 'Actor'
comes from the name of an open-source Java framework called 'exactor' which
inspired the module.  In the case of 'exactor' I think the name was
chosen for it's coolness and its similarity to the name of company
that released it.  Similar projects that are ports of, or
inspired by, test frameworks on other platforms are:

Test::Unit      from jUnit (xUnit)
Test::Class     from jUnit (xUnit)
Test::FIT       from FIT

I've actually already uploaded the module under the name PerlActor,
but it was suggested to me that Test::Actor might be a better name and
would facilitate those searching for it. It's certainly better than
trying to create a top level namespace for it.

Thanks,

Regards,

Tony.
