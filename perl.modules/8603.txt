Hi,

Could I get an author ID for the following please?

Name:     Wei L Tan
Email:    wil@dready.org
Homepage: http://www.dready.org
AuthorID: DREADY

I have yet another Text template system called PEE (Perl Embedding Engine 
- http://pee.sourceforge.net). It has been released for more than a year 
now, but haven't bothered to get it uploaded to CPAN. I would like to do 
so now. It is quite similar to ePerl (sorry for re-inventing the wheel, 
and don't ask me why).
The module namespace is Pee::* but I think it would probably fit well into 
the HTML/ directory along with Mason and EmbPerl etc., is that allowed?

Thanks.

wil.
