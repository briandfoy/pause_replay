Hi.

I have noticed this module (Array::substr) is listed with a DSLI code of
"idp ". I would like to help implement this module. There is a reference to
LWALL as author in the info column. When I click on the reference, CPAN
tells me the id 'LWALL' is not found.

What is the status of this module? Where can I get more information on it?

Thanks in advance for your help.

I look forward to helping on this and other modules.
