Subject: Module submission Object::Trampoline
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Object::Trampoline
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Delay object construction
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The original name for this was "Devel::Trampoline", it was
    suggested that "Object::Trampoline" would be a better name for it.
    So, at this point I need the new name and to drop
    "Devel::Trampoline". Reason for the change is that this is still a
    trampoline but "Object::" is a better description of what it
    is/does.

  enteredby:   LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  enteredon:   Mon Oct 24 17:28:30 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Object::
::Trampoline      bdpOp Delay object construction                    LEMBARK
