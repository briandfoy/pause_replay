Subject: Notification from PAUSE
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: "Eryq" <eryq@zeegee.com>
From: "Perl Authors Upload Server" <upload@pause.perl.org>

ERYQ (Eryq) visited the PAUSE and requested an upload into his/her
directory. The request used the following parameters:

 pause99_add_uri_uri        [http://www.zeegee.com/code/perl/MIME-tools/download/MIME-tools-6.200_02.tar.gz]
 SUBMIT_pause99_add_uri_uri [ Upload this URL ]

The request is now entered into the database where the PAUSE daemon will
pick it up as soon as possible (usually 1-2 minutes).

During upload you can watch the logfile in
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=tail_logfile&pause99_tail_logfile_n=6000.

You'll be notified as soon as the upload has succeeded, and if the
uploaded package contains modules, you'll get another notification from
the indexer a little later (usually after 1/2 hour).


Thanks for your contribution,
