Subject: Module submission Device::AlphaLED

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::AlphaLED
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Control Adaptive LED signs such as BetaBrite
  userid:      GORK (John Laur)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://wls.wwco.com/ledsigns/

  similar:
    ProLite

  rationale:

    This module is an interface to the Adaptive Technology LED signs
    and messageboards including the BetaBrite sign which is commonly
    available and in widespread use.

    It implements Adaptive's sign protocol fully, and it can
    communicate with single signs over RS-232 or sign networks connected
    via RS-485. Win32 is supported as well as Unix/Linux TTY serial
    ports.

    The module includes a number of other convenience features for
    programming signs including a simple markup language suited to the
    signs' capabilities, bitmap constructors, and other interesting and
    useless features such as 90-degree rotated text.

    The module is finished, mature, and well tested for several years;
    however, it has not ever been prepared for upload to CPAN. Althoug
    the ProLite module for other brand signs is in the root namespace, I
    chose the Device:: namespace because it seemed more appropriate than
    cluttering root. Mabye ProLite should move at some point?

    Thanks for your consideration.
