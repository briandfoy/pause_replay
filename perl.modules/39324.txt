1. what new name i can choose for this module? i think about Stream::Parser
or,
maybe, Stream::Tokenizer.
reason: after adding optionaly regexp matching and little more statistics,
this
module will be correspond completely even to the most exotic requirements
concerning directly stream parsings (imho)

2. will be new interface. some more simple, but will not losing
functionality. i want to ask: is here somewhere place, where i can put
different variants and people will choose the best?

ps: Please, i need the answers on this two questions
