The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Error::Filtered
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: Exception handling in an OO-ish way
  userid:      NILSONSFJ (Nilson Santos F. Jr.)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:
    Error

  rationale:

    This module implements functionality very similiar to Error.pm (in
    fact, it's almost a drop-in replacement). The main difference is
    that it's a source filter module.

    Its main goal is to implement the same error handling interface as
    Error.pm (since it's the best i've seen in perl) without its
    inherent problems due to memory leaks and implicit anonymous
    subroutines through prototypes.

    PS: This is a repost of Error::Filter, using another name, since it
    was judged as a misleading name. Please, if Error::Filtered also
    seems misleading (or just plain ugly), I urge you to suggest a
    better name.

The resulting entry would be:

Error::
::Filtered        adpnp Exception handling in an OO-ish way          NILSONSFJ
