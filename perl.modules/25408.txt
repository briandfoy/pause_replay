I'm trying to write a new module called 'Oyster' but when iu try t run this
code:

#!C:\perl
 use Oyster;

 $oyster=new Oyster;
 $oyster->writeln("Hello, world");
 $oyster->write("Hello world!");
 $num=$oyster->round("55.21","22","1","0");
 $oyster->wrtieln();
 $oyster->writeln("$num");

It comes up with an error that says:
Can't locate object method "new" via package "Oyster" at C:\oyster.pl line
4.

The module is in C:\perl\lib\ so the cause of not being in the right
directory is ruled out, whats my problem and what do I need to do?

Please help me, I am a begginer to writing modules.

Charlie
