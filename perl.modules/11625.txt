Subject: appropriate place for curried function attribute

From: educated_foo@yahoo.com (Sean O'Rourke)

I recently wrote a small module to implement curried functions as an
attribute.  I was thinking of putting it on CPAN as
Attribute::Curried.  To those with more CPAN experience than myself,
does this (a) seem worth submitting, and (b) seem like the right
place to put it?  Thanks,

Sean
(cpan id = SEANO, btw)
