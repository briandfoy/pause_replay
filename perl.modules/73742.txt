From: david.megginson@megginson.com (David Megginson)

I have an old CPAN account from the 1990s under the name "dmegg".
Unfortunately, I no longer have access to whatever email account I
associated with that (possibly one in the uottawa.ca domain), so I
cannot use the automated password recovery.

I would like to transfer the SGMLSpm module to Andrew Bailey (RAAB),
who is interested in actively maintaining it.  I would appreciate any
help, either getting me access to the account (so that I can do the
transfer), or transferring ownership of the module directly.


Thanks in advance for any help,


David Megginson
