Very interesting idea! Sorta like sleep on steroids. Will you have an
alarm() like feature too?

I'm not sure BackOff is the best name, but I can't think of others at
the moment. I don't think it will conflict with anything, although
people might not know what it is right off the bat.

I'd call the whole thing BackOff (you only need to register the main
name) unless someone comes up with a better name.

Instead of 

    sleep $obj->delay(); # returns 0 if nothing to do

how about just

   $obj->sleep;

The delay() still returns a number, but you roll up the whole operation
in a single method call.
