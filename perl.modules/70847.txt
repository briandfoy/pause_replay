He needs to log in to PAUSE, go to "Change Permissions" in the menu, 
select the namespace "MQSeries::Command" in one of the list boxes, 
(Here: "2. You are primary maintainer"), press the "Select" button next 
to "2.1 Pass primary maintainership status to somebody else (giving it 
up at the same time)", type the PAUSE/CPAN ID of the new owner in the 
text field, click "pass maintainership status".

Let us know if there are any problems.

Cheers,
Steffen
