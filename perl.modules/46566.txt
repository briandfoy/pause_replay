	Gah, looks like it!! I asked cpan-discuss if there was some way to
do this before I got started, but nobody mentioned "Test::Prereq"... I was
told about "Module::Depends" with the caveat that it only did about 25% of
what I wanted.

	Actually, I just looked over Test::Prereq, and it does look like we
are doing different things (albeit to check a similar result). The primary
motivation behind Test::CPAN is to test distributions where the Makefile.PL
(or Build.PL) itself depends on a package being installed; it provides tests
to make sure that you get the list of prerequisites you expected, whether or
not a package is actually installed. It fakes a module not being installed
by adding a directory to @INC that contains versions of these modules that
return false on "require" to ensure that the code paths for "module use
succeeded" and "module use failed" are both taken care of. It also injects
itself directly into CPAN.pm instead of overriding WriteMakefile or
create_build_script.

	So I think there's good reason for both pieces of functionality, but
maybe not neccessarily in two separate modules... we could converge if you'd
like.

	Cheers,
		Tyler
