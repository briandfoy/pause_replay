Hi.

I've been working on IPC::Editor (available at 
http://www.etla.org/misc/IPC-Editor-0.01_05.tar.gz).

It's a module to encapsulate the small but repetitive task of starting
a text editor on a hunk of text, and then getting the results back into
your program.

Is IPC::Editor a good name, or should I change it to something else?
(I also toyed with Text::Editor, or some variant on this, but it isn't
a text editor)

Michael
