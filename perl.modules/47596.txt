The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::HTML::W3C
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: W3C HTML validation testing module
  userid:      VICTORF (Victor)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::HTML::Tidy

  rationale:

    There doesn't seem to be a module that has this kind of
    functionality right now and there is already a Test::HTML::Tidy
    module. Test::HTML::W3C would seem to best fit the naming convention
    of these types of testing modules.

  enteredby:   VICTORF (Victor)
  enteredon:   Mon Feb 27 23:03:24 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::HTML::
::W3C             bdpfp W3C HTML validation testing module           VICTORF
