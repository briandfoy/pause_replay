The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Exception
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Functions for testing exception-based code
  userid:      ADIE (Adrian Howard)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    An extension to the Test::Builder family of testing modules
    (currently Test::Simple, Test::More and Test::Differences) to enable
    easier testing of code that throws exceptions.

    Test::Exception supplies a few functions that make the testing of
    exception conditions explicit, and provides more intelligent
    diagnostic messages on failure. Works with the other Test::Builder
    based modules.

  enteredby:   ADIE (Adrian Howard)

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Exception       Rdpfp Functions for testing exception-based code   ADIE
