Ouch. So it seems. It seems you're right. I believe both Tim and I
have been following this thread on modules@perl.org with too little
attention. Sorry for that.

It's documented how it works, please read CPAN/modules/04pause.html
and the archives at http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/

Yes, that is unfortunate, but on the other hand there were times when
it worked good and times when it didn't work at all. My excuse is that
I have started rewriting PAUSE from scratch knowing about the
shortcomings and I believe with the new engine we have a chance to
dedicate more time to true namespace monitoring. As things are right
now, I'll be done with the PAUSE relaunch by the ned of the year. Stay
tuned.

The archives are open to everybody, the mailing list isn't. We want to
have a closed list to do our work, because we believe we do not need
yet another mailing list but we need a working environment but we want
to have an open archive about what we are doing. Some people like to
read the mailing list archives and chime in at random points in time.
Should we discourage that?

Good point.
