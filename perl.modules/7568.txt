Hm, this is weird.

A while back I transfered IO::Tty IO::Pty and IO::Tty::Constant
to Roland. And they do not show up in my list anymore. But they
are not in Rolands list either.

Looking in the database dump I see that the perms table still lists
GBARR for the two IO::Tty modules but it now has PEASE listes for
IO::Pty. But PEASE has nothing uploaded to CPAN with that name

Andreas, I don't know if I have access to chnage this table
via the UI in anyway. Can you change the perms for these three modules
to be RGIERSIG

Thanks,
Graham.
