This isn't something special to CGI necessarily.  Other
thing might like to use this useful module.

I'd flip around the name to allow for profiles of
other types of browsers.  I'd choose something other
than UA for the name to make it clear what you are
doing. Maybe something like:

   WWW:AgentProfile::Mobile

Then you could add other classes of profiles too.
