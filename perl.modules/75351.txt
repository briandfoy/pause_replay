Subject: Module submission WWW::Selenium::NetworkCapture
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Selenium::NetworkCapture
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Parse net traffic data from Selenium/Firefox
  userid:      JHERM (Jon Hermansen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.beginners/

  similar:
    WebInject

  rationale:

    WWW::Selenium::NetworkCapture is an OO-interface that mainly
    implements getting statistics from the raw XML network traffic
    capture data that can be passed back from Selenium/Firefox. I
    believe that this package name is rational because it describes the
    object we're dealing with -- a "network capture."

    WWW::Selenium is a namespace that already exists, and currently
    does not implement this functionality. I'd just be adding onto it.

    My approach is not unique, but no one (as far as I can see) has
    implemented this in pure-Perl. The code is essentially a port of
    some Python code, located here:

    http://code.google.com/p/selenium-profiler/source/browse/trunk/we\
    b_profiler.py

    I will be happy to support my module through RT, on the
    perl-beginners mailing list (or I can start a mailing list for this
    module) and by personal e-mail.

    If anything needs clarification or elaboration, please let me know
    and I will be happy to provide additional details.

    Thank you for your time and efforts!
