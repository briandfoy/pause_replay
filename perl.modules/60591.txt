[meta: This arose from a discussion on the ActiveState perl mailing list]

I have some modules (Time::Format, Regexp::Common::time, Time::Normalize)
that need to know the month and weekday names, and their abbreviations, in
the user's current locale.  Those modules currently get this information
from I18N::Langinfo (and fall back on English names/abbreviations).

Since I18N::Langinfo is not reliably available, I would like to provide a
way for the user to explicitly specify the month/weekday names/abbreviations
that they would like to use.  My first thought was to provide a set of
functions in each module: set_month_names(), set_weekday_names(), etc.
But... why should the user have to set the names once for each module?  They
should be able to do it once and be done.

So I am considering having a new central module whose only purpose in life
is to wrap I18N::Langinfo and allow the user to specify month and weekday
names and abbreviations (or override them if the module exists and works but
the caller wants a different set of names for some reason).  And it should
probably allow the user to specify the other strings that I18N::Langinfo
provides.

I'm posting this here to stimulate discussion about the merits of this
idea.  Is it good?  Is it awful?  Does this sort of thing exist already?

Should it be incorporated into I18N::Langinfo?  I suspect that is a bad
idea.  If it should be a new module, should it be under I18N? Maybe
I18N::Langinfo::Fake?  I18N::Langinfo::Override?  Should it be under
Locale:: or even Lingua::?

Thanks in advance,
Eric Roode
