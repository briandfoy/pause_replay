Auctionbrokers Australia is by far the largest seller on eBay
Australia. As you would have seen, we usually have several 100 auction
listings LIVE at any one time. Running these auctions is very
demanding and a resource hungry process. We run the full eBay process
with a very small team. Because of our low overheads, we can offer you
these $1 NO RESERVE bargains on eBay every day.

Thanks for bidding on our auctions. Remember to bookmark
www.auctionbrokers.com.au and keep checking our site for great new $1
No Reserve product offerings. We get new stock everyday so you never
know what great deals you will find!

Please note that we are closed over the Easter holidays. We will endeavour to answer all emails on Tuesday April 13 and Wednesday April 14.

Thank you for your patience and We hope you have a safe Easter.

Kind regards,

Auctionbrokers Customer Service
