The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Pastor
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generate classes/round-trip XML persistence
  userid:      AULUSOY (Ayhan Ulusoy)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    In a nut-shell, this module generates (before compile time, or at
    run time) Perl classes that can do round-trip with XML persistency
    all this made possible by the existence of a W3C XSD Schema.

    Basically, the module is very close to what CASTOR does in the java
    world, that is, it reads a set of W3C XSD schemas and generates Perl
    classes from the type definitions (simple or complex) in the schema.
    The classes that are produced can be used as regular Perl classes
    with automatically generated accessors for attributes and child
    elements. They also 'know'how to convert themselves into XML DOM
    elements and attributes. This way it's possible to read an XML file
    into DOM, convert it into a schema-aware perl class (Pastor
    generated), read or modify data in it, and write it back to XML DOM.

    I am proposing the name XML::Pastor for this new module. This
    sounds like the Castor java equivalent a little bit. I know we
    should stay away fromp cutesy names but in this case something like
    XML::Class::Generator would be too cumbersome and would not convey
    the full functionality anyway.

The resulting entry would be:
