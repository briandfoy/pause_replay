The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chart::EPSgraph
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Generate EPS and PNG graphs
  userid:      APLONIS (Ĝan Ŭesli Starling)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    GD::Graph

  rationale:

    This is to be my first CPAN module. I think I'm asking for the
    right thing.

    I read in the docs that Larry says a module does not have to
    inherit from above. My EPSgraph.pm will not inherit from CHART:: but
    it should be comfortable hanging out with the other offerings
    domeciled there.

    My module (heretofore privately named GUS::PSGraph.pm) I am
    proposing to upload as CHART::EPSgraph. That is to say I think my
    module would be best re-named EPSgraph.pm and housed under the
    CHART::* heirarchy.

    It seemed to me that all the Graph::* modules were by the same
    author and inter-related whereas many a Chart::* module were
    standalone. My own module is standalone.

    My module writes very pretty XY and XYY graphs from data, and does
    a prettier job of XYY (currrently, anyway) than does GD::Graph
    (which often mangles the Y2 tickmarks).

    My module is really just a re-work of a PostScript program I wrote
    back in 1992. When I couldn't get GD::Graph to do XYY graphs how I
    liked, I dragged out my old PostScript program, hacked it appart,
    and married the pieces to Perl. Perl is the interface and the EPS
    bits are stored in strings. Perl pieces an EPS together out of these
    strings and embeding the data directly into the EPS.

    In addition I put in a method which interfaces with Ghostscript
    and/or GV to display the resulting EPS graph and to even export a
    newly written EPS file to PNG (via Ghostscript).

    I have tested it several different ways on both NetBSD and WinXP.

The resulting entry would be:

Chart::
::EPSgraph        RdpOp Generate EPS and PNG graphs                  APLONIS
