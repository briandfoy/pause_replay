Subject: Module submission Bloom::Filter

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bloom::Filter
  DSLIP:       bmpOg
  description: Pure Perl Bloom filter implementation
  userid:      MCEGLOWS (Maciej Ceglowski)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    forthcoming perl.com article, http://loaf.cantbedone.org

  similar:
    Bloom16 Text::Bloom

  rationale:

    Sorry to resubmit request so soon, but a Perl.com article is coming
    out and I would like to have the namespace registered before
    publication.

    A Bloom filter is a cool form of compact storage when testing for
    the presence of keys in a very large set (for instance, a spell
    checker). There are currently two CPAN modules that implement parts
    of the Bloom algorithm - Text::Bloom and Bloom16 - but both are
    somewhat limited. Text::Bloom is geared exclusively at text
    collections, and has its own collection+weighting model built in as
    a result, this makes it less than ideal for other uses (spam
    whitelists, for example). Bloom16 is implemented in XS and has a
    hard-coded four-bit window size, this makes it much less useful to
    people who need a vanilla, one-bit Bloom filter for compactness, or
    work in a compiler-free environment. The aim of this module is to
    provide a configurable Bloom filter implemented using Perl's own
    pack, vec and bitwise operators. The module is abstracted from the
    innards of the LOAF project for a social network extension to email
    (http://loaf.cantbedone.org). If the Bloom root level namespace is
    undesirable, I can suggest Algorithm::Bloom::Filter, but I would
    point out that Bloom16 has already blazed the namespace trail ;-)
