Subject: Module submission HTML::ExtractLinks

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::ExtractLinks
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Extract links from an HTML document
  userid:      WRW (William R Ward)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org mailing list

  similar:
    HTML::LinkExtor and HTML::SimpleLinkExtor can do the same thing, but
    carry with them the overhead of the HTML::Parser engine

  rationale:

    This is a simple, lightweight, regexp-based way of extracting the
    links from an HTML document, without incurring the overhead of
    loading the HTML::Parser or a similar system for processing the
    entire document. This works with the LWP modules to quickly find all
    the links on a particular page, for example if you want to download
    a document and all of the documents it links to.

    Support is also included for filtering the links extracted by a
    regular expression on either the URL of the link or the contents of
    the <A> tag

  enteredby:   WRW (William R Ward)

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::ExtractLinks    adpfp Extract links from an HTML document          WRW
