The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::FTDI::FTD2XX
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: Native FTDI D2XX USB driver interface
  userid:      SKMACPHE (Scott K MacPherson)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    The Win32::FTDI::xxx module(s) extend the existing Win32 root
    namepsace, adding an FTDI sub-name, and modules for interfacing with
    FTDI USB devices & drivers.

    FTDI (http://ftdichip.com) is a major USB chipset manufacturer, and
    interfacing Win32 Perl with them via Virtual Comm Ports with older
    interfaces like Win32::CommPort and Win32::Serial are hugely
    problematic. As many of the FTDI interfaces are used by
    microcontroller hobbyists like myself, I searched everywhere for an
    interface that would work with my Active-State Perl5.8.8, and found
    none, and many others in the same predicament. So a native driver
    solution was sorely needed.

    I've writen the first module, FTD2XX, which is a Perl5 object
    oriented interface to the FTDI CDM/D2XX direct USB driver API,
    allowing perl to communicate with that range of devices over the USB
    via native I/O and not COM. By creating the FTDI sub-name, future
    FTDI driver interfaces and device specific modules may expand the
    tree.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::FTDI::
::FTD2XX          bdhOp Native FTDI D2XX USB driver interface        SKMACPHE
