Dr.BOTHA KEFU( B.Sc.,M.Sc. MNIM.)
Director, Project Implementation
E-mail:bkefu@netscape.net
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT

I am Dr.Botha Kefu a native of Cape Town in South Africa and the director of =
project implementation with the South Africa Department of Minerals & Natural =
Resources.First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for =
a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality =
and prompt access reposed on this medium. I 
have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of =
the deal described Hereunder for the  benefit of all parties  and hope you =
will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals & Natural Resources where I work as a =
Director and with the cooperation of four other top officials,we have in our =
possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eight Million, Five hundred =
Thousand US. Dollars (US$8.500.000.) which we want to transfer abroad with =
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the =
said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive =
such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South =
Africa Civil Service 
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your =
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $8.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed =
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the =
officials over-invoiced deliberately.

Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original =
contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have =
in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer =
(K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an 
application through the Ministry of Justice here in South Africa for the =
transfer of  rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be =
willing to assist us in this transaction, your share of the sum will be =
discussed. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat =
it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful =
execution of this transaction. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my =
confidential email address above to confirm whether or not you are interested =
in this deal. If you are not,it will enable me scout for another foreign =
partner to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that my partners and =
myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided =
you can give us a very 
strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please, =
remember to treat this matter very confidential  because we will not =
comprehend with any form of exposure 
as we are still in active Government Service .Once again, remember that time =
is of great essence in this transaction.

Positive response should be accompanied with your telephone and fax number so =
that i can reach you immediately with more informations.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
BOTHA KEFU.
