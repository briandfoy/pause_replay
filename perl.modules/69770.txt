The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LinkedList::Single
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Fast, compact OO singly-linked list manager
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    I cannot find a low-level linked list mangler on CPAN.

  rationale:

    Linked lists are useful in Perl for comparing multiple lists(in my
    case long lists of geometry generated from DNA sequences).
    Singly-linked list are fairly compact and easy to manage -- this one
    even works around a memory management bug in 5.10. The top-level
    "LinkedList" also seems an obvious place for "Double" and "Circular"
    if anyone ever wants to write them.

    List::Linked would be another option, depends on whether you think
    this conflicts with the existing "List::oo" or its better to have a
    single namespace list manglement of all types.

  enteredby:   LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 10 00:10:25 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

LinkedList::
::Single          bdpOp Fast, compact OO singly-linked list manager  LEMBARK
