As per <http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#registering>:

  reichert@numachi.com

* your homepage if you have one

  none

* your preferred user-ID on CPAN

  REICHERT

* a description of what you're planning to contribute

  I have cobbled together a perl module to act, in effect, as a
  varient of 'system', with the added feature of being able to get
  to both the STDOUT and STDERR of a child process.

* for modules a description in module list format
* for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send...
* where you have discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly

  Other than a message posted to modules@perl.org on Fri, 20 Oct
  2000 15:52:54 -0400, in an effort to resolve potential namespace
  issues, I have no discussed this module on a public mailing list.
