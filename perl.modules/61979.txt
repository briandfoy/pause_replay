The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RDR::Collector
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Reception and decoding of RDR packets
  userid:      SHAMROCK (Andrew S. Kennedy)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    RDR is a packet format containing specific information relating to
    user and network usage.

    It was originally designed by PCube ( now Cisco ) and offers a rich
    environment for collecting statistics and event triggers.

    More details can be found

    http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/cable/serv_exch/serv_control/broadband_app/rel316/scabbrg/scabbrg.html

    If any other suggestions can be made for a namespace happy to take
    them on board but could not think of anything appropriate.

    Net did not seem the correct place, however it may fall under say
    'Statistics' thus the module would be Statistics::RDR::Collector but
    statistics again does not seem the most appropriate place.

    I can not find anything in CPAN relating to this but if there is
    something please let me know.

    Andrew.
