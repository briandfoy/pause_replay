The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::TimeSeries
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: TimeSeries functions and objects
  userid:      TOMMIE (Tommie M. Jones)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    cpan

  similar:

  rationale:

    Working with Time series is a common practice in business
    intelligence. An object was needed to provide common functionality
    for time series. This includes stretching, shrinking, normalizing,
    synchronizing two series, deseasonalizing and clipping. Future
    functionality might include correlation, regression and many others.

    Also the timeseries object provides a pack function so it could be
    stored in a text field in a database.

  enteredby:   TOMMIE (Tommie M. Jones)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun  9 13:35:43 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::TimeSeries      RdpOg TimeSeries functions and objects             TOMMIE
