You are getting this error because 0.01 is larger than 0.0.1 (which can 
also be written as 0.000001). This is not related to the fact that your 
version numbers are out of sync with the distribution version. Whether 
you like or dislike that depends on how you develop the module.

Now in general, if there is not a very, very good reason to use three 
part version numbers, I would suggest you stick with the ordinary X.XXX 
scheme.

In order to fix your problem, you need to upload a distribution 
containing a higher version of the module in question. You already 
uploaded the module with version 0.01. That  means the version has to be 
at least 0.10.1 (0.010001) or 0.011 or better yet, 0.02.
