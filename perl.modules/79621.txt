Subject: Offer - Co-Maint on Bit::Vector - RT 71052

Steven,

For the past couple of years, I've helped authors who are overly busy
release patches which help keep their modules working against the most
recent perl. If you give me co-maint access to Bit-Vector, I offer to
do a 7.2 release for it to fix the most recently reported problem
against the coming perl 5.16

You can do this by going to this url and granting TODDR Co-Maint
access to Bit::Vector, Bit::Vector::Overload, and Bit::Vector::String

Thanks,
