I download Apache::RedirectDBI and modified it in order to get the
functionallity I needed.
I kept the orginal functionality.  Subsequently, I emailed the authers, who
stated that I could take over the updates to the module.   The following is an
email exchange:
=============================
Hi George,
Thanks for getting in touch again.
Apache::RedirectDBI provided something that was needed at the time, but for 
which I have no future need, so I'd be very happy to tranfer CPAN ownership 
to you - not sure exactly how that works, but I'll do what I need to do to 
make it happen.
I'm happy for you to handle any announcements (and anything else) in the way 
you see fit.
Hope this all sounds OK.
Michael

Subject: Apache::RedirectDBI mod

I needed something close to what Apache::RedirectDBI provided.
I modified version 0.01 to allow it to get the URI from a DB field and then 
also to be able to do an external REDIRECT.
The original functionality of the module was maintained.
I think others would benefit from the new capabilities.
I am willing to take over the module if you are willing to work with me to 
do the CPAN transfer.
Please, let me know and I will pursue the CPAN update. Let me know up 
front, how you want me to handle any anouncements or what ever wishes or 
objections that you may have.

How do we go about shifting the ownership of the module to myself?
