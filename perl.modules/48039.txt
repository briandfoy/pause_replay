Hi brian

Unfortunately, there is no formal specification of the CSV format.

When you save a CSV file in OpenOffice Calc, you are given the option to
select a comma, a semicolon, a colon, a tab, or a blank space as the
separator character.

In a Windows system, when you save a spreadsheet in Excel as a CSV file,
Excel will use as the separator character the default list separator for the
locale. So, if you are running a Spanish Windows with the Spanish (Spain)
locale set, you will get a semicolon as the separator.

That's why all the parsers available give the user the option to specify the
field separator.

I think that the problem is the name of the format. Perhaps it would be
better to name it "Character Separated Values"; this way you can keep using
the same abbreviation.

Best regards,
Enrique
