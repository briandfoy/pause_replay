Greetings:

Go ahead and purge Widget::FixedWidthFont::Input from PAUSE.  I had intended
to break out some generic code out of some old Curses::Widgets stuff since I
thought it would have some appeal outside of that.  Given that the
Widget::* namespace only has two modules altogether, I almost have to
question why it exists at all.  I'll just keep that code in-line with the
Curses stuff, and be done with it.

Subject: Old CPAN namespace registration for Widget::FixedWidthFont::Input

Dear CPAN contributor,

we, the PAUSE administrators, are trying to tidy up the CPAN Modules
List and are looking at namespaces that have been registered without
ever being uploaded to PAUSE.

You have registered the namespace

Widget::FixedWidthFont::Input

in the CPAN Modules List, but according to our databases, you have not
uploaded any module with that name. This may be an error on our part,
a problem with the PAUSE indexer, or you actually haven't uploaded an
implementation.

In any case, we kindly ask you to contact us via the modules@perl.org
mailing list so we can sort out the issue. This is particularly
important if you think you are receiving this mail in error!

A simple message telling us briefly why you want to keep the
registration even without an upload so far should suffice to get the
namespace off our to-do list.

We plan to purge the registration for the aforementioned module
from our database somewhen after December 17, 2007 if we do not receive an
answer until then.

Thank you for contributing to CPAN and your help in advance.

Best regards,
Steffen Mueller
for the PAUSE administrators
