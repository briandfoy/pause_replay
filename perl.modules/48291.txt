Is this implemented using on of those other modules?

If so, perhaps something like Text::CSV::Filter would be more appropriate?

Snail:: has no specific meaning, and it is general better to keep 
component names to descriptive ones that look familiar to people, rather 
than use brand names, except for large API frameworks in a crowded area 
like DBI wrappers, or web things.
