The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Shaper
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple Multiplexing TCP Traffic Shaper
  userid:      BHOLZMAN (Benjamin Holzman)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    When testing a networked application, it is often desirous to limit
    the bandwidth of network connections. This can be used to uncover
    race conditions and to simulate real-world behavior. This module
    implements a multiplexing tcp traffic shaper that accomplishes this.
    Perhaps a better name would be Net::Shaper, but it's built on the
    IO:: modules.

  enteredby:   BHOLZMAN (Benjamin Holzman)
  enteredon:   Thu Nov  6 07:43:16 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::Shaper          adpOp Simple Multiplexing TCP Traffic Shaper       BHOLZMAN
