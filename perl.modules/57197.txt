Greetings all,

For over a decade, I have enjoyed programming in Perl, and greatly
appreciate the efforts of the Perl community in keeping CPAN and the
infrastructure functional.
I am preparing to contribute a new module to CPAN.

The module subclasses Graph::Undirected and adds methods relevant to testing
undirected graphs for Hamiltonicity.
i.e., whether the graph contains a Hamiltonian Cycle or not.

I would appreciate some advice, as this is my first CPAN contribution.

Q1. Which namespace is appropriate?
Examples:
Graph::Undirected::Hamilton
Graph::Undirected::Hamiltonicity
Graph::Undirected::HamiltonianCycle


Q2. Is inheritance the right thing to do, or should I prefer composition?
I only plan to add methods to those of Graph::Undirected, and never override
any.


Q3. My ambitious goal is to formalize this working code into a "P=NP" proof.
I like the idea of publicly collaborating on this effort, but not the idea
of "someone else" collecting the million dollars by building upon my work.
Any thoughts? :-)

Thanks,

- Ashwin.
