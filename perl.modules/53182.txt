The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Any
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Support several config file formats
  userid:      RATAXIS (Joel Bernstein)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    Catalyst and Catalyst-Dev mailing lists, #catalyst and #catalyst-dev
    on irc.perl.org, Catalyst SVN repository

  similar:
    Config::General, Config::Tiny, YAML, YAML::Syck, JSON, JSON::Syck,
    XML::Simple

  rationale:

    Config::Any provides a facility for Perl applications and libraries
    to load configuration data from multiple different file formats. It
    supports XML, YAML, JSON, Apache-style configuration, Windows INI
    files, and even Perl code.

    The rationale for this module is as follows: Perl programs are
    deployed on many different platforms and integrated with many
    different systems. Systems administrators and end users may prefer
    different configuration formats than the developers. The flexibility
    inherent in a multiple format configuration loader allows different
    users to make different choices, without generating extra work for
    the developers. As a developer you only need to learn a single
    interface to be able to use the power of different configuration
    formats.

The resulting entry would be:
