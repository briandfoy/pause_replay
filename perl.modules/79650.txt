Subject: Module submission Bio::KBase

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::KBase
  DSLIP:       adphd
  description: DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase interface
  userid:      RDO (Robert Olson)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    DOE KBase developer site (Trac + mailing lists)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Let me begin by noting that there will likely be several modules
    that are part of this namespace; it wasn't clear if I need to
    register the toplevel once or if each distributable module is
    registered separately.

    The DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (http://kbase.us) is a
    project that is building a stable infrastructure of systems biology
    databases and network APIs to access the databases and related
    computational infrastructure.

    These APIs will have client libraries in a variety of languages,
    including perl, and I would like to have stable namespace in CPAN to
    use for the distribution of both the client libraries and some of
    the perl-based tools used to manage them (in particular a
    strongly-typed IDL-style interface language and the compiler that
    generates the client and server APIs, based on JSONRPC).

    Thank you for your consideration, Bob Olson Argonne National
    Laboratory
