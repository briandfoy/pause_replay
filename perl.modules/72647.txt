Subject: Module submission Image::SubImageFind
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, ctrondlp@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::SubImageFind
  DSLIP:       adhfg
  description: Find sub-image file within larger image file
  userid:      CTRONDLP (Dennis K. Paulsen)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    chatrooms

  similar:
    N/A

  rationale:

    Module: Image::SubImageFind. This module relates to Image
    functionality, that is why 'Image' was chosen as parent namespace.
    In addition, its sole focus is Finding sub-images within another
    image; which is why 'SubImage' + 'Find' were selected as the name.
    This naming approach allows for additional "sub-image find"
    functions to be added.

    Thank you.
