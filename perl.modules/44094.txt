It would certainly be possible to add a corporate id as a co-maintainer 
for a module.

What does concern me about doing that is the potential for bad things in 
situations when people leave a company on not-so-great terms, or if a 
company folds or is bought out by a larger entity... then we have to 
change ids all over again.

I suspect these sorts of reasons are why we haven't historically done 
corporate author ids.

Companies are simply far more fluid than people.
