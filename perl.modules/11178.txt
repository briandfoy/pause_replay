A little perl XS module that provides access to the HP Openview Operations API 
function:  opcmsg().  It also provides an OO interface to sending Openview 
messages.  It requires that HP openview is installed.

Current working name: OVO::Message.  I am open to suggestions, as this would be 
a new namespace.  I did not find anything into which this seemed to fit.

Thanks,

Lincoln
