Well, I guess the question is really about the fact that because they as 
a group "own" the Apache:: and Apache2:: namespaces, do we just let them 
do their own thing? If they are already doing AuthFoo stuff already I'd 
prefer consistency over correctness anyway.

That said, I'd probably not want to approve an AthenFoo name, since it's 
two subnamespaces for the one thing.
