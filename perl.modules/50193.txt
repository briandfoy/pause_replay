The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Directory::Scratch
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: self-cleaning scratch space for tests
  userid:      JROCKWAY (Jonathan Rockway)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    http://www.jrock.us/trac/cpan_modules

  similar:
    File::Temp, but not quite as easy-to-use inside unit tests

  rationale:

    Directory::Scratch because it's a scratch directory. I guess this
    is the first Directory:: module, but I think other modules that
    manipulate directories would fit in here nicely. (That said, using
    the File:: namespace wouldn't make much sense, since the directory
    is what the module is about, not the contained files).

    This module is similar to File::Temp, in fact File::Temp is a
    prerequsite, but File::Directory provides some nice utility
    functions to make the whole experience nicer. I might not use it in
    a production application, but it's great for inside unit tests.
    Here's another discussion on this issue:

The resulting entry would be:

Directory::
