    I'm wanting to write a module similar to Mail::Audit with some
    different functionality.  As well as help out, as time allows, on other 
    CPAN modules and any other ideas I come up with along the way.

    I've discussed this at length with fellow programmers in person. 
    However, since I have not actually coded it up yet, no formal review
    has happened. 

    Honestly I my Mail idea would better be handled as an addition to
    Mail::Audit, however I have had no luck in contacting the
    maintainer via E-mail. 

    I have also been wanting to migrate some of my personal libraries
    into a CPAN style for use by other sysadmins and mod_perl
    developers.
