Request for Namespace for CPAN::Tester

Description:

  A module that makes executing common tasks and duties of a CPAN Tester
  easy, efficient, and seamless.

  This module is a subclass of the CPAN module, and provides its
  interface through the CPAN Testers shell. It will provide at a
  minimum the following functionality:

  + Auto-detection of the platforms testers.cpan.org macid.
  + Shell grading of distributions. This will either externally invoke
    cpantest or integrate cpantest's functionality internally, depending
    on dialouge with Kurt on this subject. Shell commands would be the
    following, which if called without an argument will act upon the
    last tested or installed distribution.
    - pass
    - fail
    - unknown
    - na
  + Additional shell commands:
    - recent -- lists all recently (one week) uploaded modules. Will
      also automatically mark which ones have been tested on
      your platform.
    - tested -- checks if (the latest version of) the argument has
      been tested on this platform.
    - grades -- lists other grades this distribution has received.
    - tests  -- either displays test.pl through the pager, or pops
      you into t/.

  Implementation details are in the alpha stage currently. Comments,
  and suggestions on this are most certainly welcome.

DSLI entry:

  CPAN::
  ::Tester bdpO A CPAN Shell for CPAN testers AFOXSON

Discussion:

  There exists a CPAN "helper shell" for CPAN Admins (CPAN::Admin)
  that implements administrator specific add-ons to the CPAN module.
  This module would strive to afford CPAN testers similar convieniences.

  I've had an e-mail exchange with Graham on this subject. He believes
  this would be very useful.

  As always, Thank you for your time and consideration.
