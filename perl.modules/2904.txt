Table          MdpO  Data type for spreadsheets/database tables   EZDB

The idea has been discussed and the package has been tested among some friends
of the authors. The authors have not found any package in CPAN provide similar
function or can be easily inherited to implement what Table.pm does. The
following is a breif preview of some features from Table.pm:

$header = ["name", "age"];
$data = [
           ["John", 20],
           ["Kate", 18],
           ["Mike", 23]
         ]
$t = new Table($data, $header, 0);
print $t->csv; # print out a CSV file.

$t = Table::fromSQL($dbh, "select * from employee");  # table from a DB query
$t->sort("age", 1, 0);   # sort by column 'age'.
print $t->html; # print the spread sheet in HTML table format

Other methods include:
addRow delRow addCol delCol subTable sort match_pattern colMerge rowMerge ...
