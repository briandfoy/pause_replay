Hello,
   I have a module which I would like to upload to
PAUSE (my id is RKOBES). The proposed name is Math::Cephes,
along with a couple of related modules Math::Cephes::Complex
and Math::Cephes::Fraction - I had earlier on c.l.p.modules
proposed Math::Functions, but it was suggested Math::Cephes
was better, which I agree. The DSLI info is
	D: a (alpha testing)
	S: d (developer)
	L: c (C and perl)
	I: h (object and function)
These modules provide an interface to (much of) the math cephes
C library of Stephen Moshier, particularly various functions
and utilities such as Bessel, statistical distributions, gamma, trig, 
hyperbolic, etc., as well as some support for handling
fractions and complex numbers. There are about 155
functions in all. It is in an alpha stage because at present 
I've only tested it on linux and Win32. Brief descriptions are

Math::Cephes - cephes math functions and utilities 
Math::Cephes::Complex - cephes complex number routines
Math::Cephes::Fraction - cephes fraction routines

I realize that there are modules with some overlap here -
Math::Pari, PDL, and Math::ematica for certain functions, 
and Math::Complex and Math::Fraction for complex numbers
and fractions - but this module is confined to providing 
an interface to various functions and utilities, and so
doesn't do symbolic/matrix calculations, but rather includes
a number of functions not available in any one of the 
other packages (except through Mathematica, but not everyone 
has this). It also provides a C interface to the complex number 
and fraction routines, which although in its present form is more
primitive than Math::Complex and Math::Fraction, might be 
faster, depending on the situation.

I have cleared with Stephen Moshier any copyright issues
regarding the library. Could you let me know if this
is OK? Thanks.

best regards,
Randy Kobes
