Hi Chris,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins.

I=E2=80=99m working on resolving situations where a CPAN distribution has=
 two or more people with indexing permissions, or where there are indexin=
g permission conflicts between two or more distributions. Your Smil distr=
ibution is one of these.

Most of the packages in the Smil distribution are in the SMIL:: namespace=
, which avoids conflict, but lib/Smil/QT.pm has name =22QT=22 rather than=
 SMIL::QT.

Previously you could have indexing permissions on =22QT=22 and author AWI=
N had permissions on =22Qt=22. But a few years back we changed PAUSE so t=
hat package names were treated case insensitively, and at that point you =
lost your indexing permission on =22QT=22. As a result the Smil distribut=
ion has split permissions.

There are at least three ways to resolve this:

1. You could do a new release of Smil with QT renamed to be SMIL::QT =E2=80=
=94 this would make the package name match the path (SMIL/QT.pm) and also=
 bring it inside the top-level namespace, which is a recommended practice=
 anyway, to avoid this sort of conflict.
2. If you=E2=80=99re not interested in this any more (it was released in =
2005, so I suspect that might be the case :-), then I could just delete i=
t from CPAN for you, which would also resolve the conflict.
3. If you=E2=80=99re not interested in it, but want it to remain on CPAN,=
 I can do a release which renames QT to be SMIL::QT and then delete the 0=
.898 files from your author directory. This way it would remain on CPAN =E2=
=80=94 though in a different account =E2=80=94 in case someone comes alon=
g and wants to adopt it.

Which way would you like to resolve this=3F

Cheers,
Neil
