That is still not a good idea.  As brian says, metainformation
like that should not encoded in the module name.  Also, it wouldn't
necessarily encode *enough* information, such as whether the author
has some recommendations to use instead of the deprecated one.

Why can't the Makefile.PL of a deprecated module simply be changed to
make the right discouragements, along with the documentation (=head1
DEPRECATED, maybe?)?
