The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ClearCase::Region
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A simple OO foundation for ClearCase
  userid:      LESPAUL (Leslie D. Paul)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Rational Users Conference 2003 (presentation in August)

  similar:
    ClearCase::CtCmd - not related or used by my module. This is a OO
    interface for Cleartool only.

  rationale:

    Many compancies spend thousands of dollars writing and maintaining
    Perl scripts that expand and enhance the core functionality of
    IBM/Rational's ClearCase system. However, these scripts are often
    not portable or reuseable between companies, platforms or even
    ClearCase regions.

    My ClearCase::Region module is an OO foundation on which one can
    build a reuseable Perl scripts. By creating a flexible abstract of
    fundamental ClearCase components - the Region and Vob, a reuseable
    OO foundation can be created for Perl scrits.

    My paper and modules have been reviewed by IBM/Rational. I will be
    a guest speaker at this year's Rational Users Conference -
    presenting this information.
