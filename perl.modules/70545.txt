Subject: Request for maintainership of Pod::WSDL

Hello,

I'd like to request to take over maintenance of the Pod::WSDL module by
Tarek Ahmed.  Pod::WSDL hasn't had any updates since October of 2006 and
Tarek's only other module on CPAN hasn't had any updates since July of 2008.

I've tried on a couple of occasions to contact Tarek and offer my
patches and continued assistance, but I've not gotten a response.  His
website only contains the same email address as listed on CPAN and he
doesn't appear to have a profile on perlmonks.org.  Googling for his
name turns up a couple of matches, but they do not appear to be the same
person.

The number of packages on CPAN which handle WSDL are relatively small,
and this one's approach to the problem of WSDL generation is unique.
The company I work for has several large projects which use SOAP
services, so WSDL generation is an important requirement.  Obviously, I
could fork the code and maintain our version on our internal CPAN
mirror, or upload it to CPAN as Pod::WSDL2, but neither seems like the
right thing to do...

Thanks for you time and consideration:
