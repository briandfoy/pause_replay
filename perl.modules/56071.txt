The main development branch is actively developed at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winguitest, please contact the developers 
there, so that we don't split branches.  Reading the yahoo group for this 
module (indicated in the documentation) would have directed you to 
sourceforge as well.

Thanks,
Dennis

>Hello,
>
>I would like to propose to take over Win32::GuiTest, because the author
>(CTRONDLP) doesn't seem to be responsive. There are some problems with both
>complication and installation of the module, and also the distribution 
>doesn't
>get recognized by CPAN::shell (because of _ in the archive name).
>
>If you agree, I plan to apply my patches and release as 1.60 (without 
>underscores),
>which would mean that default CPAN installations will use it (not 1.3) as 
>before.
>I realise this might be a bit drastic, but am actually at loss what to do 
>in this
>situation. Tell me what you think of it.
