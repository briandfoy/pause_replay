Subject: PAUSE ID [3rd request]
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: five@mailroom.com

It has been more than a month since I originally requested a 
PAUSE ID, but I haven't heard anything since the request for
clarification I replied to.

My preferred ID is 'FIVE'
My preferred list name is 'v'
Most of my work can be found at 
http://hermes.freehosting.net/
(Hermes: the first pure Perl email client)

Please let me know if I need to do anything else...

Thanks!
