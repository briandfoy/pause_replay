Hi Brian - 

Good point.  Music::DB can handle most types of audio content that can be
read by popular players like iTunes.  Such files will naturally need to have
their meta ID3 tags set.

This doesn't necessarily mean that the schema and reports will make sense
(ie the author for audio books may be in the "artist" table, and the book
title might fall in the album table).  Despite this minor incongruity, it
should work as expected.

Todd
