The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::GoogleWhack
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Finds, verifies, and/or submits GoogleWhacks
  userid:      AFOXSON (Adam J. Foxson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    #perl on EFnet

  similar:

  rationale:

    GoogleWhack is a game. The idea of the game is to generate a page
    on google that reports only one result by entering a query with two
    words (quotes may not surround the words). There are three rules:

    - Must generate one, and only one result on google, ie Results 1 -
    1 of 1 - Both words must exist in dictionary.com - The resulting
    page must not be a list of words

    For more information, visit:

    This module finds, verifies, and/or submits GoogleWhacks.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
