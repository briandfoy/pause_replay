The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::DistManifest
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Verify MANIFEST as an author test
  userid:      FREQUENCY (Jonathan Yu)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::CheckManifest

  rationale:

    This is admittedly a simple module but helps with testing that the
    MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP pair of files are valid. This isn't a
    substitute for the built-in functionality of Module::Build and
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker, but rather, an author test.

    It's saved me a few times; of course, it's a careless mistake for
    authors to forget to update MANIFEST files, but this module could be
    useful particularly for developers that release a lot of different
    packages.

    It has already been considered for inclusion in Test::Apocalypse,
    so it shows there is interest in this module from at least one
    author :-)

    There are similar modules already available on CPAN, for example,
    Test::CheckManifest. This module is different because it provides
    better support for the MANIFEST.SKIP file, which is why a new module
    was created instead.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::DistManifest    bdpfp Verify MANIFEST as an author test            FREQUENCY
