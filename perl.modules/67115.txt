When I follow the link to reset my password I get the following:

>> pause.perl.org uses an invalid security certificate.
>>
>> The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not tru=
sted.

>> (Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)

 Is the Cert really bad?  Or has there been something else happen....?

    * This could be a problem with the server's configuration, or it
could be someone trying to impersonate the server.

    * If you have connected to this server successfully in the past,
the error may be temporary, and you can try again later.
