The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       arXiv
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Components from the arXiv.org repository
  userid:      SIMEON (Simeon Warner)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    The scholarly communication/repository community

  similar:

  rationale:

    The arXiv (http://arxiv.org/) repository, which currently holds
    ~660,000 articles in physics, mathematics, computer science and
    related disciplines and will grown by 65,000 this year, has
    transformed scholarly communication in some disciplines. arXiv has
    been mainly in perl (versions 3, 4, 5, 5.6...) since the early 90's,
    and significant chunks have been rewritten in the past few years. We
    would like to release some of this code that might be useful to
    others in the repository and broader communities. Except for a one
    large component (the automatic TeX processing system) the perl
    modules all live under the arXiv root namespace in our system. While
    we can put some effort into gradually releasing this code we cannot
    afford to rename/restructure. Hence the request to use the arXiv
    root namespace.

  enteredby:   SIMEON (Simeon Warner)

The resulting entry would be:

arXiv             Rdphp Components from the arXiv.org repository     SIMEON
