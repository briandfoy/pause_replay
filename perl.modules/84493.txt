     why:

    Over the past four years, I have learned and learned to love Perl.
    A PAUSE account seems like the next logical step, although I don't
    have anything to contribute -- yet. There is, however, a chance that
    I will want to upload a pet project (a mashup of the TeX and XML
    languages) during the course of this year. I'd rather use the "amon"
    username instead of my real name, as this would coincide with my
    stackoverflow account.
