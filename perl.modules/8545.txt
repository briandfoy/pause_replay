The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::PartialOrder
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Classes for rooted finite partial orders
  userid:      MOOCOW (Bryan Jurish)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    I think that "PartialOrder" is the most accurate theoretical
    description of the kind of data the module is made to represent. The
    "Math" namespace strikes me as the best existing root namespace to
    hold it. I am not aware of any existing modules which provide an
    abstract interface to partial orders and operations such as
    least-upper-bound(s) and greatest-lower-bounds(s). Such structures
    and operations are useful to linguists (like me), and have also been
    used for knowledge representation systems (like LOOM), so I think
    that the module is at least potentially useful to others.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::PartialOrder    bdpOp Classes for rooted finite partial orders     MOOCOW
