The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Covetel
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Sync OpenLDAP with ActiveDirectoy and 389
  userid:      WVARGAS (Walter Vargas)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/Covetel/Covetel-LDAP-Sync, #covetel on freenode

  similar:

  rationale:

    Covetel is a cooperative association of hackers doing Free Software
    in Venezuela, we have developed several Perl modules for
    synchronization of LDAP services and databases such as Active
    Directory, OpenLDAP, 389 Directory, Postgresql, Oracle.

    We have the next modules: Covetel::LDAP Covetel::LDAP::OpenLDAP
    Covetel::LDAP::AD Covetel::LDAP::Sync Covetel::LDAP::Sync::Oracle
    Covetel::BOSS Covetel::BOSS::Result

    These modules are in production in the Bolivarian Goverment
    Institutions in Venezuela such as: * National Telephone Company of
    Venezuela CANTV (Telco) * Producer and Distributor Venezuelan Food
    (PDVAL)

    Our development team want to upload this modules to Debian, we can
    take care of this work, but before debian, we want upload our
    modules to CPAN.

    Thank you very much for attending this request.
