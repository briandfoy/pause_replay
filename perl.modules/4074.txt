A few lines and a potential security hazard!  I can easily see how the
module could be used in DOS attacks and as an attack redirector if it was
willing to fetch and mail arbitrary pages on the web.  Yes, there would be
ways to mitigate the danger, but it doesn't seem warrented to me.  If many
people request that functionality - perhaps limited to the local server
name or something - I would consider it.  My inclination is to keep first
releases simple and targeted and to allow the users of the module to guide
the creaping featurism.

Thanks!
