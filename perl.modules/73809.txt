According to the bug reporter himself, the bug was in 0.24.

The bug is labelled that way in RT and the reported states that it
remains unfixed in 0.26, which is to be expected as I did not make any
changes that would fix any bugs in the module itself. But nor should
the repackaging have introduced any new bugs.

I'll try to replicate on a 5.8.8 system later today, but this should
not change your priority (although the existence of a Critical
Twiki-breaking bug might).
