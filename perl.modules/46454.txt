Dear perl modules list maintainers,

I have finished an initial version of a class providing methods to
handle doubly linked lists as I could not find any other generic
doubly linked lists implementation in perl (and the bioperl classes
being too specific). I hope not to have invented the
perly-doubly-linked-wheel a second time...

At this point the class is in a state where I would consider
contributing it to cpan as the basics are done and *tested*
(constructors, various accessors, validation method, modifiers
((un)shift, pop, push, append, splice)) plus some more.

I would be grateful to any advise as to

- whether this thing is really new to CPAN
- where it would best fit into the namespace

Thank you, Nils
