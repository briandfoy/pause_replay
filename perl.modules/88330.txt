The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pistachio
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Turns source code into stylish HTML
  userid:      JBD (Joel Dalley)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Pistachio is based on the acronym PSTCH, which stands for "Program
    Source [code] To Css & HTML".

    Currently, it supports turning Perl5 source code into Github-like
    CSS-styled HTML, for the purpose of browsing the source code. The
    key idea here is simply that reading source code in a browser is
    much more pleasant when language keywords, user-defined symbols,
    etc, have been styled (font colors, bold font weight, etc).

    Future plans include adding support for additional styles (out of
    the box). And possibly more languages.

The resulting entry would be:

Pistachio         bdphp Turns source code into stylish HTML          JBD
