The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Domain
  DSLIP:       Mdphp
  description: Data description and validation
  userid:      DAMI (Laurent Dami)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)

  similar:
    Data::FormValidator Data::Constraint Declare::Constraints::Simple

  rationale:

    A data domain is a description of a set of values, either scalar or
    structured (arrays or hashes). The description can include many
    constraints, like minimal or maximal values, regular expressions,
    required fields, forbidden fields, and also contextual dependencies.
    From that description, one can then invoke the domain's inspect
    method to check if a given value belongs to it or not. In case of
    mismatch, a structured set of error messages is returned.

    The motivation for writing this package was to be able to express
    in a compact way some possibly complex constraints about structured
    data. Typically the data is a Perl tree (nested hashrefs or
    arrayrefs) that may come from XML, JSON, from a database through
    DBIx::DataModel, or from postprocessing an HTML form through
    CGI::Expand. Data::Domain is a kind of tree parser on that
    structure, with some facilities for dealing with dependencies within
    the structure, and with several options to finely tune the error
    messages returned to the user.

The resulting entry would be:
