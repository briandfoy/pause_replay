Ah yes, I see what happened.  There were actually multiple 
discussions, of the RFC nature, and the one where SQL::SyntaxModel 
was decided on, Sept 15-16, had occurred in private email.  It was a 
recourse I came to because modules@perl.org was not being paid any 
attention by those in power at the time.

On the dates of 2003.08.11 thru 2003.08.13 there was a discussion 
that was cross-posted between [modules@perl.org, 
poop-group@lists.sourceforge.net, dbi-users@perl.org, 
victoria-pm@pm.org], but some replies were only on one list or 
another.  I tried to compile several replies and reply to them at 
once, cross-posted, so those not privy to all lists would know what 
was said.  This discussion had subject "[RFC] SQL::AST (SQL Abstract 
Syntax Tree) - DBI related".  That discussion resulted in a reg 
attempt of "SQL::ObjectModel" on 2003.08.13, which never went 
anywhere due to admins not registering anything at the time (a 
question about this, with 2 replies, were posted 2003.08.18 thru 
2003.08.20).

These are the important posts to look at for that discussion (sorry, 
my email client was not set up then to hard-wrap text, so it may be 
harder to read; OTOH, I don't see why the web archive can't deal with 
non-wrapped text elegantly):

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/22813 - the original RFC
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/22840 - my first 
aggregated reply (includes all text of emails I am replying to)
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/22874 - second agg reply

After the above talk, I directly emailed the roughly 10 people who 
replied the first time (all recipients visible to each other) on Sept 
15th with subject "RFC on renaming a SQL/database module", which 
quickly became "Re: name for SQL module".  On Sept 26 I sent the same 
group a follow-up of "Follow-up: re: RFC on renaming a SQL/database 
module" saying what I did after the talk.

For historical posterity and convenience of the Perl module list, I 
will post an aggregate of that off-list discussion to 
modules@perl.org in a separate email.  It should be up within an hour.
