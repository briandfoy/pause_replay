     why:

    I have recently started to work for a software house that uses perl
    extensively. Every so often, we find something in a package that
    could be improved. Once permission is granted by my employer on a
    case-by-case basis, I will send patch suggestions to the packages to
    try to help improve what is already a powerful and wonderful
    resource.
