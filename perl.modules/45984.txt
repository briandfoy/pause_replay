OK, well it is your decision. My module is now ready and it works
fine for my problem. If you dont want it, it is ok. I dont want
to force on.

I have done a large look to Config::Auto, but i isn't what i've
bin searching for. If Config::Auto would handle BIND8 config-style
files, there would be a change to handle my config-structure with
this module, but it isn't.
