Hello modules@perl.org

I emailed the perlipq maintainer to see if he was still active, but
did not get a response and it appears that his contact info has become
defunct.

http://search.cpan.org/~jmorris/perlipq-1.25/IPQueue.pm

I would like to open a request to take over maintainership of perlipq.

Thanks,

- Fred
