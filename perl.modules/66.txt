Odd it may seem, but after not publishing these modules for the past 3 or 4
years, I am now rather interested in doing so. Can you give me some idea for
how long this intense deliberation will take?

In the case of the other name, SOOP, which was seemingly already approved,
do I now have any freedom to operate beneath that name, in SOOP::*, or not?

Should I begin the process of getting NameSpace::Transient or
Exporter::Transient approved now, so I don't have to waste two or three
minutes writing the module with the wrong name on it?
