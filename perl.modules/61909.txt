I am about to submit a module for calculating and applying affine  
transformations to CPAN. I plan to name it Geometry::AffineTransform  
and was wondering what others think about that.

AffineTransform is a class name and I picked it because similar  
classes in the Java and Cocoa frameworks use that name and so I think  
it is what people who are looking for this kind of module would search  
for.

I don't really have a preference for the leading namespace part, I  
picked Geometry because it seemed appropriate, but maybe it should  
live somewhere else?



Cheers

Marc
