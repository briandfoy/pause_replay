     why:

    I would like a PAUSE ID to contribute to CPAN archive. I have been
    using some own written perl utilities for the last 3 years in my
    company and want to make them available to the world since they
    could be useful for somebody out there. On the other side any
    contributor/feedback to improve quality would be greatly
    appreciated.

    1) perl library for complex multithreaded applications 2) perl
    utility for searching content of hashes and arrays
