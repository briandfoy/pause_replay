Okay...

I don't know if I qualify. I never received a "namespace approved" type
of message, but I also never got any objections.

I have discussed these on newsgroups and this list, and people are
certainly using them based on feedback I get.

At some point I directly emailed (cc to modules newsgroup) the supposed
maintainer of HTML::Element, but got no response.  No news is good news
on that front, I say.

I have had discussions with Stacy Lacy regarding the overlap of intent
with my HTML::ElementTable and the HTML::Table modules.  They are
radically different approaches to HTML tables - in fact, mine behaves as
though it were a single HTML::Element, but with far more capabilities,
as you might imagine.  It is my understanding that Stacy Lacy has
retired from HTML::Table maintenance, and was looking for someone to
take it over.  However, due to the radical differences I refer to, I was
not prepared to do this since the apparent overlap of function does not
translate to any sort of overlap of maintenance.

All of these were developed along the road to HTML::CalendarMonth.

So, here they are, already available under my ID:

HTML::
::ElementTable  bdpO  HTML::Element table manipulation          MSISK
::ElementSuper  bdpO  Various HTML::Element extensions          MSISK
::ElementGlob   bdp0  Manipulate multiple elements at once      MSISK
::ElementRaw    bdpO  Graft HTML strings on an HTML::Element    MSISK
::CalendarMonth bdpO  Calendar Months as HTML::Element trees    MSISK

If more details or discussions are required, I will be happy to send
along more thorough documentation.

Thanks!
