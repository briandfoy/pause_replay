Request to register new user

fullname: Tom Kirkpatrick
  userid: TKP
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.kirkdesigns.co.uk
     why:

    a few DBIx Class extensions... Actually, I set up a pause account
    yesterday but stupidly chose the wrong username... If possible,
    could you alter the account 'MRFELTON' and rename to 'TKP' if not
    possible, could you just set up this new account and delete the old
    one? Or can I delete the old one myself?
