Request to register new user

     why:

    I have created some tools (in Perl) that I have recently started
    cleaning up with the intent of contributing them. (While I have been
    trying to contact the maintainers of one project to arrange
    contributing to it, there are other tools that would fit elsewhere
    in CPAN. Also, being registered enables the possibility of directly
    maintaining my contributions even the ones contributed to other
    projects.) Tools I have created are in the areas of data
    handling/converstion, POD, Tk and others as needs/wants suggested.

    Thank you for your consideration
