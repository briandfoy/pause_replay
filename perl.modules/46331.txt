If you want to do multiple bundles, can you explain how all of them are 
going to fit together.

Also, have you considered doing a Task:: module instead, given that 
we've just started the long process of deprecating Bundle:: in favour of 
  Task:: (and I mean JUST started, but the consensus for doing Task:: 
seems clear, see Task.pm for documentation).

Also, see Task::Catalyst for an example of using "features" in your 
Task:: package, so you may not need to do multiple packages at all.
