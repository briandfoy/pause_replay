The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ActiTime::WebForms
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: An API to manage time tracking in actiTIME.

  rationale:

    Dear Sirs,

    I would like to submit a new module presenting a remote API to
    query and update user data in actiTIME.

    actiTIME is a web-oriented time-tracking software (see
    http://actitime.com/ for more information). There is a free version
    available in addition to the more advanced commercial package.
    Basically, it helps you to track you time spent on your task
    assignments at work.

    I have used a small desktop application for a long time, logging to
    a local file what I am currently doing. This log of simple
    start/stop actions is used to generate reports of my working
    activity. When actiTIME was rolled up company-wide, I wanted to
    update the time-track in actiTIME automatically and also have the
    list of my recent tasks synchronized with the actiTIME.

    Unfortunately actiTIME has no API except for the web UI for the
    end-users. I decided to create an API by issuing HTTP commands to
    the web UI, simulating the user interaction in HTML, similarly like
    the modules accessing free e-mail accounts do (Gmail, Hotmail, ...).
    My module does basic read and write operations with the task list
    and with the time-track for the logged-in person. It can be used to
    automate operation with actiTIME or to integrate actiTIME to other
    monitoring software.

    I chose the name ActiTime::WebForms because the module is an
    interface to the actiTIME server and it works by using the web forms
    of the native web UI. I chose the strict pascal casing not to be
    confused as a programmer thinking what letter-case I should use for
    another module. (This is the naming style used by the .NET framework
    and I like the certainty but feel free to suggest other one if you
    find it more appropriate.) And the sub-namespace, maybe there will
    be other APIs created which will not simulate the HTTP communication
    with HTML web forms and they could have other sub-namespaces next to
    my first one (SOAP, RPC, ...). If you find the namespace
    inappropriate, feel free to suggest a better one. I tried to look
    for Hotmail or Gmail integrating modules but it seems that the
    naming is not consistent there. If you find the idea of creating a
    new root namespace and a sub-namespace for the technical API style
    strange, I considered also WWW::ActiTime good, for example. I do the
    communication over WWW and a Hotmail supporting module which
    communicates with the server in a similar way is already in this
    namespace. As for the category, please, feel free to suggest another
    one if you find it better for such HTML-parsing web-based APIs.

    I use the module in a plugin for my desktop application which
    provides a both-ways synchronization of the task time-track with my
    machine and the actiTIME server. My colleague uses it also for
    automated generation and sibmitting of reports to an internal
    time-accounting system. The current versoin 0.05 is fairly good
    tested and likely to be released as a stable one. I may only change
    the namespace as I discussed above. The current structure is:

    ActiTime\WebForms.pm (convenience functions wrapping usual tasks)
    ActiTime\WebForms\Connection.pm (connection and authentication with
    the actiTIME server) ActiTime\WebForms\MyTaskList.pm (management of
    tasks available to the authentified user)
    ActiTime\WebForms\MyTimeTrack.pm (queries and updates of working
    times of the authentified user)

    I can send you the current module distribution if you would like to
    see it. Thank you for helping me with publishing the module.

    Best regards, Ferdinand Prantl
