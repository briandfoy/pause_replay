The long name directories are not supported anymore. They were no good
idea, because the directory was growing without bounds and became an
obstacle for smooth working. Besides they were not 7bit clean. The
eighth bit was simply latin1 which we consider inappropriate for an
international community. Unfortunately lWe cannot delete the old
entries there because the world is full of links to them.

Thanks for letting us know.

Although it isn't a bug, it needs fixing somehow. I'm planning to
coordinate with the owners of 8bit names to delete their entries in
the near future. Maybe I'll just turn the symlinks into HTML files
that contain a link to the real directory.
