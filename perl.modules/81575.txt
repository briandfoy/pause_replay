Subject: Module submission Net::IMP

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::IMP
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Inspection and Modication in proxies, IDS...
  userid:      SULLR (Steffen Ullrich)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module implements an interface for inspecting and modifying
    data in an callback drin way. It is targeted at inspecting proxies,
    firewalls, IDS etc - no matter if commercial or free. The idea is to
    have an easy to use interface to let anybody write plugins to
    analyze and modify traffic. Sample implementations of such proxies
    are already included in the distribution, to make it easy to start
    experimenting. Also there will be an implementation in the
    commercial genugate firewall.

    IMHO no module like this is currently at CPAN. There is some
    overlapping functionality with Net::xAP (last update 1999), which
    attempted to implement ICAP, a widely used protocol also for
    inspection, but IMHO inferior for anything except small HTTP
    requests.

    I think the Net::* space fits nicely, because there are lots of
    protocols (Net::SMTP..) and also inspection (Net::Inspect, which can
    be nicely used together with Net::IMP)

    The current state of the module can already be seen at
    https://github.com/noxxi/p5-net-imp

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::IMP             bdpOp Inspection and Modication in proxies, IDS... SULLR
