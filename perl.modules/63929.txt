Subject: Module submission Bio::SSA

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::SSA
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Small Sequence Analysis (SSA) - DNA, RNA, AA
  userid:      MBRANDON (Marty Brandon)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    bioperl

  rationale:

    Bio seems like the obvious root since it is already established for
    other biological sequence analysis modules. My modules differ from
    those currently available in that they are focused on those doing
    research on very short segments of DNA, such as mitochondrial
    genomes, so I thought SSA for "short sequence analysis" might help
    to convey that difference.

    I'm new to submitting modules to the CPAN and have a genuine desire
    to "do the right thing". No enlightened person has advised me on
    what namespace to use, so if my reasoning is faulty, I'd very much
    welcome a suggestion. Is there someone to ask about such matters?

    Thank you.
