Sorry, David, it's not CPAN's policy to prevent competition. I cannot
see hijacking here, all I see is a smallish change to your module.

I cannot imagine the reason why AWA is not contacting you about the
change, maybe she has tried, maybe she has chosen a channel that you
did not receive on, maybe she intended to contact you and was then
side-tracked. These are normal things to happen.

CPAN did not *index* the other upload. This is the protection that we
provide for every author's namepaces. But we do not prevent uploading
for the very reason to encourage competition, to smoothen
collaboration, to further alternative approaches.

Maybe AWA plans a fork, maybe not. Maybe her change is an improvement
that you should consider for your own distro, I cannot judge the
quality and the intent of the changes. Ideally you would concentrate
on the content and decide if it is a gift or not worth considering
further. Feel free to comment on the change in your blog, your
manpage, your ChangeLog or Changes file, in RT or wherever you see fit
and see what comes out of it.
