The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       eGuideDog::Festival
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: Wrapper of common functions of Festival TTS.
  userid:      HGNENG (黄冠能)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=643787

  similar:
    Speech::Festival Festival::Client

  rationale:

    The module is a wrapper of Festival text-to-speech system which is
    written in Scheme language. It provides more functions than the
    exist and it's easier to use. I think it is worth sharing on CPAN.

    I am not strongly demanding for the namespace eGuideDog, which is
    the name of my voice web browser for the
    blind(http://eguidedog.sourceforge.net). "Speech::EasyFestival" is
    acceptable too.

    I am going to write another module named "eGuideDog::eSpeak" (or
    named "Speech::eSpeak", which is a wrapper of another TTS eSpeak.

    Thank you!
