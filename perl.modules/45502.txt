Subject: Module submission Nabaztag
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, jeteve@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nabaztag
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: Control nabaztag from perl !!
  userid:      JETEVE (Jerome Eteve)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Nabaztag is a wifi connected screenless, keyboardless terminal.
    Actually it's a plastic rabbit featured with movable ears, speaker
    and multicolored lights . It's designed to gently display
    informations gathered from the internet or messages send to him with
    its ears, lights and speaker.

    See http://www.nabaztag.com for more info.

    The company who designed it provides a simple API. My aim is to
    adapt this api to turn it Perl OO accessible in order to allow the
    community to easilly devellop new services based on this wonderfull
    terminal.

    The root of implied modules will be 'Nabaztag' !!

  enteredby:   JETEVE (Jerome Eteve)

The resulting entry would be:

Nabaztag          adpOl Control nabaztag from perl !!                JETEVE
