The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filter::QuasiQuote
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: Quasiquoting for Perl
  userid:      AGENT (Agent Zhang (章亦春))
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Filter::Simple Filter::Util::Call

  rationale:

    GHC 6.10.x is going to have a nice quasiquoting feature for
    Haskell:

    http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mainland/ghc-quasiquoting/

    And this module implements similar quasiquoting syntax for Perl by
    means of carefully designed source filters.

    The user can subclass Filter::QuasiQuote and define her own DSL
    extensions. Besides, multiple concrete quasiquoting filters can be
    chained and composed within a single Perl file.

    Special efforts have been made to ensure line numbers for the
    resulting Perl source won't be corrupted and support for precise
    file position information is also provided to user's DSL compilers
    as well.

    I now have a working prototype ready to upload to PAUSE. But I'd
    like to seek opionions about this module before uploading here ;)

The resulting entry would be:

Filter::
::QuasiQuote      adpOo Quasiquoting for Perl                        AGENT
