From the Desk of Dr=2E Abba Mabutu
E-Mail=3Adappy255=40netscape=2Enet

Dear Friend=2C

You may be surprise to receive this letter from me=2Csince you do not know
me personally=2E I am DR=2E ABBA MABUTU=2Cthe son of SOMINU MABUTU=2Cthe most
popular black farmer in Zimbabwe=2E

He was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country=2E I got your
contact through network online hence I decided to write you=2EBefore the
death of my father=2Che had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of
US$10=2E5M =28Ten million=2CFive Hundred Thousand United states Dollars=29 in
one of the security company=2Cas he foresaw the looming danger in
Zimbabwe=2EThis fund was deposited in a box as gemstones for concealmet
and to avoid much demurrage from the security company=2E

This land problem came when Zimbabwe President=2C Mr=2ERobert Mugabe and his
cabinet introduced a new land act reform wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few rich black farmers who are opposed to his
Government and this result to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean
war veterans and some lunatics in the society=2EIn fact=2Ca lot of people
were killed because of this land reform Act for which my father was one
of the victims=2EThe problem is yet unresolved as some white farmers who
could not quit are being arrested by the security officials of Zimbabwe=2E

It is against this background that my family and I fled Zimbabwe for
fear of our lives of which I am currently staying in the GHANA seeking
political asylum=2E

Moreover=2CI have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable
foreign account WHERE IT WILL BE SAFE AND SECURE AND NOT BE TRACE BY
ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT HEADED PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE=2ESince the law of the
GHANA prohibits a refugee =28asylum seeker=29to have such amount of money in
any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction of such
magnitude through the territorial zone of GHANA=2C I am seeking a trust
worthy partner who I have entrust my future and that of my family in his
hands=2EI must let you know that this transaction is risk free=2Cif you
accept to assist me=2E

All I want you to do for me is to make an arrangement with the security
company to clear the consignment =28fund=29 from their affiliate office in
the Netherlands=2E I have already given directives for the consignment to
brought from South Africa to the Netherlands=2EAll modalities will have to
be put in place like change of ownership of the consignment into your
name as to empowered sole beneficiary so that you can be contacted by
the security company and clear the consignment on my behalf=2E

I have two reward options for you=2EFirstly=2CI can give you a certain
percentage preferably 20% of the total funds for your role in clearing
the consignment and ensuring that the fund is transferred into an
account which you have control over=2ESecondly=2Cyou can go into
partnershipwith me
for the proper profitable investment of the fund in your
country=2EWhichever option you want=2Cfeel free to notify me=2EI have also
mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred by you to
defray them at the successful completion of this transaction=2E

You may reply me by giving me your telephone and fax numbers so that I
will send to you all the necessary documents once you have decided and
willing to help while maintaining the absolute secrecy required in this
transaction=2E

Yours Sincerely=2C
ABBA MABUTU=2E
