I can use:
	FWNS::OO::Class
where 'FWNS' stands for the prospective namespace.  So I don't really
need a second namespace.

However, the namespace "pollution" on CPAN is a bit awkward.  I wrote a
script to search ~/.cpan/ (it's necessary to use regex on the module
names), which will be part of the application.

Argg...
	VALU = meth2()
(and so on).  Setters are private, getters are public.
