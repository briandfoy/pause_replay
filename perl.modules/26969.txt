The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::GDBUI
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Help implement a Bash/GDB-like environment.
  userid:      BRONSON (Scott Bronson)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Term::TUI

  rationale:

    I submitted a request when I upload 0.61 but it doesn't seem to be
    listed on the modules page and I'm not listed as the owner of any
    modules. Please tell me if there are any issues with registering
    this namespace.

    On the surface Term::GDBUI appears similar to Term::TUI.
    Term::GDBUI provides a comprehensive Bash-like interface, however,
    where Term::TUI provides a more limited hierarchical command
    interface. They solve different problems.

  enteredon:   Sat Jan 31 09:20:23 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::GDBUI           bdpOp Help implement a Bash/GDB-like environment.  BRONSON
