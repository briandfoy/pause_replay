Planned Contribution Summary: Better auto'use'r specifically for classes

Module Description ( DSLI )
Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Class::
::Autouse      adph  Loads class when any class method is called

Class::Autouse
A module somewhat similar to the normal autouse, except that it does NOT
require
the functions to be pre-declared, and will load the module when any
method is used.
Or course, it only really works in a class/method context.

Public Discussion:
	The module was discussed in the Efnet #perl channel, where there
was some interest
	and it appeared that the module would be of use.

Could this go into the standard autouse
	Perl already has an autouse. But the method I'm using doesn't
seem to lead itself to
	being integrated. The current autouse has features this cannot
support. This is also
	designed specifically to work with objects and inheritance, so I
think it is better
	off seperate.

Thanks for your time

Adam Kennedy
