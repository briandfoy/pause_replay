The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::MSN
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: An interface to connect to the MSN network
  userid:      DJR (David Radunz)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, CVS repository

  similar:
    Net::Oscar

  rationale:

    I wanted to be able to write a perl bot that was able to connect to
    MSN, Oscar and Yahoo. There were no good MSN modules, and none that
    supported protocol version 9 - So I have written this module which
    does support MSNP9, as well as logging on to msn via passport.

  enteredby:   DJR (David Radunz)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 22 05:48:36 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::MSN             cdpOg An interface to connect to the MSN network   DJR
