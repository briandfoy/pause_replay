I would like to request the name space digest-auth for the new=
 module I have written. The module does digest based (hash based)=
 authentication for perl applications. Its primary usage would be=
 in cgi applications but can be used in multiple types of=
 scripts. Originally I was planning to sell the module but have=
 decided to give it to all under cpan instead.

So far I am at the alpha stage of this module (about 1700 lines=
 of combined code and pod documentation) and would like to=
 solidify the namespace.
