Subject: Module submission DateTime::Event::Predict

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTime::Event::Predict
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Predict next date from a set of dates
  userid:      BHANN (Brian Hann)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module would take a set of dates (probably DateTime objects)
    and find trends in recurrence ('every Thursday', 'every weekend
    day', 'every other week', 'once a month', etc) and also provide
    predictions for the next date most likely to follow the set.

    If workable I would think this would have any number of
    applications.

  enteredby:   BHANN (Brian Hann)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov 14 23:37:16 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DateTime::Event::
::Predict         idpOp Predict next date from a set of dates        BHANN
