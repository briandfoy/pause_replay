Subject: Module submission Sunpower::Cryocooler
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, kerr@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sunpower::Cryocooler
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: For interfacing with Sunpower Cryocoolers
  userid:      KERR (Sam Kerr)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    IRC, blog

  similar:

  rationale:

    Many researchers throughout the world make use of Sunpower
    Cryocoolers, and as of yet there is no freely available perl module
    for interacting with them. I would like to rememdy this situation
    with Sunpower::Cryo::Funclib.

  enteredby:   KERR (Sam Kerr)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr  8 17:05:39 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sunpower::
::Cryocooler      adpfg For interfacing with Sunpower Cryocoolers    KERR
