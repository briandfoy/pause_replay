Hi, Sandor.

To reset an email, generally I ask people to validate that their
identity corresponds to their new email address.  For example, if you
have a public profile on Linkedin or Google+ or another social
networking site that has your email address, that would do.  Or get
someone else in the Perl community whose email I already know to vouch
for you.  Worst case, email me a scan of government ID (not that I've
*ever* had to get to that point with someone).

Please email me off-list and we'll figure something out.  :-)

Regards,
David Golden
