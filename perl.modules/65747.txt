Seems to me that this isn't inflation at all - it's automatic construction
of an object - something like MooseX::AutoConstruct or ::AutoNew would perhaps

There's also a significant number of ways the implementation could be improve,
I think, but that's not really a modules@perl.org thing - maybe we could
discuss that on #moose at some point?
