     why:

    Net::WWWServer - a perl web server with enhanced cgi debugging
    CGI::Application::CGIErrors - a error tracking system taking
    advantage of modification I made to CGI and CGI::Carp, as well as
    plugging into Net::WWWServer's debugger Net::Pcap - for Win32
    CGI::Application::Sniffer - CGI pages to show interpreted packet
    captures GraphViz::Workflow - module to graph users workflow through
    applications or web sites

    All except for the CGI::Application::Sniffer are done, the CGI
    sniffer is just a CGI script at the moment, working on the port to
    CGI::Application.
