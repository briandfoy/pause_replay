Request to register new user

fullname: Xavier Caron
  userid: XCARON
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I've requested XAV ID. Problem is, I should have thought about it a
    bit more since XCARON was available and definitely makes more sense
    to other PAUSE persons. Sorry for the inconvenience but I'd like to
    use XCARON instead of XAV (deletion already requested). Thanks!
