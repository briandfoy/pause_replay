Subject: Selecting the right namespace

From: gsyoungblood@mac.com (Gregory Youngblood)

I have a collection of modules that I use for a variety of projects,  
mostly internal, but some have been released over the years.

I would like to put these modules in CPAN, and understand the first  
step is to discuss the proposed namespace here, and then register the  
usage formally using the PAUSE form.

My preference is to use "NetIO", as that is how the modules are  
currently set up. Under NetIO, there are several supporting modules  
that actually provide the functionality. These are not Net::IO type  
modules. These provide various methods that serve as a foundation to  
web applications, utilities, command line programs, etc. that I have  
written over the years.

Would NetIO be an appropriate name? If not, perhaps Zeta ?

Thanks,
Greg
