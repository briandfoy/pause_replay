Hi Steve,

thanks for String::Random and other contributions to the open source world.

I'd like to have COMAINT on https://metacpan.org/release/String-Random . My
CPAN user page is https://metacpan.org/author/SHLOMIF and my user name is
"SHLOMIF". My plans for it are to close bugs and maybe update some of the c=
ode
and work on the TODO list.

Can you give me COMAINT?

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
