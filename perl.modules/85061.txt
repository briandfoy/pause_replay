The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Basis
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Making script creation simpler
  userid:      MOODFARM (Kevin Mulholland)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    App::Cmd MooX::Cmd

  rationale:

    Most modules that aim to ease script creation do no such thing,
    they may need lots extra classes (Moose etc) be object oriented and
    need extra modules to be created, App::Basis aims to help people who
    are constructing simple single file apps, to ease command line
    argument usage, to provide basic config file access
    (App::Basis::Config).

    Doing simple things should not need to understand heavy weight
    modules, hence App::Basis::Email exists to ease creating and sending
    email.

    Similarly App::Basis::Tools::Ping provides a number of ways to ping
    hosts and subnets.

    More tools to go into App::Basis::Tools are planned, to help the
    DevOps type coder.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
