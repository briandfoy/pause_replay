That works fine (i.e. the file DNSBLserver will have a legal $VERSION), 
since that code is all on one line (which wasn't clear from your e-mail).

However, you just can't execute that file in some other file, because 
that is outside of the Safe compartment.  The $VERSION assignment *must* 
be contained completely within the package; it doesn't need to be a 
constant assignment, but it must not depend on any other file.  You can 
use a preprocessor to generate the other files based on that same string 
during build.
