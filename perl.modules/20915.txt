The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Copy::Link
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Function to replace a link by a copy
  userid:      RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    File::Copy::Link provides one function copylink, and uses
    File::Copy and File::Spec::Link (in the same distribution).

    The aim of F::C::L was to provide a script "copylink" that could be
    called on a file(s) in a perl source created by ./Configure
    -Dmksymlinks; to create a copy of the source file that could be
    editted and then compared to the original source file(s). There
    seened to be no functionality in UNIX or perl to do this, so I wrote
    F::C::L and F::S::L.

    The modules are generic with respect to file system (using
    File::Spec) but have not been tested on non-UNIX systems that
    support symlinks.

The resulting entry would be:

File::Copy::
::Link            bdpfp Function to replace a link by a copy         RMBARKER
