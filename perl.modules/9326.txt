Contributions:

o  ODBI - abstracts a relational database into objects with methods for 
quicky creating, retrieving and updating those objects.  Builds the 
database schema from db meta data and/or meta data tables in the db.
It essentially turns a DBI compliant database into a logical object 
store.

o  Apache::Application - based on CGI::Application, but uses the Apache
modules instead of CGI.pm.  This may actually become a sub-class of an 
as yet undeveloped module that will be shared between CGI::Application 
and Apache::Application (and potentially others).


Thanks! 
Ben
