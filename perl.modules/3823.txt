Is anyone opposed to having an Embedix::* top-level namespace?
Embedix is the name of the Linux distro put out by Lineo, and I have
a few modules that I'd like to contribute in the near future
in this namespace.  All of the modules that would go under the
Embedix namespace, qw(Embedix::ECD Embedix::Distro Embedix::Builder)
are pretty specific to the distribution, and they don't really fit
in anywhere else.

I think I should have written this first, before uploading, but I
was kinda excited to get my PAUSE id and was a little overeager
to contribute to CPAN.  If anyone has issues, let me know, and we
can try to figure out a better name for my modules.  (So far, I've
only uploaded Embedix::ECD).

thanks.
