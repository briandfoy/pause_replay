Yeah, new top-level namespaces kinda suck.  I dunno, Perl::PSP::?
Perl::SP::?  I wouldn't mind that as much, though it's still not entirely
descriptive.  Perl::Source?

I'd tend to think it should go under Perl::, in any event.  But then again,
maybe that's too presumptuous (maybe something that "tied" to Perl should
be approved by a pumpking)?  If so, maybe Source::Perl?
Parse::Source::Perl?
