From: cjohnston@rockstardevelopment.com ("Chad Johnston")

I have a module I would like to submit to CPAN. Here's the info I'm supposed
to send:
* Name: Chad Johnston
* Email Address: cjohnston@rockstardevelopment.com
* Homepage: http://www.rockstardevelopment.com
* Preferred User ID: CJOHNSTON (This is like a username, right?)
* Description: Modules for Win32 that shows memory and processor information
* Description:
Name              DSLI  Description
----------------  ----  -----------------------------------------
SystemInfo        bdpf  Memory and Processor Info for Win32

This module has been posted for use and review at http://www.perlmonks.org .
It is an outgrowth from a previous module which only accessed memory
information, which is also available at the PerlMonks site. There has been
some interest in the SystemInfo module, and it was at PerlMonks that the
suggestion for submitting this to CPAN was raised.
