I've tried to contact the author of CDB_File to submit a patch to him. I
got no bounce but I also got no reply, so I'm requesting to take over
this module.

I've CC'd him at both his cpan.org address and pod address, in case he
suddenly decides to respond.

The patch that needs to be applied (because it leaks memory and file
handles) is at http://axkit.org/download/cdb.patch

Matt.
