The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::EzDate
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO date calculatation and manipulation
  userid:      MIKO (Miko O'Sullivan)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Date::Calc

  rationale:

    Date::EzDate was motivated by the simple fact that I hate dealing
    with date and time calculations, so I put all of them into a single
    easy-to-use object. The main idea of EzDate is that the object
    represents a specific date and time. A variety of properties tell
    you information about that date and time such as hour, minute, day
    of month, weekday, etc.

    The real power of EzDate is that you can assign to (almost) any of
    those properties and EzDate will automatically rework the other
    properties to produce a new valid date with the property you just
    assigned. Properties that can be kept the same with the new value
    aren't changed, while those that logically must change to accomodate
    the new value are recalculated. For example, incrementing epochday
    by one (i.e. moving the date forward one day) does not change the
    hour or minute but does change the day of week.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
