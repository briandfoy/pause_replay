Subject: Module submission UI::State

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UI::State
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: UI Modeling via State Transitions
  userid:      TMURRAY (Timm Murray)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:
    CGI::Application, CGI::Prototype

  rationale:

    Currently, there does not appear to be a generic place for
    UI-related modules that are independant of any specific UI
    implementation (Tk, Gnome, etc.). Admittedly, this is not very
    common, as anything more than simple text output usually relies on a
    specific implementation. However, as this module shows, there are
    some concepts which can be applied to any UI. Therfore, I request
    that the new UI:: top-level namespace be created for this purpose.

    UI::State creates various states and defines ways to transition
    between them. Each state roughly translates to a logical area in a
    user interface. This is somewhat similar to CGI::Application and
    CGI::Prototype, but each of those is specific to a web application
    environment; UI::State is completely generic.

The resulting entry would be:

UI::
