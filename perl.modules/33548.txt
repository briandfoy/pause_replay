The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Gtk2
  DSLIP:       MmhOl
  description: Bindings for the gtk+-2.x UI Toolkit
  userid:      RMCFARLA (Ross McFarland)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    gtk-perl-list@gnome.org, #gtk-perl on ircd.gimp.org,
    http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/ (news, rels, doc, tutorials, cvs,
    etc.)

  similar:
    Gtk (for version 1.x bindings of glib/gtk/etc)

  rationale:

    Gtk was the original namespace of the bindings for gtk+-1.x. There
    were significant changes between gtk+ 1.x and 2.x that prevented the
    bindings from being able to bind both in any resonable manner. In
    addition both Gtk and Gtk2 are widely used and often will need to
    co-exist on systems.

    The Gtk2-Perl set of modules are part of the official Gnome
    Language Bindings set which requires adhereance to a set of rules
    about api stability and release numbering. The bindings are pretty
    complete (api-wise) as are the tests.

  enteredby:   RMCFARLA (Ross McFarland)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul 15 00:45:06 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Gtk2              MmhOl Bindings for the gtk+-2.x UI Toolkit         RMCFARLA
