The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Portability::Files
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Check file names portability
  userid:      SAPER (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The aim of this module is to test that the filenames included in a
    distribution are portable across different operating systems. It
    simply checks each filename against the advices given in
    perlport/"Files and Filesystems". The module name was chosen to
    reflect its aim.

    AFAIK, there no other module on the CPAN that checks the
    portability of a module or a distribution. Test::File from brian d
    foy and Test::Files from Philip Crow test other aspects (comparing
    files, checking their size). Test::Portability::Files checks that
    the names won't create problems, for example like the one caused by
    the HEAD program from LWP on Mac OS X systems.

    The module is placed in the Test::Portability sub-namespace, which
    could/should be used to test other potential portability problems as
    described in perlport.

    Thanks in advance
