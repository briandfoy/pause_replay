File::Format::RIFF sounds good.  Shall I go ahead and use that?

As for sockets, I'm planning on some of the functionality using 
getpos/setpos and so on, so I'll have to put some extra thought into 
differentiating what can operate on IO::Seekable-type stuff and what 
can be used to say, read/write data to sockets.  But yeah, I intend to 
write it such that it doesn't require you to necessarily have a file.  
That being said, I don't think anyone will be confused if we call it 
"File::Format::RIFF", seeing as how the "FF" in "RIFF" stands for "File 
Format".
