It is odd that PAUSE does not have an owner listed for that package.  
Why It did not pick it out form the BIRNEY upload I do not know. It  
did not pick it out of this upload because it is a developer release.

I guess thats why you were not given co-author permissions when you  
were given the others.

However search.cpan.org did know about the previous upload so it did  
not assign any permission to this module for you.

I fixed search.cpan.org.  When you upload a non-developer release to  
PAUSE then PAUSE should assign the ownership to you on a first come  
basis.
