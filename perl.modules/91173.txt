I'm not sure that would accomplish what we need.  We want to use package
name conflicts because packages already have ownership/permissions and we
want to ensure that distribution names -- which are treated as unique
identifiers by things like RT -- get controlled using the same permission
system.

This particular case seems like an unfortunate interaction between:

* case-insensitive package names (to avoid the File::stat, File::Stat
problem)
* distribution names having to match a package name for which the uploader
has permissions.

If I understand correctly, the general public sees only 06perms, not the
underlying tables so understanding the scope of the problem is difficult.
My own quick scan of 06perms shows no case-conflicts (unless I did it
wrong).

How many case conflicts exist in the non-public tables?  Maybe if the
number is small enough we can resolve them with a heuristic or arbitrary
decision.
