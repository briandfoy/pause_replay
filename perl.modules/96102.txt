Hi, Neil!

This module was written as a PoC and never was used in any of production =
code.
As I can see from deps, there is no CPAN modules, that uses it also.
After all, for now there is another module LV, that was inspired by =
lvalue and do more, than my.

So, I renamed lvalue into Sub::Lvalue for the historical reasons and =
deleted lvalue.
