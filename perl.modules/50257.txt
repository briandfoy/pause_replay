The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Generate::SQLData
  DSLIP:       cmpfa
  description: High customizable SQL-like data generator.

  rationale:

    Dear PAUSE admins, here my motivation for the new rootlevel
    namespace Generate: After looking at the list of available
    namespaces I couldn't find an appropriate rootlevel namespace for my
    module. Finally I considered to use either Test or Parse as the
    root, but both weren't satisfying myself.

    This because the goal of this module is wether to test software
    (altough it solves a somehow closely related problem, generate data
    for testing) or to parse statements (altough this module makes some
    parsing).

    This module instead, builds up tons of synthetic data on the fly
    while parsing very few but powerful regex-like user statements (this
    is the control mechanism for the kind of data produced).

    If I would place the module somewhere else, for example in Test, I
    think that users would encounter an increased difficulty to find it.

    On the other side I believe that a new rootlevel namespace
    "Generate" gives a new opportunity to developers to place, for
    example, code generation modules in there.

    Please consider my motivation and give me in any case an answer as
    soon as possible.

    Please contact me under my email adress <daconti.mail@gmail.com>
    for further details. I'm going to read my mails frequently.

    In case of a deny of my proposition, I would then rename the module
    as Test::Generate::SQLData.

    Thank you very much for your attention. Many Regards, Davide Conti.
