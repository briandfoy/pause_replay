Aha, so that is what "indexed" means.  Then  it is good that it isn't 
indexed...

Too bad.  I guess I need to ask Graham...

Noooo... that's not what I want at all...  ;-)

That's clear to me now...

I'm not confused anymore, so here's my proposal.  Keep the message 
unchanged.  But add this message at the end of the list:

"The PAUSE namespace index is available as: 
CPAN/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz."

And, if some of the modules were not added, maybe add the message:

"Package(s) (list) of your distribution were not added to the PAUSE 
namespace index."
