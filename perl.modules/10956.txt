Hi,
This is a friendly reminder about my module, Proc::Reliable.  I have
not heard anything since i submitted it for module list registration quite
a while ago.  possibly since my reply email was broken initially, but now
my reply email should be fixed.  i am hoping someone can let me know what
the status of this registration is.  I've included the registration email
text below.

thanks very much,

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Reliable
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Reliable subprocess management, many options
  userid:      DGOLD (Dan Goldwater)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Proc::Short

  rationale:

    The core functionality of Proc::Reliable is to execute subprocesses
    with a timeout and configurable termination conditions, while
    collecting all output produced by the subprocess. When writing
    high-reliability software, it is essential to have this
    functionality when running subprocesses in order to manage 'problem'
    subprocesses which are likely to fail, hang or behave badly. <p>
    Proc::Reliable implements a convenient and easy-to-use interface
    which includes all the functionality of the backticks operator and
    system() functions, plus many common uses of fork() and exec(),
    open2() and open3(). Proc::Reliable incorporates a number of
    options, including sending data to the subprocess on STDIN,
    collecting STDOUT and STDERR separately or together, killing hung
    processes, timouts and automatic retries. <p> Proc::Reliable module
    is an enhancement and rewrite of the well-intentioned but not well
    implemented Proc::Short. <p> Thanks! <p>
