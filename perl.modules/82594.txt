     why:

    At my place of employment I'm currently working on updating our
    existing old procedural Perl web app to something better. I've
    looked at using Dancer, Mojolicious and Catalyst but I found they
    are far too rigid for our requirements. Using any of those
    frameworks requires rewriting our entire app from scratch, and we
    just don't have the time or resources to do that. So I wrote
    something I call an optional MVC framework, and the difference
    between this framework and others is that you can use as much of it
    or as little of it as you want. At worst you can just include some
    parts of it in your procedural script. At best it is a full fledged
    MVC framework.

    Some parts of this new code is in use right now, some is in
    development, and I have a lot of features are planned, but I want to
    start to contribute my work to CPAN as it might be useful to those
    in my shoes, who have really bad old code and want to fix it but
    don't have the time or resources to rewrite an app from scratch
    using a full fledged framework like Catalyst.
