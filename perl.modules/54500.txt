The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PAB3
  DSLIP:       Sdhhp
  description: Perl Application Builder
  userid:      CHRMUE (Christian Mueller)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:
    EmbPerl

  rationale:

    Hello Pause Team,

    because this is a framework which includes different chapters from
    the list above, i would prefer an own root namespace to get module
    names not big. Have i to register every module here? There are three
    database drivers in this bundle. They also exists as own
    installations. Is it possible to mix this? Sorry, i did already
    upload the files.

    Kind regards,

    Christian
