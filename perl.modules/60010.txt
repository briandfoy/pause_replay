Hi,

Module Wx::ActiveX::Template contains some template text used for creating module code.

I had thought I had made sure that steps were in place to prevent pause indexer and pod reading the template text as package names and doc info.

I was wrong.

I have therefore caused a package

ModUlEPacKAgENaME

to be indexed.

I can fix the Wx::ActiveX::Template file so that ModUlEPacKAgENaME will not be indexed again, but I can't figure out for sure how to make the indexed ModUlEPacKAgENaME go away. 

If I upload a new version, without the ModUlEPacKAgENaME problem, then use the pause 'Reset' page to forget 
ModUlEPacKAgENaME, will just the most recent version if Wx::ActiveX get re-indexed, or will pause go back and try to find 'ModUlEPacKAgENaME' in all available versions.

Your help appreciated.

Mark
