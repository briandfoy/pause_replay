The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::Text::Arc
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Draw TrueType text around edge of circle
  userid:      DALLEN (Daniel Allen)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    will be discussed in kw.pm / to.pm mailing lists, possibly perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    GD can draw truetype text at any angle in a straight line. However,
    to draw text along a curve (such as around the top or bottom of a
    circle), one must invest some time to make the math work out
    correctly, as there are no existing modules to do that
    automatically. The math is not difficult at all, but getting the
    angles and signs correct can be tricky.

    This module currently draws text to follow a circular arc.
    Parameters include: GD image object, font-name, size, text, x and y
    position of circle origin, angle, justification, and orientation.
    The angle can either be the starting angle on the circle, or the
    center of the text (depending on the justification). Justification
    is either left- or center. Orientation can be clockwise or
    counterclockwise (as would be natural for at the top or bottom of
    the circle, respectively). I plan to eventually add "x-axis" and
    "y-axis" to allow the arc to follow an ellipse as well.

    Namespace:

    GD::Text::Arc is as simple and straight-forward a name as any other
    I have considered. Possible names I've considered and rejected:

    GD::Text::Wrap::Circle (rejected because it doesn't wrap text
    inside a circle, as you might expect by the superclass)

    GD::Text::Path::Arc (appropriate if somebody was going to write the
    superclass, to follow arbitrary shapes. But the name doesn't sound
    as clean.)

    GD::Text::Circular (alternative name; would be OK but it doesn't
    sound as clean.)

  enteredby:   DALLEN (Daniel Allen)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov  7 22:45:49 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GD::Text::
::Arc             adpOp Draw TrueType text around edge of circle     DALLEN
