Hello,

I'd like to request a developer ID for use in CPAN development.

Name: James Tavares
Email: perl@james.tavares.name
WWW: http://perl.james.tavares.name/
Preferred User id: JTAVARES

I am planning on contributing, at least initially, a module to configure
Linksys "Instant Broadband Series" routers. Currently, there is no other
way to configure these units other than to manually navigate through
HTML forms using a web browser such as Netscape. The routers lack SNMP
support as well as any method of exporting/importing configurations,
which is useful when working with large quantities of routers. What was
needed was a Perl interface to quickly perform firmware upgrades (via
TFTP), import/export configurations, change passwords, and modify
various settings... I have already coded the module and it is near point
of release.

I thank you for your time, and look forward to soon contributing to CPAN.

As a side note: I am not affiliated with Linksys in any way.

Thanks,

----
