The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Pod::Content
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Test a Pod's content
  userid:      MKUTTER (Martin Kutter)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    erlangen-pm@pm.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows to add simple tests for a pod's content easily
    via two methods: pod_section_is and pod_section_like.

    It has a interface familiar to the users of Test::More.

    Unfortunately, there seems to be no module on CPAN yet which allows
    easy testing of a pod's content.

    As source code generators grow up, generated documentation becomes
    more and more important. As with all work, you can't be sure without
    a test - so source code generators need to test whether the
    generated pod contains the expected content.

    Other use cases include assuring all pods in a distribution contain
    the same copyright/license note.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Pod::
::Content         bdpfp Test a Pod's content                         MKUTTER
