     why:

    I will work on linguistic processing, more specifically,
    Korean-related and corpus and dictionary related. Currently, I'm
    writing and have written scripts and modules for Hangul (Korean
    alphabet) processing.

    I have written a set of Korean encoding modules based on various
    transliteration systems, using Encode::Encoding, say, Korean version
    of Encode::Arabic. It's already usable (and may be useful).

    In series, I'll add several Korean encoding tools: 1) locally used
    encodings (in South and North Korean and China. 2) encodings used in
    digital archives of old Korean anguage, 3) coversion between Unicode
    Area (Hangul Compatibility Jamo Area <-> Hangul Syllable Area)
