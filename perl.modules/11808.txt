The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::DataLookup
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Perl extension fordatabase view lookup table
  userid:      VLADB (Vladimir Bogdanov)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::Lookup::Field, DBIx::Cache

  rationale:

    Remotely similar to DBIx::Cache but is very simpler and serves
    narrower purpose. This module allows you to both cache records
    pulled by an SQL statement from a database in the memory as well as
    look them up later at any time during execution of your script.

    This also speeds up access to your data at run-time and
    subsequently reduces load on the database. This module also supports
    alternative key mapping, which is not offered by any other module. A
    user of this module may add alternative key mappings at run-time to
    be able to link certain records with specific keys etc.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
