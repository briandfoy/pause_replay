File::Repl     cDpO  File and File structure replication utility  DROBERTS


The utility has been written for Win32 - but has no dependencies on that
architecture.  I 'd appreciate any guidance / suggestions you can give.

This has not been discussed publically (not sure where to start here - do you
have some pointers?) - but has in my work environment.  I have been searching
CPAN and the perl site for replication ans similar words - after all I'd rather
use established code than write my own.

I have uploaded the code to my directory on PAUSE...

Advice appreciated.

Thanks   Dave
