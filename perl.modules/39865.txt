Subject: Compress::Bzip2 - rewrite, i want to take over

Hi all -

I've been trying for the last two days to take over ownership of 
Compress::Bzip2.  A search just now in pause turned up Arjen, David and 
Marco, Marco whom I already sent an email to.  Marco is the current 
owner.  Arjen and David have rewrites they want to upload.  Wait, I see 
1.03 uploaded.  Looks like David's made it in.  But I only see 1.00 in 
the by-modules directory.  But I see my 2.00 up there too in 
search.cpan.org!  What gives?  View Permissions on PAUSE still lists 
KCARNUT and AZEMGI as the owners, and nobody else.  Hmmm ...

Looks like ownership is moot, although I still can't see the module on 
my login on PAUSE.

I'd still like to get the ownership worked out, and get the modules in 
the right places, like by-modules (maybe my mirror is out of date??).

David, you are the last contributor to Compress::Bzip2.  Neither of us 
are owners.  My streaming interface looks compatible to yours, only the 
module names are different (I stayed close to Compress::Zlib names).  
How was your luck taking over ownership?

I took Compress::Bzip2 and did a bit more than just putting BZ2_ in 
front of the appropriate functions (so it would compile with bzlib 1.0.2).

It now has similar functionality to Compress::Zlib, with bzopen, bzread, 
bzwrite, bzclose, bzflush, stream io, etc etc.  This was a trick, since 
bzlib doesn't have equivalents that work (properly) so I had to use the 
low level interface.

It's mostly perl xs code.  I also put in a set of about 40 test scripts 
in the cpan style to test everything out.  The test suite passes on 
intel linux (32bit), hpux pa-risc 2.0w (64bit), hpux itanium 64 bit.

I added a set of cover functions, so that it can masquerade as 
Compress:Zlib (ie, gzread, gzwrite, etc etc).  Programs that work with 
Compress::Zlib for the most part need no changes to use (my) 
Compress::Bzip2.

However, I am not the owner of Compress::Bzip2 on the PAUSE server. From 
previous emails, I understand the original author (azemgi) is no longer 
interested in maintaining it (and email is unavailable), and the current 
maintainer (kcarnut) isn't interested in doing more than patching it to 
work with bzlib 1.0.2.

So, I don't think either of them would mind if I took it over.  However, 
I can't raise them by email.

I can either
1. change the name slightly and re-upload it.
or
2. get somebody with admin to make me the new owner.

I don't like 1. cause it will lead to confusion.  It is the only one I 
can do on my own though.
