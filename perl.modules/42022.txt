The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAP::Axis
  DSLIP:       idhOa
  description: Perl bindings to Apache Axis' C++ Libraries
  userid:      BWMCADAMS (Brendan W. McAdams)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    irc.freenode.net, #geronimo axis-dev@ws.apache.org

  similar:
    SOAP::Lite, SOAP::WSDL

  rationale:

    While developing Perl to Java interoperability bindings,
    specifically using SOAP, over the last 2 years, it has become
    continually apparent that a full SOAP implementation does not exist
    in Perl.

    SOAP::Lite lacks, among other things, full WSDL support, or ANY
    support for Complex Types, a major necessity when dealing with
    today's more complicated SOAP Services which are sending and
    receiving objects. The dance needed to get SOAP::Lite to interact
    with Apache Axis, which is the Java standard for SOAP, is appalling.

    SOAP::WSDL, a newer library, appears to solve some of the problems
    but not necessarily all.

    As Apache Axis is the standard for SOAP in Java, and now has a
    stable C++ version which is rapidly becoming a standard in it's own
    segment, it seems only logical to bring full access via Perl to
    utilise these libraries. This means among other things that a
    developer familiar with Axis on Java or C++ will have a much quicker
    learning curve when they move to Perl.

    I have discussed this idea with one of the primary Axis developers,
    Davanum Srinivas, who has also started building some SWIG based
    Python bindings to the C++ Libraries. We've discussed this on and
    off for about a year now, hoping SOAP::Lite or other libraries would
    improve, and it still hasn't occurred.

    A proposal was made on axis-dev@ws.apache.org last february
    (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=axis-dev&m=107590706703743&w=2) -
    no takers existed to start development, but support was offered for
    anyone who chose to get the ball rolling. Having waited over a year
    with the hopes someone more capable would do it, I find the need to
    be overwhelming, and am attempting to take up this helm.

The resulting entry would be:
