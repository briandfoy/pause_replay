I don't know if other modules will migrate to it, but I think
Graphics::Color is a good place to collect things that deal with this
stuff.

Every namespace once only had 6 modules. In general, no level of the
namespace should contain more than one item of categorization. I think
"color" and "utils" should be separate.

I'm not sure what motivated that advice. It seems like an old comment
that doesn't quite stand up to the categorization of over 10,000
packages. :)
