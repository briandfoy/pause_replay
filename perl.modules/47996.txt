Depending upon the context, the term igraph can stand for an
inheritance graph or an interactive graph, and probably a few others.=20
So I would avoid Graph::igraph.  There seems to be an equal mix of the
various naming formats for library bindings, so I used the most
popular for my example- XML::LibXML. There are quite a few others that
are named in similar format (ex. Image::LibRSVG, File::LibMagic,
AI::LibNeural, Net::BitTorrent::LibBTT).   I'm not particularly
attached to anything, so how about I solicit further thoughts on
comp.lang.perl.modules?
