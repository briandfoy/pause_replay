Hi Neil,

Thanks so much for working to clean this stuff up.  Everything should mo=
ve to BPS.

I believe we're in a similar situation with GnuPg-Interface, which shoul=
d, ideally, also all be indexed under BPS.

I'm ok with old releases going away, but have always appreciated having =
the history around. PAUSE really can't cope with having the historical u=
ploads around?
