Okay, that one is nixed.

How so?  I don't use closures that often so maybe I'm missing
something, but it seems to me that there isn't any similarity
at all.  The purpose of my module is to save a few characters.

Instead of:

	sub xyz {
		code
	}

	" some string @{[ xyz(abc) ]} "

You have

	use my_module;
	tie %xyz, 'my_module', 
		sub {
			code
		};

	" some string $xyz{abc} "


Useful if you're going to want to interpolate a function a lot.
Worse that useless otherwize.
