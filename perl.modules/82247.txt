     why:

    I'm contributor to Misterhouse and for that I've developed an
    interface to hardware of the company Plugwise. This is hardware that
    is used for home automation. I have integrated this code in the
    xpl-perl framework of Mark Hindess (beanz).

    Now I'm writing a separate module specifically for the Plugwise
    hardware that is called Device::Plugwise. The idea is that by
    separating the interface from the xpl-perl code, other applications
    can easily make use of the interface code.

    The current (working) code is located on github:
    https://github.com/hollie/xpl-perl/blob/master/lib/xPL/Dock/Plugwise.pm

    The module I'm developing is Dist::Zilla based and will be
    published on github. The placeholder for it is already in place on
    my github account under the name device-plugwise-perl.

    Note that this code is being developed right now, the current
    content of the last repository is only a placeholder.

    So in short: I would like to be able to contribute to CPAN by
    publishing a module that interfaces to Plugwise hardware.

    Kind regards, Lieven.
