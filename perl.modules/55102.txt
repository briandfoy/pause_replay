I talked to them about that and they'll remove the modules that belong
to THALJEF, so those won't be a problem anymore.


Excuse my ignorance of this next part though because I've never been
part of a PAUSE ML: How does someone act as PARROTRE? As far as I can
tell there's not a password for ML so how does PAUSE know? Do they need
to be in list2users or just a co-maintainer with PARROTRE with the
first-come permissions? In that case, how does PARROTRE add future
co-maintainers? I don't see a way for PARROTRE to login to use the
PAUSE menu because it doesn't have a password.
