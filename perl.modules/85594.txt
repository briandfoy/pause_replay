In the last release of Crypt::Cipher, the author has this note:

http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/C/CH/CHIA/Crypt-Cipher-0.03.tar.gz

   This class has now been replaced with L<Text::Cipher>.  For 
   compatability purposes, this class is now an infintesimally thin 
   wrapper around that class.

This distribution is no longer on CPAN, though and it doesn't show up
in the packages file any more.

As such, I've transferred primary maintainership to you. You should try
reindexing the distro:
