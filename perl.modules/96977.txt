Hi,

Exec Summary: am I ok to drop PAUSE permissions on PerlIO::Scalar, =
PerlIO::Via, and VMS::stdio?

I=E2=80=99m writing this wearing my PAUSE admin hat. I=E2=80=99m working =
through clearing up situations where people have permissions on package =
names that only differ in case. Most cases are where people have renamed =
a module, and not dropped the old permissions. Once we=E2=80=99ve =
resolved all these situations, we can tighten up PAUSE, and don=E2=80=99t =
need to have code to deal with various conflict edge cases.

There are three pairs of module names where I=E2=80=99d like to drop the =
permissions on the no-longer-used name, where and if that=E2=80=99s =
possible. One of them is non-trivial.

P5P has first-come permissions on both PerlIO::scalar and =
PerlIO::Scalar. The former is what=E2=80=99s now released with Perl 5 =
(and a bunch of people have co-maint on it as well), and the latter =
appears to have been released between 5.007003 and 5.008 (I=E2=80=99m =
looking at Module::CoreList).

Similarly P5P has first-come on both PerlIO::via and PerlIO::Via. The =
former is what=E2=80=99s in use, and the latter was between 5.007003 and =
5.008.

Question: am I ok to drop the permissions on the no-longer used =
PerlIO::Scalar and PerlIO::Via?

The pair of VMS::stdio and VMS::Stdio is a bit more tricky:

ext/VMS-Stdio/Stdio.pm starts with the expected:

package VMS::Stdio;

but then later on we see:

=
##########################################################################=
######
# Intercept calls to old VMS::stdio package, complain, and hand off
# This will be removed in a future version of VMS::Stdio

package VMS::stdio;

If you look in the CPAN index (02packages), you=E2=80=99ll see that =
it=E2=80=99s the deprecated VMS::stdio that gets indexed.

Questions: Are we enough in the future that VMS::stdio can be dropped? =
And more relevantly for me, am I ok to drop all the permissions on =
VMS::stdio? That would result in VMS::Stdio being indexed for the next =
release, though I don=E2=80=99t think the indexing is that much of an =
issue, since they=E2=80=99re core modules with upstream undef.

Cheers,
Neil
