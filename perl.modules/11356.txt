No it is not. I had no control over its allocation to 'Tied Hash=
 File 
Interfaces'. When I wrote it I did not know what a tie was, so I=
 
doubt I chose that category. Perhaps I thought the name meant=
 Tied or 
Hash or File type Interface!?

Yesterday I searched CPAN for my and Robert's modules, and had=
 great 
difficulty finding them. The major CPAN categories are of course=
 
quite old and, while good in a general sense, are far from=
 perfect.

Today I would probably choose a Text type category, eg Data Type=
 or 
(better) String Lang Text Proc.

Having seen the advent of Robert's module, I think the best=
 course 
would be for me to either:
1) Delete my module permanently, or
2) Delete it under the name X500-DN... and re-enter it under the=
 name 
X500-DN-Parser...

I'm tending towards (1) myself.

Feel free to vote on this.

Very recently, I deleted VCS::CVS in order to encourage people to=
 use 
Leon Brocard's VCS suite of modules.
