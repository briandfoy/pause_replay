SNMP::Multi performs SNMP actions on multiple hosts and aggregates the 
results. It's really damn fast too. It's also been in use for about a 
year-and-a-half, so it's reasonably stable.

You'll probably note that it was placed in the SNMP namespace and not the 
Net::SNMP namespace. Why's this? Well, there are two different SNMP modules 
for perl:

	1. Net::SNMP, the CPAN module, which is all-perl
	2. SNMP, not on CPAN, which is C and Perl.

Further confusing the matter, UCD SNMP is currently available from 
http://www.netsnmp.org/ and http://www.net-snmp.org. Talk about confusing!

SNMP::Multi uses UCD SNMP because it's the faster of the two, hands down.

My inner programmer wants me to call this module Net::SNMP::Multi to indicate 
its place in society but that would further confuse it's familial relations. 
It's a child of SNMP.pm, so it's been named SNMP::Multi.

I'm open to all namespace renaming suggestions. Now that I've read the 
04pause.html and seen my mistake (not asking this mailing list first), I'd be 
quite happy to rename it as appropriate. OTOH, if you agree with me that 
SNMP::Multi is a decent name, please allocate that namespace to CPAN ID 
JOSHUA.

Thanks for the help/advice/aid,
