     why:

    I would like to package SNMP_Simple as an official module. I have
    the author's permission already. He originally wrote it for internal
    use at Sun, but it was then released to the public informally and is
    now used by a few GPL'd projects (Cricket and NMIS to name a couple)
    and would benefit a lot of people if they knew about it.

    It is basically a wrapper around SNMP_Session and SNMP_BER to make
    queries simpler. I will contact those maintainers to see if we could
    just add SNMP_Simple to their project.

    I also have a module that I have written to work Aperto's
    Packetwave product line (www.apertonet.com) that uses Net::Telnet.
    It could probably be another dub-project under Net::Telnet much like
    Net::Telnet::Cisco or Net::Telnet::Netscreen.

    If you need any more information do not hesitate to contact me.
