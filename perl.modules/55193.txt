I think 'leaf' modules (those with no descendants) that always go 
together are in the minority. So for the most part it would be one 
distribution per module.

Its not so much a problem-fix (in the sense that there are alternative 
ways of fixing the problems we have) as it is an enhancement. The goal 
is to let users get just the modules they want (and potentially have a 
much easier time installing just those, see below) and to ease the 
release of bug-fixes.

Certainly. The more modules in a package, the more likely there will be 
problems with external dependencies, the more likely the whole install 
fails. With one distribution per module the majority of Bioperl modules 
would install with no problem.

Creating and maintaining the packages will be an automated process 
relative to the work we already do.

As many distributions as there were changed modules, I suppose.


So, rather than explain the good reasons for doing it, I was more 
interested to discover if there were good reasons /not/ to do this. Anyone?
