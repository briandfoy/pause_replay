That license comes from Sybase, and it looks like the license that the
author has to include to let most of the world use his work. I don't
think this violates the spirit or the letter of CPAN.

There may be a political problem with distribution, but other than that,
CPAN should be agnostic about such matters. That C is for Comprehensive,
after all. :)

The only guidelines CPAN has is that you can't ask for payment for the
use of your code, whether shareware or otherwise.

http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#Does_CPAN_allow_shareware

Beyond that, there are no guidelines for licensing, and I think that
the lack of guidelines is the right way to go.
