Subject: Module submission Samba::LDAP

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Samba::LDAP
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Manage a Samba PDC with an LDAP Backend
  userid:      GHENRY (Gavin Henry)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, #catalyst and module-authors list.

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a port of the smbldap-tools from
    http://www.idealx.org/prj/samba/index.en.html into a CPAN
    distribution and converted into OO Perl.

    The reason for this is I am halfway through a Catalyst Application
    called "SOSA - Samba and Open-xchange Simple Administrator". I don't
    want to have to rely on the commandline tools and what to use OO
    code.

    Open-xchange modules will be coming soon too and SOSA will be GPL
    and hosted in my CPAN directory, if allowed.

    Hence the new namespace Samba::LDAP. As discussed on Perlmonks and
    module-authors, new namespace is best.

    I can't think of a better place than misc, if you can, please
    change.

    Thanks for your time,

    Gavin.
