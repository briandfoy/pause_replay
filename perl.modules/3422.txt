Abraham is lying through his teeth. I have not approved his =
participation. He sent in some code and is over-impatient for me to get =
to look at his potential contribution.
He did this without prior architectural consultation. He is impatient =
because I refused to divert my attention from a paying project on =
deadline.
Not to mention that I have other contributions and bug fixes waiting to =
be added.
My deadline having now passed, I had plans to look at the various things =
submitted by various folks.

Abraham can have his own source tree on CPAN but not under Net::Whois .
He is not part of the team.
