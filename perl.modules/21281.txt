The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JOAP
  DSLIP:       ampOl
  description: Jabber Object Access Protocol (JOAP)
  userid:      EVAN (Evangelo Prodromou)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    joap-perl-dev@jabberstudio.org

  similar:
    Net::Jabber XML::Streams

  rationale:

    There were two reasons I requested using 'JOAP' as the namespace:

    1) In parallel with 'SOAP' and friends. 'JOAP' is at a similar
    level of abstraction as SOAP.

    2) Because JOAP is a fairly large package and has within it some
    deeply-nested module names of its own.

    This package uses Net::Jabber and XML::Streams, but it's not part
    of the distribution of those packages.

  enteredby:   EVAN (Evangelo Prodromou)
  enteredon:   Fri May 23 00:01:22 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

JOAP              ampOl Jabber Object Access Protocol (JOAP)         EVAN
