Subject: Module submission MIDI::Praxis::Variation

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MIDI::Praxis::Variation
  DSLIP:       Rnpfp
  description: Tools for variation technique using MIDI.
  userid:      CBOURNE (Craig Bourne)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    MIDI::Simple

  rationale:

    Brings variation technique, as practiced by composers of many
    styles of music over several hundred years, readily to hand using
    MIDI::Simple as a back end.

    Two companion modules are being prepared for later release:

    MIDI::Praxis::Algorithm -- Leverages MIDI::Praxis::Variation and
    MIDI::Simple for Algorithmic composition. I will publish here some
    of the tools that I have used in the construction of several large
    musical works. Should there be a venue for it, I can also make
    excerpts from these works available online.

    MIDI::Praxis::Voice -- Puts an abstract interface on the problem
    sets of Instrumentation (clearly not a good term to use in an area
    where it now has other denotations), or Orchestration.

  enteredby:   CBOURNE (Craig Bourne)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 22 19:10:35 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MIDI::Praxis::
::Variation       Rnpfp Tools for variation technique using MIDI.    CBOURNE
