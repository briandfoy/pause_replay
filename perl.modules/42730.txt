The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::MyParse
  DSLIP:       bdhOg
  description: Provides access to MySQL's SQL parser
  userid:      PHILIPS (Philip Stoev)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/myparse

  similar:
    SQL::Parser, SQL::Translator::Parser::MySQL

  rationale:

    Basically to the best of my knowledge Perl lacks a good, non-regexp
    SQL parser, so I created a glue module that calls the yyparse()
    function from libmysqld and makes the resulting parse tree available
    as a simple set of objects.

    All the basic SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) are
    supported along with almost all of their MySQL-specific extensions,
    such as multiple-row INSERT, multiple-table DELETE and so on.

    I hope to release the module in a few days, I am currently writing
    up the test suite. In my humble opinion, the functionality already
    available by far surpasses the functionality seen in the other
    available SQL parsing CPAN modules, which only cover a limited
    subset of SQL and/or are regexp-based.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::MyParse         bdhOg Provides access to MySQL's SQL parser        PHILIPS
