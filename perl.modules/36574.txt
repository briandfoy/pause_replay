Subject: Registration of Class::LazyLoader and Graph::Template

To whom it may concern -

    I'd like to register Graph::Template and Class::LazyLoader. I have
uploaded several version of G::T, but never registered. I will be
uploading the first version of C::LL in the next day or two.

Graph::Template is a way of specifying GD graphs using a templating
language similar to Excel::Template and PDF::Template.

Class::LazyLoader is a way of lazyloading objects in a very
non-intrusive fashion. (q.v.
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl/?node_id=409099 for more info on the
concept.) It differs from Object::Realize::Later and Class::LazyObject
in that it requires much less on the part of the developer, plus
allows for classes to be lazyloaded that have made no provision for
the concept. This includes modules like DBI and other venerable CPAN
modules.

Thanks,
Rob Kinyon
