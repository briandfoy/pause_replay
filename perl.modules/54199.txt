The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Arduino::LCD
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perl Interface to the PerLCD Arduino Sketch
  userid:      MONTUORI (Kevin Montuori)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform. Among
    the many things one might want to do with such a device is connect
    an LCD to it and print stuff. This Perl library provides a very high
    level interface for formatting and sending messages to the Arduino
    listener. So what we have is a physical device receiving data from
    the host system to manipulate an LCD.

    Device::Arduino::LCD allows for future devlopment of, say,
    Device::Arduino::AnalogPins or whatever. Further, it doesn't appear
    there's any Arduino-related code on CPAN yet, so there really was no
    precedent.

The resulting entry would be:

Device::Arduino::
