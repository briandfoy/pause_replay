The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::ChooseSubsets
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Iterate through subsets of a list
  userid:      BDUGGAN (Brian Duggan)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Algorithm::ChooseSubsets is a convenient way to iterate through the
    subsets (or "sublists" if you prefer) of a list. I didn't see any
    other modules that provide this functionality, so I'm providing this
    one. For a list of length N, it'll go through either the N choose K
    subsets of size K, or the 2**N subsets of any size.

    I chose the Algorithm::ChooseSubsets namespace because it has a
    similar interface to (though provides different functionality than)
    Algorithm::Permute, and could be used in conjunction with this to
    iterate through all permutations of the subsets of a list.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::ChooseSubsets   adpOp Iterate through subsets of a list            BDUGGAN
