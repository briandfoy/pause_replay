The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::Guess::Educated
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: determine encoding based on language model
  userid:      TOMC (Tom Christiansen)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Encode::Guess Encode::Detect

  rationale:

    Damian suggested E::Infer. Brian liked E::G::Educated, which has
    the advantage of being a three-level name. I donât much care, but
    Brianâs seems cool.

    My approach differs from all existing approaches because it uses a
    language model trained against three different very large
    English-language corpora. It correctly determines the encoding
    between several possible 8-bit encodings where the other modules
    fail miserably.

    I had originally thought to put this under Lingua::EN:: somewhere,
    but Damian convinced me that this was wrong. It is only the fact
    that I use English-language models by default that it works on
    English-language text. There is no reason that the user could not
    supply their own training model for some other language, and have it
    perform commensurately well on the non-English text.

    I will make the mechanism for doing this clearer in the beta
    release.

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::Guess::
::Educated        adpOp determine encoding based on language model   TOMC
