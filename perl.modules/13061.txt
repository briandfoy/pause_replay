    NAME

    Filter::HereDocIndent - Indent here documents

    SYNOPSIS

    use Filter::HereDocIndent; if ($sometest) { print <<'(MYDOC)';
    Melody Starflower Miko (MYDOC) }

    outputs (with text beginning at start of line):

    Melody Starflower Miko

    DEPENDENCIES

    HereDocIndent requires Filter::Util::Call, which is part of the
    standard distribution starting with Perl 5.6.0. For earlier versions
    of Perl you will need to install Filter::Util::Call, which requires
    either a C compiler or a pre-compiled binary.

    DESCRIPTION

    HereDocIndent allows you to indent your here documents along with
    the rest of the code. The contents of the here doc and the ending
    delimiter itself may be indented with any amount of whitespace. Each
    line of content will have the leading whitespace stripped off up to
    the amount of whitespace that the closing delimiter is indented.
    Only whitespace is stripped off the beginning of the line, never any
    other characters For example, in the following code the closing
    delimiter is indented eight spaces: if ($sometest) { print
    <<'(MYDOC)'; Melody Starflower Miko (MYDOC) }

    All of the lines in that example will have the leading eight
    whitespace characters removed, thereby outputting the content at the
    beginning of the line (single space added for email readers): Melody
    Starflower Miko

    If a line is indented more than the closing delimiter, it will be
    indented by the extra amount in the results. For example, this code:

    if ($sometest) { print <<'(MYDOC)'; Melody Starflower Miko (MYDOC)
    }

    produces this output:

    Melody Starflower Miko

    HereDocIndent does not distinguish between different types of
    whitespace. If you indent the closing delimiter with a single tab,
    and the contents eight spaces, each line of content will lose just
    one space character. The best practice is to be consistent in how
    you indent, using just tabs or just spaces. HereDocIndent will only
    remove leading whitespace. If one of the lines of content is not
    indented, the non-whitespace characters will *not* be removed. The
    trailing newline is never removed.
