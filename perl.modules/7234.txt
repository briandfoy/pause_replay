How would one determine if Win32::Registry uses the Win32 API to query
the registry database or if it can read .reg files directly and
reimplements registry API? There are over 100 Win32 modules on CPAN,
all of them require the underlying Win32 API and will not work
otherwise. Why would one assume that some of them might be useful on
the other platforms (and practically useless on win32.)
