The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::RU::Antimat
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Removes Russian slang from a string
  userid:      ILYAS (Ilya Soldatkin)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    newsgroup fido7.ru.perl
    (http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=ru&lr=&safe=off&ic=1&th=bbd7c551a8471495,3
    )

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will remove Russian slang from a string. 'Mat' is
    Russian name for such bad words and that is why this module is
    called Lingua::RU::Antimat. I think it is better than
    Lingua::RU::Antislang because this module is designed to be used in
    Russian programs and for Russians name Antimat is more familiar and
    convenient then Antislang.

    This bad words are problem for chats, guestbooks and forums. I
    began work on this module in February 2001 when I need such thing.
    The first public release of module was made in June 2001. After this
    there were four public version of this module and today the regexp
    that removes slang is 11,962 bytes big. Also in June I have created
    several web-pages (http://www.tcen.ru/antimat) where visitors can
    test this module and read online documentation and my tutorial
    (about how to install, set up Russian locale, and use this module).
    To be sure that this module removes Russian slang correctly I have
    also tested this module on 6 Mb texts of different Russian writers
    (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Bulgakov and others).

    Does somebody need it? I have published this module on different
    Russian free download servers. From June 2001 there were 280
    downloads from http://www.download.ru, 250 downloads from
    http://www.softlist.ru and 120 downloads from
    http://www.webscript.ru.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::RU::
