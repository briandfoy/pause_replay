Hi,

one of the members of Israel.pm - Ariel Brosh - has passed
away a couple of month ago. With Oded Reznik, a previous employer 
and friend of him we have discussed that we should make sure his 
modules on CPAN are going to be in good hands. I volunteered to 
take care of this.

Ariels CPAN id was SCHOP, he had 14 distributions, one of them 
was registered. See    http://search.cpan.org/author/SCHOP

There are two issues:
1) I'd like to keep his CPAN id alive and in his directory 
write a few lines, probably in a README file mentioning that he 
has passed away and that his modules are now maintained by 
other people. How can I do this ? - Naturally I don't know
his password.

2) I'd like to know how can someone take over his modules ? 
Is this only a matter of uploading a higher version to the 
home directory of the new maintainer ?
In the CPAN FAQ there is an entry
"How do I go about maintaining a module when the author is unresponsive?"
but I did not see whom should I contact at CPAN in order to resolve this 
matter in case the original maintainer is not responding....

Once I understand this I'll announce the availability of the modules so 
anyone who is interested will be able to take them over. 
The remaining modules probably I (SZABGAB) will take over temporarily in 
case there are requests for bug fixes and/or to make the next transition 
easier.
