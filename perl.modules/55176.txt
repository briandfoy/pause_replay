[sent to modules@perl.org and Parrot maintainers]


I'm writing some release procedures (as far as they have to deal with
PAUSE) for the Parrot people, and here's the first pass. This really
applies to any mailing list, though.

Comments, suggestions, and corrections appreciated :)

=pod

=head1 Releasing a Parrot distribution through PAUSE

In the parrot distribution, all modules should be owned by the
PARROTRE user in PAUSE. Anyone who has release permissions for parrot
needs to be a member of the PARROTRE group in PAUSE. At the moment,
the only way to edit the list of members in that group is to write to
modules@perl.org and wait for a PAUSE admin to update the list.

=head1 The PAUSE process

=head2 Obtain a personal PAUSE ID

To upload distributions to PAUSE, you need a personal PAUSE login that
identifies you as an individual even if you are doing it for a group.

   https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=request_id

=head2 PAUSE mailing lists

PAUSE has a feature to maintain a module as part of a group, which it
calls a mailing list. To PAUSE, that just means that the primary
contact for the module is a mailing list instead of an individual.
Other than that, the "mailing list" term doesn't have much meaning.
PAUSE does not offer or maintain mailing lists itself.

Mailing lists have a PAUSE ID, but do not have passwords. Since they
do not have passwords, mailing lists cannot upload modules.
Individuals in the mailing list automatically have co-maintainer
permissions on modules the mailing list PAUSE ID owns, and release
managers upload modules under their personal PAUSE ID.

=head2 Add yourself to PARROTRE

You can't really add yourself to the PARROTRE mailing list. Write to
modules@perl.org to tell us that you should be added. This isn't an
automatic process yet because it has been a very infrequent task. If
it becomes a frequent task, that might change.

If you are a member of a PAUSE mailing list, you will have a
"Mailinglists menu" section in your PAUSE menu:

   https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=select_ml_action
   
If you don't have that, you aren't a member of a mailing list yet.
Wait patiently, then ping modules@perl.org to ensure we got the
message.

=head2 Uploading the distribution

You cannot upload the distribution as PARROTRE. Ensure that you are a
member of PARROTRE, then upload the distribution under your personal
PAUSE ID. PAUSE will recognize you as a member of PARROTRE and will
treat you as a co-maintainer of all PARROTRE-owned modules.

   https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri
   
=head2 Unauthorized distributions

PAUSE allows you to upload any module you like, even if someone else
owns it. However, the PAUSE indexer will mark your entire distribution
as "Unauthorized" if you do not have the proper permissions on every
module in it. CPAN tools will not install unauthorized distributions.

If you find that the indexer finds unauthorized modules,

=head2 Including a new module in the Parrot distribution

If you're the parrot release manager and there are new modules in the
distribution, upload the distribution normally under your own ID.
PAUSE will detect the new modules and give your personal ID ownership
of the modules. It's your job to transfer those modules to PARROTRE.
This does not affect the distribution you just uploaded, but it allows
the next uploader to supercede them.

To transfer permissions, go to the "Change Permissions" page in PAUSE
and select the new modules in "2. You are primary maintainer". You can
select multiple modules at the same time. Once selected, choose "2.1
Pass primary maintainership status to somebody else (giving it up at
the same time)". In the next form page, pass the primary
maintainership to PARROTRE.

   https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms
   
=head2 Checking the distribution

Once PAUSE indexes the distribution, it will send you a report if it
encounters any errors. If you don't have the correct permission for
any of the modules in the distribution, PAUSE marks the entire
distribution as "Unauthorized". Fix the permissions on the modules
PAUSE complains about. If you need help, write to modules@perl.org.
