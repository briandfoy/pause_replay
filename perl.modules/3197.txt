Hello folks,

I am working on a perl module to read/write ID3 tags of mp3 files. I know that there exists already
two projects to do this, but I didn't like the approach of them, and both are not able to
the things I expect from a mp3-tag module.

So I write my own module, which I would like to register at CPAN. At the moment it can be
found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tagged .

The latest version allows read/write access of ID3v1/ID3v1.1/ID3v2.3 tags, and comes with pod 
documentation and a Makefile.PL (by ExtUtils::MakeMaker).

My name is Thomas Geffert and I can be reached at thg@users.sourceforge.net and I would prefer
the CPAN user-ID thogee .

=====================================================================

Module name: MP3::Tag , together with MP3::TAG::ID3v1, MP3::TAG::ID3v2 
                        and hopefully others to follow
DSLI-Entry: bmpO
Description: Read, write & change ID3v1/v1.1/v2.3 tags of mp3 files

=====================================================================

I hope, that is information is sufficient, otherwise do not hesitate to send me an email.

Looking forwad to hear from you,

  kind regards

   Thomas Geffert
