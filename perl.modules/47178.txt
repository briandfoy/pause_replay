Hi,

You may have seen mention of "vanillaPerl" after Adam Kennedy's recent
beer reward/challenge
( see http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/28427 )

It's a simple distribution for MS Windows which bundles perl, gcc and
some other tools required to get perl running on windows, and able to
install XS modules using CPAN.pm

I plan on making a new version available as each new version of perl
is released (both stable and blead).
Because of the large filesize of the actual installers (>15MB), would
cpan be suitable for distribution? (If not, I'd probably just register
another project at sf.net)

I also plan on bundling the documentation and scripts required for
anyone to build this distribution. I'd like to make this available
through cpan, and hopefully available through a "distributions" search
on search.cpan.org
I have named the package file vanillaPerl5.8.7.tar.gz
I have created a file named vanillaPerl.pod and a README file in the
top-level of the package.
Would this be sufficient for the cpan indexer to list the package?

I initially named the project "vanillaPerl" because it only bundles
core modules.
Any suggestions for a more appropriate name would be considered.

Regards,
Carl
