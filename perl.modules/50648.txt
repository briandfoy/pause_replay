The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::TableXT
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Utility module based on PDF::API2 for tables
  userid:      OMEGA (Десислав Каменов)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    cpan dorums

  similar:
    PDF::Table

  rationale:

    The PDF::Table Module by Daemmon Hughes is abandoned. He is not
    answering my e-mails (maybe he changed his job). I am willing to
    develop further the module and release new version but i don`t have
    rights to upload into his namespace. I fixed the reported bugs and
    some additional that found into the code itself. I made some
    optimization and added new functionality. Currently I am developing
    user defined table header and spanning them to new pages created by
    the module. I would appreciate if i you give me write permissions to
    PDF::Table namespace instead of creating this one but if you approve
    it i will develop it further. With kind Regards D.Kamenov

PDF::
