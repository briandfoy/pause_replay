     why:

    I have a wrapper interface for the DBI module.

    This wrapper interface is intended to reduce the amount of code
    needed to use DBI;

    This is accomplished via a number of tricks.

    1. the code wraps both the prepare and execute statements within
    subroutines. 2. returning data structures of predetermined types. 3.
    providing an error logging interface 4. reducing the number of
    variables needed to interact with DBI

    Example Methods from the existing module: my $DSN="DSN string
    here"; my $db=DBIx::NOT_Yet_NAmed->connect($DSN);

    to return the first row of the first column of an sql statement: my
    $var=$db->sql_sec("some sql statement for
    prepare",list_of_args_for_execute);

    Example of what is needed to do this with DBI now. my
    $dbh=DBI->connect($DSN); $sth = $dbh->prepare("some sql statement
    for prepare"); $sth->execute(list_of_args_for_execute); $ref =
    $sth->fetchrow_arrayref; $var=$ref->[0];

    The module I am developing currently has several other interfaces
    that greatly reduce the amount of code need to work with DBI;

    I have not found anything similar to my code in the existing CPAN
    site. Friends and co-workers have suggested that I contribute this
    module to CPAN, and I would like to do so.

    Thank you for your time, and I look forward to sharing my work with
    others.
