Hi,

I have written a module based upon the popular
HTML::Template module.  My module, which I plan to
call TextPage::Template adds pagination, headers,
footers, field-level formatting, and more for plain
text pages, but uses the HTML::Template philosophy and
methods to allow dynamic data to be inserted into a
paginated text document.  I include a method in my
module for sending the resulting output to a PDF file
and plan to implement future enhancements that will
allow pixel or point level placement of the templated
text elements to facilitate precise placement of text
over an image (form) background (overlay) for output
to pdf and postscript printers.

I am concerned about a particular element of my
design.  I like to utilize a package global variable
to store and retrieve a reference to my Config object.
 This way, I only need to instantiate the Config
object once and can conveniently refer to it from
within other modules.  It also seems to me to be sort
of a Singleton pattern implementation, so I don't have
multiple Config objects floating around.

However, the PAUSE upload guidelines state:
"Avoid keeping any state information in your packages.
It makes it difficult for multiple other packages to
use yours. Keep state information in objects."

Is creating a package global reference to my Config
object (which contains data based upon values
determined at runtime) a violation of this guideline? 
Is there a better practice to achieve what I want?

Thanks.

Bill
