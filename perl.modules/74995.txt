The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::CouchDB
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: An object-oriented interface to CouchDB
  userid:      MNF (Mark Norman Francis)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Store::CouchDB AnyEvent::CouchDB DB::CouchDB CouchDB::Simple

  rationale:

    First, why another Couch module? AnyEvent::CouchDB is non-blocking
    (I wanted blocking); DB::CouchDB seems abandoned and Store::CouchDB
    and CouchDB::Simple seem to be simple wrappers. I wanted something a
    little more.

    Why Net::? Well, primarily because I can't think of what else to
    call it. But seriously, I access my CouchDB over the internet rather
    than having it on the local machine, so in my head it seems like a
    Net service. Plus, whilst it is a database, it is always accessed
    using the RESTian interface, and Net:: contains other modules that
    talk to RESTian services.

  enteredby:   MNF (Mark Norman Francis)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar  3 00:32:49 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::CouchDB         adpOp An object-oriented interface to CouchDB      MNF
