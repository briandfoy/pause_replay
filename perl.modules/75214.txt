Subject: Module submission DBIx::Migration::Classes

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Migration::Classes
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Class based migrations for DBI databases
  userid:      KITOMER (Tom Kirchner)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::Migration

  rationale:

    This module makes it possible to define database schema migrations
    in the form of perl classes and perform migrations of DBI databases
    based on these change classes. A migration class contains the name
    of the previous change class (if any) and a method for registering
    changes in the change manager. Currently this module is in its
    testing phase and contains the minimal functionality to be useful
    for simple projects. Further development (e.g. data security
    features etc.) are planned.

  enteredon:   Thu Mar 17 17:27:39 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::Migration::
::Classes         bdpOp Class based migrations for DBI databases     KITOMER
