There seems to be an issue with the source file itself. Even if I load  
the
source http://search.cpan.org/src/AERO/Date-Korean-0.0.1/lib/Date/Korean.pm
into my browser, where as the source for Date::Japanese::Era displays  
OK.

Downloading the source file and loading it into an editor like  
SubEthaEdit
fails also when I tell it to interpret the file as utf-8

The reason for it is historic, but the encoding does not have to be  
utf-8 to support
multi-lingual characters. Any character not in iso-8859-1 is encoded,  
for
example  &#26157;
