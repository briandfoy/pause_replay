Rafael, thanks for your willingness to take over maintenance of the
module. I've given you co-maintenance permissions as there's been no
release from David in the past two years and no answer to your bug
report in several months. Please make sure you read
http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover thoroughly. It's our
policy on this kind of situation.

David, please note that nothing is being taken away from you. Should you
choose to fix the issues yourself or object on any grounds, rest assured
that this is a reversible process.

Rafael, this ticket is only four weeks old. While unlikely (the last
release was two years ago), it could be that Benjamin is simply on
vacation or otherwise hindered. Unless he responds to this, please try
to contact Benjamin by other means keeping modules@perl.org in CC and
wait for some more time.

Benjamin, if you read this, please have a look at what Rafael and I
wrote above. Would you consider passing on maintenance to Rafael or
releasing a new version yourself? I'm confident he would take good care
of your module.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
