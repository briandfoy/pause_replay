PDL Developers and Users-

We're in the final stages of pre-release
testing for PDL-2.4.4.  Currently
PDL-2.4.3_04 is on CPAN and PDL-2.4.3_05
will be uploaded this evening with the final
code changes for this release.

Assuming PDL-2.4.3_05 has no regressions
from the pre-release 4 candidate
(PDL-2.4.3_04) in testing now, we will be
releasing PDL-2.4.4 as soon as some module
maintenance permissions details are ironed
out.

I invite you all to try the latest release
candidates at this time.  Questions and
other feedback that can be used to document
the release are especially welcome.

Developers, get your final testing and
doc edits in now!

Thanks much,
Chris Marshall
   for the PDL developers
