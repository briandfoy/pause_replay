The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Synchrony
  DSLIP:       anpOp
  description: Test identity of categorical arrays
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Offers descriptive statistics and statistical tests relevant to the
    matching, or "synchrony," of identity between one or more "response"
    datasets to a criterion "target" dataset. Implements the Greville
    method for taking account of the independent or dependent sampling
    of the criterion dataset, and the variable probabilities of each
    state in the criterion dataset being actualized. Shifts of
    response-target identity over their indices are supported (not only
    testing for, say, a match of the same alternative at trial 1 in the
    target and response datasets, but also, say, target #2 and response
    #1); and also a test for periodic synchrony over these shifts of
    indices (using Math::FFT). The wide range of possible tests for
    categorical data of this type are rarely represented, as a whole, in
    statistical texts, and the module offers a convenient integration of
    these tests.

The resulting entry would be:
