If your looking for a unique and affordable gift (some items only $5) for
the holidays or other occasion for business associates, employees, family
or friends, look no further if you (or they) like piano or instrumental
music!  Consider giving a business or personal gift (with a perceived value
of $15-$17) of a one hour CD by Denise B...  This relatively new recording
artist, (formerly a business, tax, and Quickbooks software consultant) has
4 CDs, all with relaxing, stress-relieving music.  Individuals and
businesses all over the world are ordering 10 or more copies at a time
after hearing the music!  What's the buzz about?  Listen at Denise's
website by double-clicking on the CD covers to listen to song samples and
you will find out!  One favorite of many customers is "the lighthouse CD,"
(Lakeside Dreaming). Listen to song samples at: www.deniseb.net.  

To view or print an online "brochure" with all the details for business
gifts, including pricing, and how you can customize the CDs with YOUR
business name & contact information, go online to

be accessed directly at this time, and is not viewable from the website
main menu options or navigation bar at this time, so save this email if you
wish to go back to the online brochure information.)

If you don't have any interest in this music, Denise is passing along some
YEAR-END TAX TIPS (NOT TO BE CONSIDERED TAX ADVICE, HOWEVER!)  The tax tips
include some tax information and changes from the 2003 Tax Act.   There is
still that little bit of accountant in her that doesn't want to be totally
swallowed up by the music! Tax Tips can be viewed directly at
http://www.deniseb.net/2003taxtips.pdf.
