i think "Nord" may be too general for a top-level namespace.  most
uses of it in the world do not have anything to do with musical
instruments.

typically, hardware interfaces go into Device::*, although i do
not have a problem with a Clavia:: namespace, since they have
many other devices which might end up with Perl modules.
