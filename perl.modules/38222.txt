I reindexed a few of the Tk modules, and still no success. Without 
knowing much about the details of what is going on behind the scenes, I 
had guessed that it might have something to do with my directory being 
named RCS (my initials). There are some programs that ignore 
RCS|SCCS|CVS  directories -- MakeMaker among them., and I thought it 
might have been something like that.

As an aside, I find it slightly curious that the CPAN module Rcs is 
cased as it is, instead of RCS. This is probably just a coincidence, 
though...

Thanks for the assistance,

Rob
