I should clarify -- yes the next uploader will get first-come, as if no one
had ever had that namespace before. But please don't do that for namespaces
that are attached to legitimate modules that people might still be using!
No signal is given that you are no longer interested in the modules -- so
people may still file a bug against the module and not have any idea that
no one is listening. A more friendly thing for the community would be to
turn over permissions to ADOPTME or HANDOFF, as described in
http://neilb.org/2013/08/07/adoptme.html.
