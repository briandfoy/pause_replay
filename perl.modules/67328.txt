Years ago I tried to suggest a language tag for META.yml but it was
not appreciated then, so let's see what we have instead now.

When a module has a "provides" key in the META.yml which references an
empty hash then the indexing is disabled. The user gets a mail that
contains text like this:

                   User: DAVINCHI (Pavel Boldin)
      Distribution file: SQL-Filter-0.014.tar.gz
        Number of files: 10
             *.pm files: 1
                 README: SQL-Filter-0.014/README
               META.yml: SQL-Filter-0.014/META.yml
            YAML-Parser: YAML::XS 0.32
      META-driven index: yes

    Nothing in this distro has been
                         indexed, because according to META.yml this
                         package does not provide any modules.

This might be appropriate for immediate use. I see nothing else that
is ready to use without a code change.

I'm quite a bit behind on all my projects, so you better don't count
on me doing some actual work. But PAUSE is of course open for you.

Maybe you can persuade the perl6 authors to do some tiny bit of
homework in their distros so that we do not have to start with
heuristics again? I'd recommend working with heuristics only if some
better solutions have been tried and have failed.
