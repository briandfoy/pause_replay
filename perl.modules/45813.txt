The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IP::Anonymous
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Port of Crypto-PAn to anonymize IP addresses
  userid:      JTK (John Kristoff)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace choice was suggested by Adam Kennedy after I
    provided a brief introduction to the module and solicited input on
    modules@perl.org.

    From what I can determine, I have not found any module that
    performs the same sort of functionality as this one. There are
    modules that work on IP addresses and these have been in both IP::
    and Net:: names spaces.

  enteredby:   JTK (John Kristoff)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov  9 21:03:20 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IP::
::Anonymous       Rdpfp Port of Crypto-PAn to anonymize IP addresses JTK
