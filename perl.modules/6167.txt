The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Test
  DSLIP:       idpOa
  description: Web application regression testing framework
  userid:      RAM (Raphael Manfredi)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    CGI::Test

  rationale:

    HTTP::Test will extend CGI::Test, but will perform testing via
    HTTP, not by launching a CGI program manually. This will be testing
    in-situ, and will not be limited to testing CGI programs.

    The name HTTP::Test is very similar on purpose to what exists in
    the Java world, namely the HTTPTest tessting framework that can be
    found on jakarta.apache.org.

    It's similar because it will proceed with the same logic, as
    experimented with CGI::Test (I swear, I did not know about HTTPTest
    before I wrote CGI::Test, because I had no business with Java by
    then).

The resulting entry would be:
