The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::HTML5::Sanity
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Make HTML5 DOM trees less insane
  userid:      TOBYINK (Toby Inkster)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Document Object Model (DOM) generated by HTML::HTML5::Parser
    meets the requirements of the HTML5 spec, but will probably catch a
    lot of people by surprise.

    The main oddity is that elements and attributes which appear to be
    namespaced are not really. For example, the following element:

    <div xml:lang="fr">...</div>

    Looks like it should be parsed so that it has an attribute "lang"
    in the XML namespace. Not so. It will really be parsed as having the
    attribute "xml:lang" in the null namespace.

    HTML::HTML5::Sanity makes the HTML5 DOM more intuitive.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::HTML5::
::Sanity          adpfp Make HTML5 DOM trees less insane             TOBYINK
