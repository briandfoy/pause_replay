Generally speaking, you're much more likely to get useful feedback if 
you post to the module-authors list or blog about it. modules@perl.org 
is mostly an administrative list of PAUSE admins and we're spread a bit 
thin.

Technically, any lower-case name needs approval from perl5-porters since 
they're reserved for use by the core. Ignoring this issue (you could 
always ucfirst):

Makes some sense, but I'd say it's not specific enough.

I'd say both of these make a sense.

Hmm, you're not really compiling as such, so...

I think that's bound to confuse people greatly.
