The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PostScript::File
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: PostScript File creation with debug support
  userid:      CPWILLMOT (Christopher Willmot)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Originally tried to use PostScript::Simple as a base class, but was
    repeatedly unable to reach him. Many adjustments required, so I
    decided to write my own base class.

    It provides the outline for both PS and EPS files according to
    Adobe's documentation, with functions for adding data into each
    section.

    Optional routines are available for debugging postscript code
    during development.

    The next phase is using this as a base for PostScript::Chart - an
    easy way of printing graphs, which will be used by my stock analysis
    modules also on the way.

The resulting entry would be:

PostScript::
