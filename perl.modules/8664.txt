Hello,

Is it true that frozen files created by Storable are not compatible from
version to version of the module?

I have been getting this in my web server log:

[Wed Nov  7 07:33:05 2001] [error] Storable object version 1.012 does not
match $Storable::VERSION 1.013 at
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/i386-freebsd/Storable.pm line 127.

[Wed Nov  7 07:33:05 2001] [notice] child pid 12665 exit signal
Segmentation fault (11)

....

I did not manually update Storable; it must have happened as some
dependency thing via CPAN.

I searched the Storable docs (and google) but found no mention of the fact
that files created by Storable might become unusable.

Thanks,

nick
