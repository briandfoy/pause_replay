The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Rcs::Parser
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Parse and analyze RCS files.
  userid:      BENNIE (Phillip Pollard)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Email, IRC, work.

  similar:
    Rcs Rcs::Agent VCS::Rcs::Parser

  rationale:

    Rcs::Parser is designed to directly parse RCS files with the goal
    to be able to perform analyzation of code via methods such as
    notate() which is currently implemented.

    Rcs, Rcs::Agent, and VCS::Rcs::Parser all attempt to emulate the
    ability to retrieve data from RCS files. Rcs and Rcs::Agent rely
    directly upon rcs binaries to do their work. VCS::Rcs::Parser uses
    YaPP. In all cases the modules never directly parse the data or
    allow any access to perform analyzation.

    Since this module directly parses the Rcs data as opposed to giving
    an interface similar to other binary utilities, I opted to call it
    'Parser' as per the precedence set by other modules on CPAN. And Rcs
    is the logical choice for tree location.

    For reference, it is 'Rcs' and not 'RCS' because any directory
    called 'RCS' stands a chance of being ignored by version control
    software or other developer utilities.

The resulting entry would be:

Rcs::
::Parser          adpOg Parse and analyze RCS files.                 BENNIE
