The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::SoundChange
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: Apply regular sound changes to words
  userid:      PNE (Philip Newton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules (briefly)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Lingua:: appears to be the most logical choice for me since this
    module deals with languages, not simply arbitrary text. A quick
    question in clp.modules brought one response which agreed with that
    choice.

    This module takes a list of sound changes (rules) and can apply
    them to many words. This can be used, for example, to derive a
    daughter language from its parent language through the process of
    regular sound change, or to try out Grimm's Law or see the effects
    of the Great Vowel Shift.

    The module was inspired by, and at the moment includes some code
    from the reference implementation of, Mark Rosenfelder's Sound
    Change Applier at http://www.zompist.com/sounds.htm .

    I'm not completely sure about the licence yet, because Mark doesn't
    want his sample code to be used commercially. However, I think I can
    minimise the code derived from the sample and then licence it
    myself, probably in BSD-style terms.

    There is an existing Perl implementation of Mark's Sound Change
    Applier, but when I contacted the author, he said that he had not
    distributed it. In any event, it was a stand-alone script, and I
    feel that a module will be useful, possibly with a wrapper
    distributed that will emulate Mark's 'sounds' program

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
::SoundChange     adpOb Apply regular sound changes to words         PNE
