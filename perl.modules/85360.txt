Well, given everybody on this list apparently had the same misunderstanding,
I think it probably needs a different name.

Am I right that you're trying to create something where -

  package Foo;
  use Some::Thing;

is equivalent to

  package Foo;
  $INC{"Foo.pm"} = __FILE__;

?

The last time I implemented that I called it register_inc_entry() and made it
a subroutine exported by my class builder.

I eventually went back to writing it by hand, because I pretty much only use
it in testing code and I prefer that to be as simple/obvious as possible.

Perhaps Inlined::Package or something similar would be appropriate as a name?
