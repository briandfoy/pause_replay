The other untainting module stringifies everything (but doesn't need a C
compiler), so I there is no real 1-1 correspondence.

Is utf8 going to go away, after it has just been added? If you mean the
just-recently-documented utf8_upgrade (et al.) functions will go away, I
have no problems with that and will replace it with my own.

However, since the functionality to do utf8/iso88591 conversion has just
been removed from perl (was still there in 5.6, removed in the repository)
to make room for modules implementing it, I don't think the need for
(something like) Convert::Scalar will go away soon.
