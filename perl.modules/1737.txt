Its a hard problem (I think someone said the hardest problem left in
computer science is naming things). I don't know the right answer either -
so your help is useful. 

I do see it as a slight barrier to entry that you
can't come up with a new application (that isn't necessarily a module - I
don't particularly consider AXDTK to be a module - it's more of an
application) and just upload it to CPAN. Of course you can, without
conferring with modules@perl.org - and CPAN will just accept it. So I
could potentially just ignore you ;-) Seriously though, I think I might
rename it anyway - 5 sylables is almost instant death for a cool
project. So I'm trying to reduce it to 2... So I'm back to "naming
things" again... *sigh*
