Hi

This is consistently failing.  I cannot see why it thinks I do not have 
permission for the package Mustache::Simple.

Although it still uploads onto cpan.org and is searchable with 
search.cpan.org (when it's working), it is not updating 
http://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt which means that my 
packages do not appear on metacpan.

Please let me know how to fix this.

Regards,
Cliff.
