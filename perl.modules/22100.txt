The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::ReportBox
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Display of reports
  userid:      LAWGON (Kenneth Gonsalves)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    none known to me

  rationale:

    Reports are very often created as text files using formats. These
    files are then displayed in a window. The ReportBox displays the
    text file either as a readonly text object or in a listbox, where
    the items in the list may be selected for further manipulating. The
    widget also has buttons for printing and saving the report under a
    new file name. This is a very simple widget, but i have found that
    it saves a lot of time for the programmer.

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::ReportBox       RdpOp Display of reports                           LAWGON
