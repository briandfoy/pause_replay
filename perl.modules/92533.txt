Hello Andreas,

i seem to have got myself into an upper/lowercase mess.
I while ago we renamed Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch (big S) to
Catmandu::Store::Elasticsearch (small s). This has led to all kinds of 
cpan indexing troubles. In an effort to fix this i deleted all the
Catmandu::Store::ElasticSearch files and accompanying rights (i was the 
primary on these modules), but in the process i seem to have also lost 
the rights to the Catmandu::Store::Elasticsearch namespace.

Basically we didn't realise at the time that there are issues with case 
insensitivity and cpan.
Do you know a way to fix our mess?

I included Patrick Hochstenbach in CC as he still has his co-maintainer 
rights.
His cpan handle is HOCHSTEN, mine is NICS.

Regards,

Nicolas
