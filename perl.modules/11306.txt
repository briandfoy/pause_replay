The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::JavaScript::LiteObject
  DSLIP:       Rdpfo
  description: lightweight data dumping to JavaScript
  userid:      JPIERCE (Jerrad Pierce)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::JavaScript

  rationale:

    It is similar to Data::JavaScript but lighter weight. It is unique
    in lighter weight in that the output is much denser and more terse
    that of Data::JavaScript, at the expense of being less robust.

    DESCRIPTION This module was inspired by the Data::JavaScript
    manpage, which while incredibly versatile, seems rather brute force
    and inelegant for certain forms of data. Specifically a series of
    objects of the same class, which it seems is a likely use for this
    kind of feature. So this module was created to provide a lightweight
    means of producing configurable, clean and compact output.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::JavaScript::
::LiteObject      Rdpfo lightweight data dumping to JavaScript       JPIERCE
