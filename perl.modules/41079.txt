The following is my reading of the logfiles, please let me know if I'm
missing something.

Your first upload of Nmap-Scanner-0.8.tar.gz was 26/Apr/2005:16:21:09
(local time). At 16:24:12 you reindexed it. And at 16:26:27 you
deleted it. An email was sent to you about your request to delete the
file.

Around 16:55 the indexer indexed your file.

On 2005-04-29 21:29:13 (localtime) it was deleted with the usual delay
between delete-request and actual deletion.

Regards,
