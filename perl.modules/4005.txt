This RFC is concerned mainly with what to name my modules so that they fit
into the appropriate name-spaces.  Any help is appreciated.  Also, when
one has a set of related modules, should I have a separate RFC letter for
each, or one for all?

I was trying to be brief with my email without bogging down in details;
those were in the ReadMe and POD.

To my knowledge, all of my modules are
unique; some have functionality that nothing else on CPAN that I could
find have, and those with common functionality are implemented differently
and/or have different interfaces, making them more useful in some cases.

In the latter case, I made these because I enjoy them better than the
alternatives, and I made them as "flexible" as possible while filling that
role for the express purpose of being useful to more people than myself.
Likewise, I try to make them as independant from each other as possible,
so if you want to use one but not another, it is easier to do so.

These are very valid concerns.  And in fact I would like to have different
names for the CGI::* modules, but my previous questions to the modules
list were unanswered.

I put them in CGI:: for now because the
higher-level modules that made use of them are web/cgi related.  In fact,
HashOfArrays is a semi-generic data structure, SequentialFile and
EventCountFile are semi-generic file interfaces.  WebUserIO is
specifically for the web, however, although I question calling it "CGI"
because it also works under mod_perl (but CGI first).

Now, the CGI::WPM::Globals and CGI::WPM::Base are the cornerstones of a
specific methodology that makes embeddable modules out of web
applications.  All of the other CGI::WPM::* modules are examples of
applets that use the methodology.  Whereas, everything outside of
CGI::WPM:: is not tied to this methodology and can be used in very
different ways; that is why they were kept out of CGI::WPM::
(Incidentally, Globals inherits from CGI::WebUserIO and HTML::PageMaker,
so their functionality is part of its functionality.)
