Request to register new user

fullname: Tom Jones
  userid: TOMGJONES
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Initially to contribute an elliptic curve module.

    BTW http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules doesn't seem
    to have any archives newer than March, so I can't check progress.

    The reason I'm resubmitting since yesterday is that I think I
    requested an ID that didn't match [A-Z]. Although the thing
    processing the web form submission didn't throw an error.
