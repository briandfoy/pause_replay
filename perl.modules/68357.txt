Net:: has nothing to do with it since you're not implementing a
low-level network protocol (I don't think).

"Parent" is a bit weird too because you don't need a fork to have a
parent, as in "parent commit". You need more context.

Is this something that would be useful outside of GitHub? Are you
screen scraping or doing something special with git?

I think a name might be Github::Fork::Parent, if this is only for
Github.
