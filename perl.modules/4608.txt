Hello,

I would like to register for a PAUSE username. I have developed a couple of
modules and am working on one now that I think would be useful to the perl
community. Here is some information..

Name: Simon Flack
Email Address: perl@simonflack.com
HomePage: http://www.sharedknowledge.net
Preferred UserID: SIMON-FLK

Planned Contributions: Object-Oriented tools for managing DNS zones, several
Win32 admin modules. Plus many more in the works...

I am working on the DNS module at the moment, possible NameSpace:
DNS::ZoneTools. - Development Stage : mid.

I am a regular user of Perlmonks.org (monk_name : $code or die) and plan to
write a node there discussing my modules. You can see my homenode at
http://www.perlmonks.com/index.pl?node_id=34584


Thanks
Simon Flack
