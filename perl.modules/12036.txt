Hello,

I would like to register as a CPAN developer. Here's my information:

Name:            Brad Cavanagh
Email address:   b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu
Homepage:        n/a
Preferred ID:    BRADC (first choice) or BCAVANAGH

I am currently working on some astronomy-related modules that I would
like to upload to CPAN when they're ready.

Cheers,
 Brad.
