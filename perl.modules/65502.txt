Hi, Dennis,

Long time since I last emailed you, how you are well.

I have a little problem with the CPAN permissions for one of the modules th=
at was
included in POE::Component::IRC, namely POE::Filter::IRC

Whilst PoCo-IRC itself got transferred over to me so I could assign co-main=
t rights to
other people, POE::Filter::IRC didn't seem to get included with this.

Could you please login to PAUSE and change the permissions for this so I ca=
n assign=20
co-maint to other people?

I'm copying in the pause admins as an audit trail.

Many thanks,

--=20
