Hi,

I'd like to upload the following modules to CPAN over the next few days.
There are some changes in the names of modules I have already registered.

1 Tie::SecretHash - Serializable tied hashes (and objects based on hashes)
  with transparently encrypted fields.

2 Crypt::Key - A generic cryptographic key. (Crypt::Keys is registered under
  my name, but the module has a singular Key.  Sorry.)

3 Crypt::Primes - Implements Ueli Maurer's prime generation algorithm.

4 Crypt::Elgamal - Implementation of Elgamal public-key encryption algorithm.
  Again, Crypt::ElGamal is registered under my name but it has incorrect
  capitalization.  This one is not my fault though since all instances of his
  name I have seen were spelled "ElGamal".  I got a mail from someone who
  works with him pointing out the incorrect capitalization.

5 Math::Fibonacci - A fast algorithm for computing the Fibonacci sequence.
  Contains other related functions.

6 Mail::Internet::Extensions - Some extensions to Mail::Internet. I sent
  you a mail regarding this a few weeks back but DUL refused to accept it.
  I'd CCed Graham Barr (author of Mail::Internet) who said it was fine
  with him if I uploaded this module.

best regards,
vipul.
