Thanks Arthur for your offer, it is highly appreciated. Welcome!

I've subscribed you to modules@perl.org and made you admin on PAUSE.
Feel free to try out all menus you are seeing now. I believe the forms
are all self-explaining and if not, feel free to ask. I'm sorry, we
still have no "Admin On Pause FAQ". Maybe now's the time to write it.
If you could provide the questions that now arise for you, I'd like to
provide the answers and integrate the resulting page into Pause.
