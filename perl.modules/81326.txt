The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Walk::Clone
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: deep data cloning with boundaries
  userid:      JANDREW (Jed Lund)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://prepan.org/module/429En4oFc3,
    https://github.com/jandrew/Data-Walk-Extracted

  similar:
    Storable

  rationale:

    The namespace was selected to be consistent with the other
    registered names in the Data::Walk::Extracted package.

    There are two elements that are unique with this object. First,
    this method allows for the deep cloning boundaries to be defined
    with keyword matches restricted to specific locations. Second, it is
    built as a Moose Role and can be mixed in with other Moose objects.
    Specifically it is intended to add deep cloning functionality to the
    Data::Walk::Extracted package.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Walk::
::Clone           bdpOp deep data cloning with boundaries            JANDREW
