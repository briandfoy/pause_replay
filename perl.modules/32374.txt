The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Regexp::Genex
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: generate regex matching strings with a regex
  userid:      BOWMANBS (Brad Bowman)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    a little: http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=286981

  similar:
    String::Random

  rationale:

    The module offers useful and unique (as far as I know)
    functionality. But as the approach is a bit flaky, I'm not sure
    whether it warrants module list inclusion (or what that means).

    I submitted about this module previously but was very slow moving
    about uploading code. It's there now

  enteredby:   BOWMANBS (Brad Bowman)
  enteredon:   Sat May 29 12:30:19 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Regexp::
::Genex           adpfp generate regex matching strings with a regex BOWMANBS
