1) A bad decision doesn't excuse a new one, besides I thought LPR is an=20=

actual protocol?

2) Yes, and that could be Net::IPP

3) Yes, but even if it wasn't would Local::CUPS be a better name?

I can't find a better suited place that exists, maybe it should be time=20=

to introduce Printing::CUPS ?

If no one else thinks a new namespace is a good thing, then I guess we=20=

skip it. So no responses in a few days and I will ok Net::CUPS.
