Description of what I would like to contribute initially:

A pod to LyX ( www.lyx.org ) format converter. This will include:

1) A Pod::Lyx class based off of Pod::Parser that will do the work of
converting a pod file to a LyX file. 

2) pod2lyx script as a CLI to Pod::Parser 

DSLI entry: Pod::Lyx adpO A pod to LyX format conversion class

Where this has been discussed:
The little discussion I have done about this was done with private
e-mail and on the mailing list 
lyx-users@lists.lyx.org and lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org. From the feedback I
got there were a few people interested in this. Also some people were
interested in a lyx2pod type of package which I may do in the future. 
Oh the above mailing lists can be viewed at
http://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-users@lists.lyx.org/ and 
http://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org/

Also I noticed that in the perltodo there was a reference to wanting a
list archive www.mail-archive.com archives most of the perl related
mailing lists.

Later
Richard Jackson
