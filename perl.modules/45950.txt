     why:

    A Pdf creation module for Win32 (currently) that has built in
    tables, embedded TTF Fonts, Unicode support, and several image
    formats including PNG with alpha and JPG. The module supports all of
    the native Adobe Fonts and includes a very simple and easy to use
    syntax and very feature rich set of drawing, text and image
    operators. Creating high quality Pdf reports is fast and easy with
    this module. It is written in pure perl and only requires
    Compress::Zlib.
