It seesm that there is almost nothing on CPAN that interacts with CVS. 
Just one module that lives under Apache::

I am about to write some code to allow people editing files on our CVS 
backed web site to easily indicate (tag) what the latest releaseable 
version of their work (and make sure that there are no typos in the tag 
name etc). This will make it easy to create new release branches without 
the need for reviewing the entire trunk for half edited pages. Though 
some of this will be specific to our setup, I plan to create a module 
that contains routines that return things like the last author of a 
file, The version of a file that holds a given tag, the date on which a 
file was last edited, etc.

I suspect that there may be others out there that might like to ask 
their CVS server the same questions (in a perl script), so I am thinking 
of making my module a CPAN module. The difficulty is that I have never 
written a CPAN module, and in fact only discovered CPAN about a month 
ago, despite having hacked around in perl off and on since 1996 or 97 
(not sure which... I learned from the pink camel book and only recently 
got the new one with the blue binding :) ).

So I would like to enquire as to the appropriateness of a CPAN module names.
Potential names I have thought of include:

C-V-S::Utils::LogParse
C_V_S::Utils::LogParse
CVSperl::Utils::LogParse
perlCVS::Utils::LogParse
CVSUtils::LogParse
CVSutil::LogParse

I don't think CVS:: is feaseable because a directory named CVS will 
cause problems for CVS. (too bad the authors of CVS didn't name their 
directory .CVS instead of just CVS)

Also I will probably try to include a  C-V-S::Utils::Basic with things 
like compare cvs version number, compare cvs branch number etc... 
(rejecting invalid input in those cases for example).

Also, if you have a pointer to a really explicit tutorial on how to make 
a CPAN module it would help, as I am having difficulty locating it on 
your site.
