Hi Linda,

I think there is a lot of truth in what you are writing
but I also understand people get nervous when they
are told to get serious.
They want to keep the right to "not give a shit" and
I can understand that. They (or may I say, 'we') have
other things in our life and after uploading the module
they are usually more important than that module.

The main problem, as I see, is that contribution to a module or
co-maintainer ship feels a lot less interesting, and a lot less valuable
than having your name on you own module. (yeah, lots of ego-trip in there).

I think if we could encourage more people to contribute to
existing modules and if we could encourage module authors to
let more people contribute/co-main etc. their modules,
a large part of the problems (lack of maintenance,
too many similar solutions to the same problem)
we encounter would go away.

I am not sure we can do that or how to do achieve that.

Gabor
