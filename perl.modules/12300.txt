Hi,

I wanted to ask this question for a while, but never found the time until
today...

When I last tried to update my version of WWW::Chat, I simply typed
'install WWW::Chat' from within the CPAN shell. But I was answered that my
current version was up to date - 0.05 - even though I knew Simon Wistow
had released version 0.64.

In short, CPAN.pm found:

    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/G/GA/GAAS/webchat-0.05.tar.gz

when I wanted to install:

    http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/S/SI/SIMONW/webchat-0.64.tar.gz

I finally managed to install what I wanted by typing 'install
webchat-0.64.tar.gz' (or something like this).

But this is not very user friendly.
Even more when http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=www::chat
correctly returns a link to SIMONW's module.

I first thought it might be a problem due to the change of ownership of
the module, but maybe it's something completely different. Does a member
of modules@perl.org know how to correct this, so that 'install WWW::Chat'
Does What I Mean?


Some more information:
