Request for Namespace for POE::Component::IRC::SearchEngine

Description: 

This module implements a search engine for IRC. It spiders DCC bots on
the channel it sits on that offer "packs" to be downloaded. Packs are
commonly informational text files, mp3's, and open source/free software.
It then allows IRC users to either query for matches or request a
masslist. This saves IRC users from having to repeatedly waste time
doing manual listing all the while getting spammed by matches via notices.

Some features it supports are:

  - Re-spiders frequently to keep it's DB fresh.
  - Returns very detailed data on query matches
    (pack name, number of downloads, file size, pack number).
  - Supports multiple DCC bot formats.

DSLI entry:

  POE::Component::IRC::
  ::SearchEngine bdpO Search Engine for IRC AFOXSON

Discussion: 

  There has been minimal, yet positive dicussion of this module on IRC. 
  There are other modules that implement IRC bots for various purposes,
  such as libsirc, a module that implements an IRC channel management
  bot, and POE::Component::IRC::Onjoin, a module that implements a
  moved message/onjoin bot.

  Dennis Taylor (POE::Component::IRC) has no objections to the
  proposed namespace.

  Thank you for your time and consideration.
