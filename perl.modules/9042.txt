Specifically, Tie::File.  I wrote a module by that name before I knew that
someone had already claimed it in the modules list.  After I discovered it
in the modules list, I sent the registered author an email, and copied it
to Andreas Koenig for his information.  This was 4.5 years ago -- I never
received any response to my inquiry, and there still isn't any Tie::File
release available on CPAN.

I don't know how long Tie::File has been registered, but it's never been
released (as far as I can tell) and it's kept me from releasing my code.
It seems to me that the module name was registered, then abandoned.  I'd
like to use the module name, since the registered author evidently has no
intention of using it anytime soon.

Hence, my question -- is there a procedure for reclaiming abandoned names?

Deven

P.S. Maybe an annual review would be worthwhile to deregister such names if
the author doesn't indicate an active interest?  There seem to be quite a
few other examples like Tie::File...
