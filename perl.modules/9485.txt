Cool. But DBIx::* probably isn't the best place. DBIx:::* is intended
more for modules that add a layer of functionality to the DBI API or
that are similarly _very_ closely tied to it.

It's not really a good place for application-level functionality.

We also have an SQL::* namespace but that's not a good fit either.

Maybe we need to open up something like a DbSchema::* category for
modules related to the structure of database data. Then this one could
be DbSchema::Normalizer.

Any opinions from the team?

Tim.
