Hi,

I should like to register namespace for a new module.  The DSLI details are
below.

The module's name is Quantum::Entanglement, it allows you to place perl
variables into superpositions of states which are governed by probability
amplitudes.  These variables can then interact with the various perl
operators or user defined functions to form new states.  When variables are
observed, they collapse probabilistically, as do any variables which they
have influenced, or been influenced by, in the past.

The module provides four functions upon use:

 entangle  p_op  p_func  q_logic  

This module has been disscussed, mainly via IRC and email with interested
persons.

On a quick note, it isn't the same as Q::Superpositions, as it tackles its
subject area in a very different way.
