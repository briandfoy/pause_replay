proposed contribution:
  Apache::CVS - an Apache PerlContentHandler for CVS

  at the moment, there are two major packages for putting a web interface
on CVS: CVSweb and WebCVS.  CVSweb is a single, 3000+ line CGI script
written in perl and is largely self-contained.  WebCVS is written
in Python, in large part because the author didn't like the way CVSweb
was implemented.  the interface on WebCVS looks almost identical to
that of CVSweb.

  Here are some of the ways Apache::CVS will be different:
  o it will be an Apache PerlContentHandler.
  o it will be small by taking advantage of the CPAN version control
modules (CVSweb does not do this).
  o in later versions, it will return regular structures instead of
printing HTML.  this will allow others to chain other handlers and
filters so they can create their own interfaces to CVS repositories.
a functional sample interface will continue to be supported, probably
as a separate module.

  the current work in progress is at http://64.220.182.35:8080/cvs.
a usable version will be ready in a week or two.

barbee.
