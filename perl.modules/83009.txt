The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MarpaX::Parse
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple and Powerful Parsing with Marpa::R2
  userid:      RNS (rns)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/marpa-parser

  similar:
    MarpaX::Simple::Rules Marpa::Simple::Lexer Graph::Easy::Marpa

  rationale:

    Marpa::R2 parses anything that can be written in BNF.

    This module is intended to move the use of Marpa::R2 even closer to
    the definition of parsing given in [0] by providing:

    (1) lexical analyzer (based on the grammar terminals) and thus the
    ability to use a text (rather than symbol) string as an input;

    (2) evaluation of Marpa::R2 parse results that represent parse
    trees as Tree::Simple objects, XML string, S-Expression string, an
    array of arrays, a hash of arrays, or a hash of hashes;

    (3) textual (E)BNF with embedded actions;

    (4) automatic handling of ambiguous tokens with (1) Marpa::R2 input
    model or (2) by merging ambiguous tokens to the grammar; and more,
    see [1].

    A working example of (1) and (3) is in a GitHub repo [1]. This is
    an adaptation of the "reverse diff" use case specified in
    Parse::RecDescent tutorial [2]

    The repo also contains working examples of (2), (4), and others as
    shown in README.md [3]âthis is what I consider to be an alpha (all
    tests pass) version of the module that was tentatively named
    Marpa-Easy, discussed on marpa parser mailing list at [4], and after
    some refactoring will become MarpaX::Parse. Or so I hope. :)

    I deliberately avoided naming the module MarpaX::Parser as it is
    not the parser, just an interface to it. The parser is Marpa::R2 [5]
    by Jeffrey Kegler [6].

    This rationale can be forked at Github [7].
