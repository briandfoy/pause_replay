Hello Andreas,

AFAICT, one of Tim Potter or Marco Carnut is the current maintainer (I=20=

add them in cc:). If we believe PAUSE and 02packages.details.txt, Tim=20
Potter is the current maintainer, even though Marco Carnut is listed on=20=

Search CPAN for the latest release.

Concerning Peter Lister, I already tried to send emails to his old=20
address <p.lister@cranfield.ac.uk> and to another one which I found=20
using Google, <P.Lister@sychron.com>, but received no response from=20
none of these.

I also recently discovered (just before taking the plane for=20
YAPC::Europe), that another programmer made a separate release of=20
Net::Pcap for Win32, but which also includes many new functions from=20
libpcap...
     http://www.bribes.org/perl/wnetpcap.html

I expect long and fun hours to re-integrate this stuff into the CPAN=20
branch %-)

Note that as I'm moving today to a new place where I don't have=20
Internet connexion yet, I may not be able to answer in the next one or=20=

two weeks.


Regards,

S=E9bastien Aperghis-Tramoni
