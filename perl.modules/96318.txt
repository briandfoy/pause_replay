Subject: Cannot reset version on 'T2'

Recently the 't2' namespace was handed off to me. IT was originally indexed
unintentionally and the author did not need it. I have now uploaded a dist
that implements the 'T2' namespace. Problem is I cannot index it due to the
't2' entry having an absurdly high version number (123). I also cannot
reset it as it does not appear on my reset version page on pause.

Can someone manually reset that version for me? In addition this may be a
case sensitivity bug that needs to be fixed in pause.

Thanks!

-Chad
