Subject: Module submission Password::SaltSha

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Password::SaltSha
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Create and challenge salted password hashes
  userid:      DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I got tired of re-implementing salting strategies for user login
    passwords that will be hashed and stored. This module creates a
    40-digit salt (60 possible randomly selected characters per digit),
    and uses it to salt a user password. It then hashes it using
    SHA2-256.

    The resulting salt, and hashed password can be stored in a database
    for user logins, greatly increasing security over simply hashing a
    password by itself.

    The namespace choice... well, Password::SaltSha is what it does; it
    salts and SHA's passwords. It can be used to both generate and
    challenge.

  enteredby:   DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  enteredon:   Wed May 23 23:22:43 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Password::
::SaltSha         Rdpfp Create and challenge salted password hashes  DAVIDO
