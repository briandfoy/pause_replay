The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Encode::DosHebrew
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: DOS Hebrew Encoding
  userid:      TZADIKV (Tzadik Vanderhoof)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Encoding

  rationale:

    This module implements a DOS 8-bit encoding of Hebrew, which
    includes vowels (nikud), as well as pointed (dagesh) consonants, in
    addition to the standard consonants. It is a superset of Code page
    862 (which includes only consonants).

    Although data files exist that use this "DosHebrew" encoding, its
    origin is unclear, and there are no known standards which describe
    it.

    Only the "decode" function is implemented at this time.

  enteredby:   TZADIKV (Tzadik Vanderhoof)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov 15 04:17:24 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Encode::
::DosHebrew       RdpOp DOS Hebrew Encoding                          TZADIKV
