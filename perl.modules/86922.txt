Hi to all the Pause Admins,
I was thinking about adopting Plugin::Mojolicious::Proxy :
I needed for work purposes a small piece of software to run development
environments, in few words is a reverse proxy that you can configure with
yaml files the virtualhosts you need.
It uses Mojolicious and it forward cookies too.
With a little research on CPAN i came across Plugin::Mojolicious::Proxy
that made the same thing without cookie support (and i think it's
unmantained)
So i posted on blogs.perl.org (
http://blogs.perl.org/users/mudler/2013/07/reverse-proxy-with-mojolicious.html)
, just wondering if i could make something else happy :) (and maybe wanted
some enhancements and features).
After that i sent an email to the author being polite and i noticed him
that could easily add that feature because can be 1 or 2 lines of code.
The question is, since i think as far i can see thats unmantained (on the
cpan i could see only 2010 as last year of update) can i adopt it?
I registered a pause account time ago(my username is MUDLER) , but i never
used it because i hadn't much spare time (  :-(   ) but i think i can take
that little responsability right now.
Sorry for my english, maybe there are some errors that i can't get right
now :)

Best Regards,
Ettore Di Giacinto
