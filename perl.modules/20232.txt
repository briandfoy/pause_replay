Nigeria.



Dear Friend,

I am making this contact with you based on trust and confidence irrespective of the fact that we have not met before. I am positive that you will be interested and capable of handling a business transaction involving huge amount of money. This business proposal is of mutual benefit and it’s success is entirely based on mutual trust and cooperation. 

I am the Chairman of the Contract Award/Review Committee of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMWH). I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$7,300,000.00 into your private or company account. The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$60,000,000.00. However, in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$52,700,000.00 to my benefit. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where I am the Executive Director in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval. As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Nigeria. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account detai
s as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$7,300,000.00 into your provided account. On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below:

1. 5% of the fund will be use to offset any incidental expenses
2. 25% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary 
3. 70% of the fund will be for me which I intend to invest in your country with you as my partner. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please respond by return mail. Thank you and God bless as I'm anxiously waiting for your urgent response. Please when replying, indicate your confidential Tel and Fax numbers & provide a company name you would like us to use in applying for payment for urgent conclusion of the transaction. 

Yours Sincerely, 
Femi  Williams.

NOTE: Your line of business does not matter.
