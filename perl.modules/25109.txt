I first wrote about this in October, but haven't heard anything back, so
...

I've found some bugs in Data::Compare, and would like to take over
maintenance of the module so I can fix 'em.  I have a patched version
ready to go just as soon as I am allowed to upload it.  I will, of
course, be happy to hand maintenance back to the original author if he
ever shows up again.  The licence permits this.

I see from rt.cpan.org that there is another bug report now as well as
the one I submitted.

I first tried contacting the author in late August/early September (I
forget which now).  Submitted bug report in rt.cpan.org in September.
Posted to comp.lang.perl.misc and clp.modules on 2 Oct (msgid
<ojlmnvc889pet2j0aac19b5grf7lm5uld0@4ax.com>).  Mailed his local perl
mongers list (paris.pm) on 10 Oct asking if anyone there could contact
him, apparently a message was passed on but no response from Fabien.

Looks to me that he's gone AWOL, so please can PAUSE/CPAN be prodded to
let me upload a new version.  My PAUSE id is DCANTRELL.
