The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Jspell
  DSLIP:       RdhOl
  description: Morphological Analyzer
  userid:      AMBS (Alberto Manuel Brandão Simões)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    available on SVN, https://natura.di.uminho.pt/svn/main/Lingua/Jspell

  similar:

  rationale:

    Jspell is an old C application based on ispell. The dictionaries
    were enriched with morphological information, and is actually one of
    the most used morphological analyzers for the Portuguese Language.
    Although that, it is not limited to the Portuguese language as there
    are already dictionaries for English and Latin. Other language
    dictionaries are being developed and thus, there is no reason to
    make this module sit behind Lingua::PT (also because it does not
    include any dictionary, just the system engine).

    Jspell appears now as a Perl module because the old mechanism for
    configuration based on autoconf/automake/libtool was a big hack, and
    most Jspell users use the Perl API and not the C interface.

    Cheers ambs

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
