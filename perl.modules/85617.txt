The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::Bankwest
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: check Bankwest accounts from Perl
  userid:      LXP (Alex Peters)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    GitHub repository, personal website

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::PNC Finance::Bank::mBank Finance::Bank::NFCU
    Finance::Bank::RBoS Finance::Bank::HDFC

  rationale:

    Suggesting "Finance::Bank::Bankwest" on the basis that many other
    distributions exist on CPAN under the Finance::Bank namespace for
    checking bank accounts.

    While some distributions include a country code, e.g.
    "Finance::Bank::AU::Bankwest", I have not requested this on the
    basis that no other bank in the world trades by the name "Bankwest"
    at this time. I am happy to accept a namespace with country code AU
    if it is deemed likely that this might change.

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::
::Bankwest        adpOp check Bankwest accounts from Perl            LXP
