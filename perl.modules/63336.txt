The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MultiThread
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: WorkerPool and Pipeline threading models
  userid:      DSPADEA (David Spadea)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This implements two classes: MultiThread::Pipeline and
    MultiThread::WorkerPool. These could probably go under
    Thread::WorkerPool and Thread::Pipeline, in the same family as
    modules like Thread::Queue. If you all think that's more
    appropriate, I'd be happy to change it.

    I decided to go with a different namespace because Thread::* seemed
    to be mostly core modules for dealing with perl threading, so I
    didn't want to step on toes.

The resulting entry would be:

MultiThread       RdpOp WorkerPool and Pipeline threading models     DSPADEA
