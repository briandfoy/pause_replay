Don't use ::Source, it's a bad idea.

Source is such a generic word, that unless the previous namespace refers 
to a specific noun, it doesn't work.

Thing::Source kind of just works, System::Source doesn't.

I actually made the same mistake in Algorithm::Dependency, which has 
Alg::Dep::Source as "data source" and with hindsight it was wrong.

I probably should have used ::Data instead, and I'd recommend the same 
in your case, use IDS::Data or IDS::DataSource.

In the Algorithm::Dependency rewrite, when it finally happens, there 
won't be a ::Source class.
