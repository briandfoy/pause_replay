Dear CPAN Admins,

	Term::Menus has disappeared from the 'All Modules' list, and
will no
longer install with the CPAN module when one types:

cpan> install Term::Menus

The latest version is Term-Menus-1.07.tar.gz

I would *greatly* appreciate this being remedied at the earliest
possible convenience.

(Do I have to request that the link in the 'All Modules' list be updated
every time I want it to point to a new version? This is a manual process
I take it??)

Thanks!
Brian Kelly

Terminal, Console, Windows CMD environment. No gui.

Does it work with anything other than a terminal? That would be
the major point that would force that one way or the other.
