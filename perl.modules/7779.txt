I've at least three packages I'm planning to upload in the near future,
Jabber::Connection, Jabber::RPC and Jabber::RPC::HTTPgate. As you can
see from the modules list this week, Piers is planning to contribute
another two: Jabber::JAX::Component and Jabber::Judo::Element, with more
to come. And I don't think that will be the last of it by any means, as
is clear from the movements in the development community at the moment.

Ryan has written some great modules, but as I briefly explained in my
initial proposal, the Jabber::Connection package is a different approach.
I'm sure you're not an advocate of 'one size fits all' in software... 
I certainly am not.

I beg your pardon?

I don't understand how you turn the explanations and reasonings that I
have given in response to queries on this list into a desire on my part
to 'make a point' or use this list or the namespace as a 'forum' and am
mildly offended, to say the least.
