Hello,

my upload LWP-Authen-Negotiate-0.03.tar.gz is visible in CPAN at

<http://search.cpan.org/~agrolms/LWP-Authen-Negotiate-0.03/lib/LWP/Authen/Negotiate.pm>,

but when searching via
<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=LWP%3A%3AAuthen%3A%3ANegotiate&mode=all>

the 0.02 version is found.

What is going wrong?

Maybe the problem is that Leif has released (
as Co-Maintainer of namespace) the 0.02 version and
now has "first come" accessrights additionally.
(My accessrights are "modulelist" accessrights)

What has to be done?

Thank you,
Achim
