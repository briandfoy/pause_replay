Hi,
 
 I would like to contribute this:
 
        Name    DSLI    Desc    					Info
        web     SdLp    functs for CGI-processing and webpage creation
XWOLF
      
 
Current download location:
http://cgi.xwolf.com/cgilocal/xload.cgi?file=web.pm
(German info: http://cgi.xwolf.com/web/)

Beneath the functions that are similar to cgi-lib.pl/CGI.pm, there
are several new functions that are in need of professionell
CGI-programming,
and webpage creation, like a locking-function that works with atomar
links 
instead of flock(), which is failing accross system-boundaries and
several
ckeckroutines for Mailadresses, URLs, parsed userinput at CGI-scripts 
and so on.
        
My module cannot and shall not replace modules like CGI.pm and
HTML::Parse(r),
but they are made newbie-friendly, that means, also those folks
which want to learn out of them can use and learn out of them.
I tried to use no hacker-code.
(Many beginners on CGI/Perl-programming fail on it due to the fact,
that they have no idea of objectoriented programming. So here they find
examples for routines like in CGI.pm but with plain functions.)

Ciao,
  Wolfgang
