    Graph BioPerl

  rationale:

    Summary: We present a Perl library dedicated to the analysis of
    graphs representing biological data. It includes five different
    types of operations : file access (reading and writting graphs in
    different formats), basic operations (computing of values as well as
    graph structure modification), random graph generator adapted to the
    structure of graphs of biological data, an original clustering
    method based on the identification of high density areas, and
    finally a pathway towards visualization programs. Such a set of
    functions provides a toolbox to study and manipulate graphs.

    Many biological processes can be represented as a graph : protein
    interactions, genes linked by an evolutionary relation, enzymatic
    pathways, gene expression/regulation, etc. Such data are generally
    associated to external information : for example, for a graph where
    each vertex is a protein we would like to have access to its
    function. Furthermore, the operations on such graphs are often the
    same succession of calculations : the computing of a distance or a
    density, the research of clusters, etc. That is the reason why we
    have developped the BioGraph Perl module. This library makes it
    possible to create imperative programs dedicated to graph treatment
    (applicable on every type of graph and not only on biological data)
    with input/output files compatible with many bioinformatics tools.
    The programmer can use one of the graph representations or format
    proposed in accordance with the type of operation needed.

    An "application note" of this work has been submitted to
    Bioinformatics.
