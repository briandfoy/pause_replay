Why not? That could be useful to others.

Well, there's already the eg/adblock.pl example file in HTTP::Proxy
version 0.13. It's very limited, though.

> Maybe I should publish the whole proxy thing as a one?

You mean as a script? I don't think proxy scripts are very useful,
because one always needs to adapt them to their needs. A module, on the
other hand, brings more generality. And proxy scripts can be very short
with HTTP::Proxy and the appropriate filters.

The proxy I'm using at home is in fact a script that collects several
unrelated filters in one single proxy. The script grows with my needs to
modify the web (so that my web experience is not limited by what the
various site designers had in mind).

I'd suggest you publish the module, and provide the script as an example
of use.

I'll be pleased to talk about your module at the next conferences I'll
talk about HTTP::Proxy. That would be easier if your code is published
somewhere I can point to (e.g. CPAN).

> An appropriate namespace? (now is HTTP::Proxy::Filter::AdBlock)

If it implemented as a module that inherits from HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter
or HTTP::Proxy::HeaderFilter, you should use the proper namespace, in my
opinion (HTTP::Proxy::BodyFilter::AdBlock, I guess).
