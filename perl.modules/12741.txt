The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Reuters::SSL
  DSLIP:       adhfg
  description: Reuters SourceSinkLibrary Triarch
  userid:      CBARKEY (Christian Barkey)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The toplevel Namespace Reuters should declare unmistakeably the
    affiliation to be a Product to deal with Reuters Software.

    SSL, the Source Sink Library, ist the well known name in Reuters
    terms to describe the Suite to gather and contribute data from and
    to the Reuters Triarch. Indeed, it could be misunderstand to be the
    Secure Socket Layer Procotol used for HTTPS - connections but the
    top-level makes it very clear that the product affiliates as a
    Reuters Product. This was already discussed in
    module-authoers@perl.org and the only other good suggestions was
    Reuters::Realtime. But this could also lead to misunderstandings in
    terms of a realtime network as well as Reuters has another realtime
    - Product called TIBCO.

    There is actually no contributed module to access Reuters Data from
    a Triarch. I've seen that in 98 somebody tried to, but I wasn't able
    to contact him by email.

    Therefore I know there is some need for this nice and handy
    Perl-Module out there.

    Why a new rootlevel? Well, this is only the beginning... Reuters
    has many products, one is the Triarch Realtime, a second is the
    TIBCO (new infrastructur for realtime data) and there are several
    services for historical and other purpose data which are accessed
    each in a unique way and should all go under this top level.

The resulting entry would be:

Reuters::
::SSL             adhfg Reuters SourceSinkLibrary Triarch            CBARKEY
