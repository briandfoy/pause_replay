If you can confirm your identity in a way that we know is you, we can
update the email address on the old account.

Google plus profiles and LinkedIn profiles have been used in the past.
 Or other "well known" CPAN authors who vouch that your new email
address is really you, etc.  Worst case, I'll take an email with a
scanned image of government ID.  :-)
