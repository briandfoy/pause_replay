description: scripts to extract records randomly  from text based file
delimited by blank lines (paragraph) or (carriage returns)
note: several people in the computer science department at the
University of Virginia have asked for this script to extract quotes,
paragraphs for various purposes (extracting records from a file,
extracting jokes, extracting poems, creating poems, etc...)

Thank you for your time.
