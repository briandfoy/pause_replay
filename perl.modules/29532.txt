The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::Wyrd
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Framework for HTML-embedded objects
  userid:      WYRD (Barry King)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, web site to be set up "real soon now"

  similar:
    Apache

  rationale:

    The Apache::Wyrd class of modules represent a framework for the
    development of Apache applications that operate under mod_perl and
    use apreq, DBI, etc. They are not really meant to work outside of
    the Apache::Wyrd::FOO namespace except when the entire namespace is
    subclassed by modules in local namespaces on individual perl
    installations. The Apache::Wyrd class and derived classes represent
    self-processing HTML template-like objects when pre-processed by the
    Apache::Wyrd::Handler. Their distinct location on an HTML page lends
    the idea of "Word" as an analogy, but there are several CPAN modules
    devoted to a well-known wordprocessor that use "Word" in their
    name-space. The old germanic word "Wyrd" is a better description, as
    it has the connotation of a evocative aspect as well as a written
    one.

  enteredby:   WYRD (Barry King)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 16 21:49:40 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::Wyrd            bdpOg Framework for HTML-embedded objects          WYRD
