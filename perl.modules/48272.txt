Hi,

I just tried to upload File::Tools but it was not indexed due to lack
of permission.

I checked and as I can see
Aaron Sherman <ajs@ajs.com> -- ASHER is listed as the owner of
3 modules on PAUSE:

module=09who=09type
File::Copy =09ASHER =09modulelist
File::Recurse =09ASHER =09first-come
File::Tools =09ASHER =09first-come

I could not find his directory on www.cpan.org
File::Copy is core and I could not find the other two on CPAN
though File::Tools is on backpan.
http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/A/AS/ASHER/

Can you please clean the ownership of File::Tools so I can upload
a new version of it?

Thanks
   Gabor (PAUSEID: SZABGAB)
