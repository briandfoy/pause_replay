Currently, there is no way to make the distinction so there is no real
incentive to make the distinction correctly. This could change if a
mechanism were available.

The production environment is also the reference environment. If a
module requires something that is not in the production environment,
any additional requirements should be added very carefully. Every
extension to the production environment is something extra to
maintain, and I think it is a very valid argument to try to minimize
this.

Actually, this question was triggered when I recently tried to install
Bundle::CPAN. When it wanted to install a product called Spiffy I
decided to hit the cancel button and investigate.
