We are having a career evening/open-house this WEDNESDAY (APRIL 20,
2005) at 6:30PM for our large, professional Fortune 500 company in North Dallas. We will have a second open house this Saturday as well.

Your name came across my desk as a hard working agent and professional. We
are looking for potential partners in the related fields of real estate,architects, builders,
attorneys, cpa's,tax preparers, and bookkeepers to help families retain their
homeownership and get out of debt. This may not be for you, but if I could show
you how working with us would increase your business and income would you be interested?

Please R.S.V.P via e-mail or fax me at 214-889-5512.

Thanks,

Greg

P.S. If you have any referrals in any of the above fields, please forward
my e-mail. Our country is in great need of what we have been doing for the
last 14 years!! Especially with all the social security deficit that is
about to occur!!!
