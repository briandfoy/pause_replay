Subject: Module submission Lucy
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, creamyg@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lucy
  DSLIP:       imhOo
  description: Search engine library.
  userid:      CREAMYG (Marvin Humphrey)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-lucene/LucyProposal

  similar:
    KinoSearch Plucene Clucene

  rationale:

    Ferret, written in Ruby/C, and my CPAN distro, KinoSearch, written
    in Perl/C, are both implementations of Apache Lucene. Ferret's
    author, Dave Balmain, and I are joining forces, along with Lucene's
    original author and Apache VP Doug Cutting, to create a fresh
    implementation of Lucene, with development hosted at Apache. The
    name of the new project is "Lucy" and a proposal has been submitted
    to the Lucene Project Management Committee; with Doug already on
    board, the prospects for approval seem high.

    Lucy will consist of a shared C engine with Perl and Ruby bindings.
    Once it is sufficiently feature-rich, stable and mature, KinoSearch
    will be deprecated.

    A top-level namespace is warranted by the sheer scale of the
    project: KinoSearch currently counts 80 modules, and Java Lucene
    weighs in at over 200. Lucy will aim to mimic Lucene's class
    structure, and since class names in Java do not have to include the
    complete package, Lucene's class names are quite lengthy.
    Lucy::Search::HitCollector::HitQueueCollector is long enough
    already; Search::Lucy::Search::HitCollector::HitQueueCollector is
    beyond the pale.

The resulting entry would be:

Lucy              imhOo Search engine library.                       CREAMYG
