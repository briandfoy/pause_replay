> How to apply new version of uploaded module?

Are you asking why your latest version hasn't shown up? It might take a
little while for PAUSE to do it's processing, and a little longer (a
couple days) for local mirrors to update.

Can you tell us which distro you think isn't showing correctly, and
what you think it should be?

Which namespace? Is it still a problem?

You only register a namespace once.

Thanks,
