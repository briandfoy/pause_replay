What else would go under File::Attributes::*? I couldn't think of 
anything else that would reasonably go in that namespace. Is it worth 
creating a namespace for just this module?

The original motivation for this name was that extended attributes are 
known as "extattrs" (*BSD) or "xattrs" (Linux).

Thanks.

We (Kevin Goess and I) discussed having a submodule per platform, but we 
decided to do have all the cross-platform in the XS. Haven't /actually/ 
tried that yet, though. ;)

Thanks, bye, Rich =]
