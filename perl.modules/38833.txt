The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::MirapointAdmin
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Access for Mirapoint Administration Protocol
  userid:      AHALL (Adrian Hall)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://mirapoint.wayne.edu/

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module connects to a Mirapoint box via a TCP port or an SSL
    connection (hence the Net) and talks via the Mirapoint
    Administration Protocol (hence the MirapointAdmin). It used to be
    called Mirapoint::Admin in its prior (non-CPAN) versions, but I
    figured you would all object to the creation of a top-level
    namespace, so we proactively changed the name.

    I'm open to other naming schemes if anyone thinks that the chosen
    one is not suitable and wishes to suggest a new one.

  enteredby:   AHALL (Adrian Hall)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar  5 00:12:42 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::MirapointAdmin  bdpOa Access for Mirapoint Administration Protocol AHALL
