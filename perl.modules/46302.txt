The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ArchNav::Power::ITTC
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Power Prediction Prognosis according to ITTC
  userid:      RAGRO (Ralph Grothe)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I haven't found an existing rootlevel namespace where this or
    similar modules would best fit in to. If there were modules of Civil
    Engineering with a rootlevel namespace such as Eng I would rather
    place it beneath that like Eng::ArchNav (n.b. ArchNav should
    translate to Architectura Navalis, the Latin term for Naval
    Architecture). My module idea may sound a bit weird, and thus
    probably would fit into the notorious Acme:: as well should you be
    reluctant to constitute a new namespace like the proposed. Because I
    consider myself merely an intermediate level Perl programmer I
    wanted to come up with my first module on CPAN with something not
    yet available there, and I am convinced there are hundreds of CPAN
    authors who are more eligible to contribute to the ubiquitious IT
    related namespaces. Also I would consider my contribution rather as
    an incentive to more apt Perl programmers to improve my attempts and
    start contributing more (or any at all) engineering related modules,
    which are desperately underrepresented on CPAN I beleive.

The resulting entry would be:

ArchNav::Power::
::ITTC            idpOp Power Prediction Prognosis according to ITTC RAGRO
