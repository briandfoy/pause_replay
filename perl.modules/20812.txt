I think it's wrong to create a new top level namespace EPS, just for a
part of postscript.

I would suggest to use instead the already existing namespace PostScript
and to call your module e.g. as
PostScript::EPS
or
PostScript::Encapsulated

There are some advantages more than just only avoiding to create a new top
level namespace.
- EPS can mean a lot
  A quick search with google shows that there exists also in the world
  * European Physical Society
  * EPS Software Corporation
  * Expanded PolySterene (EPS) foam -- a popular packaging  material
  * Educators Publishing Service
  * Experimental Psychology Society
  * ...
  EPS only stands for encupsalted postscript when handling postscript,
  (different to e.g. HTML, WWW, ...)
  so postscript should also in the module's name
- There are some comparable modules like your one already in the
  PostScript::* domain like
  * PostScript::StandardEncoding
  * PostScript::GraphBar
  * PostScript::GraphStyle
  * PostScript::Elements
  * PostScript::Poster
  * ...
- It's not that important that the module's name is short,
  as we can assume that it will be used only in few scripts,
  but not at a significant ratio (like e.g. CGI or GD),
  so a more full self explicating name is more appropriate.
  Especially as it helps also to understand what the module can be grouped
  in, also for a beginner in programming, where EPS would only be
  cryptical acronym.
