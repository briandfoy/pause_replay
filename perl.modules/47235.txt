What'd you think about Tk::LineGraph::Dataset? If it's a submodule for 
Tk::LineGraph, that seems much more appropriate.

On a related note, I'm having a hard time getting an idea what it's 
about without a proper rationale, so if you  find Tk::LineGraphDataset 
much more appealing, I'd be interested in finding out why. :)

Best regards,
Steffen
