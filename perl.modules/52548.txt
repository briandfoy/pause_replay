     why:

    I would like to contribute a library I wrote called VEGAS (Virtual
    Extensive GAme Simulation). It simplifies the creation of programs
    which use playing cards, particularly games. Specifically, it
    provides several functions, which simplify the creation and
    manipulation of decks and cards.
