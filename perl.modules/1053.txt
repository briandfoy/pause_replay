In that logic it should really be named Socket::PassDescriptor because
the module does not pass file handles, it passes those pesky ints that
kernel understands. Writing a perl wrapper that makes a file handle
from a file descriptor around the core function would be trivial, of course.

Given that my module already works and does what I want _and_ someone
(that nobody remembers ;-) else has more ambitious file handle passing
plans, I think I'll move my module to stable category: I use it
because it works for me, but I'm not likely to make new releases.

Others should probably use that other module. I take it that jhi
implied that the other module promiced better support, more stability,
and well designed "nice" interface, where as mine is pretty bare
bones, probably wont be made to work on exotic or too buggy platforms
(file descriptor passing seems to be notorious to be buggily
implemented on many kernels) and suffers from several days of delay in
reading mail (i.e. bad support).

I'd still like to ask - what happened to SMIMEUtil?
