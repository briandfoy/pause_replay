The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VCS::LibCVS
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: The functionality of CVS in a library
  userid:      DISSENT (Alex Taler)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    dev@libcvs.cvshome.org

  similar:
    VCS::Cvs

  rationale:

    CVS is a version control system, so VCS:: is the right place.

    Someone else is already using VCS::Cvs, and it isn't a good choice
    anyway because CVS can't have a directory called Cvs on a
    case-insensitive file system.

    LibCVS is the name of the project, and it hints at the fact that
    this implementation is not just a wrapper around the CVS executable.

  enteredby:   DISSENT (Alex Taler)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul  1 20:47:06 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

VCS::
::LibCVS          ampOp The functionality of CVS in a library        DISSENT
