I suggest making use of an existing top-level namespace rather than 
inventing your own (Silly) ... On the other hand, now that I look, 
you aren't setting a precedent; Silly::Werder is already registered.

For example, "Acme" is the usual prefix for modules that are 
genuinely useless; if you use that, then you can call the module 
"Acme::SillyWabby".

Alternately, if the module does have a practical use, however 
marginal that is, then try looking for a category with other modules 
that are somewhat similar.  Your choice of the "11 
(String_Lang_Text_Proc)" category is a good start looking.  Or, try 
looking under "World Wide Web" as what you are doing sounds sort of 
like a robot or IRC client.
