A cluster of tall trees with leafy tops stood a short distance outside the
walls, and here the boy landed and sat down to rest in the refreshing
shadeThe city seemed as hushed and still as if it were deserted, and before
him stretched the vast plain of white, heated sands
<br>He strained his eyes to catch a glimpse of the band of warriors he had
passed, but they were moving slowly and had not yet appearedThe trees that
sheltered Rob were the only ones without the city, although many low bushes
or shrubs grew scattering over the space between him and the walls
