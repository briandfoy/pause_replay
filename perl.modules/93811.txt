Request to register new user

fullname: Daniel C. Schmidt

     why:

    I work at Tilt.com, whose backend is largely built in Perl.
    ("Modern" Perl - plenty of sugar with everything from Moose, to
    Type::Library, Function::Parameters, Syntax::Feature::Try, etc.)

    I've written thousands of lines of internal Perl code but haven't
    been active in the community outside of my workplace, with the
    exception of Github interactions here and there. I'd like to start
    contributing to the community.
