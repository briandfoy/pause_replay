OK, so far we have three kinds of modules:
- modules to peek *inside* a VCS system (RCS in this case)
- modules to access VCS systems (VCS::* and VcsTools::*)
- modules to work with and add functionnalities to VCS systems
  (VcsTools::*)

I agree to clean that up. I think everything related to VCS should end
up in VCS::* (or Vcs::*).

Then we'll have to decided whether to split up the namespace for the
various VCS system:

Vcs::Rcs::*
Vcs::Cvs::* 

Then there's the problem of modules than can apply to several vcs
system (like VcsTools::History). 

Should it become Vcs::History, Vcs::Common::History or stay
VcsTools::History ?

What do you think ?

Cheers
