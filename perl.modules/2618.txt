This is a petition for registration as a module contributor, unless it turns
out (oops!) the module has already been done...

-name: Phill Wolf
-email: pbwolf@bellatlantic.net
-url: http://members.bellatlantic.net/~pbwolf/ (nothing there)
-preferred cpan uid: PBWOLF
-contribution:  a module whereby Perl scripts on Windows can use Active
Accessibility (to manipulate and query GUI components)
-interest shown yet: none (The August DC Perlmongers meeting got rained out)

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Win32::
::OleAcc       cd+O  Active Accessibility client

The proposed module name comes from 'oleacc.h', which defines the functions.

Related CPAN modules:

-Win32::OLE.  If you could get an Active Accessibility interface into
Win32::OLE, it would probably work, since IAccessible is dual.  But it would
be an inefficient way to deal with Active Accessibility, since you typically
place at least the same 3 or 4 calls on every Active Accessibility object.
And you need access to a few Win32 Active Accessibility functions besides
the ones available through IAccessible.

-Win32::GuiTest.  GuiTest users might also use OleAcc, or vice versa.  The
sweeping package name "GuiTest" threatens an eggplant effect.  GUI testing
is a *large* discipline and GuiTest is wading just off the beach, but near a
sharp dropoff into much deeper water.  I think it wise to put OleAcc, which
is well-defined, cohesive and uncoupled, into a separate package.  I like it
when packages are named for what they do, rather than what you might use
them for.

Thanks for your time,

	-Phill
