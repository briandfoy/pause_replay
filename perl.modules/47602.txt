The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Radius::PacketOrdered
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: RADIUS packet interface with proxy states
  userid:      TPG (Toni Prug)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Radius::Packet

  rationale:

    This module is a significant improvement over Net::Radius::Packet.
    It implements RFC 2865 proxy states, which are important part of
    running Radius authentication and dealing with its accounting
    packets. It has been running on a busy network with several thousand
    edge devices for over two years, while Net::Radius::Packet, base of
    this module, has been running on a large ISP network with milions of
    accounts (hence mature development stage). I've been in touch (sent
    him the module and asked for integration) with Net::Radius::Packet
    author (Luis M.) back in late 2004, when i wrote the module, but
    apart from few emails, we both slacked on geting integration done.
    This time over, I released immidiately and sent the module and a
    note to Luis - to let him know that if he integrates the two i'm
    happy to close this module down. Until that time (of integration),
    it's worth registering this module, especially since
    Net::Radius::Packet is not registered.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Radius::
::PacketOrdered   MdpOp RADIUS packet interface with proxy states    TPG
