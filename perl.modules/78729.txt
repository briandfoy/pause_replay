Now it's three weeks later, hooboy, and here's the update and upshot:

What (very) few "hey buddy, want a module?" queries I've sent out, 
I've gotten no replies to.
*But* the past three weeks in my not-online life have been, uh, 
dizzying- so I haven't really "door-to-doored" every module I could 
think of, to every person I could possibly look around and elicit 
interest from.
So maybe there's someone who loves Number:: stuff, who would really 
really love Number::Latin-- but I don't know about them and I didn't 
carefully (at all) look for the existence of any such person.

So, okay, anyway:
I now want to log into PAUSE and shed most of my modules over to 
someone, ~mostly~ indiscriminately.

Who's a willing target?  JESSE?  BDFOY?  "ADOPTME"?

Be careful what you ask for, you're disturbingly likely to get it!


About my modules:

* There's something like twenty modules (not dists, but packages, as 
PAUSE seems to do its accounting of them) that I'm glad to shed right 
now, whoosh.  That'll be a big rush of permissions changes, right in 
whoever's face.
And there'll be a few occurrences of me emailing the new owner a few 
sentences of specific wisdom/warning/gossip/despair about the module, 
and *then* pulling that module's big PAUSE-xfer switch.

* There's some modules I'm co-maint on, and I want to email the other 
person and check that they're okay with me making them the sole owner.

* There's the few modules (RTF, Unidecode, etc) that I'm keeping 
indefinitely.


Bam!
