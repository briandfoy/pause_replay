The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::Daemon::SSL
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: SSL encapsulation for HTTP::Daemon
  userid:      BEHROOZI (Peter Behroozi)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::Server::Proto::SSL Net::Daemon::SSL

  rationale:

    Hi,

    For some time, I have been looking for a module that can function
    as an HTTPS server, but have so far failed in the attempt, and,
    judging by a Google search, so have many other people. There exist a
    few generic modules for encapsulating various Net:: classes in SSL,
    but none for the HTTP::Daemon class, which seems to be the most
    popular HTTP server class on CPAN. Most of the "quick solutions"
    that people have found either involve patches to HTTP::Daemon to
    make it only an SSL server or dynamically changing its inheritance,
    both of which are improper long-term solutions. Hence, I wrote a
    quick extension class to HTTP::Daemon which I would like to see on
    CPAN, as it may benefit many others besides myself.

    Thanks,

    Peter Behroozi

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::Daemon::
