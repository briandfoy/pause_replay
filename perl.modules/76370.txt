The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Debian::ENetInterfaces
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Convert to/from XML&/etc/network/interfaces.
  userid:      CHEAKO (Mike Mestnik)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2011/06/threads.html#00001

  similar:

  rationale:

    XML-Debian is much like the name used by Parse-Debian-Packages. As
    this file contains several types of objects the iterator approach
    was unpractical. Debian because ifup/ifdown scripts are so
    generically named that this is likely to clash with some other OS's
    interface to interface control.

    ENetInterfaces is short for /etc/network/interfaces. I don't fell
    confident simply calling the module Interfaces as that could be a
    module that parses the output of ifconfig or similar. I believe that
    this name uniquely identifies the file it operates on while still
    being short enough to type 100 times fast.

    I don't mean to sound contradictory but I'm new and the
    "rootnamespace XML doesn't match chapter" thing just screamed at me.
    This is a Server Utility or Operating System Interface(depending on
    what one considers an Operating System) If that wouldn't belong
    under XML, I'm willing to take suggestions. However this is where I
    feel it should go as this format is used by other OSes.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::Debian::
::ENetInterfaces  bdpfp Convert to/from XML&/etc/network/interfaces. CHEAKO
