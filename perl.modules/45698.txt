From: cpan@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

I came late to the CPAN party, by the time I arrived it was already 5 or 
6 years old and module dependencies were just something I took as a 
given from the start.

And Bundle:: made immediate sense to me too, a special namespace where 
you could specify named groups of modules to install all at once.

After creating my first Bundle:: module (Bundle::CVSMonitor), I 
naturally just created a .pm file with a $VERSION, some pod describing 
the bundle in a similar format to other bundles I'd seen, and then wrote 
a Makefile details the exact needs of the application.

But when I tried to install it, I found out that despite being no more 
exotic than a special no-content case of a normal dist, it worked 
completely differently.

My makefile was ignored, it parsed the POD for some reason, and then 
tried to intuit a list of modules out of the POD description, parsing an 
  errant English comment into 4 or 5 modules it thought it should install.

And this sort of functionality appears to be deeply hardwired into a 
number of places.

I don't see any reason why we should need magic for Bundles at the cost 
of not working with the upcoming generation of module and dependency 
scanners and other smarter tools.

Although I'm sure Bundle:: won't be going anywhere soon, I'd like to 
propose an alternative namespace, tentatively located at Collection::

Modules in this namespace will be for the same or similar purpose that 
Bundle:: is for, except it will allow the dependencies to be done via 
the normal Makefile.PL process, allowing smarter functionality in the 
selection of the modules to use (for example, allowing slightly 
different module deps based on Perl versions and OS platform etc).

I'm open to other root namespace names as an alternative to Collection:: 
but it appears that having "Bundle" in it, particularly at the beginning 
is dangerous from a magic point of view.

Thoughts?
