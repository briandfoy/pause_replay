Data::JavaProperties seems clearer to me. It's not about
OLE::Storage::Property after all.

And the file format will probably have a published specification and
will be used elsewhere. It's not a mail header, it's not in
App::Config format, it apparently can deal with continuation lines and
I bet it must be UCS16 encoded or what not else. As long as we do not
have a published specification of the file format, we should have Java
and Propert{y,ies} in the name. I wouldn't mind
Java::StreamedProperties either.

I'm really looking forward to your module, but the naming is crucial.
I suspect that such a module exists somewhere but I have no idea where
to find it, so let's make sure, other people find you module.
