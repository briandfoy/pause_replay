Subject: Module submission Business::BR

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::BR
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Business-related Brazilian modules
  userid:      FERREIRA (Adriano Ferreira)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    CPAN RT

  similar:
    Brasil::Checar::CPF Brasil::Checar::CGC

  rationale:

    To provide basic functionality on business-related concepts for
    Brazilian applications in Perl. It will start with simple functions
    which test the correctness of identification number and codes, like
    CPF, CNPJ and others emitted by government bodies. The idea is to
    encompass useful implementations that make it easier to develop Perl
    code for Brazilian comercial applications.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::BR              cdpfp Business-related Brazilian modules           FERREIRA
