Yes.  It uses rename() but it allows the renaming to be done
interactively via a text editor.  If I run my Renamer, it will
produce a file listing of the desired directory in a temp file.  

If my $EDITOR environment variable was set to vi, I could do things
like :%s// substitution on the filenames.  Upon quitting the temp
file, the changes are committed (renamed).

When I need bulk filename changes but I'm too lazy to create even a
perl -p -i -e ..., this solution works well.

Maybe it should be File::InteractiveRenamer in the site_perl
hierarchy ?

Just let me know if you have any other questions.
