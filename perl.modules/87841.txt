As the author of the Net::SNMP Perl module, I have been kind of neglecting
the module for the last couple of years because I changed industries and
there really has not been any significant issues with the module.  I did
not realize that there was someone actively monitoring for "orphaned"
modules.  At this time I am not really ready to hand off the module to
someone.

This is more of a wake up call for me to get back to playing with Perl.  I
might be willing to have someone aid with any changes that might need made
for Perl 6 though.

The question is not, are you responsible - the question is, are you reliabl=

Perl and CPAN have an active community. SNMP hasn&#39;t been updated since =
2007<br>
and could need a lot of enhancements.<br>

Further: SNMP should be a &quot;meta-module&quot; like JSON and switch to A=

 =E2=80=A6<br>

Adopting the module would allow me to do such namespace cleanup, and having=
<br>
created an own SNMP agent and wrote a lot of ASN.1 based communication<br>
software (SNMP, SUPL, =E2=80=A6) makes me experienced enough to honor previ=
