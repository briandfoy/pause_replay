SOAP::Lite-0.69 (released 16 Aug 2006) has a module named
SOAP::Packager. The first-come permissions are in SOAP, whose last
release was 5 Sept 2000.

I don't think anyone would mind if Byrne took over SOAP::Packager, but
it might be better named as SOAP::Lite::Packager to avoid this problem.
I don't know what the technical implications may be, but at the moment
I know you can't install the latest SOAP::Lite with the CPAN tools.

There was an earlier message this year indirectly related to this:
