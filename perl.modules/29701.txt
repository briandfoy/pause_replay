The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Params::Classify
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: argument type classification
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Params::Validate

  rationale:

    This module provides type categorisation, and is complementary to
    type verification modules. It's intended for functions that want to
    accept more than one type of argument, and treat different arguments
    differently.

    The type classification that it provides is designed to be useful
    particularly for that purpose, and turns out to be quite similar to
    the classification that Params::Validate uses. It divides scalar
    values into these five mutually-exclusive categories:

    * undef

    * ordinary string

    * typeglob

    * reference to unblessed object

    * reference to blessed object

    It also supports finer distinctions within some of these
    categories.

    At first glance this module appeared appropriate for the "data
    types" chapter of the module list, and possibly the Data::
    namespace. However, it is actually more closely related to existing
    modules in the "argument processing" chapter and the Params::
    namespace. As its main intended use is, in fact, in argument
    processing, it seems more appropriate to place it in the latter
    location.

The resulting entry would be:

Params::
