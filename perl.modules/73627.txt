     why:

    I would like to contribute a command-line script that converts CIDR
    notation into a list of IP addresses. It's fairly simple, but I've
    had a similar tool on my website for a while and it keeps getting
    hits, so it seems like it would be worth adding some POD and sharing
    it on CPAN.

    I'm also working on a module for modelling the internal state of
    poker games (similar to Games::Poker::TexasHold'em, but able to cope
    with a wide range of different variants of the game instead of just
    a single set of rules). If and when I get it finished, I'd like to
    share that with the community as well.
