Request to register new user

fullname: Williham Totland
  userid: WITO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://totlandweb.info
     why:

    Having been a perl user for many years, I have decided it's about
    time to give back to the community.

    My first package is undergoing testing and packaging and
    documentation; (an extension to Date::Japanese::Era allowing for
    counterfactual Era names and dates, supplied by the user.)
