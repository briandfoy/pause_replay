The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Google::GeoCoder::Smart
  DSLIP:       cnpfg
  description: google maps api interface with filtering
  userid:      TTG (John Hunt)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Geo::Coder::Google, Geo::Coder::GoogleMaps and a few others

  rationale:

    I had a large database that I needed geocoded the other day, so as
    usual I went to CPAN to see what geocoding modules were out there,
    because perl is my all time favorite data manipulation program.
    however, none of the geocoding modules that i found could do quite
    what I wanted them to. so I ended up writing my own interface into
    my program. I decided to try to turn my interface into a module.
    one, because I thought it might be useful to others, and two,
    because I can more easily apply it to other programs if it is in a
    modular form. I chose the namespace Google::GeoCoder::Smart because
    I am trying to make my program into a smart geocoder, and most of
    the Geo::Coder namespace is already taken.

The resulting entry would be:

Google::GeoCoder::
::Smart           cnpfg google maps api interface with filtering     TTG
