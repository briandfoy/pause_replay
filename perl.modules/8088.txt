The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Software::Packager
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Common API for packaging software
  userid:      RBDAVISON (R Bernard Davison)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)

  rationale:

    The Software::Packager modules provide a common API for packaging
    software in many formats. The name space was chosen as it is self
    explanitory as to what the module does.

    This module attempts to provide as common an interface as possible
    for the packaging of software in many packaging formats. The present
    list of packaging systems to be supported includes: Tar -
    implemeneted. creates tar files. AIX - Implimentation phase. creates
    IBM lpp packages Dec_osf - under development. creates Digital/Tru64
    UNIX software kits Solaris - Implimentation phase. creates solaris
    packages HPUX - under development. creates software distributor
    media Darwin - Implimentation phase. creates MacOS X packages
    Mswin32 - under development. creates MicroSoft Installer media Perl
    - under development. creates Perl packages of the kind we all use
    tinstall modules RPM - under development. creates RedHat Package
    Manager packages. Dpkg - under development. creates Debian Package
    Manager packages. Oracle - under development. creates Oracle
    installer packagers. Zip - under development. creates zip files.

    Where possible native perl methods are used. i.e. the Tar module
    uses Archive::Tar to create tar files. For other systems the module
    is a wrapper around the packaging systems own interface.
    consequently many of these packaging systems are only available on
    there respective platforms.
