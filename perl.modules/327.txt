Envy builds to a command program:

[joshua@eq1062] % envy help

  Envy 2.46 -- Environment Dimension Manager

  Try:

     envy help usage    for command line arguments
     envy help author   for help writing .env files
     envy help path     for an explaination of search paths
     envy help env      for a list of envy specific environment variables
     envy help license  for licensing information

     envy help custom   for a description of $HOME/.custom/ files [OPTIONAL]

  Send email to envy@listbox.com for support.  Thanks!

[joshua@eq1062] % envy help usage

   list [<envy>]                - See descriptions
   paths [<envy>]               - Location of source files
   load <envy> [<envy> ...]     - Loads <envy>
   reload <envy> [<envy> ...]   - Unloads & reloads <envy>
   show <envy> [<envy> ...]     - Shows changes (shell env is unchanged)
   un <envy> [<envy> ...]       - Unloads <envy>
   unload all                   - Unloads all envies
   <str>                        - Lists/loads envies that match <str>
                                  AVOID IN SCRIPTS; CMD-LINE ONLY

   These options must be first on the command line:
   -csh                         - csh mode
   -quiet                       - Only report errors
   -v\d                         - Set verbosity level
   -strict 1                    - Upgrade warnings to errors.
   --trace                      - Trace activity
   --debug                      - Maximum verbosity

I'm not really willing to rename it.  I guess I don't mind if you wish
to omit Envy from the module list.

Oh, you mean that I own the top-level namespace under each of my
top-level modules?  I didn't realize that.

Rc mimics the B API.  It gives access to the Rc abstract syntax tree.
