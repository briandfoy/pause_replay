     why:

    Well folks here we are again!

    The people clearly want us to win, so we will be pressing on!!! You
    can ask my totally independent publicist ANYTHING: just holler
    @MEGACPAN.

    When this account is approved (and I guarantee you this), I will
    open a dialogue with our North-German dear leader Kim Jong Schmorp.
    We have had enough with the folks from the PRC ripping us off, Neil
    Jinping can't stop us!!!
