The different modules don't have to form a tree structure, but just
shoving them under Time:: doesn't give the uninitiated any idea what
these names mean.  Is there some common name used to describe these
sorts of time systems? If that is "Astro",  for instance, you could
insert "Astro" in all your names to group those from all the other
things people might put in Time::*

Time::Astro::TCB
