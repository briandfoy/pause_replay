The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::BFDump
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Dumps data structures in breadth first order
  userid:      YVES (Yves Orton)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Data::Dumper, Data::Dump, Data::*

  rationale:

    I wrote this module after getting frustrated with Data::Dumper and
    Data::Dump doing depth first traversals (which for complex and self
    referential structures is hopelessly confusing and difficult to
    analyse). In addition I have added features like duping coderefs
    using B::Deparse. Tested against Data::Dumper and Data::Dump
    (sortof, Data::Dump has some crippling bugs) Data::BFDump is far
    more accurate (and much more readable) than either of the above.

    Breadth first order ensures that objects are placed as high up in
    the data structure as possible (and thus have the shortest paths)
    this much more closely mirrors the way most programmers think of
    their data structures.

    Additionally the breadth first nature means that Data::BFDump (moe
    or less) must do a catalog of the datastructure before it dumps
    which allows various interesting opportunities, such as predeclaring
    multiply referenced variables so as minimize the number of post
    declaration "fix" statements that are required.

    A number of other features for development analysis are already
    implemented or on the drawing board such as - DiffStructs do a deep
    level diff of two structures using Algorith::Diff - Various
    indentation options not provided by Data::Dumper

    Ultimately Data::BFDump will support the full interface of
    Data::Dumper (currently it only supports the more commonly used
    attributes)

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::BFDump          bdpOp Dumps data structures in breadth first order YVES
