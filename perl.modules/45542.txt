The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAP::Data::ComplexType
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Complex SOAP::Data object class interface
  userid:      RYBSKEJ (Eric Rybski)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    SOAP::Lite SOAP::Data::Builder

  rationale:

    This module is intended to make it much easier to create complex
    SOAP::Data objects in an object-oriented class-structure, as users
    of SOAP::Lite must currently craft soap data structures manually. It
    uses SOAP::Data::Builder internally to store and generate object
    data.

    SOAP::Data::ComplexType defines a structured interface to implement
    classes that represent infinitely complex SOAP::Data objects. Object
    instances can dynamically generate complex SOAP::Data structures or
    pure XML as needed. Fields of an object may be easily accessed by
    making a method call with name of the field as the method, and field
    values can be changed after object construction by using the same
    method with one parameter.

    Blessed objects returned by a SOAP::Lite method's SOAP::SOM->result
    may be used to reconstitute the object back into an equivalent
    ComplexType, thus solving signifigant shortcomings of SOAP::Lite's
    handling of complex types and allowing users to access their objects
    in a much more abstract and intuive way. This is also exceptionally
    useful for applications that need use SOAP result objects in future
    SOAP calls.

    I hope this module will greatly improve productivity of any
    SOAP::Lite programmer, especially those that need to deal with many
    complex datatypes or work with SOAP apps that implement inheritance.

The resulting entry would be:

SOAP::Data::
::ComplexType     adpOp Complex SOAP::Data object class interface    RYBSKEJ
