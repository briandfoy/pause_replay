The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::SimpleTemplate
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Simple HTML templates with easy syntax
  userid:      ACRAWFORD (Andrew Crawford)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    While HTML::Template is very effective at displaying whole pages,
    it is somewhat heavyweight (in terms of developer time) and
    consequently not optimal for displaying pages which must be formed
    from repeated calls to many seperate templates.

    This is particularly the case when writing content management
    systems - it is very difficult to express the conditional display
    logic of these systems with HTML::Template, and conversely, very
    easy to express it in Perl itself.

    HTML::SimpleTemplate is specifically targetted at occasions where
    many (perhaps dozens) of seperate template calls will be used to
    construct one page; it is not necessary to create a new object for
    each template and the syntax is deliberately convenient both on the
    Perl side and in HTML.

    I enjoy HTML::Template and appreciate the work that has gone into
    it; I do use it and will do so again. However I do believe that the
    goals of HTML::SimpleTemplate are sufficiently different to merit
    having a seperate existence.

    In summary, HTML::SimpleTemplate is limited in functionality
    compared to HTML::Template but addresses the needs of some
    developers in a more convenient manner.

The resulting entry would be:
