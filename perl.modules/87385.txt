The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::OnlineCode
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: A rateless forward error correction scheme
  userid:      DMALONE (Declan Malone)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    gnetraid project on sourceforge:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnetraid/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've already implemented Crypt::IDA which can be used to implement
    Reed-Solomon type of error-correcting codes. They're fine for
    storing data long term, but are quite expensive to calculate if you
    want to use it to transmit data. "Rateless" error-correcting codes
    are much better for that purpose, especially in a multicast network,
    where explicit ACK/NAK messages are inefficient and don't scale well
    as the number of peers increases. I wish to put this in the Net::
    namespace (a) because of the suitability/affinity of using this
    scheme in multicast or multi-sender network applications, and (b) I
    will include various example scripts which demonstrate this use. I
    would also like to create a POE wheel to implement a full network
    protocol for senders and receivers.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
