The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::MultiFactor
  DSLIP:       bdpOb
  description: multifactor authentication for catalyst
  userid:      TENGU (Cédric Jeanneret)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org#catalyst

  similar:
    Catalyst::Authentication::Realm::Progressive

  rationale:

    I didn't find any multifactor authentication module for catalyst.
    The only approaching thing is the
    Catalyst::Authentication::Realm::Progressive which let user enter at
    the first successful method listed in configuration.

    My module will ensure that ALL configured method returns a
    successful login, and then will let the user enter.

    At the first fail, it exits, to prevent any guess.

    This namespace seems to be the right one, as it's a dedicated
    module for catalyst authentication credential.

    It ca uses any available authentication credential in catalyst,
    which makes it really generic and useful.

    I have some cleanup to do in my code, and document it before I can
    upload it, but this module is already in use in two of my
    applications, working fine.

  enteredon:   Thu Feb 23 14:43:00 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::
::MultiFactor     bdpOb multifactor authentication for catalyst      TENGU
