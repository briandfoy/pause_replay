Hmm, interesting. I never thought about there not actually being a
module called AFS::Command. This package provides access to the AFS
"suite" of commands. There are four binaries: bos, fs, pts and vos.
The corresponding modules are AFS::Command::{BOS,FS,PTS,VOS}. You can
use them directly, and there's not actually a need for an AFS::Command
module.

Is there a recommended way to handle this situation -- where the
package name doesn't actually match the name of any module inside it?
In the next release, should I make a no-op AFS/Command.pm to avoid
this inconsistency?

Thank you!
