     why:

    I have re-written the old File::Compare module and emailed the
    author/custodian of the script asking for feedback. I plan on
    contributing this module but I am waiting to hear from the author.
    If I do not hear from the author within 3 months I will assume he
    has abondoned the module and proceed from there.
