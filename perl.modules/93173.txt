I have transferred ownership of the following three modules to John =
Gamble (JGAMBLE):

	Math::Brent
	Math::Derivative
	Math::Fortran

These were last released by John Williams (copied) in 1995. He no longer =
had ownership of these packages, but I checked that he was happy for =
them to be passed on.

Alex Ciornii (CHORNY, also copied) had ownership of all three modules, =
but hadn=E2=80=99t done any releases, and was happy for ownership to be =
passed on.

Michael Walter (MIWALTER) had previously been given co-maint on =
Math::Derivative, so I checked with him. He didn=E2=80=99t plan to do =
any release of it now, and was happy to give up his co-maint.

John had previously asked for these modules, and existing packages in =
the Math:: namespace. John, you now have sole ownership of these. Thank =
you for taking them on.

Thank you to everyone for helping make this happen.

Neil
