The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Query
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Query processing framework
  userid:      EBOHLMAN (Eric Bohlman)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides an object that matches a data source against a
    query expression.

    Query expressions are compiled into an internal form when a new
    object is created or the prepare method is called; they are not
    recompiled on each match.

    The class provided by this module uses four packages to process the
    query. The query parser parses the question and calls a query
    expression builder (internal form of the question). The optimizer is
    then called to reduce the complexity of the expression. The solver
    applies the expression on a data source.

    Built-in methods are provided for evaluating common "search engine
    style" queries (simple and Boolean) against scalar string variables.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Query           bdpOp Query processing framework                   EBOHLMAN
