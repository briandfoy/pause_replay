Is "pot" a common name for this sort of thing? Google's results were
polluted about statistics of marijuana. This seems to be the same thing
I used to called binning.

If Curiously, there are a lot of other things called "Schmidt's test",
including one for fermentation.

Is there a name that might make the functionality of the module more
clear to other users?
