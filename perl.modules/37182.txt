Hello,

I am going to upload my new distribution on CPAN.  Its name is
rpm-build-perl, and its essentials parts are as follows:

B::PerlReq - Perl compiler backend to extract Perl dependencies
PerlReq::Utils - auxiliary routines for B::PerlReq, perl.req and perl.prov

perl.req - list requirements for Perl scripts and libraries
perl.prov - list what Perl source files provide

The latter are scripts.

I see two problems here:

1) Distribution name is non-conventional for CPAN distributions,
which are usually named after the main module or namespace (there is
a few well-known exceptions like libwww-perl).

My argument is that rpm-build-perl is not just a Perl module, but rather
a set of tools for automatic dependency tracking (actually perl.req and
perl.prov are drop-in replacements for /usr/lib/rpm/perl.req and
/usr/lib/rpm/perl.prov of RPM package manager).

The name is conventional for RPM, though.  rpm-build package is used to
build RPM packages.  Here in ALT Linux, we also have rpm-build-tcl and
rpm-build-python.

2) Namespace occupation: while B::PerlReq seems to be a reasonable name,
PerlReq::Utils is questionable.  Maybe B::PerlReq::Utils would be a
better name, but PerlReq::Utils is completely unrelated to B compiler.

So I kind of need an advice.  I also would like to know whether Bad
Things to happen if I keep everything as it is.

Thanks.
