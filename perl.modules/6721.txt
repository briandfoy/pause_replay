Win32-CtrlGUI-0.21 has been released.  Win32-CtrlGUI is a system for doing
GUI control based.  It uses Win32::Setupsup for the low level operations,
but adds a user-friendly (or friendlier) OO interface.  In addition to the
OO interface, there is an OO flow-control system that allows normal
flow-control constructs (looping, if-then-else, sequences, etc.) to be
constructed and executed.  There is a Tk debugger/observer that allows these
sequences to be observed as they execute.

Lots of changes since 0.20, but nothing earth shaking.  The major changes
were:
 * Support for "named" windows (a recognized window can be assigned a
friendly name for use in future matches).
 * Support for aggregate criteria (and, or, nand, xor).
 * Added support to the Tk debugger/observer to display the internal status
for aggregate criteria.
