The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Readonly
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Create read-only scalars, arrays, hashes.
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    RPI lily

  similar:
    constant.pm

  rationale:

    The built-in "use constant" pragma creates only scalars and lists;
    creates variables that have no leading $ or @ characters; creates
    only global variables. The variables it creates cannot be used as
    perl variable work-alikes in many ways (cannot be interpolated into
    strings; cannot take a reference to them). Also, it works only at
    compile time.

    Readonly.pm, by contrast, creates scalars, arrays, and hashes;
    these can be global or lexical; can be initialized at runtime; can
    be used as any other perl variables (except that they cannot be
    modified).

    Readonly.pm uses tied variables, so there is a performance penalty
    as compared to "use constant," but I believe it makes a useful
    complement to the pragma.

The resulting entry would be:

Readonly          bdprp Create read-only scalars, arrays, hashes.    ROODE
