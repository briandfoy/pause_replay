The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DNS::Zone::Parser
  DSLIP:       adpOd
  description: DNS Zonefile preparser
  userid:      OLAF (Olaf Kolkman)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)

    See rationale

  rationale:

    This module implements a pre-parser on which Net::DNS::Zone (in
    advanced alpha, will be published later) will be based.

    In the package itself I refer to other packages that are related.

    Related packages. There are other packages with likewise
    functionality; they where not suitable. Before you start using this
    module you may want to look at these.

    DNS::Zone::File will parse a zonefile but will not expand domain
    names that are not fully qualified since it has no logic to
    interpret the RDATA of each individual RR. You can use this module
    to pre-process the file and then feed it to DNS::Zone::File
    (Default) to create a DNS::Zone instance.

    DNS::ZoneFile has almost the same functionality as this code it the
    canonicalises RR records it is aware off. It also has an INCLUDE
    function. Being an abstraction of a zonefile it has an interface to
    add and delete RRs from the zonefile and print it. The code does not
    sup- port a GENERATE feature.

    Net::DNS::ZoneFile has related functionality but failed to load a
    number of zonefiles.

    I have tried to use these other packages for my purposes but they
    all failed to parse the zonefiles I provided. I've been looking at
    bug fixes but that would involve major rewrites of these libraries.

    I'll try to supply a generic and RFC complient module.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::DNS::Zone::
::Parser          adpOd DNS Zonefile preparser                       OLAF
