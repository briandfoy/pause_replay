As the only member of Moose core team on here:

His stuff is nothing to do with us.

It's just a module that happens to use Moose as an object system.

Putting Moose in its name is silly; from a user's POV that's an
implementation detail (albeit I'll tend to avoid things not using Moose
if I'm planning to extend the module).
