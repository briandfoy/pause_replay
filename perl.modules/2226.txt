Both names seem fine to me. I'll put the DBIx::FullTextSearch into the
modulelist.

For HTML::FillInForm I ask myself, how does it compare to HTML::Form,
HTML::FormValidator, HTML::ParseForm, HTML::StickyForms,
HTTP::Request::Form, and CGI? Would you suggest it should be added to
the module list too?

Thanks,
