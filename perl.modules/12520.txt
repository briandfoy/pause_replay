Applications of XML often tend to go directly under the XML:: namespace. I'm 
ready to be proven wrong but I don't think TEI needs a top level namespace of 
its own. XML::Schema is probably a bad choice too, as people would indeed 
think that it is an implementation of W3C XML Schema (and if they have any 
sense, run away fast ;).

Given that it is a DOM wrapper, why not simply XML::TEILite?
