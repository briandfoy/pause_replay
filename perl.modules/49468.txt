Hello.

I am actually working on a Perl module which allows to build an IMS-LD
(Learning Design - http://www.imsglobal.org/) package. It uses XML::Simple
to read an XML file. I want to know if someone is working on a similar
module and I need help about the name for the namespace (eg, it can be:
IMS:LD, IMS::CP, IMS::Metadata and so on).

Thanks in advance.

Sergio.
