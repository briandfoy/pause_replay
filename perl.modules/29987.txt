Release</STRONG><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 
98% of adults are infected with a parasite that causes Rosacea &amp; Acne.<BR>A team of doctors 
in China isolated a small unseen parasite called human demodex that can people's complexion to 
become rough, lumpy and reddish, as well as hair loss, premature aging of the skin, enlarged 
pores and acne.&nbsp; The parasite looks like a microscopic worm and it feeds off our skin.&nbsp; 
It takes only 10 days to grow from egg to full size and it multiplies at an extremely rapid rate 
if not treated properly, leading to Acne Rosacea - a bizarre type of skin rash that occurs 
primarily on the face. <BR>&nbsp;It was noted in their studies that babies did not have the 
parasite at birth, but contracted days later when babies were touch by other humans, and the 
infection grows with us as we get older.<BR>&nbsp;Here in the Western Hemisphere, many theories 
about the origin of rosacea have been put forth but doctors and dermatologists are starting to 
accept the fact that bad complexion is due to this parasite. <BR>&nbsp;Dermatologists usually 
recommend antibiotics like tetracycline for treating Rosacea &amp; Acne, but the results greatly 
vary, often with little or no effect at all since they are not formulated to get rid of this 
parasite. After 30 years of research on over 900,000 patients worldwide, this team of the doctors 
discovered that the use of Seabuckthorn oil combined with other ingredients and applied 
externally to the affected areas can kill the human demodex parasite and restore the skin to its 
natural beauty.&nbsp; The results, as reported by patients and doctors worldwide, are amazing and 
achieved within days after starting the treatment.&nbsp; Also people with normal skin should be 
aware that they could further enhance it by diminishing their count of human 
demodex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>To view the complete FaceDoctor Line visit us on line at <A
