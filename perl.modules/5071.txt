Hi!

Sorry for using mailing list for that kind of problem - I tried to
ask Andreas (koenig@franz.ww.TU-Berlin.DE), but got no answer. I
have an account at CPAN (amaltsev) but either I forgot my password
(which I doubt) or the system just forgot about me. Why I suspect
that is because when I hit "Forgot Password" link on PAUSE server
it does not recognize my e-mail address (am@amsoft.ru).

And yet that works and displays correct e-mail address:
http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&query=amaltsev

Any ideas? I just want to update modules to new versions..

Thanx!

Andrew.
