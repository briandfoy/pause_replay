The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Stream
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Module for handling XML Streams
  userid:      REATMON (Ryan Eatmon)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Jabber for the past year

  similar:

  rationale:

    I thought that this module had been listed, but I was wrong. This
    module has been in place and stable for quite a while now.

    If I could please get this into the list.

    Also, would it be possible to cross list it under the new Jabber
    namespace, since it is related.

  enteredby:   REATMON (Ryan Eatmon)
  enteredon:   Fri Oct 26 03:23:40 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Stream          RdpOp Module for handling XML Streams              REATMON
