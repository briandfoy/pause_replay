The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Prospect
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: I'face to Prospect protein threading package
  userid:      REECE (Reece Hart)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    SourceForge (project pending)

  similar:
    none similar; related: Bio:: and CompBio:: trees

  rationale:

    Rationale for the module ------------------------ There are no
    existing perl interfaces to the Prospect package; this module is
    unique. We have endeavored to use other packages where possible
    (e.g., Bio:: (aka bioperl)).

    Rationale for the namespace --------------------------- The major
    reason for choosing Prospect:: over a package name within the Bio::
    or CompBio:: trees is that those are to be broad names assigned to
    small groups of individuals. In particular, Bio:: is a big chunk of
    namespace assigned to a group with enforced coding guidelines.
    bioperl would probably not accept any package which doesn't adhere
    to their coding guidelines.

    I like ontologies and organization. If you can think of an
    appropriate place to stick this module (be nice) then I'm happy to
    discuss it. One possibility is to start a new tree with a designed
    hierarchy and that is not owned by a single group. E.g., Biology::
    Entities:: Sequence Structure Gene Protein Alignment ... GUI:: ...
    Tools:: Prospect:: BLAST::

    I know that there has been discussion on the bioperl mailing list
    regarding breaking Bio:: up into subtrees in order to address this
    issue, but I'm not aware of any progress on this yet.

    Thanks, Reece
