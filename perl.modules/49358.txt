Is there a document outlining this somewhere?  I can't seem to find it.

I setup my package so that ExtUtils::MakeMaker works.  You state:

> If you let ExtUtils::MakeMaker [..] do the packaging then you will

The docs for ExtUtils::MakeMaker mention nothing about packaging
files.  I managed to find "instmodsh" but it only seems to notice
a very small set of installed modules on my system.

So I made a tarball that looks like the other tarballs I see
in my .cpan/build directory, and I uploaded it.

So now what?  I still don't see any way to get it into the CPAN
info for Image::BMP.

It would be nice if there was a simple HOWTO about this.
If there is one, a pointer would be greatly appreciated.

Dave
