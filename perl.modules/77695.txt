only Andreas Koenig can do an instantaneous (no three-day wait) delete 
from PAUSE. He reads this list and will likely get back to you as soon 
as he can.

You will have a very hard time eradicating all copies of these documents 
from the internet. As Graham said, regular CPAN mirrors will 
automatically remove the files after they have been deleted from PAUSE. 
There are several sites that do not delete any distributions by default. 
This is by design. Apart from the two that Graham mentioned, there is 
another run by Barbie for the CPAN testers. I am CC'ing Barbie on this 
email.

It is possible for anybody to run such a non-deleting mirror on his 
computer at home. We can't possibly track all copies down, just the most 
prominent ones.

Best regards,
Steffen
