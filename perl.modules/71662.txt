Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: nneul@mst.edu ("Neulinger, Nathan")

Would like to reclaim NNEUL, I originally registered this years ago but
never did much with it. There is a possibility that I will need to use
it again real soon, and would like to reclaim it.

Unfortunately, in the intervening time, our university changed names
from University of Missouri - Rolla to Missouri University of Science
and Technology, along with a corresponding domain change from umr.edu to
mst.edu.=20

Would it be possible for you to update the author record for NNEUL from
'nneul@umr.edu' to 'nneul@mst.edu'? (Or alternatively, just delete NNEUL
and I'll reregister it since there isn't any history on there that I
recall.)
