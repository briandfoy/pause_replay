I am pleased with the discussion that took place as well: it highlighted 
unambiguously the rift between two main groups of users. Having on 
record where various participants stand, including their extended 
position is an invaluable resource to have going forward.

However I find David's outlined course of action appalling. During the 
discussion advocates of a development speedup articulated multiple times 
in no uncertain terms that slavish catering to existing codebases will 
take a backseat. The certainty of this was so great that it prompted me 
to re-commit to keep working on the project in the same manner as it was 
led in the past ~4 years. There was a sizable support for this sort of 
arrangement.

Imagine my surprise when the PAUSE admins (after already having 
prevented me from taking my long-deserved retirement by scuttling my 
original plan) are informing me that my ownership of the project will be 
taken away by fiat anyway.

David, I realize that at this point you will do whatever it is you want 
to do. I am simply putting it on record that the transfer is happening 
against my will, and to a long-term (likely catastrophic) detriment of 
the existing userbase of DBIx::Class.

Additionally I believe the current group of PAUSE admins embarrassingly 
failed their first real accountability test. I strongly suggest 
revisiting your processes at the next QA Hackathon: the way you 
currently handle things "by ear" is absolutely unworkable going forward.
