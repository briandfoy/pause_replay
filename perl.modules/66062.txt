The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Quake::Stats
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Quake game statisitics compilation
  userid:      MBEEBE (Matthias Beebe)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    irc.freenode.net in the #quetoo channel

  similar:
    Games::Baseball::Scorecard, Games::Ratings

  rationale:

    Hello,

    This module implements a simple interface to process the Quake game
    series scoring log (usually called the 'fraglog').

    Most, if not all, implementations of Quake use the same format for
    the scoring log. This module has functions to read the log file and
    compile statistics on each player that appears in the log. There are
    two graphing methods that create simple bar-graph JPEG images, and
    methods to generate textual output of the statistics as well as HTML
    formatted output. The HTML formatted output is included to be useful
    in a CGI application.

    Thank you very much,

    Matt Beebe
