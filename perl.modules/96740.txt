Hi,
I'm the new maintainer for the Apache::FileManager and
Apache2::FileManager distributions.
When viewing the PAUSE permissions for A::FM, I see 2 entries, myself
(WBRASWELL) and user PMC.  I am listed as the "first come" and PMC is
listed as "co-maint"; I am listed as "owner" for both entries.
On the A2::FM permissions, I also see 2 entries, myself and user
DAVVID.  I am listed as the "first come" while DAVVID is "modulelist".
 Unlike A::FM, I am listed as "owner" for only 1 entry, while DAVVID
is listed as "owner" for his A2::FM permission entry.
Can you please explain why DAVVID is listed as modulelist instead
co-maint?
And also, why am I listed as owner on both A::FM permission entries,
but only on 1 of the A2::FM entries?
Thanks!
~ Will
