     why:

    A module that fits into the category of sending Network packets in
    the SMB protocol (Microsoft file sharing protocol, the protocol used
    by Samba and Win NT/2000/XP/9x file servers).

    The module is an XS interface to a small subset of the huge number
    of functions in the libsmbclient (Samba 2.2.x) library.

    They meet my needs of

    . sending and receiving SMB packets for Network management
    applications

    . providing a very modest but hopefully expandable alternative to
    smbclient (an application that is very hard to script and for which
    Filesystem::Smaba is a noble attempt to wrap).

    Name spaces like

    Net::SMB (although it does NetBIOS also) Net::Samba Samba

    are tentative choices.
