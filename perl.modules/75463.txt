The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finnigan
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Thermo/Finnigan mass spec data decoder
  userid:      SELKOVJR (Gene Selkov, Jr.)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://code.google.com/p/unfinnigan/

  similar:
    Xcalibur::Rawfile

  rationale:

    I believe the name of a data decoder module should correspond to
    the name of the data type it decodes. In this case, the data type
    can be traced back to Finnigan before it was acquired by Thermo, and
    despite many years of massaging and and stuffing new data into the
    format, making it look like a bursting suitcase
    (http://code.google.com/p/unfinnigan/wiki/FileLayoutOverview), no
    official name was ever given to it. People refer to it as "raw
    file", mostly because they cannot do anything with it (not even
    look) without processing it with commercial software.

    That has changed. The guts of the format have been analysed and put
    out in the open. Turns out, although it is possible to use the
    format to store the actual raw signals from the instrument, no one
    really does it. Thermo's software, when operated by a normal user,
    uses this format to store (converted) spectra or even called peaks
    -- so the idea of "raw" really does not apply.

    I see no better alternative than simply linking the data type to
    its origin, Finnigan. For that reason, I named my decoding project
    Unfinnigan, and it has already become known under this name in a
    growing circle of mass spectrometrists, especially those working in
    proteomics who use Thermo instruments.

    Making this format public is important because of the huge amount
    of important data accumulated over the years that the researchers
    have published or intend to keep publishing, but the number of
    potential users is limited because access to the data has so far
    been limited due to its dependence on proprietary software.

    I am not against the idea of a nested namespace; I just haven't
    found a suitable one, and cannot really think of any.

    I am not sure which category to put it in, either. "Commercial
    software interfaces" seems to be the most suitable, but we are
    talking about data here, rather than software. Unlike
    Xcalibur::Rawfile, this module does not use any software except
    other perl modules.
