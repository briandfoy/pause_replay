none of the code is JavaScript.  this is a Perl module, isn't it?
if you output JavaScript, that's just text.  i'm dubious that the
module should even output any sort of code.  that seems better suited
to templates.

they both implement TEA.  the implementation details aren't that
important.  i think you should work to extend Crypt::TEA rather
than reinvent it.

i don't see how "HyperText" (the first two words with HTTP) have
anything to do with your module.  i think you should choose a better
name.  you keep using "tautology", but i don't think it means what
you think it means.  HTTP or HTML are not CGI.  they have different 
namespaces.

i don't see how they are confusing.  I think you should choose a 
more descriptive name.

i don't find any of this convincing.  Clui makes no sense to me.  i
think you should choose a more descriptive name.
