If you are to discuss anything it should be open. Why have subscriber-post-only ?

Yet. Last year there was the intent to have it so that it would look like
it was built in. Pushing the API levels down does not give that impression.

While I welcome discussion, I would just like to restate that there has been a *lot*
of discussion on this in the past. But there are too many people who are passionate
about the exception handling in some other language and want perl to mimic it.
The result is that you never get a concensus, at least we never have in the
past.
