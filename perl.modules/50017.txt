     why:

    I have Perl module that I think others will find useful. It allows
    the user to stich together a file based on markers. Markers can be
    placed anywhere within the file, and new data can be inserted before
    or after a marker. Markers and their data can be delete as well.

    I'm currently using the module to maintain various configuration
    files. When a new host is added to the network I need to update
    dhcpd.conf, but I don't want to have auto-generate the whole file
    unless I have to. I use the library to insert the desired text at
    the exact location of where it needs to go.
