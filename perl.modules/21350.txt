     why:

    A bunch of modules to be used in language localization and
    internationalization of documents. Most of them have been written
    for my own use inside some scripts but recently managed to clean
    them up, take them out and put them in different modules.

    Gregorian<->Jalali(Shamsi) converter: Converts Gregorian date to
    Jalali(Shamsi) which used in Iran. It will be added to date::convert
    http://search.cpan.org/author/MORTY/DateConvert-0.16/Convert.pm.

    Other modules are mostly related to automatic language detection
    (with a pool of Persian words to guess the language), automatic
    encoding conversion of web pages using meta tags and Encode,
    specifically tuned up for conversion between Arabic-1256 and UTF-8)
    which naturally fixes some Persian letters problems.

    Numbers converter: Basically converts 1234567890 to its Persian
    equivalent, which is ۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹۰ and vice versa.
