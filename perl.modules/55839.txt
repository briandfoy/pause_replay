The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::OnlinePayment::VirtualNet3
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: SSL 1.0 gateway for credit card purchases
  userid:      ODO (Rick Smith)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Business::OnlinePayment::VirtualNet was the seed for this module

  rationale:

    While certifying for TSYS, I researched existing modules to create
    PCI compliant SSL transactions over the internet for credit cards. I
    found Ivan Kohler's very nice VirtualNet module, but discovered that
    the specification the module was original designed for had been
    update significantly since he published his last version.

    Nonetheless, Ivan's module proved to be a decent start for the
    foundations of the SSL gateway and fundamental parameters. I tweaked
    his module to adhere to the present spec, and my company uses this
    code to clear thousands of dollars a month on our POS servers.

    Now that this code has matured in production and is ready for
    public release on CPAN, I'd like to post this version as a
    co-maintainer of the module with more modern field specs.

The resulting entry would be:

Business::OnlinePayment::
::VirtualNet3     Rdpfp SSL 1.0 gateway for credit card purchases    ODO
