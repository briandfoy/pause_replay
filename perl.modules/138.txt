Ok, I've readied most of the changes from the feedback on this thread, and here goes:

I would like to request the following namespaces:

Import::ShortName - for the namespace aliasing thingy

and

Import::JavaPkg - for the auto-loading package
loader (with aliasing)

I'm splitting the docs, verifying all the weird syntax options and any other oddball cases I can throw at it.

I haven't decided what to do with the issue of loading into an existing namespace. Part of me thinks this could be useful as an alternative way to implement inheritance for a performance boost by bypassing the virtual method lookup mechanism in @ISA.

Thoughts? Or should that be relegated alongside the Damien Conway posts that use indirect syntax *and* implement pragmas. :)

I thought about enforcing a two-level namespace in order to even use the module (so bozos who try stuff like 'use Import::JavaPkg "CGI";' get an exception telling them not to do that). But, then some people pointed to wanting to try something like "use Import::JavaPkg "IO";' (or Tk::somesuch).

I decided to let those who wish to do so do so,
and not shake my finger and tell them I won't
let them do that. I don't presume to know
someone else's intent and prevent them from
doing something. Especially when I would have
to put in extra code to prevent them.

I didn't feel I should be the "code police" and publish crippleware. There are plenty of others on these lists that have egos big enough to take up my slack in that area.

I also don't know what to do about multiple packages that are inside a single pm (a la XML::DOM, primarily). Any ideas?

Make a second pass to hunt for qualifying
namespaces to alias *after* I've 'use'd the
module?

Mike.
