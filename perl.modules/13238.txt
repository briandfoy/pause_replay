A short description of what I'm planning to contribute:

 Math-XOR-0.01 - A lightweight XS module that allows you to XOR two strings
together on the byte level, something that is done faster in C than in Perl
but is still desireable in numerous applications (primarily data security).

 Thanks,
  Tyler
