     why:

    I would like to submit my module for Zabbix::API communication (as
    Zabbix::API is already used, I'll come up with a different name). I
    would also like to abstract the skeleton of a dashboard generating
    solution that I'm using and try to produce a base, common module
    from the loose set of scripts that I'm using. Ideally, this would
    enable the user to produce only the config and the HTML template,
    and a set of plugins to obtain data (with the Zabbix plugin already
    provided) - the module and a simple skeleton would be enough to
    produce a dashboard with an overview of the system status (for
    real-time monitoring).
