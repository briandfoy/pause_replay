Subject: Module submission Tk::PerlMethodList

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::PerlMethodList
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Display methods of a Perl class
  userid:      LAMPRECHT (Lamprecht, Christoph)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    c.l.p.tk modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a Tk::Toplevel-derived widget, so its place is obviously in
    Tk:: I thought of Tk::MethodList first, but Brian d Foy suggested,
    that it should refer to Perl in its name to make clear it's a tool
    for Perl programming only. The widget shows Names of all subs
    defined or declared for a package and its parent classes. Sub-names
    are read from the symbol-table. A second window displays sourcecode
    if available.

    I'm not sure about the chapter_id... Should this go to 003 or 008 ?

    Regards, Christoph

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::PerlMethodList  RdpOp Display methods of a Perl class              LAMPRECHT
