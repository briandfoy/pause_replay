Hi,

I have prepared a SpinBox module which I think would be a useful
tool for people using perl/tk.  

Here is the relevant information:

         Name: Geoff Russell
        Email: geoff@austrics.com.au
    Home Page: No I don't have a home page
       userid: gjrussell
      modules: 

      SpinBox: data entry field for numbers, dates, money, time with
               arrows for spinning numbers up or down  
   BlockEntry: 
               This widget simplifies data entry form layout 
               where you have a bunch of fields to be
               lined up on a screen form.

                         e.g.,
                           Name:  _____
                       Address1:  ______________
                       Address2:  _______________
                         Suburb:  ___________

    SpinBox:
         Development Stage: b
            Support Level : d
                 Language : p
                 Interface: O
               Description: Data Entry widget for numbers, dates, times
    BlockEntry:
         Development Stage: b
            Support Level : d
                 Language : p
                 Interface: O
               Description: Set up column of labelled data entry widgets

The SpinBox module has quite a lot of function but doesn't take up
as much screen real estate as some date widgets I've seen.  

Cheers,
Geoff Russell
