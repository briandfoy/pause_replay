It might, but I consider that option to be inferior to 
SQL::SyntaxModel and prefer to stay with SQL::SyntaxModel.

Some more rationale:

1. A previous discussion about naming this module was had on 
modules@perl.org and other lists about a year ago, mainly on 
2003.09.15 and 2003.09.16, and SQL::SyntaxModel was the result of 
that discussion.  I liked it better than any other candidates that I 
used or that were suggested before, and so did the other 
participants.  About 10 people gave me feedback.

1. "SyntaxModel" is intended to be treated like an atomic compound 
word.  I would have in fact used a single word, but none were found 
that were just as descriptive.

2. SQL::SyntaxModel is intended to be used in similar contexts and 
speech patterns as the likes of SQL::Statement and SQL::Translator 
and Class::DBI, and it is supposed to have a similar amount of 
ubiquity as SQL::Statement has.

3. SQL::SyntaxModel works best as a level-2 namespace because it is 
very distinct from any existing SQL-related modules.  It is also 
self-contained rather than being one of a set of parallel modules 
that comprise a framework.  At the same time, SQL::SyntaxModel is 
designed to be extended or wrapped by or used internally by other 
third-party modules that can optionally have level-3 names below it, 
or be named something completely different.

4. I prefer shorter names, as do users.

5. There are no other SQL::Syntax::* modules, nor are there likely to 
be any time in the near future.  So creating the extra namespace 
level is superfluous.

6. While SQL::SyntaxModel is closely related to SQL in its problem 
domain, it is not SQL itself, and has several distinct design 
differences.  Breaking out a separate "Syntax" namespace would imply 
a closer tie to the language than actually exists.  A 
SQL::SyntaxModel can represent the same concepts as SQL in an 
abstract fashion, but it is by no means a concrete syntax model, or 
will it ever be.  There are intentionally no parsers or generators 
included.

So I would like to stick with "SQL::SyntaxModel" please.

Thank you very much. -- Darren Duncan

would SQL::Syntax::Model also work?
