Thank you for the notice. I thought I had the first minimally working
version of this uploaded before I started work on supporting modules for
other database servers. As I actually had an inquiry into this module by
email just a few weeks ago.

I'm off camping this weekend, but will check my PAUSE account when I get
back. Sorry for any inconvenience

Sincerely,
Sean.
