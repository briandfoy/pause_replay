The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Roguelike::Area
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Roguelike Area Map
  userid:      EARONESTY (Erik Aronesty)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    rec.games.roguelike.development

  similar:

  rationale:

    I think it should be easy for someone to write a roguelike in perl.

    The idea behind the library set is:

    a) ease of development without gameplay constraints b) reasonable
    efficiency and speed (which guided some object interface choices) c)
    full compatibility with other Games::Roguelike modules (of which
    there is only 1 now, but hopefully will be more)

  enteredby:   EARONESTY (Erik Aronesty)
  enteredon:   Sun Jan 18 04:31:05 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Roguelike::
::Area            bdpOp Roguelike Area Map                           EARONESTY
