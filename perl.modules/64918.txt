The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Syslog::OO
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Object-oriented wrapper around Sys::Syslog
  userid:      MAXSCHUBE (Max Schubert)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I first did a module like this in the late 90s, then threw it away
    as i was sure someone would do a better one. I needed that module
    again for a recent project but still do not see any like it on CPAN,
    so I have re-developed it and am submitting it to CPAN this time.

  enteredby:   MAXSCHUBE (Max Schubert)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar 14 03:30:26 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::Syslog::
::OO              Rdpfp Object-oriented wrapper around Sys::Syslog   MAXSCHUBE
