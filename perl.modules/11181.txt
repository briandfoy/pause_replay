The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::ASED
  DSLIP:       adpOd
  description: abstracts &  encapsulates file editing
  userid:      TDL (Tom Legrady)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    By providing an alternative interface to file editing
    functionality, Text::ASED makes it simpler to separate the file
    manipulation from the remainder of script code. This simplifies
    implementing Localization and Internationalization, since the
    regionally variant components are located in a configuration segment
    or even a separate file. Separating the components can make the code
    simpler to understand. Changing the file editing components can be
    peformed with minimal risk of damaging the actual code, since the
    two are no longer intermingled.

    Eventually, I would like to implement a GUI interface to assist in
    generating the external description files.

The resulting entry would be:
