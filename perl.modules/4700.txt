Greetings!

Back in October of Last year, I registered as a developer and I submitted
a module called TextList.pm - it is a Tk module.

This module was originally created by Greg London, and he had 
given me permission to take over maintenance duties. I have updated
this module twice since then (I just updated Pause a moment ago),
and I'm a little bit confused. Why is this module not showing up
in the Tk directory?

Regards,

Rob Seegel
