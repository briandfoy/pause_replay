Almost certainly rejected

Firstly, the letters are based specifically on the ISO two-letter codes 
for the languages, and in lingua they are primarily used to namespace 
collision reasons, rather than existing themselves. Is ES the actual 
standard two letter for spanish? (I'd say probably, but please confirm).

Secondly, Lingua::Romanus::Perligata was created before or at about the 
time of the creation of Acme:: a namespace explicitly for fun and weird 
modules.

If this is a specifically a fun module, it should be put under Acme::. 
If it will actually be used in production code, then you may wish to put 
it somewhere specific under Lingua::ES::... Perhaps Lingua::ES::Perl.

Thanks
