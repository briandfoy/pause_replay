The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAP::WSDL
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Complete WSDL support for SOAP::Lite
  userid:      MKUTTER (Martin Kutter)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    SOAP::WSDL provides WSDL support for SOAP::Lite. As SOAP::Lite uses
    SOAP::Schema::WSDL for it's own WSDL support, the SOAP::WSDL
    namespace looks like the best choice.

    SOAP::WSDL is likely to be the first search result when users are
    looking for modules providing WSDL support for the SOAP protocol -
    and that's exactly what the module does.

  enteredby:   MKUTTER (Martin Kutter)
  enteredon:   Fri Jul  9 09:15:07 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SOAP::
::WSDL            adpOa Complete WSDL support for SOAP::Lite         MKUTTER
