     This is a request for feedback or comment
on my plan to register PDL::Graphics::POGL
on the PAUSE namespace to suport refactoring
of PDL::Graphics::TriD et. al. for PDL-2.4.4.

Namespace:

  PDL::Graphics::POGL

Purpose:

  Refactor PDL 3D graphics routines to use the
  newly re-maintained Perl OpenGL (POGL) module.

  [ Thanks, Bob! http://graphcomp.com/opengl/ ]

Reasons:

 (1) Improve PDL portability: using POGL would us
     to abstract the 3D graphics support from the
     platform specific issues of OpenGL support.
     A 'cpan install PDL' would not fail just
     because the TriD part of the build failed.

 (2) Improved support for OpenGL APIs.  The current
     PDL::Graphics::OpenGL binding ported to PP
     from OpenGL-0.43 circa PDL-1.93 and has not
     been updated recently.
    
 (3) Moving to a more component based PDL
     framework should improve the useability and
     reliability of PDL.  The PDL core will be
     smaller and more focused.  Feedback via the
     CPAN testing framework should allow better
     debugging on multiple platforms.


My plan is to release an alpha development
module as soon as the next update to the POGL
with the support required for PDL integration
is released.
