Sending email to modules@perl.org (either manually, or by registering a
module through PAUSE, which sends an email there automatically) is the
only way I know of to reach those in charge.

I can sympathise with you; in one case, it took me about a year to get a
module of mine registered (there had been no negative comments; the
reminders every couple of months appeared simply to have been ignored).
However, there is nothing I can do to help you with this process except
ask you to be patient and to try again.

They may not be on the official module list but should still be
downloadable from your CPAN author directory and should be indexed on
sites such as http://search.cpan.org/ .

I'm afraid I don't know specifically who processes these registrations
(I know a couple of names who belong to modules@perl.org but I don't
know what their roles are, and I'm fairly certain there are other people
as well). Please continue to use modules@perl.org as your primary point
of contact.

Cheers,
Philip
