Hi,

I'm receiving this error trying to upload a module.

It failed the first time I uploaded it because the namespace was owned
by Graham Barr. I contacted Graham and asked for the namespace
(originally used by Scalar::Util, no longer used) and Graham replied
there's no use for it anymore and relinquished it.

However, reindex failed. Then trying to upload 0.001 failed because
the files already exist. Then uploading a new one still fails.

May I please receive the namespace now? :)
