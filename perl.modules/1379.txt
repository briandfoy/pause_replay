Hi, I'd like to add my module to the module list.
My CPAN ID is: NEDKONZ.

Here's the info:

Archive::Zip adpO  Provides an interface to ZIP archive files.

From the README:
--------------
The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate,
read, and write Zip archive files.

Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings.

Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and
enumerated.  They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or
other attributes queried or modified.  Their data can be compressed or
uncompressed as needed.  Members can be created from members in existing
Zip files, or from existing directories, files, or strings.

This module uses the Compress::Zlib library to read and write the
compressed streams inside the files.
--------------

I have posted a pointer to the comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup.

I have uploaded it to PAUSE:

/authors/id/N/NE/NEDKONZ/Archive-Zip-0.06.zip
/authors/id/N/NE/NEDKONZ/Archive-Zip-0.06.tar.gz

Several people have communicated with me about this, and have tested
the module on Win32 (NT, Win95) and Linux.

Thanks,
Ned Konz
