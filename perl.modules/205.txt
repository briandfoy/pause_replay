Seven Steps To Start Selling Online
*****************************************

----Step 1----
Shop Around

It's a basic step, but an essential one. Put yourself in the
shoes (or in this case, at the keyboard) of your customer. See how other
stores present products and services like the ones you plan to offer. Get 
a
feel for what types of bells and whistles you would like to include in the
store you build.

----Step 2----
Solidify Your Plan

You'll want to be sure your small business is ready for e-commerce 
*before* you get into the intricacies of building a store. You'll need to know
details ahead of time, such as:

* What types of products and services you will offer.
* Will your prices be higher or lower than local retail stores.
* How you will handle order fulfillment & shipping.
* How you will handle sales calls & customer service.
* How you will guarantee satisfaction & handle returns.
* How you will handle international orders, if at all.

Remember that just because a particular product sells well in retail 
stores, it won't necessarily sell well online. In fact, many products 
cannot be sold easily over the Internet because of factors like high 
shipping costs, high product liability issues, or the need for personal 
salesmanship.

Before building your online store, evaluate your products' suitability for
online sales. An objective assessment can save you much time and expense 
in the long run.

----Step 3----
Keep It Simple, To Start

A common mistake is to attempt to develop a site that turns out to be too
complex to ever be implemented. Often, well-intentioned projects never get
off the ground because of unrealistic expectations and mounting technical
costs.

To avoid over-engineering your online store, start simply by identifying 
the most basic goals, and implement those to begin. You can always add 
more bells and whistles after the basic system is in place, and sales have 
begun.

----Step 4----
Pick a Provider

When it comes to the nuts and bolts of building an e-commerce store, 
there's good news, especially for beginners. Many e-commerce solutions 
providers are now teaming with ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and Web 
hosting services, a trend that makes it easy to find a one-stop solution 
for doing business on the internet. These new partnerships often combine 
site hosting, store setup, and credit card processing into a single package 
specifically designed for e-commerce beginners.

Let your store-hosting service worry about fending off internet hackers 
and handling "back-end" technical issues, so you can concentrate on selling 
your products and marketing your store.

----Step 5----
Address Security Issues

If you want to host your own e-commerce site, you need to make network
security a top priority, even before your e-commerce site goes live. 
Unless you are an experienced network administrator, you should seriously 
consider retaining the services of a network security expert who can install
specialized security software.

If you are a beginner, as we mentioned above, your best bet is to use a
turnkey hosting service that will take care of most security issues for 
you.

----Step 6----
Develop a Professional Design

Once you've settled on a provider for hosting your site and handling 
payment processing, you'll want to concentrate on the front-end interface 
and design. A word of advice: Don't Skimp on Design.

Without a professional, marketing-oriented, easy-to-use page layout, even
the most sophisticated back-end technologies won't be enough to drive your
e-commerce sales success. If you are serious about building a successful
e-commerce site, make sure that the design works to your advantage, rather
than becoming a cause of lost sales opportunities.

----Step 7----
Be Accessible

Always make it easy for your shoppers to contact you by e-mail, phone or
fax. Keep in mind that the internet is a global medium. When possible, you
may want to provide a toll-free telephone number for customers within your
region (such as an 800 number in the U.S.), as well as a standard 
telephone number that works around the world. Prominent contact information on each
page of your site will help convey to shoppers that you are a reliable
source, dedicated to customer satisfaction.

Tips of the week

A new Trojan horse (rather than virus) is in circulation. It was
recently detected (15 Sept) and claims to be a Year 2000 countdown timer
provided by Microsoft. It is distributed by email, supposedly from
Microsoft, and the virus is contained in an attachment called
Y2KCOUNT.EXE Other aliases of this particular virus include Count2K,
Troj.Polyglot and Troj_Polyglot.

However, please be aware that although the URL and some of the text use the
word "hoax", this is a REAL trojan horse
