Hi Brenden,

I have been using your IMAP::Client module from cpan for quite a while 
now and have had to make several custom changes to fix bugs. I've also 
noticed that there are several bug reports with patches on cpan going 
back 2 years which haven't been addressed. It looks like you stopped 
maintaining the module a long time ago. I would like your permission to 
take over maintenance and development of the module if possible?

I am sure I tried to contact you in the past regarding bugs without 
getting a response, but I no longer have a copy of the emails that I 
sent. I just wanted you to know that if I don't hear back from you 
within a couple of weeks, I'll assume that you've disappeared for good 
and will follow the advice on 
http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_04about#takeover 
regarding obtaining "co-maintenance permissions"

Regards,
