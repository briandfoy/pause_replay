The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unique::Lines
  DSLIP:       Mdpfo
  description: Update file having duplicated lines with uni
  userid:      KPAWAR (Kiran Rajendrasa Pawar)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    Perl groups on LinkedIn.

  similar:
    there might modules like this in CPAN, but i think this approach of
    doing the same thing is easy and straightforward.

  rationale:

    I have given Unique::Lines namespace to the module because it
    updates the file having duplicated lines with unique lines in a
    file.

    There might modules like this in CPAN, but the approch i have used
    is, i think unique and different.

    And it's doesn't depend on any other module, and i have read and
    written the same file in easy way.

  enteredby:   KPAWAR (Kiran Rajendrasa Pawar)
  enteredon:   Wed Aug 27 13:38:26 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Unique::
::Lines           Mdpfo Update file having duplicated lines with uni KPAWAR
