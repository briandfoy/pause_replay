The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Template::Set
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: HTML::Template extension adding set support
  userid:      DJR (David Radunz)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    email

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    I had a mod_perl application that worked in an opposite direction,
    that being the templates were handled by a 'handler'. So for the
    'handler' to know how to handle the template I needed to set a
    paramater in the template. The old templating system I was using
    supported this, but didnt handle nested if's very well and I wanted
    to use HTML::Template. I decided I would write this module, now I
    can have <TMPL_SET NAME="handler">index</TMPL_SET> and sub index
    will be called to handle my template.

  enteredon:   Fri Apr 30 00:43:23 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::Template::
::Set             bdpOg HTML::Template extension adding set support  DJR
