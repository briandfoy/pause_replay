I found the note I had from Stacy Lacy once upon a time. It was a
newsgroup posting as well; I've included it here.

It seems pretty clear that adoption is okay with Stacy Lacy.

Thanks, I wrote HTML::Table more than a year ago as an exercise learn
Perl 5 OO techniques.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to spend any
time on it for many months.

This is a formal offer to turn over HTML::Table to anyone who has time
to maintain it.  I have received email from about 45 or 50 people who
are using it in a production web site some quite extensively. 
Additionally I have had several requests for enhancements that are
stacked up.

If it makes sense, I will turn over the name HTML::Table and you can use
that name for your much more feature rich HTML::Element::Table module. 
The only concern I have is maintaining a level of compatiblity with the
previous version so it doesn't break all the existing code out there.

Your thoughts.
