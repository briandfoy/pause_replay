Hi,
   The following is the description of the package that I wish to
contribute to CPAN. (I have already sent this desc. while registering for
a CPAN id. My CPAN id is UARUN).

  perlPOS is implemented purly in Perl (no XS) and it consists of a
number of packages (in the order of 25-30 packages). I am however a bit
unsure about the namespace to choose. 
    
  I would like to use one of the following toplevel names

       a) POS::
       b) perlPOS::  (or)
       c) pPOS:: 

  Which one of the above should I use ?


Regards,
Arun
