Hmmm...  if that's the only problem you have with it, I'm glad...  ;-)

I was considering something like this, but thought the huffmann coded name 
Thread::Needs would be sufficient.

Do you have anything particular in mind with which Thread::Needs could 
confuse people (other than it being applicable to modules?).

I thought that:

   Thread::Needs qw(This::Module That::Module);

is pretty descriptive and shows what it's supposed to do.  But then I may 
be suffering from tunnel vision in this respect... ;-)
