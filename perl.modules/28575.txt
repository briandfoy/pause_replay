I would like to use cpan to load perl modules.  But I think during
my 1st setup of cpan on my server, I set something up wrong.  Any
time I download a module, it can't do a "make" on it.  I think I may
need to "re" setup cpan on my server.  Can you tell me how to do
this?=20

My current errors look like this:

=20 CPAN.pm: Going to build L/LD/LDS/CGI.pm-3.04.tar.gz

Checking if your kit is complete...
Looks good
Writing Makefile for CGI
=20   -- NOT OK
Running make test
=20 Can't test without successful make
Running make install
=20 make had returned bad status, install seems impossible

Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
