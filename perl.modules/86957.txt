The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::LongPath
  DSLIP:       bdchp
  description: Win32 support for very long paths & Unicode
  userid:      RBOISVERT (Robert Boisvert)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    https://github.com/rdboisvert/Win32-LongPath

  similar:
    Win32::Unicode Win32

  rationale:

    This is a Windows module supporting very long paths and Unicode by
    "normalizing" the path to an extended-length path and calling the
    Windows wide-character functions. Output paths are "denormalized" to
    regular DOS paths that can be manipulated using functions like
    catfile, catdir, splitpath, etc.

    It works in the WinXP to Windows 8 environment.

    It attempts to emulate the existing native Perl file functions as
    closely as possible (e.g. open, symlink, link, opendir, unlink,
    rmdir, etc.)

    Although Win32::Unicode is similar in its ability to deal with
    Unicode, it doesn't support extended-length paths and deals more
    with Unicode paths. I was unable to get a response from the author
    about extending its capabilities.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::LongPath        bdchp Win32 support for very long paths & Unicode  RBOISVERT
