The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Eng::Naval
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: ITTC Power Prediction Procedure

  rationale:

    I herewith would like to reapply for the namespace Eng::Naval or
    alternatively Eng::Marine after having received kind encouragement
    by your fellow PAUSE maintainer Adam Kennedy. To start with
    something less involved from the vast array of naval architecture
    applications I would like to implement the ITTC'78 Performance
    Prediction Method in a Perl module named Eng::Naval::ITTC78 The
    procedure is outlined in this publicly available document:
    http://ittc.sname.org/2002_recomm_proc/7.5-02-03-01.4.pdf As I
    selected the module state above as "idea" I haven't even started
    writing it yet. I hope I will find time starting with it over the
    Xmas bank holidays. However I need to let you know that I am not a
    developer but merely a Unix system administrator (with a naval
    architecture background) who has been using Perl for the last five
    years to the greatest pleasure for all kinds of mundane Unix admin
    tasks. This would probably disqualify me as a CPAN contributor, and
    I am quite aware of the total uselessness of a module like
    Eng::Naval::ITTC78 for anyone else. My hope nevertheless is that an
    Eng namespace will raise other CPAN authors' interest who can do
    better than me to come up with their own engineering applications
    (maybe even naval architecture ones?).

    Many thanks for your kind attention
