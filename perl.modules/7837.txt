short description of what I am planning to contribute :

Mail::SpamPunisher

This package would work in conjunction with Mail::SpamAssassin, not
as tightly coupled modules, but rather in abstract sense where a user
uses existing Mail::SpamAssassin to identify existing spam threats
and block them while they utilize active response techniques provided
by the Mail::SpamPunisher to further protect themselves, by either
getting out of the spam lists that could be done for example by sending
message
replies defined by the user back to spam facility that look something
like:

>>Unsolicited email advertizing hurts me. I run a service which answers
children's email science questions, >>and it is being significantly
damaged by the flood of unsolicitied advertizing. Eskimo.com blocks most
>>spam, but still I must read up to 30 ads a day before deleting them,
because I
>>cannot take a chance and delete a child's message.
>>I only have about 1/2hr per day to help kids, so you can imagine that
the spam plague is seriously hurting >>my service.

Other active response techniques could involve slightly more drastic
mesaures being taken
that stay within the perimeter of law.
