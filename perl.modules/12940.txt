Subject: Question about the Net::FTP Perl module

Hi - I'm investigating the installation of the Net::FTP module for Perl 5.
Can you tell me what (if any) other Perl modules the Net::FTP pm depends on?
One of our Unix administrators has told me that the Net::FTP module must be
installed along with 1 or 2 other modules (for a total of 2 or 3), but I
cannot find any documentation that affirms that.

Can you offer some help for me please?  The modules will be installed on Sun
Solaris 7 and 8 servers that are running Perl 5.005_02.

Thank you very much for your help.
