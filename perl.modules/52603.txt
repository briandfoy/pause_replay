	Sure. Is there any administrivia I need to do on the CPAN end
of things for this, or will it pick up as soon as you release a new
version?
	For what it's worth, the reason there haven't been any new
updates is that the package is nearly complete: there aren't any major
bugs that I can remember, and no one's been clamoring for major new
features.
