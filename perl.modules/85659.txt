     why:

    Hi PAUSE team,

    because i did not got any response for my first request a half year
    ago this is my second try.

    Att i've wrote some modules within a specialized PBX project
    (Asterisk pbx) which could be useful to others and i want to publish
    fully as open source.

    There are modules like for:

    - speed up Asterisk IVR (AGI) programming in Perl

    - Interfaces to different free TTS (TextToSpeech) Systems and
    Services incl. automatic caching and more - could be used in very
    different circumstances (not only Aterisk or PBXes).

    - A small class for data exchange and remote procedure calls on
    ZOPE over the net.

    Additionally i work on a fork of the (old and partly outdated)
    Harvest-NG - may be there will come some usuable work out for CPAN
    users in the next monthes or so.

    It would be very nice to get part of the CPAN community.

    Many thanks in advance and best regards,

    Niels.
