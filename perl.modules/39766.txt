I'm hoping to upload a new module to interact with the new Web services
interface on upcoming.org.  This message:

<http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/w3glimpse2html/modules/2004-04/msg00
277.html>

...was the only reference I could find to Web services namespaces in the
list archive, so I've built my module as WWW::Service::Upcoming::API.

The justification is that soon many, many Web sites are going to have
either standardized or custom Web service interfaces, and a unique
namespace will prevent them from polluting the root level.  (Flickr::API
is a bad example to follow, I think, for this reason.)  Dropping it in
XML seems counterintuitive since the code exists to _hide_ the transport
mechanism.

The third element of the namespace above shouldn't strictly be defined
as a site name: it may be a library used across multiple sites for
instance.  (See http://getluky.net/freetag/ -- a Perl client-side to
this could be in WWW::Service::Freetag::API.  A Perl implementation of
the server-side could be in WWW::Service::Freetag.)

Thanks.
