Also SVN::Simple, which only implements Edit(or).

But this module would still require that the Perl bindings be installed?  Or are 
you proposing to create a completely new XS/C interface to the Subversion API? 
Have you discussed this on the Subversion devel list?  I have a somewhat stale 
branch (with another person) in the main Subversion repo devoted to bringing the 
Perl SWIG bindings up to par with the Python bindings, so I'm intensely 
interested in your ideas/plans.

But I don't think this is the best module name (in particular the ::Light or 
::Lite distinction often hides the real focus of the class)...
