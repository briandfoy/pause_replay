Subject: RE: BerkeleyDB::Tie module 

Hi Jim,

sorry for the delay it getting back to you. I was on leave for a couple of
weeks and have been slowly working my way through my mail mountain ever
since.

Regarding your module, it sounds like a really good idea. Here are a couple
of random comments.

The use of the &incrementkeys and &duplicatekeys seems a bit strange. I can
see what you are using it for, but I'm not sure about the approach. Perhaps
you could hide the gory details like this?

  my $dupdb = new BerkeleyDB::Tie::Btree(
		home => 'zoo',
		filename => 'bigcats',
		incrementkeys => 1,
		) ;

then get the new method to map the incrementkeys parameter to "sub { $_[0]
<=> $_[1] }".

Regarding the documentation, I really like the use of examples, but the
thing that is missing is manual page definitions of the interface (I'm a
fine one to tell you this given the sad state of my own documentation).

I'd fire it onto CPAN.

cheers
Paul
