I assume with 'folder' you mean 'namespace'? Namespaces are mapped to
folders upon installation.

Don't think so. Where would this folder be reserved? In the Perl core
kit? No way. On the user's disk? We cannot speak for the individual
user.

Looks okay to me. Category 24, Commercial_Software_Interfaces?

If you want to distribute w/o CPAN, why reserve a CPAN namespace?

Actually, your proposal confuses me.
