Subject: Module submission Audio::DB

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::DB
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Relational DBs of digital audio collections
  userid:      TWH (Todd Harris)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    previously known as Music::DB

  rationale:

    Note: A request for listing of this module in the registry under
    the namespace Music::DB was submitted last week. Brian Foy
    rightfully suggested that perhaps it belonged more appropriately
    under Audio:: since it can handle audio files that may not be music.

    Rationale: Audio::DB makes it easy to create relational DBs of
    digital audio collections. It has its own internal schema to
    represent the relationships between artists, albums, genres, and so
    forth. Building a database of audio file meta data is a common task
    of anyone working programmatically with digital audio files. For
    this reason, I believe it should be listed in the registry.

    Databases supported and schema: Audio::DB uses an database adaptor
    based approach, currently supporting MySQL and SQLite. The
    underlying schema has support for a number of as-yet unimplemented
    features, including multiple users, playlists, ratings, play counts,
    and last played statistics. Although the underlying schema is
    hard-coded it is easily extensible.

    Database creation: Databases can be created from tab-delimited flat
    files, XML files (of the sort used by iTunes), or read from music
    files directly.

    Querying and reporting: In addition to the databasing facilities,
    Audio::DB comes with a variety of modules for querying and reporting
    on collection. Also included are some handy GD-based scripts that
    generate, say, histograms of the growth of your collection over
    time.

    Visualization: Audio::DB also contains a rudimentary web-based
    interface to the database via Audio::DB::Web and an included cgi.
    Contributions are welcome and encouraged.
