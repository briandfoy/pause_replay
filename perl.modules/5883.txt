A short description of what I'm planning to contribute:
  A cool little package called File::CacheDir, which manages caching files
and cleanup without looking through a directory full of files and without
a cron.  The user passes a filename, a base path and a time to live and
based upon the time to live, a filename with full path is returned.  When
time to lives expire, directories automatically get cleaned up.
  Can also be used for automatically backing up files, or doing whatever
you like when ttl expires, because the package accepts passed code refs
for each step of the process.

  It isn't all that complicated, but it is really cool and has a ton of
uses.  I would just like to share it with the world.

Earl
