While I don't object, I'll just make the comment that I think you should 
be careful that this doesn't turn into a conglomerate dist like bioperl 
where you can only update the entire thing in one go.

If you note the approach taken for several other countries, individual 
pieces such as Business::AU::ABN or Business::CN::IdentityCard are 
uploaded as standalone dists.

I think it is preferable to do it like this where the modules in 
question do not have any sort of intrinsic interelationship.

You can then have a Bundle::Business::BR if you wish to install all of 
the modules at once.

The real strength in CPAN is in having a larger number of smaller parts. 
Things that can be split should be.

Again, just something to consider.
