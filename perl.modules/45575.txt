Hi Salvatore,

Ron Savage discovered a bug in some older versions of Module::Build
that prevented the indexing of two of your distros on CPAN, namely
File-Samba-0.03 and SVN-SVNLook-0.02.

The indexer now has a workaround against this bug and your distros are
scheduled for reindexing. Sorry for the inconvenience, no further
action is required on your part. Just make sure you upgrade your
Module::Build before you release your next module. Thanks!

Ron, I've manually checked all other distros and they were all either
indexed before 2004-04-19 or are superceded by newer releases. So this
bug should now be extinguished. If you prefer to not make new releases
of your modules, just use the reindexing feature. The indexer now
ignores the META.yml 'provides' field if Module::Build's version is
lower than 0.26 and the provides field is an empty hashref.

No lets go back to our regular insanities:)
