The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Runtime cgiapp info in a popup window
  userid:      RHESA (Rhesa Rozendaal)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    IRC: #cgiapp, mailing list: cgiapp@lists.erlbaum.net, wiki:
    http://cgiapp.erlbaum.net

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This plugin has long been on the wanted list of web developers
    using CGI::Application (see
    http://cgiapp.erlbaum.net/cgi-bin/cgi-app/index.cgi?PluginsWanted).

    It presents reports about your application in a popup window. It
    has a flexible reporting interface, allowing anyone to add their own
    custom reports. It's a great help during development of web
    applications based on CGI::Application, because it consolidates all
    the various bits and pieces of runtime, debugging, logging and
    profiling information in one screen.

    This distribution comes with two reports: - incoming and outgoing
    http headers - timing information about the various stages

    Additionally, my CGI::Application::Plugin::HtmlTidy hooks into it,
    providing a html validation report of your output.

    Sam Tregar is working on a DBI profiling report, Cees Hek has added
    support to his CAP::TT plugin, and others are either working on or
    suggesting other reports.

    I'd like to have this module listed, because it fills an obvious
    need among users of CGI::Application. The extra visibility might
    help us to attract new users, and - who knows - having all this
    debugging and runtime information at your fingertips might result in
    a better web.

    You can see a demo at http://oss.rhesa.com/scripts/dp.cgi .
