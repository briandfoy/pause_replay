The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Upload
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: CGI class for handling browser file uploads
  userid:      ROBAU (Rob Casey)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    previously discussed at
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=150713

  similar:
    CGI File::MMagic HTTP::File (old)

  rationale:

    This module has been written to provide a simple and secure manner
    by which to handle files uploaded in multipart/form-data requests
    through a web browser. The primary advantage which this module
    offers over the existing modules with similar functionality is a
    single interface which provides the most often required information
    regarding uploaded files ( file name, file handle [file stored
    within temporary file generated via new_tmpname function of IO::File
    which offers secure, non-predictive file names], file type [as
    specified by file extension], and mime type [for validation of the
    nature of the uploaded file] ) - This is performed making use of the
    existing CGI and File::MMagic methods (although there is some
    overlap) and offers a very tidy, succinct interface for working with
    multiple file uploads.

    This module to my mind represents a very nature extension of the
    existing modules.

    This code is at near-release stage having gone through some review
    and feedback on PerlMonks prior to this application for name space.
    The only requirements at this point prior to release onto CPAN
    (pending namespace approval) in a near-complete form is some
    additional POD documenation.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
