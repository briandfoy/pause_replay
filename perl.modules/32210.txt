The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Closure
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Encapsulated, declarative class syntax
  userid:      LPALMER (Luke Palmer)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::Declare, Class::Struct

  rationale:

    I was going to choose Class::Declare, but it was already taken.
    Class::Closure seems appropriate, since the primary method by which
    the classes access their data is through closures.

  enteredby:   LPALMER (Luke Palmer)
  enteredon:   Mon May 24 18:40:50 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Closure         bdphp Encapsulated, declarative class syntax       LPALMER
