The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SGML::Parser::OpenSP
  DSLIP:       cd+Op
  description: XS Interface to the OpenSP (X|SG)ML Parser
  userid:      LINK (Terje Bless)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    SGML::Grove SGMLSpm

  rationale:

    SGML::Parser::OpenSP aims to be a "native" XS interface to the
    OpenSP SGML and XML Parser -- and specifically to OpenSP as opposed
    to "a generic SGML Parser" -- that does not just wrap an external
    binary like "onsgmls" (SGMLSpm) and does not make assumptions about
    what you intend to use the module for (SGML::Grove).

    In particular, it will be focussed on Validating SGML and XML and
    any buzzwords implemented (DOM, SAX, etc.) will be a secondary
    thing.

    Eventually it may end up as one of multiple pluggable backends for
    the SGML::Parser module from SGMLSpm (at which point the two may end
    up beeing merged instead of beeing separate modules).

  enteredon:   Sun May 25 16:11:48 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SGML::Parser::
::OpenSP          cd+Op XS Interface to the OpenSP (X|SG)ML Parser   LINK
