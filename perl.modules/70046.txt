I think I'm just missing the point of your module. Based on what I see
in the documentation, I don't think you are actually working with sets
(and neither is Set::Array) in the expected sense of that word.

     http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Set.html

It looks like you merely have something that gives you array and list
operations on an arrayref. 

Maybe Array::AsObject would work.
