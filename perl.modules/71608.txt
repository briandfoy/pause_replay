(I already submitted this module via pause.perl.org but, since I did
 not see it in http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules, I'm
 resending it here in case it got lost somewhere...)

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Directory::Queue
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO interface to a directory based queue
  userid:      LCONS (Lionel Cons)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    IPC::DirQueue Queue::Dir File::Queue

  rationale:

    This module implements a directory-based queue. It focuses on
    simplicity, robustness and scalability.

    Compared to the existing implementations, its main differences are:
     - any type of data can be stored in the queue (not only a single
       string/file)
     - it scales well to millions of entries without performance
       degradation
     - it is multilingual since a Python implementation will be
       available too

  enteredby:   LCONS (Lionel Cons)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun  7 11:49:24 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Directory::
::Queue           bdpOp OO interface to a directory based queue      LCONS
