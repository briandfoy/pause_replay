One reason could be speed.
That's why Brent Powers has long time ago written a similar module:
String::Strip

Let's look to it's description:
                                                               
DESCRIPTION

   StripLTSpace - Removes Leading and Trailing spaces from given string

   StripTSpace - Removes Trailing spaces from given string

   StripLSpace - Removes Leading spaces from given string

   StripSpace - Removes all spaces from given string

   I do these things often, and these routines tend to be about 35%
faster than the corresponding regex methods.


It seems, that String::Strip has all trim functions,
used in many languages.
I don't understand why we need an extra module String::Trim.

Greetings,
Andrea
