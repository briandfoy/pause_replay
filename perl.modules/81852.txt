Approximate two week reminder as requested. (Note HIDE modules were =
sorted, the two IKUTU RabbitMQ
 modules still outstanding)..

Timely for me right now - as I'm likely to have tuits during YAPC to do =
the work and testing to get these sorted. (And entirely selfishly, I'l =
love to be able to suggest using an un-patched amqp stack in production =
in my talk... ;_)

Cheers
