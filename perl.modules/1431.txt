Your call has been heard, thank you (No sarkasm). Please accept my
sincerest apologies, yada yada...

I muchly prefer Statistics::, partly because it exists already, partly
because I have always seen simulation as a branch of statistics.

The module list as of this moment contains:

Statistics::
::ConwayLife      adpr Simulates life using Conway's algorithm      DANB

Are you on VMS? I find, that's a bit of a mess to push VMS file naming
restrictions onto the rest of the world. If it's possible to you, I'd
appreciate if you could use a filename that fits into the family.

But that's probably just my way to see it.

 > Thank you!

Thanks to you! You know, there is a little HTTP form now that makes
this kind of work a tiny little bit easier, so your call maybe has
helped to expedite registrations in the future.
