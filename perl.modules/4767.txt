Hi.  I recently registered as a PAUSE developer (KARLWARD), getting the
namespace Music::GUIDO for my Perl module.  I'm about to upload my module,
but I have a question.

I got the namespace Music::GUIDO, but I need to use the namespace
Music::GUIDO::Event, since now the Music::GUIDO module relies on a module
called Event that uses Music::GUIDO subroutines (->new, ->print, ->AUTOLOAD,
etc.).  

Should I also register this namespace (Music::GUIDO::Event)?  Should I
change my code so the Music::GUIDO::Event stuff is appended to the GUIDO.pm
file (as a separate package namespace)?  

Thanks for your help.
