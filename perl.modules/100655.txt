Hi Fredrik!

Thanks very much for getting back to me, and for letting me maintain 
your module.

I've CC'd the modules@ list and Neil, who has been my contact on this.

P.S.: Java gives me conniptions, too...

I notice you had some future plans to implement that, but the last update to the module was nearly seven years ago. Did you ever end up implementing fragmentation support? And do you have any plans to work on the module anytime soon? If not, would you consider passing the maintainer torch? I'd be able to keep it maintained along with other ongoing work I'm doing.

I'm very happy to pass Maintainer to you for this module.
Sadly, I never got around to implementing it, and I hardly ever have
time for Minecraft development anymore. On one side, that's a good
thing (Java is ... not a favorite), but I do miss it sometimes.
I hope you treat the module better than I have.

I've just confirmed with the powers that be that you're to have full access.

Hi Fredrik!

I'm looking at the Minecraft::RCON module you've written. It looks great, and I would like to use it in a project of mine, but the lack of fragmentation support is a problem. I notice you had some future plans to implement that, but the last update to the module was nearly seven years ago. Did you ever end up implementing fragmentation support? And do you have any plans to work on the module anytime soon? If not, would you consider passing the maintainer torch? I'd be able to keep it maintained along with other ongoing work I'm doing.
