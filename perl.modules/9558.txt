The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DHCP::Server
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: DHCP Server code
  userid:      JWALGENB (Josh Walgenbach)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am currently developing a native perl DHCP server for my employer
    (Indiana University) to better implement classes and DDNS.

    Since I am doing this work anyway, and I have built Net::DHCPClient
    (hopefully to be renamed Net::DHCP::Client) and they share
    signficant amounts of code, it seems as though this should be
    released as well.

  enteredby:   JWALGENB (Josh Walgenbach)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan  7 00:16:28 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::DHCP::
::Server          adpOp DHCP Server code                             JWALGENB
