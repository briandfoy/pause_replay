Hi Kim!

I'd like to comaintain this CPAN distribution of yours -
https://metacpan.org/release/gettext , which has been suffering from
accumulating test failures and bug reports, and other bitrot , and did not =
have
a release since 2005.

My CPAN username is "SHLOMIF" and you can find my active MetaCPAN page here:

* https://metacpan.org/author/SHLOMIF=20

While I'm in the neighbourhood, I'd like to ask whether you'll agree to cha=
nge
the licence of "gettext" to a better one such as the Artistic 2.0 licence o=
r to
the MIT/X11 licence. See:

http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/foss-licences-wa=
rs/#which-licence-same-as-perl

If I don't receive a reply in a few weeks, I'd like to ask the CPAN admins =
to
give me a COMAINT bit for it.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
