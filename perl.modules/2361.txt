Hi, I've written a module which implements the algorithm for a
password generator, specified in a standards document, namely
FIPS 181 (on-line at http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip181.htm )

Any ideas on what to call it?  My initial inclination was to
have FIPS181 in the name.  It goes against the adage, "names
should not say HOW", but in this case, many of the module's
potential users will be looking specifically for an implementation
of this standard, since it is *required* in some gov't agencies.

I'm also not sure what top-level to put it under; maybe 
Crypt:: or Authen::.
