The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Vector
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: allows creation and use of 3-D vectors
  userid:      WSYVINSKI (Wayne M. Syvinski)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module was created for science and engineering applications.
    It allows the usual vector operations (dot product, cross product),
    plus some operations in analytical geometry (calculating normal
    vectors of planes from points), conversion from IJK or ai + bj + ck
    (string) notation to the mathematical representation, and a function
    that calculates the vector necessary to bring an arbitrary number of
    vectors into equilibrium. I believe this can be a very useful module
    for scientists and engineers (and students of same) who have an
    interest in Perl (or it might get them interested in Perl :) )

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::Vector          MdpOp allows creation and use of 3-D vectors       WSYVINSKI
