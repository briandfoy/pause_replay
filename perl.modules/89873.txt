The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LaTeXML
  DSLIP:       Mmpnd
  description: LaTeXML a LaTeX to XML/HTML/MathML converter
  userid:      BRMILLER (Bruce Miller)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://lists.jacobs-university.de/mailman/listinfo/project-latexml,
    https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML

  similar:

  rationale:

    LaTeXML is an application, rather than collection of modules,
    although it is of course implemented as a collection of perl modules
    with LaTeXML as the top-level namespace.

    LaTeXML is the name that has been used for this program for almost
    10 years and is the name that it is known by in the communities that
    use it. Thus it would be the most appropriate namespace to place it
    in.

    Also, there are several plugins/extensions for the system that
    could naturally go underneath that namespace within the CPAN
    universe. Things like LaTeXML-Plugin-foo; (but we're open to
    learning about good cpan-friendly design patterns for dealing with
    extensions)

    Could possibly also be listed in Chapter 015
    World_Wide_Web-HTML_HTTP_CGI, but I suspect the Text one is best.

The resulting entry would be:

LaTeXML           Mmpnd LaTeXML a LaTeX to XML/HTML/MathML converter BRMILLER
