Howdy,

I've written a module and I don't know if it is worth
putting it in CPAN and what namespace to use.

OK, I bought a Card from Conrad (German electronic stuff
dealer) which has 8 Relais on it to control electronic
circuits. It is connected to the serial port.

So I wrote a Module which utilizes Device::SerialPort
to control the card(s).

Looking at the CPAn module list I don't have an glue
about what namespace to use. It is indeed a kind of
a hardware driver. It is also a device.
In the cpan module list all the modules look very
generic. Where to put a module for only one specific
need?

Before I will register at PAUSE I would like to hear
some opinions.

Please reply to my email address as I'm not subscribed
to the module list.

thanks in advance,

Norbert
