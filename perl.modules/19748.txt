Hi,

Whenever(1) I upload a new module, I register it as recommended.
But what happens next?

I'm asking because I only ever received response about Attribute::Property. 
It seems nothing was done with the 5 other namespace registrations.

What exactly does it mean if you don't get any response and the
namespace is not registered?

The modules are (in reversed Google order): PLP, Devel::GetSymbols, 
Crypt::Caesar, Math::Calc::Euro, Math::MagicSquare::Generator.

(1) Not really. Because of the silence after registration I forgot to
register some more recent modules.


regards,

Juerd
