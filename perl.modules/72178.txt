Certainly, it's not my choice, let alone my first choice. If I were
forced to argue for it, I'd say that it is a development tool of no
interest to the end user. The key feature both of the original
Smart::Comments and of Devel::Comments is the filtering of
specially-formatted comments into executable code. Some of the
filtered-in code calls routines in the module itself; that is, the
module filters source and then execution returns to it later. I have
trouble stretching 'normal operation' to cover that. This is essentially
a modified execution environment with a primitive, alternate, terse
syntax of its own -- a syntax I expect to extend considerably in
response to feature requests already made. 

Guys in here argue for the fork as a new version of Smart::Comments but
CHORNY is non-responsive and DCONWAY does not favor the idea. I haven't
seen here (modules@perl.org) any strong feeling for any other name that
might apply to the fork. 

Guys in PerlMonks argue strongly for 'Devel::Comments', DCONWAY endorses
it. One argument made in favor
[http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=851233]: 

    perl -d:Comments script.pl

I had not considered this but now I have it in hand to support this use.
Personally, I just want to dump variables with a minimum of keystrokes.
Others see a wider application. 

There's even sentiment for 'Smarter::Comments'. If that emerged as the
group choice, I'd likely abandon the work in despair.

The project has been stalled for nearly 3 weeks on this name change
issue. It took me several hours to make the global change. If you want
to fight it out with the 'Devel::Comments' backers, I'll be neutral. But
I think it's fair for me to ask for an extremely solid reversal of
consensus before I go through another global name change or interrupt
the package/upload process. 

No name will make everyone happy. I see other authors not bother to RFC
their module names at all; some seem to ignore every principle of module
naming stated at
[https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_namingmodules].
They get indexed and I don't know why. 

I'd like to think I've done enough. If I'm wrong, please tell me so
directly. I don't have to do this as a CPAN upload; I just thought it
would be polite.

Sorry to be overly literal but I don't understand that statement. My
perception is that there is a group of people who review module
submissions and either do or do not index them; it's not automatic. My
opinion is that a module that isn't indexed is wasted effort. That may
be overly broad but if nobody is allowed to find Devel::Comments, I
don't know that many will use it. 

If I'm running into a wall here, please just say so. I have other
projects waiting on my free time and perhaps one of those will be of
wider appeal.
