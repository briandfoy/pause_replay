The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::StripAccents
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Convert accented characters to unaccented.
  userid:      CCOLBOURN (Charles Colbourn)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I've had requirement to replace accented characters with their
    unaccented equivalents a few times, for usernames/legacy systems
    etc; and a question was raised on Perlmonks a while back about the
    same thing. This is a very simple module, but it does save rewriting
    code.

  enteredby:   CCOLBOURN (Charles Colbourn)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 13 14:30:35 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::StripAccents    adphp Convert accented characters to unaccented.   CCOLBOURN
