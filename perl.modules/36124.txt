     why:

    I am a Perl Programmer/Bioinformaticist at the Center for Inherited
    Disease Research (CIDR) at the Johns Hopkins University School of
    Medicine

    I have written several modules for CIDR, ranging from simple
    database management routines to full-fledged genetic analysis
    applications, including a CIDR-wide Pure-Perl distributed computing
    platform consisting of modules that allow supercomputer-class
    analyses to be performed on commodity hardware. I plan on eventually
    uploading all as free software, as I feel the greater bioinformatics
    community could benefit from the use of these modules without having
    to re-invent the wheel. I also feel that I personally could benefit
    from collaborating with other Perl Developers in the community to
    develop free, quality software available to all.
