Hello...

My name: Gordon Dewis
My email: gordon@pinetree.org
Preferred user-id: GDEWIS

After searching for a Perl implementation of the NORAD SGP4/SDP4 orbit
models, I have decided to do the port myself.  It is based primarily on
the Pascal code written by Dr. T. S. Kelso (see www.celestrak.com), with
his blessing: 
-----8<----- 
No, I wouldn't mind at all. I have no
restrictions on how you use my code, only that you give proper credit for
the source. To date, nobody yet has asked about a Perl version, but that
would be an interesting addition. It certainly would make it easy to do
things on the web.

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Satellite      cdpO  NORAD SGP4/SDP4 orbit models                 GDEWIS

This module will have all the necessary methods to permit the calculation
of various orbit information for satellites based on NORAD two-line
elements (TLEs).  Possible applications include Perl-based satellite
tracking systems.

My personal homepage is http://www.pinetree.org/~gordon but I will
probably create a website specifically for this once I have finished
porting the code.

If you have any questions, please let me know!
