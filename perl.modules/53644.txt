Your suggestion was in a different thread ('Suggestions for naming 
please?'), I've cut in the relevant piece below. 'Leave off the Misc' 
sounded clear to me at the time :-)

So basically, we're back to square one - I couldn't find a great spot for 
it.... The name 'ProgressMonitor' should stay if possible (this is the name 
it has in the Java/Eclipse world), so it's really a namespace under which it 
should fit I need. My initial suggestion was 'UI' but you suggested not ('I 
wouldn't put it in a UI namespave because it's not an interface, it's just a 
display.')...

So...suggestions are still welcome :-)

Leave off the Misc. It doesn't add anything to the name.
