The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XDI::SPIT
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Single sign-on, data sharing using XRI/XDI
  userid:      EEKIM (Eugene Eric Kim)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://wiki.idcommons.net/, icdev@idcommons.net,
    xrixdi@idcommons.net

  similar:
    XRI

  rationale:

    XRI and XDI are OASIS standards for extended resource identifiers
    (next-generation URIs). The XDI::SPIT (which stands for Service
    Provider Interface Toolkit) module implements single-sign on using
    an XRI resolver (which was uploaded recently). There are also Java
    and PHP implementations of XDI::SPIT, which will be available soon
    as well.

    We're applying these standards towards building a distributed
    digital identity infrastructure that respects the rights and privacy
    of individuals. (Think Passport or Liberty Alliance, except users
    own their data, and the data is distributed.) It's a first
    implementation of the vision described in the Augmented Social
    Networks whitepaper (http://asn.planetwork.net/).

    A first demonstration of these technologies is happening this
    weekend at the PlaNetwork Conference in San Francisco
    (http://www.planetwork.net/2004conf/).

The resulting entry would be:
