The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Daemon::Simple
  DSLIP:       Rnpfl
  description: It makes a script a controlable daemon.
  userid:      KHS (HyeonSeung Kim)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Daemon::Generic,Proc::Daemon

  rationale:

    About functionality. Proc::Daemon has only make a process to a
    daemon without pid-controlling. But it has simple use(just call
    init() on top of a script).

    And Daemon::Generic has a rich pid-controlling and also has
    functionality making a daemon. But it has complex use(overloading
    two functions) and seems unstable sometimes.

    I needed a simple use and a simple pid-controlling. This
    module,Daemon::Simple has both. It is very easy to use and powerful.
    I am use it on my job which is encoding videos.

    About namespace. Already there is Daemon namespace. This module is
    special to making daemon. And it is simple to use. So I think that
    Daemon::Simple is fit.

The resulting entry would be:

Daemon::
::Simple          Rnpfl It makes a script a controlable daemon.      KHS
