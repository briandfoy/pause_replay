Dear Brian,

  Thx for reviewing this module. I agree with you, the name is not 
descriptive. Is it a real problem, as soon as it is always displayed 
with the given short description aside ?
If not, I'd like to keep it because  I like it . As a matter of fact, I 
like funny and abfuscated names ..
I'm maybe a bit too much geek :D

Best regards.

J.
