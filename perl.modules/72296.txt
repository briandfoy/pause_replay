I think you're confusing what makes a good module with what you need to
do to upload to PAUSE. It's so easy to upload to PAUSE that you don't
really need instructions. Just upload it in any of the ways mentioned
and explained on:

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri

For what makes a good module, well, there are lots of different
opinions on that, and it's not something PAUSE is there to help you
with. The module-authors mailing list might be a good place to talk
about that. :)
