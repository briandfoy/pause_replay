The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PGObject
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: Utilities for stored procedures and objects
  userid:      EINHVERFR (Chris Travers)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #ledgersmb,

  similar:
    Not really

  rationale:

    PGObject is a framework for building PostgreSQL-specific object
    models, largely based on the work that has gone on in LedgerSMB. The
    system would be of interest to people building PostgreSQL-specific
    applications as it will allow for a variety of methods for
    integrating stored procedures into object models in such a way as to
    best ensure maintainability. These modules are re-engineered based
    on the lessons learned and made more generally applicable.

  enteredby:   EINHVERFR (Chris Travers)
  enteredon:   Sat May 25 14:38:17 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

PGObject          RdpOb Utilities for stored procedures and objects  EINHVERFR
