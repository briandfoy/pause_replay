The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Hash::FixedKeys
  DSLIP:       Rdprp
  description: Hashes with a fixed set of keys
  userid:      DAVECROSS (Dave Cross)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    london.pm mailing list, perlmonks, article on perl.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is a very simple way to create hashes with a fixed set
    of keys. It does this by assigning undef to all the values when the
    hash is created and then foilng all attempts to add or remove keys
    from the hash.

    It is a subclass of Tie::StdHash.

    The name seems to follow the same rationale as many other Tied
    modules (e.g. Tie::Hash::Regex, Tie::Scalar::Timeout).

    The module was originally written to illustrate ideas in a perl.com
    article, but since I've uploaded it to CPAN people seem to find it
    useful. I therefore think it would be useful to have it in the
    module list.

    Thanks,

    Dave...

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::Hash::
::FixedKeys       Rdprp Hashes with a fixed set of keys              DAVECROSS
