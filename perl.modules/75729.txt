While important, "nested" and "composable" are very abstract features
that can apply to lots of scenarios.  I mulled on the name for a
while and think Data::Overlay is better.  It has the same
advantages as "tweak" (except obscurity) and is more suggestive of
non-mutating changes.

There's also a draft version at:

https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/B/BO/BOWMANBS/Data-Overlay-0.51-TRIAL.tar.gz

My tweak advantages, for context:

I was partly making this submission to get "dibs" on the name,
does it work that way?

Thanks,

Brad
