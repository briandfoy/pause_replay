Dear PAUSE Admins,

Can you drop ADOPTME from the HouseURL module please?

It was originally included in Simon Cozens' Apache-OneTimeURL =
distribution.
Simon told me in email that it shouldn't really have ever been included.
I was given co-maint of Apache::OneTimeURL and did a release of =
Apache-OneTimeURL that didn't include HouseURL
Simon deleted his release(s) of Apache-OneTimeURL

So the module isn't on CPAN any longer, and the only permission is:

% grep HouseURL 06perms.txt
HouseURL,ADOPTME,f

So if you can just drop that ADOPTME, it'll be like it was never here =
...

Cheers,
Neil

PS smartypants comments about backpan will be ignored :-)=
