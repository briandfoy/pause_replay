I just received a message from you.  Unfortunately it contained
an attachment that is not permitted to be sent to this server.

The message was DELETED!

Please zip the attachment and resend the message with the zipped
attachment.

If you did not send a message, it was probably a virus that reported
you as the sender.

There is no need to reply to this message.

Thank you.

Ian
