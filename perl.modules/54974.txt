The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::SSH::Expect
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: An ssh wrapper to execute remote commands
  userid:      BNEGRAO (Bruno Negrao)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    on modules@perl.org?

  similar:
    Net::SCP::Expect Net::SSH Net::SSH::Perl

  rationale:

    My module is a wrapper to the ssh available on the system. It
    executes arbitrary commands on the ssh server and returns their
    outputs.

    It has a counterpart, the Net::SCP::Expect, and my module has an
    interface very similar to Net::SCP::Expect, this makes them a small
    SSH API :-)

    The functionality of module differs from the existing Net::SSH
    (also a ssh wrapper) mainly in the fact that my module accepts a
    user/password pair to authenticate on the SSH server.

    Also my module can establish an ssh connection once and them
    execute how many commands you want on the ssh server using that same
    connection, while with Net::SSH you have to establish a new ssh
    connection for each command you need to run.

    Besides all this, the only requirement my module has is Expect.pm
    be installed. While Net::SSH::Perl needs the installation of tons of
    perl modules.

    See bellow an example script that uses Net::SSH::Expect:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #!/usr/bin/perl use lib '.'; use Net::SSH::Expect;

    use strict;

    my $ssh = SSHEXEC->new (host => "myserver.com", password=>
    'pass87word', uid => 'username');

    # establishes the ssh connection, authenticating # with that user
    and password $ssh->connect();

    # runs arbitrary commands my $ls = $ssh->exec("ls -l /");
    print($ls);

    my $who = $ssh->exec("who"); print ($who);

    # closes the ssh connection $ssh->close();
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The resulting entry would be:

Net::SSH::
