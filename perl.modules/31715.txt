Hi.  Last week, I registered for new PAUSE ID:
SCOOTER.  I saw a reply in
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2004-05.mbox,
however I didn't receive a separate email that should
have contained instructions on how to complete the
password approval process.  Would you please look into
what happened with that?

Thanks,
Scott
