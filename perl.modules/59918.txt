The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::Prototype::Util
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Prototype-related utility routines
  userid:      VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    You can contact me on FreeNode or MAGnet (vincent or Prof_Vince)

  similar:
    Not that I know of

  rationale:

    This module provides some utilities that were written in the idea
    of "overloading" calls to prototyped functions (as in, for example,
    possibly deferring the call back to the original function). Since
    it's dealing with prototypes, I thought that Sub::Prototype would be
    a good base namespace.

  enteredby:   VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr  6 15:49:14 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sub::Prototype::
::Util            bdpfp Prototype-related utility routines           VPIT
