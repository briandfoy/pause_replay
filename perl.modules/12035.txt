Andreas:

Yeah, I guess I have some evidence, but I'm not sure whose bug it is.
I've been waiting since last year to be able to fix the meta data and
DSLIP settings for some of my modules, but they don't show in the list:

Sys::Ptrace
File::DirSync
Net::DNAT

Am I doing something wrong?  Or am I supposed to wait for approval
from something?  These links do not seem to work for me:

Some are ready for beta instead of pre-alpha and alpha.  I've attached
original inclusion proposition messages below...

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Ptrace
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Perl interface to the ptrace(2) command
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's very annoying to use the ptrace directly with syscall() so I
    want to provide an easy interface. There are also very many
    constants that go along with it. I plan to EXPORT_OK all of the most
    popular and useful ones, (i.e., PT_* and PTRACE_* found in
    <sys/ptrace.h>). This is basically just "h2xs sys/ptrace" with the
    ptrace command exported.

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::DirSync
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Syncronize two directories rapidly
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    It's already being used.

  similar:
    File::Copy

  rationale:

    File::DirSync will make two directories exactly the same. The goal
    is to perform this syncronization process as quickly as possible
    with as few stats and reads and writes as possible. It can be used
    for many purposes, but I use it to avoid accessing commonly needed
    files across a slow NFS mount by using File::DirSync to sync
    everything to a local hard drive. It can gaurantee exact file
    structure consistency within the entire descend of two directories
    for hundreds of megabytes of files, directories, and symlinks within
    a few milliseconds.

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DNAT
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: DNAT Layered Packet Switching Load Balancer
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://www.f5networks.com/BIGIP5K/BIGIP5KFAQ.html
    http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/modperl/302681

  similar:

  rationale:

    Roughly based on the concept of F5's BIG-IP=AE Accelerator, it is
    intended to perform psuedo layered packet switching for incoming
    requests. This is mainly for developmental purposes or testing
    functionality for applications designed for the BIG-IP=AE; however,
    it is much slower in execution. It does not handle over 1000
    hits/sec very well, (like the BIG-IP=AE does), because it is actually
    implemented like a proxy server. But my module is less expensive
    (free).

    This module can also make it easy to combine the power and speed of
    mod_perl handlers with the security of suExec for many users on one
    machine. (This used to be extremely difficult to utilize
    simultaneously.)

    It is perfect for redirecting HTTP requests to different pools of
    machines behind a firewall based on its URL via Destination Network
    Address Translation. The original source IP Address and Port is
    retained so Apache logging and CGI programs will still execute
    accurately.
