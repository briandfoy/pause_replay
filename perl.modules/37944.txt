The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::Part
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Partition one array into several
  userid:      BRENTDAX (Brent Dax)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:
    List::Util

  rationale:

    This module implements a C<part> function similar (but by no means
    identical) to the one expected to be in Perl 6. C<part> (which can
    be expanded to many things, but I prefer "partition") allows you to
    divide the contents of a list between several result arrayrefs based
    on the return value of a block. It's a more general version of the
    "multi-grep" people occasionally implement.

    While superficially similar to the functions in List::Util, the
    functions in this module aren't trivially implementable in terms of
    C<reduce>, and probably wouldn't be used as commonly as the
    functions in that module. I felt it more responsible to simply name
    the module after its function, rather than call it
    List::EvenMoreUtil or something.

    List::Part has existed as an unregistered CPAN module for over a
    year now; I'd simply like it to appear on the module list so that
    potential users can find it more easily.

The resulting entry would be:

List::
::Part            Rdpfp Partition one array into several             BRENTDAX
