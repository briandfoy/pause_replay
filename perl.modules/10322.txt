  I got your E-mail address from a friend who told me he read 
about you on the internet. I liked what I heard so I decided to 
write.


     I am interested in donateing some time and benefit to your 
organization. My skill set includes the ability to generate 
recognition for the services to the community provided buy 
charitable orginizations of all shapes and  sizes.  Bringing 
awareness to the communiy of the benefits that have been a 
result of your organization  would be a service to the community 
in and of itself.    Non-profit oginizations like yours are the 
lifeblood of this country and I would be honored to be of 
assistance.

    I would ask nothing more for this service to your organization, 
and to the community than for you to write  a certified letter of 
recignition and acknowledgement reflecting my time and efforts.

    Please let me know if I can be of assistance.

                                      Tony
