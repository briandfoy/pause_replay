I have an object oriented framework for Unix system administration implemented
as a set of Perl modules. Currently these live under a SYSADM:: namespace. I've
been working on these for several months and I have reached the point where I'm
ready to set up an open source project and invite others to pick over my design
and my code. Before I do this however, I'd like to get an idea of where best to
hang these modules in the CPAN namespace. My current hierarchy looks like this:

        SYSADM::
                Cmds::
                        FreeBSD
                        Linux
                        SunOS
                Config
                Files::
                        FreeBSD
                        Linux
                        SunOS
                Hinf::
                        FreeBSD
                        Linux
                        SunOS
                List::
                        Hinf
                        Uinf
                Uinf
                Utility

I basically represent hosts and users in their respective classes and use ssh to do
interesting things to them. As I said, this is a framework for Unix system administration, 
though I'd like to be able to add support for Be, VMS or *ahem* whatever. I'd therefore 
like to add an abstraction layer for OS/Platform, but I'm uncertain as to where. I lean toward,
for example, SYSADM::Files::Unix::FreeBSD rather than  SYSADM::Unix::Files::FreeBSD.
I'm also unsure if SYSADM:: is the right top-level. Any suggestions or advice would be
very welcome. I can post pod and/or source if required.
