The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Annovar::Wrapper
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Wrapper around the annotation tool annovar.
  userid:      JILLROWE (Jillian Rowe)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jerowe/wrapper-annovar

  similar:
    Bio::Tools::WrapperMaker

  rationale:

    This is a tool specifically to automate a pipeline to go from VCF
    files -> annovar annotation files -> annotated VCF files.
    Reannotating the VCF file is optional.

    To this end it takes as its input a vcf file, or a list of vcf
    files, gets the sampleIDs contained within, and writes the annovar
    input conversion, annovar annotation commands, and the commands to
    write out a new annotated vcf. It also places files in a tree
    structure with annovar_interim, annovar_final, vcf-annotate_interim,
    and vcf-annotate_final. That way a user can clearly distinguish
    between the generated interim files and the final output file.

    I could have written something similar using
    Bio::Tools::WrapperMaker, but I prefer wrappers written in Moose
    with MooseX::Getopt, and I wanted to protect against very large
    STDOUT/STDERR by IPC::Open3 and IO::Select.

    In conjunction with Runner::Threads/MCE many of the processes can
    be run in parallel, with a 'wait' command for any jobs that need to
    complete before the next one can begin.

The resulting entry would be:

Annovar::
::Wrapper         adpOp Wrapper around the annotation tool annovar.  JILLROWE
