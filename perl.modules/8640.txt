Hello!

Have you ever seen a module that allows you to manage 
AOL mail? AOL is not pop3 (actually I don't know what 
the heck it is!) so a standard pop3 reader won't do 
it.

My goal is to read an AOL mailbox and forward 
(without deleting) certain emails based on subject, 
contents, etc.

Ever heard of anything like this??

Thanks!

Conrad
