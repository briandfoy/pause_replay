Request to register new user

fullname: Caleb Cushing
  userid: XENO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://xenoterracide.blogspot.com
     why:

    I maintain Template::ShowStartStop I'd like to change my login name
    to the shorter xeno as it is often what people short xenoterracide
    to (which is 12 chars and thus too long). I'll be migrating my 1
    package once it happens. I won't ask for another account name
    (unless cpan gets 12 char support). It'd be much appreciated thanks
