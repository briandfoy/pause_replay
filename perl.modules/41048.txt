The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       User::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple user sessions management
  userid:      GWOLF (Gunnar Wolf)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Developed as part of IPmanage, CVS requires authentication

  similar:
    Apache::AuthCookie Apache::AuthCookieDBI Apache::Session WebTools
    CGI::Application::Plugin::Session

  rationale:

    All of the modules I have seen regarding user sessions are too
    complicated or married with a specific way of working. Besides, they
    all implement only half of the logic (querying wheather somebody has
    the right credentials), but miss the other half (maintaining the
    users' data in the backing store). User::Simple tackles the first
    part via only 10 very simple methods, and User::Simple::Admin (also
    in the same distribution) handles all administrative tasks (down
    from creating the database structure) in 16 methods.

  enteredby:   GWOLF (Gunnar Wolf)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun 15 18:12:43 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

User::
::Simple          bdpOp Simple user sessions management              GWOLF
