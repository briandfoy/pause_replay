Hi Andreas, this is a response to your plea in the README file of
CGI-Lite-2.001-emergencyrelease for a volunteer to take over maintenance
of CGI::Lite:

  http://search.cpan.org/src/ANDK/CGI-Lite-2.001-emergencyrelease/README

I have several projects which use CGI::Lite and am interested in its
continued existence.  In addition to the security issue that you fixed
in February, there are a couple of other bugs in the module.

Locally I'm running a version of CGI::Lite which addresses these, and
I'm sure it'd be beneficial for the fixes to reach a wider audience.
Patches were sent to the previous maintainer over a year ago but they
have not been applied -- and I'm assuming that he was still unresponsive
in February, and that was why you were the person who made the security
release.

So I'd like to take over CGI::Lite.  If you (and modules@perl.org) are
happy with this then I'll fill in the form to get a CPAN account.

Cheers.

Smylers
