The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Presenter
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Reprocess information from database reports
  userid:      JKEENAN (James E Keenan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Perl Seminar NY

  similar:

  rationale:

    Data::Presenter is an object-oriented module designed to facilitate
    the manipulation of database reports. If the data can be represented
    by a row-column matrix, where for each data entry (row) (a) there
    are one or more fields containing numerical or string values
    (columns) and (b) at least one of those fields can be used as an
    index to uniquely identify each entry, then the data structure is
    suitable for manipulation by Data::Presenter. In Perl terms, if the
    data can be represented by a hash of arrays, where each element of
    each array is a number or a string, it is suitable for manipulation
    by Data::Presenter.

    Under the name ''DataPresenter'', Data::Presenter has been used by
    the author for more than a year in a production environment and has
    been the subject of several presentations to Perl Seminar New York.
    Since the module's code is maturing, now is an appropriate moment to
    share it with the larger Perl community.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
