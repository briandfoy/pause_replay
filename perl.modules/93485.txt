Hi,

I have been working on a module that converts numbers between roman and
arabic notations. Modules with similar funcionality already exist in CPAN:

Text::Roman - Allows conversion between Roman and Arabic algarisms
Math::Roman - Arbitrary sized Roman numbers and conversion from and to
Arabic
Convert::Number::Roman - Convert Between Western and Roman Numeral Systems

Therefore, I could use one of the namespaces of these modules. I believe
this is more about numbers than text, so the list of namespace candidates
would be reduced to:

Math
Convert::Number

Now the question lies on whether this is more about mathematics or number
conversion. I would say the latter, so the only candidate remaining would
be:

Convert::Number

However, there's also module

Number::Convert - Perl extension to convert numbers between different base
systems.

So then the question becomes

Convert::Number
or
Number::Convert
?

I would go for the latter, as roman can be regarded as just another base
system (as decimal and binary are). Therefore, the full name of my module
would be:

Number::Convert::Roman

Before uploading the module, I would appreciate your opinion on this.

Regards,
Jos=C3=A9.
