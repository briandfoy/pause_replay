Dear Sir, 
A PROPOSAL FROM THE ABACHA FAMILY AND MYSELF. 
While this letter may come as an outright surprise from someone to be called =
a stranger, at least for now, I must make haste to assert that there is a =
first time for everything even human contacts. I am Barrister Basher Dalhatu, =
Nigeria's Minister for Power and Steel under the Late General Sanni Abacha, a =
former military Head of State in Nigeria. I am sure I do not need further =
introduction since the family status is a common talk of the globe. I am =
soliciting your apt assistance to us in this transaction for which we are =
prepared to reciprocate by giving you immense and very generous =
gratification. The Late General was a very good boss to me and I swore to him =
in his lifetime that I would never turn my back on his family, hence my =
determination to lead them along until we achieve final and lasting victory. =
Ever since the death of my boss in June 1998 it has not been quite easy, as =
we have been plunged into one trauma or the other, masterminded and executed =
by those who feel they have a score to settle with the dead. They have =
employed diverse machinations to frustrate us. The height of the traitorial =
decadence is that those who dined with my late boss, those who advised him, =
those who drew out his policies have identified themselves with our =
persecutors. They have frozen even our personal accounts, closed down our =
businesses and even prosecuted his son falsely. They kept him in detention in =
contravention to the constitution of Nigeria and tried him for murder but =
justice did not fail us when he was discharged and acquitted as it was =
discovered that the charges against him lacked merit and were frivolous. =
Their hate and taste for wickedness knows no bound and as soon as Mohammed =
Abacha (my late boss' first son) was pronounced innocent by the Supreme Court =
of Nigeria, no sooner had they brought a suit on financial impropriety =
bordering on a failed contract against him. The way we are treated-our =
properties seized, accounts frozen, businesses closed and harassment by the =
police is not news as it is on the front page of the media. It is our right =
to survive; survival is every man's right. The latest development now is that =
they have written to various nations and financial institutions to have our =
remaining funds seized for which we have taken the government to court and =
already won a preliminary objection raised by the Federal Attorney General on =
the jurisdiction of the court to hear the case. We really need money to =
settle our lawyers, revatilise our businesses, address Mohammed's ambition of =
becoming Governor of Kano State in 2007, and negotiate with government =
officials and generally to run ourselves. Endless as this seems, last year =
Mohammed was released on unfair conditions: (1) That he should refund $1.5 =
billion alleged to have been looted by his father (my late boss). (2) Be =
confined to Kano State and be under strict security surveillance hence his =
inability to handle this transaction himself. The dogged federal government =
of President Obasanjo was not even ready to release him but for the =
intervention of first class monarchs, state governors and well meaning =
Nigerians. However such only succeeded in giving him a conditional release =
for which he cannot travel outside Kano State and also that he should refund =
$1.5 billion. All students of good conscience and social justice will agree =
that this is oppression and pay-back because my late boss imprisoned =
President Obasanjo for a failed coup d'etat against our government. Right to =
freedom is fundamental and constitutional and cannot be diminished by mere =
allegations against one's boss or father. For authentication of my claim on =
Mohammed's release and court cases, I make a point of ready reference to you =
on the GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER and THIS DAY NEWSPAPER in Nigeria, which are =
foremost national dailies here and can be accessed on line. You are compelled =
to take the stories as they are because these media are even anti-Abacha as =
they fought against my boss while he reigned. I refer you particularly to the =
Guardian publication of 24 and 26 of September 2002. I am even obliged to =
send you newspaper cutouts. Their websites are: www.ngrguardiannews.com and =
www.thisdayonline.com. For the latest development on the court case, I refer =
you to Thisday publication of 4 February 2003. WHAT IS TO BE DONE: We have =
decided to take advantage of the various deposits we made in several security =
companies across the world, starting with Europe. We have thirty million =
United States Dollars (U.S.$30,000,000.XX) deposited in a security company in =
Europe unknown to anyone. The money is gratification paid to my late boss by =
Julius Berger Plc for awarding them a contract. We really need you to travel =
to assist in getting our various monies We have agreed that for this you =
shall be entitled to a percentage share which shall be duly and generously =
negotiated between us. If this is okay by you, I have the consent of the =
family to continue discussion with you. You must keep this very confidential =
because I am at present assumed to be asylum outside the country but I am =
hiding within until we get these monies and conclude the court cases. I will =
direct you on how to go about the monies after we have agreed on the =
percentage and given you appropriate mandate and authorisation. I am very =
sure you would find this relationship very interesting and one not to be =
regretted as I will introduce you to our family wealth and circle. 
Thanks 
Basher Dalhatu.
