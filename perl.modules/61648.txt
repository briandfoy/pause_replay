I attached the p5p@ message to the mail to modules@.

I know. 6 months. I did that for the developer releases to get to this 
stage.
I didn't want to wait for an almost-core module to get stable for 5.10.

Hi Josh,

I've uploaded the latest series of B-Generate-1.12_x which is becoming
stable now.
These are the current maintainers of B::Generate

B::Generate  	ABERGMAN  	Artur Bergman  	co-maint  	JJORE
B::Generate 	CLKAO 	Chia-liang Kao (高嘉良) 	co-maint 	JJORE
B::Generate 	GRUBER 	Anton Berezin 	co-maint 	JJORE
B::Generate 	JCROMIE 	Jim Cromie 	co-maint 	JJORE
B::Generate 	JJORE 	Joshua ben Jore 	first-come 	JJORE
B::Generate 	MSCHWERN 	Michael G Schwern 	co-maint 	JJORE
B::Generate 	MSTROUT 	Matt S Trout 	co-maint 	JJORE
B::Generate 	SWALTERS 	Scott Walters 	co-maint 	JJORE

The list of fixes for the latest releases for 5.10 comes from:
   Anton Berezin
   Reini Urban
   Dmitry Karasik
(See Changes)

The module pm says this:
MAINTAINERS

This is just a list of people who have submitted patches to the
module. To find someone to actually maintain this, please try
contacting perl5-porters.

Josh Jore, Michael Schwern, Jim Cromie, Scott Walters.

This list is incomplete.
I'm asking for permissions for co-maint and release a 1.13 then.
