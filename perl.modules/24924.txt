The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Nextbus
  DSLIP:       adpOr
  description: OO access to the GPS services at Nextbus.com
  userid:      PHLI (Peter H. Li)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Posted as WWW::Nextbus last week to modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I scheduled WWW::Nextbus (registration attempt last week) for
    deletion and replaced the package with WebService::Nextbus as I was
    advised. Unfortunately, the WWW package was already indexed, so
    someone will probably want to free up the WWW namespace I
    transiently, misguidedly occupied. The deletion should go through by
    Friday.

    WebService::Nextbus also occupies WebService::Nextbus::Agency and
    WebService::Nextbus::Agency::SFMUNI. In the future, I expect it
    other subclasses of Agency to be built, representing other specific
    agencies. Right now, SFMUNI is the only one and is prototypical.

  enteredby:   PHLI (Peter H. Li)
  enteredon:   Mon Dec  8 19:36:58 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::
::Nextbus         adpOr OO access to the GPS services at Nextbus.com PHLI
