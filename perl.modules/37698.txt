Hi everyone,

I have a (system of) module(s) I want to upload to PAUSE/CPAN, but I  
need to relocate their namespace first. And this is non-trivial because  
I'm not sure what new namespace to use, and I've put quite a lot of  
thought into it.

First, some background.

I've heard a lot of claims about blackjack card-counting schemes,  
grid-based programs for human players to interpret on the casino floor,  
etc.. I've also heard that it's possible in casino blackjack for the  
trained player to get a 5% or so advantage with 'ideal' strategy and  
timing, over the long run. But there is considerable debate, it seems,  
on WHICH strategy one should follow to get the maximum advantage. And  
more importantly, there doesn't seem to be any objective source in the  
market - no arguments are really being made by anyone who isn't trying  
to sell a book or a training program. I want to see a study done  
not-for-profit, with the data open to the public, with the algorithms  
open to the public, and giving anyone the software and data to  
duplicate the entire contest for themselves, if they want.

So.. I decided to have a contest for blackjack bots, where the  
tournament software is open-source, and require all entries to be  
open-sourced as well. Everything is written in perl, as will be all the  
entries (though I'm considering adding other interfaces). There are  
many more details to the contest, many of which are yet to be worked  
out, but it's looking like it'll probably start in March or April, and  
will be open to entries for a few months. I am involved with the  
Thousand Oaks Perl Mongers, they are going to sponsor/adopt the  
contest. When the contest opens, I want to be able to tell users we  
will simply be using the latest version of the X::X::X module, and they  
can download and install (and help debug) the same tournament software  
that we will be using with a simple CPAN command.

The code I have ready is just about ready for upload of a public alpha  
version, but when I originally wrote it I never imagined I'd be  
uploading it to CPAN, thus it needs to be repackaged and moved to  
another namespace (it's currently in the root namespace).

About names.
Games::Blackjack, the most obvious option, is taken, and I do not make  
use of that module, so I don't feel comfortable using  
Games::Blackjack::Tournament or some other derivative namespace.  
Games::Tournament::Blackjack is good, but I don't currently have a  
Games::Tournament module or equivalent - though I do plan on possibly  
making tournaments for other games - poker, for example. So that's a  
good option, except for it being a third-level name for what I have  
ready now. Games::Cards is taken, and I like their system ok, but I  
found out about it long after this code was written.  
Games::Cards::Blackjack or Games::Cards::Blackjack::Tournament is a  
good name but has the same problem as Games::BlackJack::Tournament. I  
really want to get what I have written uploaded without rewriting much  
other than the package names so I can get some parallelism going in  
rewriting it where necessary, and deciding where that is..

Reasons this module doesn't make use of the Games::BlackJack module  
(yet, at least):
   - I didn't like the way their card and deck representations worked.  
Mine (in deck.pm) uses one scalar value per card,
     Games::BlackJack uses an array reference. Mine can be printed  
without any more preprocessing than a join, theirs
     requires a loop or subroutine to interpret the cards.. We both  
supply utility
     functions to minimize the necessity for accessing the cards  
directly in any case, but when you have to do so,
     I believe my way is better. I prefer to offload as much effort as  
possible from my users.
   - I wasn't aware Games::Blackjack existed until after I already had a  
working deck.pm, was happy with it's API, and had other code built on  
top of it.
   - Maybe a bit of NIH at first, but I think there's room for two  
Blackjack modules. And mine has a different and more specific purpose.
   - I haven't had time to try to integrate it, and I'm not sure I'm  
willing to give up my deck representation. But I do plan to use what's  
useful in the long run.

Reasons this module doesn't make use of the Games::Cards module:
   - I didn't know of it in time. It looks useful, I may want to  
integrate it later.

- -----------

So that's the situation. I need to come up with a root namespace to put  
all this under. In case it's interesting or helpful in deciding, you  
can get at the original source release (the code on my personal drive  
is a bit newer) at
<  
http://codehearted.com/for/thousand-oaks.pm/ 
blackjack_tournament_pkg.tgz >.
Please do not re-distribute the code until after I've had a chance to  
clean it up a bit and move it to it's permanent CPAN namespace. And  
anyone interested in entering the contest will be very welcome to, just  
let me know and I'll pass along details when they become available.

So, what should I name it? I've asked the TO.pm mailing list, and the  
group in person after going over the blackjack code in detail at a  
previous meeting. I'm still not sure and the naming problem is holding  
back development. Please help.
I'd also appreciate any advice anyone has to offer on how to promote  
the contest.

Thanks for your time,
- - Paul Jacobs (pjacobs on PAUSE)
