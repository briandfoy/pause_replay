The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::OSC
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: OpenSound Control client and server
  userid:      CRENZ (Christian Renz)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    OSC Mailing list (see
    http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl)

  similar:

  rationale:

    OpenSound Control ("OSC") is a network protocol on top of TCP or
    UDP that allows audio applications to send commands to each other
    for e.g. sound synthesis. (Actually, it could be seen as a generic
    RPC mechanism, but in practice is used for audio and video control.)
    It was developed at U of Berkeley and is used both in commercial
    (MAX/MSP, Reaktor, ...) and non-commercial (Csound, SuperCollider,
    ...) software.

    Audio::OSC implements the OSC standard in pure Perl. It has
    superseded the previously used (buggy) XS Perl modules that directly
    linked to a (buggy) C library. It was discussed on the OSC
    mailinglist and is used by several artists and composers for their
    performances.

The resulting entry would be:
