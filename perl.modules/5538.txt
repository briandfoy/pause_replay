External references: Books have been written, directories have been
advertised.

Internal dependencies: PAUSE programs and Modulelist Maintainance
programs were not written with a flexible chapter structure in mind.
It would be a big challenge to fix that and there are many much more
urgent things to work on.

It _is_ on my todo list to change that, but I'd need quite a lot of
time for it.
