Subject: Module submission String::CRC::Cksum
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::CRC::Cksum
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Emulates POSIX 32bit CRC cksum program
  userid:      AHAMM (Andrew Clarke)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Announced on comp.lang.perl.modules a few years ago

  similar:
    String::CRC String::CRC32

  rationale:

    String::CRC calculates a variable-width checksum which does not
    cover the POSIX cksum results. String::CRC32 generates a ZMODEM sum
    which once again is not the same as the POSIX cksum program.

    This simple module allows scripters to easily interact with
    checksums calculated using the POSIX algorithm, for example when
    supplying a checksum to end users, or when receiving files and
    checksums from elsewhere.

    PS - I believe I submitted this request a few years ago now, but
    nothing came of it. If my request was defective or rejected, I
    received no notification. PAUSE was in flux at the time, however...

    I would also like to get this module into the main Registered
    module list. I am about to bump the version number upto 1.0 (upload
    pending) and tag it Mature.

    Thanks in anticip

The resulting entry would be:

String::CRC::
::Cksum           MdpOp Emulates POSIX 32bit CRC cksum program       AHAMM
