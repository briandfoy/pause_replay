Hi,
	I'd like to register as a perl author.  I have two modules in mind:

Image::EXIF and another that I don't know a good name for yet.

First the basics:
	* Name: 	Caleb Crome
	* Email:		perl@crome.org
	* User ID:	caleb

Image::EXIF cdpO Get date, time, etc. from dig camera JPGs. CALEB 

WWW:ImageDirectory cdpO Create web site from directory of photos. CALEB


Description of contribution:

	Image::EXIF:   EXIF is a format of JPEG file that most newer digital
cameras produce.  These files are useable as regular JPGs, and in fact, most
folks I've spoken with don't know that the extra EXIF information is stored in
their images.   The EXIF information contains many useful tidbits, including: 
Date and Time the photograph was taken, exposure, flash settings, bits per
sample, camera name, type, and lots of other stuff.   Image::EXIF retrieves
this information from EXIF files in a nice, simple OO manner.  


	The other program I have is one that creates a web site from a
directory tree of images.  It could be considered a module or a script. I would
prefer to think of it as a module (and can structure it as such). The web
administrator runs a script which converts all the images in his/her directory
tree into nice web-digestible sizes:  thumbnail, small, original.  Thumbnail is
a tiny image used for a visual index of images.  Small is what you see when you
click on the thumbnail, say 640x480, user definable.  Original is the original
image, which may be large.   This script also generates all the html files to
nicely format the images.  It shows, for example, the visual directory, with
subdirectories.  It will also show the date, time, and other settings if the
picture was taken with a digital camera (via Image::EXIF).    I'd like to
enhance this program to allow users to add commenets to each photo, rename
them, etc.  It uses ImageMagick for converting the images, but the resize
routines may be overridden if the user wishes to use some other image resizing
utility.

  	I don't know what to call this one.  Maybe WWW::ImageDirectory



I haven't discussed these modules publicly, but the people I have discussed
them with privately are very interested in both of these.
