There are two different modules on CPAN called Crypt::Enigma. CPANPLUS
installs Crypt::Enigma 1.1 by Jason Blakely from November 2001, since that was
apparently registered first on PAUSE.

The other one is rather different, Crypt::Enigma 1.3, by Alistair Francis from
April 2002. Oh, and the interfaces are completely different.

The 1.3 version is (in my subjective opinion) better Perl, and is actually
more like a naval Enigma machine: it has more rings, and it has the correct
Royal Flags fallover settings on the rings.

Perhaps the modules gurus could persuade Jason to rename or remove his
version?
