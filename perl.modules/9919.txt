How Commodore-specific is this module?  There were many computers back
in the day that used the 6502 or one of its family members (In fact,
most of the Commodore computers didn't use the 6502 itself - the 64
used a 6510, and the 128 used an 8502.  I'm not sure about the PET and
VIC).

Does your module implement any of the KERNAL [sic] features from the
Commodore, or just the assembly language?

I think it's a great idea, and I too came from the Commodore
background.  Next we need a CBM::BASIC2 module!  And
Tk::CBM::C64Emulator!  And....
