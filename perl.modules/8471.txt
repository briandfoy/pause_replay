I'm working on a module called Acme::Fitness witch contains methodes
for calculating BMI and some other popular formulars.

I'm also working on a debug module (called Debug right now, will change)
that enables a program to trace into Module or Module::subroutine.

Another plan of mine is to make Gedcom::CGI into something use full.
Maybe adding a interface for accessing .ged files and a database
in a uniform way. To enable Gedcom.pm applications to grow in a
nice way.
