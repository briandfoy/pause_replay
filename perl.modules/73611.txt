Does the directory portion really matter in this case? That is, once
you figure out which files to select, does putting them in a directory
actually matter as a fundamental part of the problem?

I see two parts here. There's the pluggable criteria portion to select
items, and there's the part that post processes that list of items. It
sounds like your module is mostly the picking part, and it would be
much more flexible to having the picking portion apart from the
directory portion.

I thought there would already be some modules in the Algorithm::*
section that would do that sort of thing. I haven't looked to see if
any do exactly what you need though.
