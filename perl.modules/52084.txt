Hi,

I filed the namespace request below some time ago. As noted in a mail in 
reply to Brian Foy the day after I understood it could benefit to be 
shortened to just 'ProgressMonitor' instead.

Being new at this and unsure of protocol and expected time it will take to 
process things, I'm just wondering if this is in progress, and if the name 
adjustment is ok...or if there's anything else I should do. After sending 
this mail I will upload a 'ProgressMonitor-0.01.tar.gz' if this will make a 
difference...:-).

Thanks,

ken1
