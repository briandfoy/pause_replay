CGI::Session was an idea from 1995 that I never implemented and no longer
intend to tackle.  I get mail asking about it every few months -- I think
it should be removed from the list so someone else can do it.

CGI::Response is something I wrote.  The responsible party is listed as
CGIP, which was a mailing list I created in 1994 or 1995 with Tim Bunce to
talk about such things.  CGIP is no longer in existence -- Lincoln Stein's
CGI.pm effectively took its place.  As such, I would be happy to have
CGI::Reponse listed as author "MGH" so people can send me requests about
it.
