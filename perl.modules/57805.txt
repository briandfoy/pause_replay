The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::CachingFind
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: find files within cached search paths
  userid:      DORNER (Thomas Dorner)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    "File::CachingFind" is useful for repeated file searches within a
    path of directories (e.g. include directories). It caches the
    contents of its search and supports two different methods of fuzzy
    search, a normalize function and regular expressions.

  enteredby:   DORNER (Thomas Dorner)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov 20 17:26:43 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::CachingFind     RdpOp find files within cached search paths        DORNER
