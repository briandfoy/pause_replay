Benny F, Florida<BR>I am constantly amazed about the price increases in out industry. The Gusmer 
machines went up by 30%. The foam went up about 70% over the last two years. And us contractors 
are still in business, getting choked from our suppliers and our customers. I can see how Graco 
uses its monopoly to dictate prices (and of course the folks up in Indiana quietly go along with 
it). But what about the iso prices? Shouldn't someone check into that to see if the demand is 
really that tight? Perhaps there are some other forces at work? Wouldn't surprise 
me!</A></FONT></P><P><A href="http://cpifoam.com/srv-forum-216.htm">Click here to read the entire
