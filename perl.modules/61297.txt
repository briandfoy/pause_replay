The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::ANOVA
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Perform oneway analyses of variance
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil

  similar:
    Statistics::Table::F

  rationale:

    Performs oneway between groups and repeated measures (parametric
    and nonparametric) ANOVAs, with estimates of proportion of variance
    acounted for (eta-squared) and effect-size (omega-squared), plus
    pairwise comparisons by the relevant t-tests. Also performs equality
    of variances tests (O'Brien's, Levene's). Access output as typical
    F-table or string; cached and optionally printed values include F-
    and p-values, treatment and error SS and MS.

    Purpose has simply been to permit run of tests without needing
    access to commercial software or climbing R's steep learning curve.
    Results have been checked with these however and found to agree.

    Improves on Statistics::Table::F which only provides F-test for
    independent groups, returns only F-value, and which will be in error
    if there are missing or non-numeric values.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
