The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::RouterCLI
  DSLIP:       bdphr
  description: Methods for creating a Standford style CLI
  userid:      JORDAN (Bret Jordan)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    sourceforce.net

  similar:
    Term::ShellUI

  rationale:

    After talking with the author of Term::ShellUI I realized I was
    going in a different direction. My goal is to create a framework for
    users wanting to create a Cisco/Standford style CLI for a Linux
    based network appliance. Unlike Term::ShellUI I have full recursive
    completion, recursive command interpolation, hidden command trees,
    authenticated command trees, support for things like RADIUS and
    TACACS authentication, multi-user support, per user command
    histories, audit log support, internationalization of command
    descriptions and help. Basically all of the tools you will need to
    develop a Standford style CLI (the same CLI that Cisco, HP, and
    Foundry use on their network gear).

    I picked the "r -- restricted_distribution" because I was not sure
    what else to pick. I have chosen to license my code under a modified
    MIT style license with a dual license component. Which basically
    says that if you are using this for free and opensource projects,
    you can use it for free. If you are using this for a commercial or
    closed source projects you will need to get a license from me.

    Thanks Bret
