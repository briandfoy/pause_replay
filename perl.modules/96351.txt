Hi James,

Early last month I emailed you:
> I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving =
conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.
>=20
> You have ownership of the Gettext namespace, and have module Gettext =
on CPAN, released in January 2000. This conflicts with the gettext =
module, last released in 2015 by PVANDRY.

ones being:
>  1. You could rename the module so it doesn=E2=80=99t conflict
>  2. There aren=E2=80=99t any downstream dependents, so you could =
remove it from CPAN

Given (a) the other module is being maintained, and has other modules =
dependent on it, and (b) yours hasn=E2=80=99t been released since the =
first release in 2000, and doesn=E2=80=99t have any downstream =
dependents on CPAN, I propose to drop your permissions on the namespace, =
to resolve the conflict. I will do this early next week.

Please shout if you=E2=80=99re not happy with this course of action, and =
we can try and work out a different solution. Or shout if you=E2=80=99re =
happy, and I=E2=80=99ll do it right off. Also, please let me know if =
you=E2=80=99re happy for me to schedule the removal of your old release =
as well, just to tidy things up.

Cheers,
Neil
