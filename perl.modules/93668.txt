Request to register new user

     why:

    I've looking for some CPAN modules to deal with temporary emails
    (like: Guerilla Mail), however I didn't find any.

    I already started to write a code to easily access some of these
    temporary email providers, however probably that would be useful to
    have it as a CPAN module.

    (I have some other ideas as well.)
