Dear all,

maybe my request for a PAUSE ID got lost?

I know that the 3 weeks are not over yet, but in the mail archive I can 
see multiple ID request that were sent after mine and have received a 
positive response.

If there's something missing for my request, please let me know.

Thanks and Best Regards,
Michael
