Hey all-

I just recently finished rewriting an application used to modify host
records. In the process, I wrote it into a completely modular form, with
much reusable code.

I'd like to upload this stuff to CPAN. There are several modules, but
they can actually be used separately or together. So, I'd like your
advice on naming.

The application is called "HostEdit", and currently it lives under
"Net::HostEdit" (seems appropriate). It is an OO module that creates
network, subnet, and host objects, and lets you modify their
properties. It's completely transactional, allowing multiple concurrent
users access to your hosts files. When you're all done you call
->commit() to write your changes to disk.

In addition, in the process I created two other modules, one for
terminal user interaction ("Term::UI" - should it be "Term::CLI"?) and
one for Apache-style configuration parsing. This latter module just
lives under "Net::HostEdit::Conf" right now, but considering it works
100% on Apache config files (and I had promised mod_perl something like
this a while ago :-), I was thinking of naming it "Apache::ConfigFile",
which was the name Doug MacEachern originally proposed for it.

In any case, what do you think? Judging by the above there would be
three module listings:

 Name           DSLIP  Description                                 
 -------------  -----  --------------------------------------------
 Net::HostEdit  RdpOp  Comprehensive host maintenance system        
 Term::UI       Rdpfp  Simple, flexible terminal user interface 
 Apache::ConfigFile  Rdpfp  Read an Apache-style configuration file

Along with probably a "Bundle::HostEdit" to make it easy to use (it
needs Unix::Login and some other stuff). Input?

Thanks as always,

Nate
