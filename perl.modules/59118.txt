The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Interactive
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: configfile parsing with XML  & interpolation
  userid:      MPG (Maxim  Grigoriev)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Config::General Config::Simple

  rationale:

    Provides a convenient way for loading config values from a given
    file and returns it as a hash ref, allows interpolation for the perl
    scalars ( $xxxx ${xxx} ) and inside of XML fragments as well. Also,
    it can run interactive session with user, use predefined prompts,
    use validation patterns and store back into the file, preserving the
    original order of the comments and definitions. Motivation behind
    this module was inspired by Config::General module which was missing
    required functionality ( preservation of the comments order and
    positioining, prompts and validation for command line based UI ).
    Basically, this is Yet-Another-Config-Module with some subset of the
    functionality and list of features found to be useful.

  enteredby:   MPG (Maxim  Grigoriev)

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Interactive     RdpOo configfile parsing with XML  & interpolation MPG
