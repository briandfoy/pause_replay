I think so, too.
However, we should be careful enough.

Use Devel::Dprof.
You can see how many times called magicMatchStr();
If adding some magic data, the penalty when failing in the pattern match 
increases.

Many people use File::MMagic with Namazu.
Namazu indexes  thousands  files one process.
I want to keep the performance for Namazu.

Read subroutines magicMatchStr and magicMatch() more carefully.
There are no feature specification flags, after '/' of 'string/b'.
It may be adventitious to pass your tests.

I want to replace magic data to debian's one, too.
But File::MMagic only support old type magic format.

We need more help.
