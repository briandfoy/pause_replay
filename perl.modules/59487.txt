First, check with the DateTime mailing list. They can help you
integrate your code into the overall DateTime idea.

   http://datetime.perl.org/

For general module questions, you might want to look through Sam
Tregar's "Writing Perl Modules for CPAN", which is avialable as a free
ebook:

Good luck :)
