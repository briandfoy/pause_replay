The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::EnvProcess
  DSLIP:       cdcfp
  description: set or get another process's environment
  userid:      CLIVE (Clive Darke)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    perlmonks #658253

  similar:
    Win32:Env

  rationale:

    Win32:Env will set (or get) environment variables via the registry.
    This is not only flaky, it is not always desirable. The Win32::Env
    author has documented the issues. Win32::Env is for making permanent
    environment variable changes.

    Win32::EnvProcess explicity does not set the registry, so changes
    are not permanent. It uses DLL injection to set or get variables to
    (or from) another single process, so a PID is required. With this
    module it is perfectly possible to set the same variable in a number
    of different processes to different values, all at the same time.
    That is not possible with Win32::Env.

    I have invited the author of Win32::Env to co-operate on this but
    have not yet recieved a reply.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::EnvProcess      cdcfp set or get another process's environment     CLIVE
