Hi Alexey,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving =
conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

You have ownership of the =E2=80=9CText=E2=80=9D namespace, which is =
used for the Text package which is defined and used within your =
Business::OnlinePayment::SurePay module. This now clashes with the TEXT =
module, which is owned by user SHERZODR.

To resolve this conflict, the easiest change would be to rename the =
package from =E2=80=9CText=E2=80=9D to =
Business::OnlinePayment::SurePay::Text, which is the usual way to name =
internal packages.

Or there is another option: I noticed that this module doesn=E2=80=99t =
work on any version of Perl released in roughly the last 15 years:
	=
http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=3DBusiness-OnlinePayment-SurePay+0.01
So another option would be to just delete this from CPAN and then drop =
your permissions on the relevant namespaces.

Would you be happy to do one of these please? If you=E2=80=99re not =
interested in maintaining this module any, are you ok for me to do this =
on your behalf?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m tidying up the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
