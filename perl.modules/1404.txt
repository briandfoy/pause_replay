Hi:  I've recently released a set of modules for maintaining the ht://Dig site
indexing system (written on contract at CoSource.com, commissioned by the
maintainer of ht://Dig, Geoff Hutchison.  Available currently at
http://configdig.sourceforge.net/

I'd like to submit the module set to CPAN for inclusion in the module listing,
but realize there may be namespace issues.  The current modules are
HtDig::Config and HtDig::Site.  I plan to add a couple more in the next release.

I didn't use the Search or Text namespaces because this isn't really a search
interface, rather a maintenance interface for the server system.  I liken it
to the "Commercial Interface" modules section, only ht://Dig is open source. 
Will my choices create any problems?  I see in the FAQ that the top level
namespaces are carefully guarded, and with good reason.  If there are problems,
how can I best fix them?

Opinions?
