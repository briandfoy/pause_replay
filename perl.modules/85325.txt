    You directed this to me, yet, I was responding to this:

If you don't regard that as a personal attack, I'm not sure what would
qualify.

Whereas, I was quoting from another user who also had complaints about
Matt's style that I didn't even have to look for -- it was just in the
middle of
my screen when I brought up the new archive. 

    This is a perfect example of the sniping attacks and how the
'community protects
the snipers' and puts the blame on the wallflowers .. Having been on the
p5p list
for over 10 years when I was labeled a problem was ONLY because I spoke
up and had
an opinion.   Forgive me ..... if I just stood in the background and
never posted,
that'd be fine.  But having watched and used perl for over 20 years, I
think I'm entitled
to express an opinion -- especially when something is going in a
direction that is negative.

    I don't recall anything offensive or personal in my submission, so
why don't we go
back to that, approve it, and I can go back to getting things done
rather than being
stressed out over the abuse and attacks I get from the snipers in this
so called community.

The biggest emotion I felt when Ricardo turned off p5p -- emotional
relief that I wouldn't
have to deal with such abusive people. 

Matt brought the personal attacks... he's one of your own protected
snipers.  No matter what
you do, unless you ban everyone who sniped at me *first* on the list,
you are being hypocritical.


It's not fair to give them license then gang up on me for defending myself.
