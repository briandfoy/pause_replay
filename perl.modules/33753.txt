     why:

    My immediate need is to add example files for a perl.com article
    about making live music with perl, as commissioned by SIMON.

    The example files would be of general use of those using perl for
    creating live music, and would include a time synch server and a
    text editor for live editing of Perl code as well as compositional
    examples.

    I'd then use it for similar purposes in the future.
