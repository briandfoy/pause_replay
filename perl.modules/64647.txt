The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GPS::Garmin::Connect
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple module to fetch activity data from co
  userid:      HPOUL (Herbert Poul)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is already a GPS::Garmin namespace which allows direct
    communication with garmin devices. This module GPS::Garmin::Connect
    (after the name of the website - connect.garmin.com) would allow
    indirect fetching of activities (the user would upload data using
    the official garmin utilities and download this data using this
    simple module)

    Approach: There is currently no public API to fetch data from
    connect.garmin.com - hence this module relies on submitting the
    signin html form for authentication and then fetches activities as
    JSON data from the same URL the official flash client uses.

  enteredby:   HPOUL (Herbert Poul)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb 21 11:45:53 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GPS::Garmin::
::Connect         adpOp Simple module to fetch activity data from co HPOUL
