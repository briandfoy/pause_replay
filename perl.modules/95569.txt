Hi,

I recently noticed a bug in Ogg::Vorbis::Header which was preventing  
my module AudioFile::Info::Ogg::Vorbis::Header from working on Perl  
5.22 and greater.

The bug is https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=104869 and  
the fix is simple.

    
https://github.com/davorg/Ogg-Vorbis-Header/commit/3f5c1579a1164da4d4d08b8ba0ed5f1b6e07c6d8

The last update to Ogg::Vorbis::Header was in 2003 and the author  
appears to have gone missing. Two weeks ago, I sent the email below. I  
have received no reply.

Could you please give me co-maint on Ogg::Vorbis::Header so that I can  
release a fixed version of this module.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Dave...

Hi Dan,

I suspect it's been a very long time since you had any interest in  
your CPAN module Ogg::Vorbis::Header. It's over 13 years since you  
released a version.

But I'm the author of AudioFile::Info::Ogg::Vorbis::Header which uses  
your module and it's just come to my attention that no-one can use my  
module on modern versions of Perl as your module no longer builds  
successfully due to this bug:

   https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=104869

If you wanted to take the time to fix this problem, then that would be  
great. But if (as seems more likely) you no longer have any interest,  
I'd be happy to take over maintenance of the module in order to bring  
it up to date.

Please let me know what you think.

Cheers,

Dave...
