Greetings:

This whole debacle with Parse::PlainConfig opens up a few questions about the
integrity of CPAN.  If I am to believe brian's assertion that I proceeded with
the module with *any* consensus at all, why was I allowed to upload it?
Allowing authors to upload willy-nilly could potentially cause namespace
conflicts, could it not?

In other words, what's to stop a mistaken or malicious upload of a module
whose namespace violates sanctioned and allocated namespace?

I've never attempted to upload anything until I had (or thought I had) the
group's authorisation to do so.  I have to think that if I was prevented from
uploading modules outside of the namespace I was already granted that would
have made the lack of consensus a tad more obvious.

So, is there a potential security problem here?
