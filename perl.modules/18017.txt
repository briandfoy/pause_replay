Now that I think of it, would Text::WidgetRepository make more sense?  I
rejected it originally because I didn't want people to think it was some kind
of "Widget" repository, instead of a "text" repository for widgets.

I'd be happy with Widget::TextRepository, except that the Widget::* namespace
doesn't appear to exist, and I hardly think this is a justification for it.
How many widget-oriented modules are out there that are not tied to a specific
toolkit?
