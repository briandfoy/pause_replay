Full disclosure:

This is gonna be personal, because it can't be anything but.

I am biased. I perceive myself as having been hurt by riba. Intentionally.  
For no other reason than his own enjoyment. I perceive him having done the  
same to at least one other person, for the same reason. He has expressed  
he feels no remorse for any such actions, and in fact steadfastly  
considers them something people interacting with him should expect as par  
for the course. He has said so in public* and repeatedly and in vast  
detail in private.

* https://twitter.com/ribasushi/status/597722817866661888 - (1:19 PM - 11  
May 2015) - "For the public record: Sometimes I consciously troll people  
for no other purpose but to relax. Been doing so for 2 decades with mild  
success"

What i see happening here looks similar to strategies he employed back  
then, which is to get people unnerved and then keep them on edge by  
withholding information and implying consequences.

I am not convinced it is the absolute truth, but i consider this a  
reasonable possibility: He may be doing the same thing right now, with his  
cannons aimed at mst.

At the same time, as insane as this may seem, i trust him in technical  
regards. In my experience he has not done any missteps that might be  
considered "professional". I do not know if he does this merely out of a  
sense of personal pride, or because such things may become part of his  
"career history".

I consider mst's concerns as i've seen them linked in this thread to be  
borne out of something riba created in a calculated manner: A fear of the  
unknown, spiced with single-word hints at possible outcomes. Not an  
attempt to fuck with riba. (Although i fully expect riba to claim that  
this is now an attempt to collectively troll him.) The reasons and  
expectations around the transfer of FIRSTCOME were clear and reasonable.

That said, it is true that in its current state DBIC is a one-man show and  
has been for a long while. However, i do not know whether this is because  
of a general lack of interest in involvement, or possibly due to riba  
having been so abrasive to so many people (see his language towards other  
devs in this thread) that nobody wishes to interact with him anymore, or  
that he possibly has been engaging in large scale refactors that precluded  
meaningful contribution.

I don't know if riba intends to just give the thing to ilmari and be  
content with having kept some hearts beating at higher than normal rate  
for a few weeks.

I don't know if he intends to give it to someone whose only action will be  
to hold FIRSTCOME and do nothing else; thus effectively forcing PAUSE to  
take this away, passing it on to someone else and effectively martyring  
riba.

I expect it to be an outcome that will still leave him able to describe  
himself as an excellent engineer.

However, as a DBIC user, i am worried about its future, specifically the  
future of the development of DBIC, since the wording riba has chosen  
leaves that ambiguous. I hope for two possible paths in the future:

Either riba states clearly and in entirely unmisunderstandable terms his  
commitment to doing his best to start (not maintain) an indefinite future  
of development following his departure and refrain from using his perms  
and personnel choices to introduce any kind of obstacle to indefinite  
development.

Or the PAUSE admins let him do whatever he wishes until his involvement is  
complete, and commit to removing any obstacles to indefinite future  
development he may have put in place, as per this violating the original  
understanding at FIRSTCOME transferrence.
