Hello.
85% of all Internet surfers are directed by search engines. Search Engines 
are the super powerful traffic solution on the Internet.

Your web site:  http://use.perl.org/faq.shtml

can be evaluated for FREE for its keyword placement in
the top twenty major search engines.  By evaluate, we mean taking
the search words that are important to your web site and checking
the results of those words in the top twenty search engines to
determine your web site's placement within those results.  We 
will create a report that displays the results, and then a
professional evaluator will look at your site to see if there is
any 'search engine hostile' content.  This valuable service is
simply free for you as our gift.

To take part in our free offer, simply click the link below:

I think you will be very surprised by the detail and results of our 
analysis.

If by some misunderstanding we sent this email, click reply and type 'take away' in the 
subject line.
