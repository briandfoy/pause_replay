From: aaronsca@hotmail.com ("Aaron Scarisbrick")

As per the instructions at http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html I would 
like to register as a developer on CPAN.  My info:

Full Name:	Aaron M. Scarisbrick
Email:		aaronsca@hotmail.com
Home page:	http://scarisbrick.org/
Preferred ID:	AARONSCA
Projects:

I have a few  things I would like to contribute that I'm working on.  The 
first is a module that is somewhat like Net::Telnet but allows a greater 
degree of control on socket interaction, and has better buffer management 
and line parsing. The second is a module implementation of the BSD 
newsyslog(8) that allows logs to be rolled, compressed and the like. Lastly, 
I'm working on an APRS (an amateur radio position reporting system) module 
for decoding and encoding APRS info.

Thanks,

-Aaron
