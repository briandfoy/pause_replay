Just a few rules of thumb:

Before anything else, they should be in rt.cpan.org in the respective
queues. It's also helpful to have them in your CPAN directory for
better visibility and downloadability. I'd recommend you follow the
naming convention I started (see ANDK/patches/). A patches/
subdirectory is handy for better sorting.

After that be patient. From my experience, 10% of all bugreports are
handled immediately. Send a ping after three months, only then start
to think about taking over the module.
