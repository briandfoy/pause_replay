The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Function::ID
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Variables to let functions know their names
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    None that I know of... but I can't claim to have searched
    exhaustively.

  rationale:

    This is an exceedingly simple module. It ties two variables and
    places them in the caller's namespace. When used, these variables
    contain the name of the function that uses them. One variable just
    contains the function name, the other includes the function's
    package. Example:

    use Function::ID; sub foo { print "This is $this_function\n"; print
    "Also known as $this_fn\n"; }

    This will print:

    This is main::foo Also known as foo

    It seems to me that this is a useful shortcut for error or log
    messages, and possibly for debug messages. You can copy/paste an
    error message from one function to another, and you don't have to
    worry about changing the text of the message to reflect its new
    place in the program.

    I suggested this module on comp.lang.perl.modules about a week ago,
    and the response was positive. I did a search around CPAN and didn't
    find any similar modules. I did see that a top-level Function:: name
    exists, and I think that this module logically fits under that name.
    However, I'm not wedded to the name "Function::ID"; I'm open to
    changing it if someone has a better suggestion or if there's a
    problem with that place in the hierarchy.

    Thanks, Eric
