The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::JavaScript
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: JavaScript testing from within perl
  userid:      KEVINJ (Kevin Jones)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Nowhere probably

  similar:
    Test-Simple

  rationale:

    This module will allow people to write unit tests for javascript
    libraries that don't require the document object. Of course, most
    javascript does require the dom, but I still think there are a few
    places where this module could be used, like testing validators,
    etc.

  enteredby:   KEVINJ (Kevin Jones)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 27 22:08:11 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::JavaScript      cdpfp JavaScript testing from within perl          KEVINJ
