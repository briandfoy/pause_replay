Subject: Module submission P4::C4

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       P4::C4
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: CVS like update front end for Perforce
  userid:      WSNYDER (Wilson Snyder)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perforce's user contributions area

  similar:
    P4::Client

  rationale:

    This sits upon the existing P4 modules to provide higher level p4
    functions (like "is a file the same" and is there a .cvsignore?). It
    also includes a script that uses the package to let p4 users have a
    cvs-like look and feel.

    The name c4 is based upon a older C based program "c4" and is a
    corruption between the names "p4" and "cvs".

  enteredby:   WSNYDER (Wilson Snyder)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug  8 13:42:19 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

P4::
::C4              RdpOp CVS like update front end for Perforce       WSNYDER
