Hello.

Module Net::Whois::Raw is now officially maintained by
Corris Randall <corris@cpan.org> (CORRIS)
(The original author is Ariel Brosh <schop@cpan.org>).

The problem is that this module is not actually
maintained by it's current maintainer.
The latest version was released 25 Mar 2003.
The module has some problems and there are
many possible improvements that can be performed
for Net::Whois::Raw, so this module is definitely
need to be actively maintained.

I have sent patches for this module a long time
ago, but received no answer from Corris Randall.
I tried to connect with him but with no success.
I don't know what is wrong with him and why it is no
longer available - maybe he was dead etc. ;)

So, I can be a new maintainer of this module -
I have many improvements for this module
that is not applied to the official version.
Some of my suggestions was already
applied to previous versions of Net::Whois::Raw.

Is it possible to be a new maintainer?
If yes, what I need to do to initiate
change of maintainer?
Unfortunately I have no way to contact Corris Randall,
the current official maintainer.
