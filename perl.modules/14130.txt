Victor Industries Signs Canadian 
Distributor 

Wednesday October 3, 7:00 am ET 

MCMINNVILLE, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 2, 2002--Victor 
Industries, Inc. (OTCBB:VICI - News) announced that the Company 
has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Servimex 
Canada LTD. 

Servimex will have exclusive distribution rights in Canada, Mexico, 
Brazil, Argentina and Chile. 

"Leandro has arranged the production of a Canadian approved 
version of our ENVIROLIZER(tm) box with both French and English 
on the package. His initial order of 5 tons will be shipped in one ton 
super sacks and boxed locally. We have been concentrating our efforts 
at marketing primarily in the west so far but have received some interest 
from the East coast as well. As I said in our last release I will announce 
distributors as they are signed," said Carson Coleman CEO of the 
Company. 

"The exclusive nature of Servimex Canada LTD is dependent on certain 
minimum orders in which I have confidence Mr. Silva can meet and hopefully 
exceed. We have to remember that this is the first product of its kind offered 
on the market and to expect a lengthy educational process. However, as the 
consumer comes to realize the convenience of watering and fertilizing their 
plants less frequently as well as the environmental benefits of reducing nitrate 
and phosphate pollution the Company believes our orders will continue to 
increase." 

This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning 
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are subject
to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from 
those projected in the forward-looking statements. The Company may experience 
significant fluctuations in operating results due to a number of economic, competitive 
and other factors. These factors could cause operation results to vary significantly 
from those in prior periods, and those projected in forward-looking statements. 
Information with respect to these factors which could materially affect the company 
and its operations are included on certain forms the company files with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission.
