     why:

    I started writing Perl about 2 years back and had a lot of hiccups
    when it came to learning and debugging the code that I wrote in the
    first place. But once when I got a hang of it, I started to love
    Perl and have fallen for it completely.

    Now I would like to make it easy for everyone else to jump in adopt
    Perl, as I think Perl has everything it takes to make life more
    easier for a lot of Programmers.
