I agree that just because a module uses Moose it doesn't mean it should be
in the Moose or MooseX namespace, that was never the issue.

However, I don't think it is wrong to let people know that Moose is involved
since the first time you install such a module on an older platform (and
there are some hosting sites that still run 5.8.8) you are in for a
surprise. The newest version of perl I have seen on the hosting sites I deal
with is 5.10.1 and they do not have a full install of the MooseX stuff. Yes,
the end user will installing missing modules into their own directories, but
it is time consuming.

Jim

As the only member of Moose core team on here:

His stuff is nothing to do with us.

It's just a module that happens to use Moose as an object system.

Putting Moose in its name is silly; from a user's POV that's an
implementation detail (albeit I'll tend to avoid things not using Moose
if I'm planning to extend the module).
