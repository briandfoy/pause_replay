Hi,

John gave me C::DynaLib co-maint 5 years ago, but
C::DynaLib was not in his perm selection.
So I have only the subpackages.

I started working on C::DynaLib again, adding a struct parser, but
the test release 0.58 even after waiting 2 years was not indexed.
My latest upload neither. (so far to the 6 month grace period)

Can modules please give me co-maint?
My gsoc student would benefit from it.

PS: cdecl has a problem with gcc-4 which I couldn't solve yet, but I'm on t=
o it.

It's all yours. :)

Request a PAUSE account if you don't have one:
http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=3Drequest_id

With luck, you will be contacted shortly. =A0They may want me to email
that I transfer maintenance to you, in which case forward me the
request.

Thanks
John

Oddly, C::DynaLib did not appear as a selection, but I transfered
these to you:

Made RURBAN primary maintainer of C::DynaLib::Callback.

Made RURBAN primary maintainer of C::DynaLib::Struct.

Made RURBAN primary maintainer of C::DynaLib::Struct::Imp.

Best of luck.
John
