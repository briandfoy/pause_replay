Searchability via m /GUI/ in CPAN.pm

Searchability via search.cpan.org

Searchability of modules which, for some reason or another, are not in
the modules list (eg it hasn't been updated recently).

Easy navigability of a CPAN archive via FTP, or on a CD-ROM.

That's just off the top of my head.  How many more do you want me to
come up with?
