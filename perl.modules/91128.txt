The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::STDF
  DSLIP:       adhOb
  description: Parses files in Standard Test Data Format

  rationale:

    Standard Test Data Format (STDF) is a widely used standard file
    format for semiconductor test information. It is a commonly used
    format produced by automatic test equipment (ATE) platforms from
    companies such as LTX-Credence, Roos Instruments, Teradyne,
    Advantest, and others.

    STDF is compacted into binary format according to a well defined
    STDF specification originally designed by Teradyne. The record
    layouts, field definitions, and sizes are all defined in the
    specification. Over the years, parser tools have been developed to
    decode this binary format in several scripting languages, but as of
    yet nothing has been released to CPAN for perl.

    This module would be a first attempt. It utilizes an underlying
    open sourced C library called libstdf
    (http://freestdf.sourceforge.net/) to do the grunt work of parsing
    binary data into structs (STDF records) as defined by the
    specification.

    An object-oriented Parse::STDF module is provided for the end user.
    It's object methods make the API calls to to libstdf.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
