Can you be more specific as to which users are confused on which level
(and scale)?

The usual measures are to never restrict uploading unless there are
indications of severe wrongdoing or wreaking havoc. It would be a
completely unprecendented move to interfere on the upload level without
a very good cause.

"That this situation stops" is probably the key phrase here. What is the
situation that needs stopping, why, and how many other parts of the
eco-system besides PAUSE-uploading-system might be good starting points
to consider tweaking (or inventing?)?
