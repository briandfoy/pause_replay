Request to register new user

fullname: Frank Carnovale
  userid: FRANKC
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.dbnet.com.au
     why:

    I have already contributed largely to Class::DBI::Loader::Oracle
    (see acknowledgements), and I wish to post several authenticated bug
    reports to some Class::DBI related addins, and potentially some
    variations on these which support MS SQL more correctly. I also wish
    to post a Catalyst-based framework suitable for RDBMS apps.
