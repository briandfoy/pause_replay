description:			script - debugging

	I've just released TestMy.CGI v.1 - a freeware script that, when installed on any server running Perl 5, will allow browser-based point-and-click navigation through a domain then, will test the syntax of a CGI script reporting any errors in the browser window.

	TestMy.CGI has proven most helpful for programmers and developers at any level of skill who do not have shell access to their domains, who do not have access to their domain's server or error logs, or who do not wish to wade through extensive lines of log entries for the ones relevant to the script on which they're working.

	Upload and configuration instructions are commented at the top of the script, while instructions for use are provided right in the browser when the script is invoked.

	I do not expect to contribute a large quantity of scripts or modules to this community as I am more of a designer than a programmer. I developed TestMy.CGI primarily because I needed such a tool when I moved to a host that did not allow log access. I searched for some time for an existing script but to no avail.

	I'd like the opportunity to share this simple and handy tool with the Perl community as it may well help other developers in a similar quandary.

	Please contact me any time if you have questions. Otherwise, I look forward to being able to upload TestMy.CGI to your archives.

Virtually yours,

Craig Richards
