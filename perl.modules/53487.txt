Subject: Module submission List::Temporal

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::Temporal
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Treats a list like a temporal bucket.
  userid:      MCARTER (Matt Carter)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    To be honest i cannot think of a better way of describing the
    module name other than 'Temporal'. I'm open to suggestions.

    Essentially the functionality boils down to: Manipulating a list in
    that any action (such as grep) also removes the matches putting the
    remaining items in the orignal list. This differs from a normal grep
    which leaves the unmatched items in the originally given array.

    I admit that the functionality of this module is simplistic but I
    ran into a use for such a module myself and reasoned I mind as well
    share with other Perl devs to prevent re-inventing the wheel.

    You can see the completed module in my PAUSE storage area.

The resulting entry would be:

List::
::Temporal        Rdpfp Treats a list like a temporal bucket.        MCARTER
