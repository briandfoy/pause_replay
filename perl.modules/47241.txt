Hello Philip,

the GSSAPI-0.13 module in CPAN  is broken (does not compile).
and unmaintained (last change in 2001).
(We need GSSAPI bindings for LWP::Authen::Negotiate)

Leif and me have contacted you with our bugfixes and suggestions, but got no 
answer from you.

Now we have written a GSSAPI-0.14 module that solves the problems.

Our qestion: Are you interested in  me to becoming the maintainer 
of the GSSAPI module or do you want to maintain the module yourself?

If you want to maintain the module yourself - what are your planned
next steps - do you want to include some of our code?

Thank you,
Achim Grolms
