The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::FOP
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Access Apache FOP from Perl to create PDFs
  userid:      KEN (Ken Prows)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'd like to get some feedback on the naming choice of my new module
    before I release it.

    XML::FOP is a module that allows the use of Apache FOP via Perl. It
    supports most of the features that the fop.sh script included with
    FOP allows.

    FOP is based off of XML (it's part of the Apache XML project), so I
    feel that XML::FOP is a good name for the module.

    Since FOP is written in Java, the module relies on Java.pm. You
    will need to have FOP and Java.pm installed before installing the
    module.

    Using Java.pm allows allows for much better performance than simply
    using a system call to fop.sh. (In my tests, about 3 times faster.)

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::FOP             bdpOp Access Apache FOP from Perl to create PDFs   KEN
