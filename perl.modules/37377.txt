The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Arch
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Perl interface to GNU Arch
  userid:      MIGO (Mikhael Goikhman)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    gnu-arch-users, #arch-magic on irc.freenode.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    GNU Arch is a revision control system, and arch-perl is a Perl
    interface to GNU Arch. I believe Arch:: namespace should be reserved
    for arch-perl project.

    Several distributions (including Debian) already include arch-perl
    as a separate package or a part of archzoom, archway or axp
    packages, that are the main front-ends based on arch-perl.

    [Actually, these front-ends use ArchZoom::, ArchWay:: and AXP::
    namespaces respectivelly, that I'd like to keep too. However these
    are regular unix applications, there are no immediate plans to make
    them installable from CPAN.]

The resulting entry would be:

Arch              RdpOg Perl interface to GNU Arch                   MIGO
