The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::PercentChange
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Calculate the percent change between values
  userid:      MBAAS (Mike Baas)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    #perl on Freenode

  similar:

  rationale:

    I read this from David Wheeler:

    http://www.justatheory.com/learn/math/percent_change.html

    I asked him why he didn't make it a module? He said he never used
    it again after that day. I told him I use it almost every day.
    Others in #perl on Freenode said that sometimes the most obvious
    modules simply aren't written and if I was inclined to write it, I
    should, so I did.

    The code is done and ready to be submitted.

    Thanks,

    Mike Baas initself on freenode
