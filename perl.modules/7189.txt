Data:: is so generic it's almost meaningless... almost everything a Perl
module could deal with is data, and it wouldn't make sense to put every
perl module under Data.  So let's save Data for stuff that's really
generic data manipulation and which don't obviously fit elsewhere.

I'd suggest putting your module under the Mac:: namespace.  Although
Mac:: is mostly modules that run on Mac, there is at least one other
example of a platform-independent module in there
(Mac::FileSpec::Unixish).  The real issue, though, is where would people
look for a Mac-related module?  I'm thinking they'd look in Mac::
