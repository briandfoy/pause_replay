I am folowing the CPAN FAQ to register myself as a developer:

contribution: A module that wraps the Spread client libraries. 
(http://www.spread.org/)
	It is already written, I am just trying to put it somewhere people can
find it.

The Spread perl module is currently used to implement distributed
logging via hacked syslogs, the mod_spread_log modules for Apache and
various other multicast applications.

I think the Spread package is clean, concise and very easy to use.  I
hope that it opens the doors to spread for many people that like perl ;)
