The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Project3D
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Project vectorial function from 3D to plane
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Possibly #perl?

  similar:
    None I know of, none rhizomatic #perl could point me at.

  rationale:

    You might have seen a similar namespace registration request
    recently for Math::Project_3D. The underscore is bad. Hence this
    request. Math::Project_3D has been deleted from CPAN.

    Given a function of three components and of an arbitrary number of
    parameters, the module allows you to project any point of the
    function (specified by its function parameters) onto an arbitrary
    plane in R^3 along any vector.

    Math:: was chosen because, well, it is Maths. Vector geometry.
    Project3D was chosen because ology suggested it on #perl and I could
    not think of a more appropriate name. I'm open for suggestions at
    mail at steffen-mueller dot net.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
