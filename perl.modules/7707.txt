Are these modules or scripts?  (Well, the first one is obviously a
script.)  I strongly suggest packaging them as modules so they'll
be more useful to a wider variety of people.

Also, we don't maintain listings of scripts.  While you can stick it in
your CPAN author directory, nobody will ever find it there, and what's
the point?

I'd suggest naming them something like File::Similar and
Mail::Filter::MultiClient.
