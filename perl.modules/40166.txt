Subject: Module submission URI::virtual

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URI::virtual
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Use 'em as bookmarks or mirror lists
  userid:      RPAUL (Rich Paul)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    LWP::Protocol::cpan

  rationale:

    These are some pretty small modules ... there are two: URI::virtual
    is a subclass of URI, and represents a 'uri' of the form:
    virtual://CPAN/authors/s/so/somebody/something. There is a simple
    config file which mapps the keyword CPAN to one or more
    http,ftp,file, or if you're relly sick, another recursively virtual
    URI's. (oops .. bug ... gotta avoid infinite recursion).

    The resolve method returns the path of the virtual URI, appended to
    the root from the file ...

    The LWP::Protocol::virtual class is pretty simple ... It originally
    created a nested UserAgent and tried to fetch the thing itself ...
    but when I saw the class LWP::Protocol::cpan, and realized my
    mistake, I changed it to return a redirect. Now it's about 5 lines.

    And my CPAN 'urllist' has only one entry: virtual://CPAN/ ... which
    I can use not only with CPAN, but with GET, lwp-request, etc. ---
    and can also use to suck things down from Gentoo mirrors,
    SourceForge, or to implement a 'poor man's bookmark.

    I love object technology.

The resulting entry would be:

URI::
::virtual         bdpOp Use 'em as bookmarks or mirror lists         RPAUL
