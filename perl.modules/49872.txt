The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GPS::Babel
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Interface to gpsbabel
  userid:      ANDYA (Andy Armstrong)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    GPS::Garmin, GPS::Lowrance, GPS::NMEA, GPS::Poi

  rationale:

    GPSBabel is a versatile tool that converts between nearly 100
    different GPS file formats and interfaces directly with a number of
    popular GPS devices.

    There is currently no simple way of building the following pipeline
    (for example):

    file -> gpsbabel -> perl filter -> gpsbabel -> file

    GPSBabel doesn't currently have an import / export format that
    would lend itself to use in this kind of scenario.

    My intention is to add an import / export format for gpsbabel
    designed for easy parsing / generation by a language such as perl
    and then to wrap that in a perl module that will allow (for
    example);

    my $babel = GPS::Babel->new(); my $data = $babel->read(module =>
    'gpx', src => 'in.gpx');

    munge($data);

    $data->write(module => 'gpx', dst => 'out.gpx');

  enteredby:   ANDYA (Andy Armstrong)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 17 09:38:11 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

GPS::
::Babel           cdpOp Interface to gpsbabel                        ANDYA
