Hi,

I'd like to request a CPAN ID.

Name:		Chris Ball
E-mail:		chris@printf.net
Homepage: 	http://printf.net/
Preferred ID:	CHRIS
Contribution:

I'd like to contribute a Statistics::Inferential module. The Inferential
module will contain algorithms for the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Sign and
Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient significance tests in first
revision, and will grow subsequently. 

I've discussed my plans for the module on Rhizomatic's #perl, in
comp.lang.perl.modules (with no replies as yet - Message-ID: 
<slrn9cm37t.7vn.chris@pkl.net>) and today in e-mail with Jon Orwant;
Jon wrote Statistics::ChiSquared, and advises that CPAN is lacking in
inferential statistics modules, and that I should go ahead with coding.

DSLI:    		
Development stage: 	c
Support level: 		d
Language used: 		p
Interface style: 	O
Description: Inferential statistical methods  


Please let me know of any namespace issues - I haven't had much chance
to explore these. Statistics::Inferential as a module name was chosen
because of the link with the existing module Statistics::Descriptive.
 
Many thanks for your time, best regards,
