Hey guys, I heard back from the author...

What he wants to do for now is use the following:

Data::RRD::SharedModule
Data::RRD::Piped

I have pasted his comment below:

the reason for it to be two modules is, that the piped module works
even when you do not manage to compile the shared perl object ...
having both in one is sort of pointless ...

as for the name, this is fine ... we can have a 3 part name ...

cheers
