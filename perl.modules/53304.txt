Ah, that sense of "falling" is not what I was expecting.  Yes, I would 
think that "Decreasing" would be much more likely to resonate with 
module authors.  However, both modules will always have 'undef' (under 
Safe mode), so perhaps the test could be a little smarter and come out 
and say 'undef' will not be indexed.

I guess I'm going to have to augment the META.yml generation in 
Module::Build to populate this for me...

Thanks!
