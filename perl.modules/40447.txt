The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::RandomPerson
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Generate people data to populate databases
  userid:      PETERHI (Peter Hickman)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    To allow the creation of realistic data about people for databases
    that may be show to clients and thus needs to appear to be rooted in
    the real world. Creates names and titles based on gender and age. It
    will be possible to change the names used. The current names are
    taken from various census lists and other public domain sources.

  enteredby:   PETERHI (Peter Hickman)
  enteredon:   Mon May 16 20:21:53 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::RandomPerson    RdpOp Generate people data to populate databases   PETERHI
