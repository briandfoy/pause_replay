The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shell::POSIX::Select
  DSLIP:       Rdpnp
  description: The POSIX Shell's "select" Loop for Perl
  userid:      YUMPY (Tim Maher)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.thepen.com/186913.html , modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Switch.pm

  rationale:

    This module uses source code filtering to endow Perl with an
    enhanced version of the "select" loop of the POSIX shells. If it
    proves reliable and useful, as I expect, I think it should
    ultimately move into the Perl Core.

    The most similar module is Damian's Switch.pm, which likewise adds
    a new flow-control construct to Perl through source filtering.

    There was some earlier discussion on the "modules list" regarding
    the most appropriate namespace for this module, which resulted in
    the choice shown above.

    (Most of the comments came from brian d foy, whom I have recently
    tried to contact, but apparently he's toppling statues in Baghdad or
    something these days.)

  enteredby:   YUMPY (Tim Maher)
  enteredon:   Tue May  6 02:17:18 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Shell::POSIX::
::Select          Rdpnp The POSIX Shell's "select" Loop for Perl     YUMPY
