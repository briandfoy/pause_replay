You don't mean it :))..


Hi again

I am so sorry for not replying sooner it seems that, one of my emails seemed to have gone astray, so I thought I would reply hoping that you would still remember who I am :)) If by some chance you have changed your email, I guess I would have lost an opportunity too. shame :( 
Anyway, I'm still willing and waiting here http://www.singlers.com/index_vip.html If you want to contact me through the site again  you know where I am.

Kisses

Ali
