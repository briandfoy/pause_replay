Dear ModuleMeisters,

I'm working with Index Data (www.indexdata.dk) to build a set of Perl
modules for the Z39.50 information retrieval protocol (see the Z39.50
maintenance agency at http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/ for
background on Z39.50)

Our code is now very close to the quality that we'd like before "going
public" on CPAN, so it's time to register our namespace.  It seems
obvious that the right general area is Net::Z3950, although please
shout if we've missed anything.

At the moment, we have two separate modules -- one provides basic
Z3950 services such as initialisation, searching and presentation
(retrieval) of records; and the other provides a framework within
which to build simple servers.  We will shortly start work on a third
module which will provides a unified interface to Z39.50's various
hierarchical data formats.

We propose to name these modules as follows:

	Net::Z3950::Services
	Net::Z3950::SimpleServer
	Net::Z3950::Data

These names in contravention of the guidelines at
http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#2)Guidelinesfor
which say --

	Please avoid using more than one level of nesting for module
	names (packages or classes within modules can, of course, use
	any number).

But given that these modules really are alternative and complementary
within the domain of the network protocol Z39.50, we don't really see
any alternative -- please advise if you are aware of one.

Thanks for your attention,

	Mike Taylor <mike@tecc.co.uk>
