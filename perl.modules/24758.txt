The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::RungeKutta
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Integrating Systms of Differential Equations
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a module of Runge-Kutta methods for solving initial-value
    problems in systems of differential equations. The Runge-Kutta
    algorithms are the general-purpose workhorse in this field. This
    module has been designed to be robust and easy to use, and should be
    helpful in solving systems of differential equations which arise
    within a Perl context, such as economic, financial, demographic or
    ecological modelling, mechanical or process dynamics, etc. Three
    main algorithms are offered. rk2 is Heun's 2nd-order Runge-Kutta
    algorithm, which is relatively imprecise, rk4 is Merson's algorithm,
    and rk4_auto uses the step-doubling method to adjust the step-size
    of rk4 automatically to achieve a specified precision. I've put some
    new work into the timestep selection stuff in rk4_auto, greatly
    improving robustness and convergence.
