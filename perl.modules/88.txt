Fine by me.

Question for modules@perl.org:

Can I have the "Import" namespace for my CPAN module?

I'd be glad to share it with others, since this module enables multiple implementations for any given namespace... :)

However, I think "Exporter::Import" is a bit weird, not to mention confusing - does it export or does it import? And it really has nothing to do with the normally used "Exporter" module, so I don't see the point of including it with those modules. Also, the former-Java programmers most interested in (the newly-renamed) Import.pm would probably not think to look under the "Exporter" namespace for an "import" function.

If you insist, you could always
'use Import qw( Import Exporter::Import );'
:)

Mike.
