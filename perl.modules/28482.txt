The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::File::Cached
  DSLIP:       bdphg
  description: On demand caching of file contents
  userid:      DANBERR (Daniel P. Berrangé)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides a specialization of IO::Scalar that loads data
    using IO::File and caches it in memory using Cache::Cache. The first
    time it is called for a particular file name it will load the file
    as normal using IO::File. The entire contents of the file will then
    be stored in the supplied cache object, such that later loads do not
    have to read from disk. One situation in which this can be useful is
    to cache files in memory across all processes in a mod_perl server.
    The name IO::File::Cached was chosen because it provides a drop in
    replacement for any (read-only) usage of the IO::File module.

The resulting entry would be:

IO::File::
::Cached          bdphg On demand caching of file contents           DANBERR
