     why:

    I have mainly two projects that have useful modules at the moment,
    which are: microformat extraction and output into other formats, and
    a fairly robust html to pdf script using pdftex (w/o imagemagick
    dependency).

    Though these will probably be available elewhere anyway it seemed
    that particularly the microformat stuff would be useful for quite a
    few people. Because of the design of the html-pdf stuff, I am hoping
    to generalise it so that other formats can be handled before
    releasing anything.

    Other stuff turns up now and then - OPML generation is next on the
    big list of things to do.
