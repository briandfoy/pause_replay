Well, damn.  You're absolutely right.  I searched for various
combinations of "Web" and "services" but never found WebService.  Thanks
for the pointer.  I still think keeping the "API" (or "REST" or other
descriptive detail element) is worth it -- it allows for multiple
implementations of the service in the same namespace -- but "WebService"
replaces "WWW::Service" perfectly.

I'll rename the module and re-submit.  Thanks!
