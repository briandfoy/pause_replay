Hi Dean,

I have transferred ownership of Net::DHCP to you, having checked that =
the previous owner (Stephan Hadinger) was still happy for this to =
happen. Sorry it=E2=80=99s taken us so long to get to this. And thank =
you to Stephan for the prompt reply to my query.

Background for modules@perl.org <mailto:modules@perl.org>: during a talk =
earlier this week, Dean mentioned that he=E2=80=99d requested transfer =
of this name in 2010, with Stephan=E2=80=99s blessing, but that it =
hadn=E2=80=99t happened. I asked him to forward me the email, then =
followed up with Stephan to make sure he was still happy for this to =
happen.

Neil
