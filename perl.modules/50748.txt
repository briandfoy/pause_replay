Well, CPAN6 has nothing to do with CPAN, the names are a "homage" and 
they are functionally unrelated. I believe PAUSE6 is similar.

Which makes things more than a little confusing for me...

"CPAN6" is the meta-repository concept floated at YAPC::EU.

"6PAN" is the currently working name for the CPAN replacement coming 
from the pugs people (in particular Jos).

What's concerned me a little is that both of these proposals dive 
straight into technical details, and neither lay out what they are 
actually trying to achieve, their priorities, constraints, use cases etc.

I'd like, somehow, to work out a way to head off all this squabbling 
before it gets started.

Ideally by somehow getting all the players from the current CPAN 
(everyone who owns or maintains a piece of it) together with anyone who 
wants to get involved with the sequel, and thrash out exactly what the 
hell it is supposed to do, and under what conditions and constraints.
