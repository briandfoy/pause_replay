Hello Pause Team,

I've tried to register for the Perl Authors Upload Server about one year
ago. Because of a mistake in the registration of my email adress, I've never
received the password for PAUSE. So I also didn't recognize the mistake
until today. Please change my email adress to mailto:kikkertuin@gmx.de and
send my password again.

Thank you

Yours faithfully


Michael Witthaut
