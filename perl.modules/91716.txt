Request to register new user

fullname: ANAIO, Inc
  userid: ANAIO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://ana.io/
     why:

    This request is for an account which will represent the research
    and development consultancy ANAIO (Access and Abundance, Inc). The
    distributions released will include wrappers around HTTP APIs, as
    well as frameworks abstracted out of our client work which we
    believe will be useful to the community.
