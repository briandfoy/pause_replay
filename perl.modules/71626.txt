Hi

I was one of the unfortunates that were blocked in the perlmonks-password
hijack days.
I have (had) the PAUSE id HTOUG.

I have tried to reset the password, but without any luck.

The reason is probably that the main email-address for my pause account is
ht000@foa.dk. This is an old email-address for a job that I no longer have.
The address is dead.
Unfortunately I did not change it in Pause in time - a forward for my
cpan.org has been in place - forwarding to htougaard@gmail.com
<htougaard@gmail.com>if my memory serves me right.

I have not had any need for my Pause-account until now. My DBD:;:Ingres
distribution has an active co-maintainer and ACME::RaiseMyKwality is as dead
as it should be.

Could you please reopen it and set the main e-mail address to
hehtoug@gmail.com.

Regards
Henrik Tougaard
