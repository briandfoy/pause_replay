Hi,

I'd like to register as a developer for CPAN

Name:		Angus Wood
Email:		angus@z-y-g-o.com
Preferred ID:	AWOOD
Module:		CGI::WML
Description:	Subclass LDS's "CGI.pm" for WML output
DLSI:		RdpO

The module in question has been in use here at Zygo Communications for
some time, and has been released to the public as CGI::WAP-1.XX, but on
the suggestion of c.l.p.modules I'm renaming it to CGI::WML since it's
more concerned generating the markup language from CGI programs than
it is handling the protocol stack etc.

Regards,
	_Gus
