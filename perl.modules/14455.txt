STRICTLY PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL

ATTN=3A Sir=2FMadam=2C

Request For Business Partnership=2E

With great pleasure=2C I write to solicit for your
assistance in a matter that can be of mutual benefit
to us=2E I only pray that you read through carefully and
respond as promptly as possible=2E

Precisely=2C on the 25th of May 2000=2C the Ministry of
Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a
Director of Auditing & Project Implementation=2C
received Presidential irrevocable circular Order
requesting the Ministry to compile and forward the
list of all past Foreign Contractors=2C whose contract
payments are pending since the period of the immediate
past regime of Dr=2E Nelson Mandela and the present
regime=2E The purpose of this exercise was for the
present South African elected government to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed=2C so as to maintain
good relationship with other foreign Governments and
non-Governmental financial agencies=2E

In light of the above=2C my colleagues and I=2C duly
assigned with the duty to compile this list of the
past contractors=2C decided to include a non-existing
Company name with a bill of US$9=2E6=2C with other
Company names and their respective bills for payment
approvals=2E Our intended plan is to create the
impression that =28Pivot International SA Pty=29 which is the
non-existing Company also carried out contractual
works of supply to the Ministry as well as others=2E

With the cooperation of Top Government officials in
the Ministry and two senior colleagues of mine in the
Ministry=2C I was therefore assigned to contact a
trusted and reliable foreign based businessman=2C
furnish him with the appropriate documents=2C in laying
claim to this $9=2E6Million being payment for contract
work=2E Payment shall then be transferred upon approval
to a safe account as would be provided by you=2E In
other words=2C if you accept to be our partner then you
shall be considered=2C given the pertinent
documentations to have been awarded a contract already
been executed by you for which your Company shall be
paid the sum of US$9=2E6Million=2E

Please be informed that with the South African
Government monetary policy=2C Government officials =2F
employees are not allowed to operate or own bank
accounts abroad hence our decision to seek a foreign
partner=2E

I also have the authority of my colleagues involved to negotiate your 
share
and benefit of the US$9=2E6M after a successful transfer into your 
account=2E
Also=2C all expenses have been
worked out=2E  For further
information=2C please contact us via the email address=3A
tbk=40netcitizen=2Ecom

Thanks for your anticipated cooperation=2E

Regards=2C
Engr=2E James Zenani
