Dear CPAN Admins,

Recently, Colin Kuskie here (COLINK on CPAN) gave me permissions for 
"Statistics::Descriptive". As evidence, I quote:

{{{{{{{{{{{

Okay, I reset the permissions on it.  Please double check to see that 
you're the

However, I still don't have permissions for two namespaces it defines:

* Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse 

* Statistics::Descriptive::Full

As a result, I got this error by the CPAN indexer:

Status of this distro: Permission missing
=========================================

The following packages (grouped by status) have been found in the distro:

Status: Permission missing
==========================

     module: Statistics::Descriptive::Full
    version: 
    in file: lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm
     status: Not indexed because permission missing. Current registered
             primary maintainer is COLINK. Hint: you can always find the
             legitimate maintainer(s) on PAUSE under "View Permissions".

     module: Statistics::Descriptive::Sparse
    version: 
    in file: lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm
     status: Not indexed because permission missing. Current registered
             primary maintainer is COLINK. Hint: you can always find the
             legitimate maintainer(s) on PAUSE under "View Permissions".

Status: Successfully indexed
============================

     module: Statistics::Descriptive
    version: 2.7
    in file: lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm
     status: indexed

__END__
}}}}}}}}}}}}

And as a result of that, search.cpan.org reports that 
http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/Statistics-Descriptive-2.7/ is an 
"Unauthorised Release".

Please make me a primary maintainer or a co-maintainer of the two sub-
namespaces, as this was Colin's intention and it prevents me from actively 
maintaining the module.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
