The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NetPacket::SpanningTree
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Spanning Tree packet encoding/decoding
  userid:      CGANESAN (Chander Ganesan)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    The NetPacket::Ethernet NetPacket

  rationale:

    The NetPacket group of modules all deal with protocol
    encoding/decoding of IEEE standard ethernet protocols.
    NetPacket::SpanningTree decodes 802.1d Spanning Tree (and Rapid
    Spanning Tree) packets, as well as providing the ability to encode
    Spanning Tree data into packets. It conforms to the standards set
    forth in the NetPacket.pm module, and works with NetPacket::Ethernet
    as required.

    Basically, it's another NetPacket component to add to the other
    protocols that NetPacket already handles.

    Note: This package required NetPacket::Ethernet version 0.04 .
    Currently the version of NetPacket::Ethernet maintained by Tim
    Potter (whom I've been unable to contact via email) does not support
    802.3 packet decoding, and as a result will not properly decode the
    ethernet portion of the packet. I've updated NetPacket::Ethernet in
    my CPAN directory (and bumped the version to 0.04). Does anyone know
    how to get ahold of Tim?

The resulting entry would be:

NetPacket::
