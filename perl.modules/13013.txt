On FreeBSD:
$ man 2 sigaction | grep core
     SIG_DFL.  The defaults are process termination, possibly with core dump;
     SIGQUIT         create core image       quit program
     SIGILL          create core image       illegal instruction
     SIGTRAP         create core image       trace trap
     SIGABRT         create core image       abort(3) call (formerly SIGIOT)
     SIGEMT          create core image       emulate instruction executed
     SIGFPE          create core image       floating-point exception
     SIGBUS          create core image       bus error
     SIGSEGV         create core image       segmentation violation
     SIGSYS          create core image       non-existent system call invoked

I don't see why not.

Debug::NoCoreStackTrace  :)

How about Debug::OnFaultTrace, or Debug::AutoFaultTrace?

You can probably drop it.  The dump() builtin also triggers a core dump:
$ perldoc -f dump | grep core
This causes an immediate core dump. [...]

From memory dump() basically sends the process a SIGABRT signal.
Just arrange to catch that and you're done.

Ah. Okay.
