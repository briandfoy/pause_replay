Hi modules@,

this is to give you an update on the proposed module list cleanup for
stale entries. Also, I include a proposal for the deletion below, so
skip ahead if necessary.

Some statistics first: (Take them with a grain of salt.)
- There were 712 module registrations in the original deletion-list.
- 393 of those are still left in the list. There has neither been a
reply from the authors nor have they been checked by hand.
- 116 registrations have been confirmed by the authors as being expendable.
- I checked several more by hand and found another 48 registrations
which can most likely be deleted.
- This means that 155 registrations were deleted from the list because
my script was in error or the author wanted to keep the registration.

At this time, it is unlikely that I will check those 393 registrations
by hand. Some of those might be low-hanging fruit (typos and the like),
but I don't have enough time to spare. By the way, "checking by hand" means:
- search.cpan.org for the namespace (should not be available)
- check "i /NAMESPACE/" in cpan shell (should also be N/A)
- check the author's cpan and backpan directory. (should not have a
distribution which seems related)

For some registrations, there was a *really* old file (for example
"$NAMESPACE.pl.gz") in the directory which probably just predated all
current packaging conventions. When I saw this, I just removed the
registration from the deletion-list.

*I propose to remove the 116 confirmed registrations from the database.
Furthermore, the 48 (or a subset thereof) which I considered deletable
might be okay to remove. What's your stance? Should they go with the
confirmed deletions?*

I'll reproduce them here:

- Typoes and the like:
WWW:Blogger ERMEYERS (misspelt, but package on backpan)
Persistence::Object VIPUL  (Uploaded Object::Persistence)
Tern::Size::Heuristic YUMPY  (typo)

- No implementation on CPAN. Also, this is the author's only registered
module and the author never uploaded any files.
Asterisk::IVR::Dido QUINN
XML::Pastor AULUSOY
YATT HKOBA
