The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::FS
  DSLIP:       adprp
  description: Read and write files using a tied hash
  userid:      DEVEN (Deven T. Corzine)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tie::FileSystem

  rationale:

    I originally wrote this module over a decade ago, under the name of
    "Tie::File". This was never released due to a namespace conflict --
    someone had reserved the name without ever releasing code.
    Ultimately, MJD released his Tie::File module, so I renamed this
    module. I would have used the name "Tie::Filesystem", but someone
    else has released a similar "Tie::FileSystem" module already. I
    therefore renamed my module to "Tie::FS" to better distinguish it.
    Unlike the "Tie::FileSystem" module, my "Tie::FS" module allows read
    AND write access to files via the tied hash, but destructive modes
    (Overwrite and ClearDir) must be explicitly enabled.

  enteredby:   DEVEN (Deven T. Corzine)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 28 06:57:58 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::FS              adprp Read and write files using a tied hash       DEVEN
