Hi Kip,

I thought four years after the release of XML::SAX::Base 1.04 should
be birthday present time. You find appended the mails I could find
easily about the unfortunate inability of the CPAN indexer to deal
with the package. The indexer has learned to deal with META.yml files
in the meantime and so I made another attemt to produce a patch that
makes the package indexable. It's really just a few lines this time
and not vague suggestions what might work but a real patch.

I've tested this patch to the best of my knowledge that it will be
accepted and recognized by the CPAN indexer and so 1.04 will become
the current version instead of the 1.02 that is still being treated as
current.

If you wouldn't mind to take this patch and apply it and make a new
release, you could make the perl community and Scott and me happy. If
you're not interested, please nominate a new maintainer. If you want
to find a new maintainer, it would probably help to rewrite the README
and let the world know what's the plan. If you want me to do that for
you, I'd be happy to act as an interim maintainer just to get the ball
rolling. I'm not interested in the code itself, I haven't used it, but
as the maintainer of the CPAN indexer I'm ashamed that I could not fix
the problem earlier. Please have a glance over the next 129 lines,
most of which are comments by makepatch, the patch itself is only 60
lines.

Kip,

you see Scott's message above, he's sending it for the third time and
I have always been to busy to react. But thanks to his stubbornness,
we have a chance to reconsider. I have written more or less the same
mail to many authors, so the following lines are nearly a form letter.
I hope this helps you a bit and let me know if you need some help.

Yes, it's because .pm file is written by a script. There are several
possible solutions:

1. Write a different file on the fly, say XML/SAX/Local.pm and have that be
   required by Base.pm and let Base.pm be just

   package ....::Base;
   $VERSION = "1.05";
   require ....::Local;

2. Write only a few configuration variables into some
   XML/SAX/Config.pm and the common logic in Base.pm. This is really
   the same thing as above, just the sizes of the files are different.

3. I have not yet enough experience with Module::Build instead. M:B
   writes a good META.yml file that would be parsed by the indexer.
   That would be an interesting approach but would probably need some
   more support both on Module::Build and the PAUSE side.

4. The least intrusive for the author would probably be to let
   Makefile.PL or Build.PL care for the distribution of a bare minimum
   of a .pm file and overwrite it during installation. I have tried
   this before and it seemed to work, but I know of no distribution
   that is persuing such a dangerous idea. Such a solution has the
   disadvantage of being a bit hard to debug if something goes wrong.

Kip,

Scott made me aware of a wrong index in the CPAN indexing mechanism.
I'm sorry that the indexer on pause.perl.org is not up to the task of
indexing your module. Maybe the workaround outlined below will be
something you want to try out?

The indexer has always a hard time when a package arrives that
contains no *.pm files. XML-SAX-Base builds the *.pm files during the
'perl Makefile.PL' run but the indexer cannot know that.

I have tried the following patch to the Makefile.PL and found that it
works quite well for the developer. It's just a suggestion, I'm sure
there are plenty of alternative solutions too.

The effect is that the *.pm files are distributed with just a package
statement and a $VERSION assignment. This would be good enough for the
indexer on PAUSE. The full *.pm files are still being built by 'perl
Makefile.PL' on the user's box.
