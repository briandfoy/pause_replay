Hi,

Perl Authors Upload Server schrieb:

sorry for the late answer. It's generally considered a bad idea to 
include an underscore in a module name. Can you think of a similar name 
which doesn't use one?

Also, There is Business::OnlinePayment::PayflowPro by a different 
author. You said the old API was discontinued by Payflow. Perhaps you 
can talk to the author of the old module and fix it instead of uploading 
under a new name? This is generally preferable to having different 
versions of the same module under different names. The "v4" in the name 
really is a string hint that this should rather be 
Business::OnlinePayment::PayflowPro version 4.0.

Cheers,
Steffen
