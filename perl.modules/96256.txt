Hi Neil,

Thank you for your message. I must say it's a real blast from the past! :)

That module had been created by me as a contract work for a company that
went bust since then. I have much more challenging task at the moment so
would not mind if anybody else takes the ownership of that module.
Alternatively it can be deleted if it causes you all those namespace issues
(Sorry I would not be able to do it myself as I'm afraid I have lost login
credentials to CPAN and on my travels at the moment).

Regards,
  Alexey.
