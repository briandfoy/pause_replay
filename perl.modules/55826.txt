     why:

    I want to share helper modules I've written with the perl community
    to become famous. Seriously, much of my utility code just sits there
    half-finished because I know no one is going to see it. I hope a
    CPAN account will catalyze this into two or three actually useful
    modules. (Also, if HOOO is qualified to upload modules, so am I.)
