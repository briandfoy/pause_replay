Subject: Module submission POE::Component::IRC

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::IRC
  DSLIP:       Mdphp
  description: A POE component for building IRC clients
  userid:      FIMM (Dennis Taylor)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    #poe @ irc.perl.org, poe@perl.org, the POE wiki, anywhere POE-ish.

  similar:
    POE::Component::IRC::*

  rationale:

    This module has actually been on CPAN for over 3 years now, but
    PAUSE is giving me a "no modules registered to FIMM" error when I
    try to edit its metadata. Did I forget to register it, or is this
    just some sort of database weirdness? No idea.

    Actually, the reason I wanted to make sure it was registered is
    because I'm handing its maintainership over to Chris Williams
    (BINGOS). Personal reasons, lack of time, etc. It deserves someone
    who will actually manage a new release once every couple of months.

  enteredby:   FIMM (Dennis Taylor)
  enteredon:   Sat Dec 11 00:01:41 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::
::IRC             Mdphp A POE component for building IRC clients     FIMM


Thanks for registering,
