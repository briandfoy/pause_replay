The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chart::HeatMap::Simple
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: converts 2d array into heatmap
  userid:      JINKEE (Thuan-Jin Kee)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    SVG::Graph::Glyph::heatmap

  rationale:

    Looking for a simple way to make a heatmap, I've noticed a lot of
    bioinformaticians will pull out a module like PostScript::Simple and
    code the heatmap from scratch.

    This module is designed for easy integration into a pipeline of
    tools and can take a 2d array and turn it into a heatmap. it also
    features a user replacable colour distribution function which allows
    the user to switch colour scales without having to subclass the
    object. (I'm still working on getting the colour functions more
    decoupled from the heatmap object, but it works for now).

    The object has flags to allow you to turn on and off column and row
    headings.

    The module currently emits postscript, which can be converted into
    anything.

The resulting entry would be:

Chart::HeatMap::
::Simple          adpOp converts 2d array into heatmap               JINKEE
