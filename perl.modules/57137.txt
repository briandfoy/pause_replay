The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Weaken
  DSLIP:       anpfp
  description: Test that freed memory is indeed freed
  userid:      JKEGL (Jeffrey Kegler)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Perlmonks Meditations

  similar:
    None, as far as I know

  rationale:

    Circular references are sometimes necessary, and the programmer can
    arrange for Perl to free them properly by weakening certain of the
    references. However, figuring out which references to weaken in a
    complex data structure can be tricky, and memory leaks can remain
    unnotices.

    This module takes a closure as its argument. The closure is
    expected to return a reference. This is freed, and all indirectly
    referenced memory is then checked to see that it was freed as well.

  enteredon:   Wed Oct 10 01:13:52 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Weaken          anpfp Test that freed memory is indeed freed       JKEGL
