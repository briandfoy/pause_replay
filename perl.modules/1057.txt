I've just started using WAP (Wireless Application Protocol,
url:http://www.wapforum.com/) and I've subclassed a new module from
CGI.pm. 

So far I've called it CGI::WAP, but I'm asking for your opinion on this
one. Namespace XML::WML was requested for something similar on message:
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/w3glimpse2html/modules/1999-11/msg00000.html

But since this is just extesion to cgi programming, I'd like to place this
module under CGI::* namespace. I don't know the status of the module
'XML::WML'.

The usage of my module is something like this:

use CGI::WAP;

my ($wap) = CGI::WAP->new();
my ($name) = $wap->param(name);

print $wap->header, 
      $wap->start_wml("1.1",
      $wap->card({-id=>"myCard", -title=>"Hello World",-newcontent=>"true"},
        $wap->p("Hello $name")),
      $wap->end_wml;

and it produces valid XML-document in WML.

I'm also developing module to compile/convert WML info a binary format
(WML-WBXML), which is required my some mobile terminals.

Now, I'm not sure which namespace to use for this one.
Convert::WML, XML::WML::Convert, CGI::WAP::Binary.

I like CGI::WAP::Binary, but compiling WML into WBXML doesn't necessarily
have anything to do with CGI. So I'd go and use Convert::WML.

The usage of this module could look like this (if I choose to bless a
tybeglob):

use Convert::WML;
use CGI::WAP;

my ($WBXML) = Convert::WML->new("1.1"); # Convert into format v1.1
my ($wap) = CGI::WAP->new(); "
my ($name) = $wap->param(name);

print $WBXML $wap->header({-type=>"binary"}),
      $wap->start_wml("1.1",   
      $wap->card({-id=>"myCard", -title=>"Hello World",-newcontent=>"true"},
        $wap->p("Hello $name")),
      $wap->end_wml;

So, now I'd like to hear namespace suggestions or register namespaces
CGI::WAP and Convert::WML.

I'd like to add that this is the first time these modules are discussed in
public. All comments welcome.
