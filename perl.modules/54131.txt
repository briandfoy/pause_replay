Greetings,

        I am planing on uploading a module to cpan.  I have requested an PAUSE
account and I am awaiting a reply.

        The module, which I have tentatively named BackOff provides modules
to "Back Off" after a failure.

        The current modules are

BackOff::Linear - Backs off on a line
BackOff::Exponential - Backs off exponentially
BackOff::Random - Backs off on a random number.

        A co-worker has suggested Proc::BackOff::*

        If you have any suggestions for a better name, please let me know.

TIA,


Daniel Lo



The basic usage of the module is to do the following:

my $obj = new BackOff::Random( { min=>5, max=>10 } ); # random between 5-10
seconds

while (...) {
    sleep $obj->delay(); # returns 0 if nothing to do

    # do action
    ...

    if ( success ) {
        $obj->success(); # removes any existing back off
    } else {
        $obj->failure(); # increments the sleep time reported by $obj-delay()
    }
}
