The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cache::Benchmark
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Checks the quality of a cache- algorithm
  userid:      TOBIWAN (Tobias Tacke)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Description: ------------ This module check the quality of caching
    algorythm of modules with the Cache:: - interface. There is no need
    to inheritance from Cache.

    It's useful to check the speed and usability of cache under
    different (adjustable) circumstances. It check:

    -is the cache fast/slow -is purge() wise enought to leave the
    needed things in cache under full charge -in which circumstance the
    algorithm is ok an when it is bad

    Reason, why to upload: ---------------------- I've seen many caches
    in so many different implementation and there are often general
    slow, purge() the wrong things or do that in a very slow way. This
    module help to find the best cache-module for whatever is needed.
