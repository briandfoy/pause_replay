The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::BibTeX::BibStyle
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Format Text::BibTeX::Entry items using .bst
  userid:      NODINE (Mark Nodine)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::BibTeX::BibFormat Text::BibTeX::BibSort
    Text::BibTeX::NameFormat Text::BibTeX::Structure

  rationale:

    The proposed module builds upon Text::BibTeX and
    Text::BibTeX::Entry but has the following advantages over the
    similar modules listed above:

    1. It is a complete implementation rather than a proof-of-concept.

    2. It has fewer bugs since it has been tested to produce the same
    results as bibtex on the standard example bibliography and the
    standard bibliography styles.

    3. It allows using a large number of already-implemented
    bibliography styles instead of always having to define your own.

    4. It incorporates a generic mechanism for turning LaTeX
    bibliographies to whatever output format is desired, with html and
    latex already implemented (and probably reStructuredText before it's
    released).

    5. It is supported by its author rather than by a Ph.D. student who
    didn't write the package.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::BibTeX::
