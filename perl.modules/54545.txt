Subject: Module submission LDIP

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LDIP
  DSLIP:       ampha
  description: LDIF-based Data Integration Pipeline Utility
  userid:      MGREGORO (Michael Gregorowicz)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://www.mg2.org/mg2/presentations/ldip.html, Detroit PM

  similar:
    POE

  rationale:

    LDIP is an abstract service and framework that will require several
    sub-packages to make it readily useful. There does not appear to be
    an existing root level namespace on the CPAN where LDIP would have a
    home. If you would like to take a look at the current code base,
    please take a look at:

    http://svn.mg2.org/projects/ldip/browser/trunk

    Sub package / hierarchies include: LDIP::HandlerPack::* - used to
    package up LDIP handler scripts for certain tasks e.g.
    LDIP::HandlerPack::SMTP, LDIP::HandlerPack::LDAP, etc.

    LDIP::Worker::* - plugins and replacements for the default
    LDIP::Worker that will be supplied with LDIP.

    (see http://mike.mg2.org/article/archived/730/ for some more info
    on my forthcoming worker implementation)

    I am currently using LDIP as a framework to help implement some of
    the features for my web server project LeafyWeb which is still in
    the planning stages. It will be a key dependency, and having it on
    the CPAN would help tremendously to that end.

    My plan is to clean up and heavily document the current version,
    and release it in the short term, and follow it up in the next
    couple months with another version that implements that worker
    model.

    Your consideration is greatly appreciated!
