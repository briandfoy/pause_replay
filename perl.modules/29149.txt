     why:

    I am currently developing an IP Inventory Database (commercial, but
    free licence). In the process, there are a growing number of IP
    based modules being implemented.

    e.g.:

    ------------- * Router

    A base class representing an IP router including many advanced
    features like static routes, static dns, interfaces/modules/cards,
    IS-IS, [ei]BGP, prefixlists. This is not actually an IP router but a
    class holding all the data regarding that router. It provides
    methods for router internal topology analysis and advanced checks.
    The important thing is that it is designed to hold informations from
    different router vendors.

    * Router::Interface

    A class representing an router interface.

    * Router::Prefixlist

    A class representing a prefixlist

    * Router::BGPVRF

    A class representing a BGP VRF including all neighbor relations
    etc.

    * Router::BGPNeighbor

    A class representing a BGP neighbor.

    * etc.

    The "Router" namespace contains a whole bunch of modules regarding
    IP routers.

    ------------- * IPv4

    Several IP Verson 4 based classes for IP/IP-Prefix/Mask conversion,
    validity checks and other checks.

    -------------

    Apart from that, I am developing several perl projects which may
    throw out some GTK2 widget classes also.
