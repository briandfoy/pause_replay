MIDI::Realtime cdpO  Interacts with MIDI devices in realtime

Existing perl MIDI code is concerned with the construction of MIDI files,
and not writing to the devices directly.

Used for a live performance of the (void) mailing list as music.  See
http://www.slab.org/void/music/ for examples.  I've discussed it on the
(void) mailing list and on the 'linart' linux artists list, which has
generated quite a bit of interest.

The module only has the features I need at the moment (writing MIDI data),
but what I have done is well documented.  There are many areas of
expansion which could arise from involving more hackers.  For example,
reading MIDI data is yet to be implemented, and people could make
subclasses for sending system exclusive data to their particular
synthesiser.

I'm very excited about the possibilities this module opens up, and think
many others will be too.

Cheers,

Alex
