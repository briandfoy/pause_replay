The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::PEFile
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Parse MS Portable Executable files
  userid:      GRANDPA (Peter Jaquiery)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32::Exe

  rationale:

    Pure Perl module to quickly parse the structure of PE/COFF files to
    access the version resource and exports table.

    In the future access will be provided to other resources and the
    imports table. Facilities will be provided to allow authenticode
    signing of PE files and manipulation of resources.

    The module is cross platform and endien agnostic.

    There is some overlap with Win32::Exe which is a much more mature
    module. However PEFile is much faster for accessing version
    information. Win32::Exe doesn't provide access to the exports table.
    Win32::Exe restricts some operations to Windows systems.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
