Subject: Module submission Filter::Comments::C
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, kosmo@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filter::Comments::C
  DSLIP:       cdppp
  description: C-style Comments
  userid:      KOSMO (Matthew J. Kosmoski)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    Will be discussed on Perl Monks, perhaps. Just speaking with
    colleagues for now until I have something to show for an RFC.

  similar:
    Searching revealed none.

  rationale:

    It is a source filter to allow users to implement C style block
    comments. It is a source filter, thus in Filter::, but I see no
    namespace for commenting (Searched quite a bit), So
    Filter::Comments::C seemed appropriate.

  enteredby:   KOSMO (Matthew J. Kosmoski)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul 26 04:08:39 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Filter::Comments::
::C               cdppp C-style Comments                             KOSMO
