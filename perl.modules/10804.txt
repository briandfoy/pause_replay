Subject: Regarding Mail::RFC822::Address

Hi,

Modules Mail::RFC822::Address and RFC::RFC822::Address seems to 
have taken the namespace which is probably better for a address
parser and not just a validator. I was hoping that one of these
would provide an interface to represent the RFC822 addresses 
(split into host, user etc). For example, when the To/Cc/Bcc line
is fed to it, it creates a data structure with list of addresses in it,
probably each address being of type ::RFC822::Address which can be
traversed later.

Can this new module Mail::RFC822::Address (which was submitted on
March 15, 2002)
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2002-03/msg00224.html
be named ::AddressValidate or CheckAddress or something
like that? so that it leaves the namespace open for something that
can represent the parsed addresses.

My apologies if this was the wrong list for this mail
