No, it doesn't do any manipulation of the strings.  It only gives back
what it thinks is the encoding.  There is a precedent for having
detect-only modules in Encode::, though, with Encode::Guess and
Encode::HanDetect.

One could also argue that it belongs in the web-related modules, but it
feels more like a problem of encoding than a web problem.

Again, I'm not really opposed to making it a new top-level, but I would
like to get it in the right logical place the first time around =3D)
