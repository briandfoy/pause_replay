Hello,

    After i submitted this, i realized that. the work on x25 will be
moved to the name space Net::x25.
    I am working on one other module which i am unsure of the name space
placement.

    The module has functions for getting the local system size of
various elements. In all, the module is used to get the byte size of a
pack format string for use with a read statement. The working name of
the module is sizeof.pm using the first level name space of sizeof.
While this is fine for the work in progress version, i was wondering is
there was a better place.
