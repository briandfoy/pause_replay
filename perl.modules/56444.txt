Subject: Re: Old CPAN namespace registration for Apache::MimeXML

Is this broken because I have:

   package Apache::MimeXML;

   use strict;
   use Apache::Constants qw(:common);
   use Apache::File;

   $Apache::MimeXML::VERSION = '0.08';

Instead of the more common "use vars qw($VERSION)" stuff?
