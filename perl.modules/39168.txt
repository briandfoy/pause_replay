Aloha,

after a lengthy debate on module-authors I finally settled on
Media::GStreamer as the name for the GStreamer bindings I'm working on.
GStreamer is a streaming library for all kinds of media, so I think the
namespace is pretty descriptive.

Unfortunately, Media:: doesn't yet exist as a top-level namespace.  The
only related one is Multimedia::, which would be too long.
Media::GStreamer is already quite a bit too long, IMO.  (All other
language bindings of GStreamer simply use Gst as the namespace.)

So, my question is, are you ok with creating this new top-level
namespace?

Bye,
