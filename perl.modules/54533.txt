The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Feature
  DSLIP:       bmpOg
  description: extracts some feature sentence from HTML.
  userid:      MIKI (Takeshi Miki)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module extracts some feature blocks from an HTML document. I
    do not adopt general technique such as "morphological analysis" in
    this module. By simpler statistics processing, this module will
    extract a feature blocks. So, it may be able to apply it in a
    language of any country easily.

  enteredby:   MIKI (Takeshi Miki)
  enteredon:   Thu May 24 02:45:38 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Feature         bmpOg extracts some feature sentence from HTML.    MIKI
