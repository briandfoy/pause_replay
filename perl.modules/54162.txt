The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Queue
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Provides a persistent queue object
  userid:      JLAVOLD (Jason Lavold)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    Array::Virtual Tie::File

  rationale:

    I was looking for a module like this in CPAN, but couldn't find it.
    I went ahead and wrote it, and now I want to make it available to
    the community :)

    The module provides an object-oriented, persistent queue complete
    with enqueue, dequeue, and peek object methods.

    It is much more efficient than using Tie::File in a queueing
    context. It is a pure perl module and doesn't depend on any external
    DBM libraries like Array::Virtual depends on SDBM_File.

    I have been using this module to keep persistency in our custom
    perl agent that that gathers system statistics and info . It has
    been running on the almost 500 Linux, Solaris, and Windows machines
    in our datacenter for well over a year now.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Queue           bdpOp Provides a persistent queue object           JLAVOLD
