My thinking is that there would be a series of pre-filters, written in Perl
to parse output for Doxygen.  One of those would obviously be for perl
source code itself.  I think something like:  Doxygen::PerlFilter and
Doxygen::SQLFilter, etc would be good name spaces.  But I am not sure if the
modules lords would want Doxygen as another top level?  If that is okay,
then I will request it.  But I wanted to defer to you all in case you wanted
something "above" it in the module tree.  I have looked through the module
tree and do not see any place it should go.
