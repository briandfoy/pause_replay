The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::AppToolkit
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: An OO CGI app development framework (MVC)
  userid:      GISEBURT (Rob Giseburt)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Application has similar goals, and plays nicely with
    CGI::AppToolkit

  rationale:

    CGI::AppToolkit is am OO-based CGI application framework that works
    well with CGI::Application.

    It doesn't 'do' anything by itself, but provides a simple means to
    encapsulate data management (with extended support for DBI) and
    interface display (with it's own templating module), and provides a
    common, simple interface to unify them.

    I plan to make a counterpart to CGI::AppToolkit called
    CGI::Application::Factory that extends CGI::Application to use
    CGI::AppToolkit.

    CGI::AppToolkit will, in the future, provide more tools, such as a
    XML data component. There is room for several convenince methods to
    aid in manipulating complex data structures, since they are passed
    and manipulated often with CGI::AppToolkit.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
