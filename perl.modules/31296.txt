Hello Modlist Maintainers,

My registration request for Digest::SHA is over 7 months old.  Is there 
a problem or a particular controversy that I'm not aware of?

The module is now relatively mature, and the user-base has grown, at 
least judging from the emails I receive.  The creation of the module was 
thoroughly discussed on Perl newsgroups, and I've been in regular 
correspondence with Gisle Aas, the author of the CPAN Digest:: module.  
I don't believe that anything has been overlooked on my part, but please 
don't hesitate to contact me if such is not the case.

Regards, Mark
