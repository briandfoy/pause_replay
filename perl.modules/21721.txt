Yesterday, I uploaded Time::Format for the first time (although I
vesioned it 0.02).  No problemo.  Today, I uploaded a new revision,
v0.03, and got the following error response.

I had previously searched cpan.org for a Time::Format module, and
did not find one.  However, I went to "View Permissions" on PAUSE
and found that Time::Format is assigned to PGOLLUCCI, along with
several other modules on a  "first-come" basis.  Yet on cpan.org
I see no modules whatsoever for this author.

Is there some mistake?

The following message says that my upload was not indexed, and in
fact it did not appear to be, but several hours later I see that
v0.03 is now available on CPAN.  So I'm confused.
