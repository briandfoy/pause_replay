Sounds like you could make it an extension for ingy's perl5.pm called
perl5::nixus which you'd then invoke as

use perl5 'nixus';

which seems suitable since this very much seems to be "your preferred dialect
of perl" wrapped up in module form. Which isn't really a criticism - just
"nixus' perl5" seems a marginally better name for such a thing than "Stuff"
in that it at least describes what it -is-, even if neither name are good
descriptions of what it -does-.
