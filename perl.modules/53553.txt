The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::BitTorrent::Scrape
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Extracting information from Bittorrent Files
  userid:      QANTINS (Marc Qantins)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::BitTorrent

  rationale:

    Net::BitTorrent::File currently offers some nice tools for
    manipulating - mostly creating - torrent files. my module should
    help people to mainly extract information from torrent files.

    with the help of my Net::BitTorrent::Scrape and
    Net::BitTorrent::File people would get to modules that would work
    together: one for extraction of information from torrents and one
    for creation of torrents. furthermore it would be nice to have an
    interface to both modules that can be part of further releases of my
    module.

  enteredby:   QANTINS (Marc Qantins)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar 15 17:32:15 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::BitTorrent::
::Scrape          bdpOp Extracting information from Bittorrent Files QANTINS
