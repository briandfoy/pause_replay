The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Client::MPD
  DSLIP:       cmpng
  description: POE component to speak with MPD servers
  userid:      JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    mailing list: audio-mpd@googlegroups.com (see
    http://groups.google.com/group/audio-mpd), subversion:
    https://svn.musicpd.org/MPD.pm/poe-trunk

  similar:
    Audio::MPD (non-POE aware)

  rationale:

    i recently adopted Audio::MPD, a module to communicate with mpd
    (music player daemon) servers.

    i put it back to shape, with lots of improvements both in term of
    features and cleaning.

    new versions of mpd (not yet released) will feature asynchronous
    information. this kind of stuff does not work well with Audio::MPD
    scheme. it's not a problem for Audio::MPD, which will simply ignore
    those. but i'd like to provide a full-blown module that will handle
    every mpd feature... and POE is the framework that will enable this.

    so, i propose to create a POE::Component::Client::MPD module that
    is basically Audio::MPD ported to the POE framework, enabling for
    future mpd goodness.

    POE::Component::Client is the namespace for such reusable
    high-level components, hence the module name.

    i don't intend to drop Audio::MPD, i will continue to work on it -
    despite its smaller feature set.

    (btw, i don't know what to put in 'interface style', since POE uses
    events... i've put 'none' while waiting for future instructions)

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Client::
::MPD             cmpng POE component to speak with MPD servers      JQUELIN
