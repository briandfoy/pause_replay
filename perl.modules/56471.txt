Actually, Oak is registered as a namespace, more than a module in
itself, there's a series of modules called Oak::* that resides in this
namespace.

On the other hand, this modules consists of a web development framework,
which, as most ( :) ) web frameworks is now completely superceded by
Catalyst. So, I should probably proceed letting it to backpan only. Is
there some statistics of downloads of that modules?
