The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Simpy
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: OOP Simpy (social bookmarking) service API
  userid:      BEADSLAND (Beads Land)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/simpyapi
    http://www.transpartisanmeshworks.org simpy-dev@yahoogroups.com
    transpartisanmeshworks@yahoogroups.com

  similar:
    Other than two misspellings of "simply" in CPAN, does not appear to
    addressed yet

  rationale:

    Although the Simpy project on SourceForge.net is titled "SimpyAPI",
    it seems to me that Simpy::API is more in keeping with Perl module
    naming conventions.

    I see Brian Foy has suggested I simply go with "Simpy", however.
    (For some reason that reply never reached my INBOX.) That's fine
    also.

    No attempt has yet been made to develop a Perl module for Simpy. As
    it stands there are only modules in Java (1.1), Python (0.1), and
    PHP (0.1) (all of which have their CVS repositories hosted as part
    of the umbrella sourceforge project). Development of the Perl
    Simpy::API would run concurrently with development of the other
    language packages for the API.

    Distributing production versions of Simpy::API through the CPAN
    module list would be consistent with current best practices in Perl
    development, and would expose the Simpy::API module to use by a
    wider community of Perl developers than availability through
    SourceForge.net alone, thereby creating a more robust feedback cycle
    to continuously improve both the Simpy::API Perl module and the
    Simpy API more generally.

The resulting entry would be:
