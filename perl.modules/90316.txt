     why:

    I've been coding with Perl for a few years and want to give back to
    the community as it's given so much to me. I don't have any specific
    module I can think of on the tip of my tongue that I'd like to
    contribute but I am writing a search engine framework for SEO in
    Perl at the moment and would love to add the modules to CPAN when
    finished. :)
