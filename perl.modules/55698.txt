The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Fcntl_Lock
  DSLIP:       RdcOp
  description: File locking with fcntl()
  userid:      JTT (Jens Thoms Törring)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Since the module does file locking putting it under File seems to
    me to be reasonable. The name Fcntl_Lock hopefully clearly expresses
    what the module does, i.e. allowing to do file locking using
    fcntl(2) instead of flock(2) (which is the default method used by
    the flock() Perl function). Using fcntl() has some advantages,
    especially when an open file descriptor has been inherited via a
    fork() call and then the parent and child process need to
    synchronize access to the file - which can't be done with a flock()
    based lock. Moreover, flock() does not allow locking of parts of a
    file. To my best knowlege a comparable module does not exist yet.
    There seem to be a few modules that use fcntl() locking, but always
    in some specialized context only. And while the built-in Perl
    function fcntl() probably could be used it's rather difficult to get
    it right, especially if a script is supposed to be portable.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Fcntl_Lock      RdcOp File locking with fcntl()                    JTT
