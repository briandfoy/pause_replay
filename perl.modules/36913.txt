The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Paginate
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: OO interface to paginate data  with 1 module
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    beginners@perl.org

  similar:
    Data::Pager and Data::Pageset, they are not used (use() wise or code
    wise) I didn't like their error handling paradigm and they only did
    the calulations you still had to make a good chunk of code to use
    those values to get anythign to display

  rationale:

    I wanted this module because similar modules relied on other
    obscure modules, had bad error handling, and were confusing because
    the subclassed ones (loosely used) had different names,
    (Data::Paginated is a thin wrapper around Data::Pageset,
    Data::Pageset inherits from Data::Page, instead of
    Date::Page::Set::CurrentPage and Data::Page::Set respectively) and
    they only gave you values they didn't actually help you implement
    those values into a navigation menu, Data::Page had "cracks" that'd
    leave certain values unchanged when they needed to be. (Its been a
    while so I can't remember the specifics..), Some limited you to HTML
    output only...

    What it does is not only give you access to the same types of
    information in regard to paginating, it gives you functions for
    outputting HTML/whatever nav menus, with methods to control all
    settings and output.

    Its quite slick and I use it in out company database system now.

    I was thinking Data::Paginate or Data::Paginate[Complete|Easy] or
    Data::Paginator for the name space.

    Then if someone wants to come upwith special functionality to make
    paginated menus for TTY, Tk, etc all they have to do it
    Data::Paginate::Foo Data::Paginate::Etc

    Thanks :)
