Hello,


I uploaded a new version of this module suite, and the PAUSE indexer
gave me these strange errors:

> Status of this distro: Decreasing version number

In other terms, RackMan::Config has no $VERSION, but it was coerced
into 0 for distribution 1.18, and undef is considered < 0. I would
tend to see undef and zero as equal, here.

This is the same for all the modules of the distribution, except the
only one where $VERSION is defined:

>      module : RackMan

I feel a bit confused. Do we now need to define $VERSION in each and
every modules?


Thanks in advance
