Hi!

I've just been made co-maintainer of the Petal module by Bruno Postle who's 
not maintaining it anymore. I tried releasing a new version that's acutally 
installable on Perl >= 5.12 but got a Permission missing for all submodules in 
the Petal namespace. Seems like I only got permissions for the top level 
module.

As Bruno will be unavailable for another week (see attached mail), could you 
extend my permissions to the whole namespace? I'm quite sure this is what he 
intended in the first place.

Thanks,
Stefan NINE Seifert

There is a CVS repo in the petal-utils project in sourceforge: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/petal-utils/

I know it's CVS, but HG and git didn't even exist when Petal was 
developed.  If you don't want to work with CVS then I'm happy to 
migrate to something else so long as the history is preserved (or if 
you don't like sourceforge, github is ok too).

Actually I'm not the main author, but inherited it after he quit.

I've been away and I'll be on holiday for another week, so I'll be 
out of touch until 1st September.  I made you a co-maintainer in 
cpan/pause, if you get a sourceforge id, I'll add you there too.
