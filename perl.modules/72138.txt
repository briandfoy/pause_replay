Devel::Comments is the new name. My thanks to all who thought about
this. Please look for upcoming release and RFC.

Could be. Or rewrite could lay a foundation for a more useful tool,
invite collaboration, and drive existing bugs out into the light. We'll
see. Nothing is guaranteed. 

My initial attempt to print smart output to a disk file was essentially
a naive s/STDERR/$outfh/g. If that had worked with a little tweaking,
I'd not have invested more effort. This thing (Devel::Comments) has
taken *all* of my very limited Perl time for the last 2 months; it has
been a digression from Devel::Hump/Test::Hump, which is itself a
digression from my actual main project, in which real end-users (human
people with cash money in their fists, not computer wizards) have taken
interest. I have not touched the main project in over 4 months. I didn't
dig deeply into Smart::Comments without reason. 

After so much time cleaning house, I'm much more able to incorporate
feature requests, of which I've already had quite a few. I suspect that
flexible output will be taken for granted -- as you say, a minor
feature.  

Now I have to cut this short -- you're welcome to think more on how to
write it but I have to work on what to call it. 

The reason for this RFC was to solicit comments on the name of the
module. I think it's important to settle that issue so comments such as
yours about how it should be written can be entertained -- so that one
can point to, say, a given branch of a GitHub repo or a given line of
code or a given identifier and not just be generating a series of dead
links. ("What is this ::Any he keeps talking about, anyway?")

Once I fix up the name, I will push to repo and also do a CPAN upload.
We'll see the smoke and I'll be very interested in collaboration. 


> If you've had an explicit "not interested" reply ...

CHORNY (current maintainer) has not responded in any way. I've posted
here and to c.l.p.modules; I've emailed several different addys; I've
noded in PerlMonks; I've /msg-ed [chorny]. There are any number of
reasons why he might have better things to do. 

DCONWAY (original author) chose to reply on PerlMonks
(http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=851245):

    I'd suggest Devel::Comments would be the best choice...

Essentially all PerlMonks discussion points in this direction. We had a
very well-reasoned argument made in ChatterBox in support of
'Devel::Comments', also.

See? Even you (MSTROUT) agree it's the more technically correct name.
Meanwhile, only you and I (XIONG) think it's an argument that the
offspring of $Dad should, "obviously", be titled '$Dad::$Mikey'.
Devel::Comments will be found; it doesn't need to make Google's Feeling
Lucky. 

I bow to the consensus.
