DESCRIPTION:

I would like to contribute two modules I am currently working on.

1. Following an XML-Schema to store and stream XML data from a database.  It
will allow programmers to utilize the XML, psudo-natively, while storing it
in a DBI-accessible database.  The aim is from a code level, be able to
query, update, and add XML data, but be scalable by containing it in a
database.  I am also planning to include some limited XQL support.

2. The other module is an XML to PDF module.  This is a higher level module
that converts XML  data (focusing on catalog data) to PDF format, it uses
the PDF::Create module.

They should be beta-ready in about a month or two.


Thanks,
Brian Kaney
