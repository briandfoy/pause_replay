I would agree. But I do think this module should be in a namespace
like Data::, I don't see anything outstanding that would say
"this is really different from other data modules". However
Properties does not stand out as a description of what your module
does. Maybe something like Data::StreamedHash (which for some
reason made me think of CreamedMash, I don't know why :-)
