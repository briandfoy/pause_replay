Good localtime every one,

I started writing a module, and I believe nothing currently exists on
CPAN that would provide the same fonctionality. I am in need of a good
name for that module, and after seeking advice on the modules-author
mailing list, it looks like their is a need to start the new
Distributed:: namespace.

But let's start with the need that lead to the writing of the module.

I had to conduct stress tests on a web based application. During the
test session, many requests would be fired at the server at once.
Unfortunately, I only had a low end computer to run the tests, a machine
that would die of exhaustion before the server starts getting tired. So
I let the same test program run on several machines at the same time.
But I still had to run around the room and hit return on all these
machines (ok, it's an image, I do know about ssh) so that "at the same
time" really means something. And I had to use scp or something to
collect the results from the tests on the different machines.

I wanted to do this automatically, by writing a module. The module
provides a server, a client, and a base Tester class to inherit from.
The server will redefine some methods of the Tester class so that
invoking them will in fact send a query to the connected clients. The
client will run the "real" method and return the results.

I first thought of calling this module Test::Distributed, but:
- the fine folks at perl-qa didn't like it, because it's nothing to do
  with Test::More.
- come to think of it, it could be used for something other that
  testing.

In fact, it's only about running the same piece of code on several
computers, hence the idea of Distribued. It is not about running several
bits off the same code in parallel on the same computer, so I don't
think it belongs to Parallel::, and Cluster:: carries a notion of high
availability which is not what my module does.

I'd like to call it Distributed::Process, what do you think ?

Thank you in advance for your attention.
