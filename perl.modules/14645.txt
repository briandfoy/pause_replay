Such as ^MySQL::Abstract or ^Oracle?

Perhaps the modules belong under ^Persistence?  It's an oo persistence framework, or a database application framework.

Honestly, I don't mind changing the naming, but I do care about changing the hierarchy.  Naming it ^MySQL::Abstract::DB etc means I have to make several changes to other classes in order to maintain support for more than one type of database.

I am sure the premise of these classes is not new, perhaps someone has a pointer to how others have named them?

thnx
