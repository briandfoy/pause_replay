The Fabless Semiconductor Association's (FSA) 2002 Suppliers Expo	 
FSA is holding its annual premier event on October 3, 2002 at the Santa
Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA. FSA is dedicated to bringing
together suppliers, fabless com-panies, IDM's and other organizations that
play a vital role in the semiconductor industry of which Chipworks is proud
to be part of. The goal of the Expo is to encourage partnerships with
suppliers/vendors and illustrate what partnerships can accomplish within the
industry. This year's Expo features more than 125 exhibitors/suppliers,
allowing over 1,200 attendees. This is your opportunity to persue the latest
services, products, and state-of-the-art technology available. Visit
Chipworks at booth 112 and find out what's new inside technology.
