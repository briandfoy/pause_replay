Hi, Krishna.

It's there now.

There is a delay between uploading to PAUSE and when the distributed
CPAN mirrors (including search.cpan.org) pick it up.  There are a
handful of "fast" CPAN mirrors that pick up new modules within
minutes, most mirrors synchronize once or twice a day, and
search.cpan.org updates every few hours, I think.

There is also a delay between when the tarball is mirrored and when
the master module index is updated and mirrored.  Generally speaking,
once PAUSE tells you it's accepted your module, give it a few hours
before you worry.  You can check your directory on a fast mirror like
here:

http://cpan.cpantesters.org/authors/id/K/KC/KCHAITAN/

If that shows your uploaded tarball, you're all set and then you just
need to wait for the indexing to catch up.
