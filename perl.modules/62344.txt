Makes sense.

These modules are an API client, but I agree it is somewhat redundant.

Thanks for the great suggestions.  I didn't know the WebService 
namespace existed; previously I was thinking that this module might be 
better called Net::WWW::iThenticate, but Webservice makes more sense. 
I'll make that change with the next release.
