Subject: Excel::Template disappeared!!
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org

Jarkko / Brian -

    Excel::Template is no longer available on CPAN, apparently. It
doesn't show up in search.cpan.org for "excel template" and if you
click on the registered link from my author page, it says "Nothing
Found".

    I've issued the reindexing, but will that fix the problem when I
don't even know what the problem is?

    Help?

Thanks,
Rob
