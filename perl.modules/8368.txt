I'd like to contribute a WWW::SMS module to the community: it is meant 
to give developer an interface to easy send SMS via free web SMS 
services. I have found there is a project called Net::SMS::Web but i'm 
taking a really different approach to the problem, reflecting the 
different namespace i'm gonna occupy.
My approach is to have a standard SMS object: you can use any of the 
submodules provided (for example WWW::SMS::GoldenTelecom) to send this 
SMS. It's all to the submodule to do the GET and POST required and send 
the sms. It's kinda difficult to explain it by words but i will send you 
the scratch of my work if you give me an e-mail address to send to.
Thank you and kind regards.
