How do I get the "License" field filled in for my modules on 
search.cpan.org?

I have two modules on CPAN, both registered, and both with the "License" 
category in the Module Metadata set to "standard Perl license", but when 
I view them on search.cpan.org they both show "License: Unknown" -- see:

    http://search.cpan.org/~shay/Win32-SharedFileOpen-3.16/
    http://search.cpan.org/~shay/Win32-UTCFileTime-1.30/

Thanks,
- Steve
