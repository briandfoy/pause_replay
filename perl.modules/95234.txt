Hi Brian,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where people =
are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

You have ownership of the module =E2=80=9CAO=E2=80=9D, which clashes =
with =E2=80=98Ao=E2=80=99, owned by used FOOF. FOOF=E2=80=99s module is =
still indexed on CPAN, but your AO module is no longer on CPAN (I can =
see that it was last released to CPAN in January 2001, but can=E2=80=99t =
see when you removed it from CPAN).

As a result I=E2=80=99d like to drop your permissions on =E2=80=9CAO=E2=80=
=9D. =46rom looking at your releases, I don=E2=80=99t think this will =
cause any problems, but wanted to check with you. Are you ok with this?

Cheers,
Neil
