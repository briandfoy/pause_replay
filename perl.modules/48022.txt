Did you try other channels than RT? Not everybody is using RT and
familiar with it, so you might find him answer when you write to him
directly? I CC this mail to him, you might want to try google searches
for his new email adress. But you should make up your mind about your
own willingness to step in before you start.

You could, for example, take it over and do the small amount of
changes you are ready to do, write in the readme that you're looking
for a new active maintainer, upload and be done with it.

So please make up your mind and let us know when you're ready to roll
a release.
