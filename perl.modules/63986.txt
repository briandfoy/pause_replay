The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::MockCommand
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Provides mock results for external commands
  userid:      KYZ (Stuart Caie)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    mailinglists, newsgroups, anywhere you like

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are no other modules which mock external commands.

    There are lots of other modules which mock things for testing
    purposes, these tend to be called Test::Mock*

    Precedent for Test::Mock*

    Test::MockClass Test::MockDBI Test::MockModule Test::MockObject
    Test::MockTime

    Precedent for *::Mock

    DBD::Mock (has to be called this) Time::Mock (does pretty much what
    Test::MockTime does) Win32::Mock Fey::ORM::Mock (part of Fey::ORM)

    - I rejected this naming because I'd have to make my own root
    namespace

    Precedent for Test::Mock::*

    Test::Mock::CouchDBSchema Test::Mock::LWP

    - not as popular as Test::Mock*

  enteredby:   KYZ (Stuart Caie)

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::MockCommand     RdpOp Provides mock results for external commands  KYZ
