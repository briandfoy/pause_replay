What you build on top of and the thing you produce don't have to have
the same name. Even though the names aren't really hierarchical, people
tend to think that a sub-namespace is really a subclass. If you don't
want to send that message, 

In your case, it looks like your application is not intended as a
subclass of Net::DNS. I still think something like Sinkhole or
DNSinkhole (one s!) would be more app-y. :)
