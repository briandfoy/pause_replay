The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CAD::Drawing
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Flexible Vector Geometry Composition in Perl
  userid:      EWILHELM (Eric Wilhelm)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    module-authorsATperl.org, pythoncadATpython.org,
    cad-linux-devATfreelists.org, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are currently no modules available for loading and
    manipulating geometric data from dxf and dwg formats. This module
    does this and much more, providing a quick and consistent interface
    regardless of source or destination format. It encapsulates what I
    think is a robust and flexible data structure for 2D geometric data.

    It currently supports loading and saving dwg and dxf formats via
    the openDWG toolkit. Saving is also possible to Image::Magick
    formats and to postscript (via PostScript::Simple.) The driving idea
    behind this module is to unify the interface to multiple
    file-formats and encapsulate the geometric data in an organized way.
    Adding support for other file types is just a matter of writing a
    load or save function for that type and will not change the
    programming interface.

    Entity selection and tracking is available through the use of hash
    references which act as addresses. Any manipulation function (move,
    copy, rotate, clone, mirror, clip, offset, delete) can operate on an
    entity (point, line, arc, circle, text, polyline) using only the
    address. This trivializes the writing of programs which deal with
    multiple drawings and formats and prevents errors and omissions when
    dealing with multiple entity types. It has been developed for use in
    batch-processing, but also makes geometric one-liners possible and
    would work well for prototyping cad software (though it currently
    has no gui components.)
