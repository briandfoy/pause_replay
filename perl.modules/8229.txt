Hi,

I would like to contribute to CPAN with modules I wrote and
the ones I am working on.

My name is Raul Silveira Dias 
and my e-mail is raul@dias.com.br

I have a home page at
http://www.swi.com.br/~chaos
and some subpages in the directories: 
cmc/
chngpwd/
files/
RPMS/


I am planning to contribute in a few areas with modules I have written
and the ones I am working on.

I wrote Event::File::tail to be used with event loop
I have written config parsers (YA)
Some rpm manipulate tools (modules)
Some high level apis to some Gtk+ widgets like Tree
Some mail (mbox) based manipulate modules
Some high level DBI manipulation tools (dbi <-> perl vars).
Some ldap authentication modules (cpan)
Some networking modules (like generic proxies)
I am planning to sub class IO::Socket to allow nonblocking
connect() (so it can be used in event loops).

If it was permited to have 3 letters USER-id on CPAN, i would like to use 
RSD

otherwise I would keep with 
RAUL




Regards to you all,

Raul Dias
