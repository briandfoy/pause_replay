<URL: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88059 >

The documentation and metadata (META.yml/META.json) for MooseX-Meta-Attribute-Lvalue doesn't list a source code repository to submit patches. I would like to submit a patch (in fact, an almost total rewrite) to fix the following RT bugs:

88056
88057
88058

... and also encompasses Evan Carroll's changes, to fix the large number of testing failures this module has.

Is MooseX-Meta-Attribute-Lvalue still being actively (or even passively!) maintained?

If so, how is best to submit the patch? By e-mail, or via RT? Or is there are publicly available source code repository I could contribute to?

If you are no longer maintaining this, would you be OK with handing co-maintainership over to me?

I've already sent you a message akin to this this by e-mail, but am filing it on RT as well so that there is a public record, and other people can see that there is an attempt to fix this module.

-Toby
