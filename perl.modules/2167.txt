I think, writing something for many or even all browsers, justifies
the namespace Browser, writing something for many or even all
workspaces, justifies the namespace Workspace, but writing a browser
or a workspace never justifies the namespaces Browser and Workspace
respectively. Just like a car is usually branded with a name, browsers
and workspaces should be branded too.

Let me illustrate how I personally deal with namespaces. When I'm
writing something bigger, I usually proceed by starting with a private
namespace, i.e. anything containing an underscore, e.g. the company
name that pays for the work and the codename. So I get names like
woolworth_billing, phillips_catalog or anderson_statistics
(disclaimer: names changed to protect the innocent:-). If such a
project gets shape and it makes sense to publish it, it is extremely
easy to rename the whole thing in one go with simple search and
replace.

Hope that helps,
