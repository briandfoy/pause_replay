The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Normalizer
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: 1st to 2nd normal form DB table converter
  userid:      GMAX (Giuseppe Maxia)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=132513

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Normalizer works with database tables, using the DBI as
    interface. Currently, it only works with MySQL tables, even though
    the algorithm is general, and it could be applied to other DBDs in
    future versions. Therefore I think that DBIx::Normalizer should be
    the most appropriate namespace. Moreover, being under DBIx, it will
    be easily separated from modules that deal with homonym functions
    for Unicode.

    The Normalizer is a OO module to help the Database Designer to
    convert database tables from 1st to 2nd Normal form. The algorithm
    is mostly SQL based, but the Perl interface makes the task much
    easier than manual coding. Using this module, fifteen lines of Perl
    are enough to accomplish most normalization tasks. Fine tuning of
    input/output is also available.

    Future versions will also include support for common tasks when
    converting from 0th to 1st normal form.

    There hasn't been any such utility available so far in the Free
    Software community.
