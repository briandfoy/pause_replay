Hi Dave,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving =
conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

Your =E2=80=9Cswig=E2=80=9D distribution has a number of packages which =
are now in conflict with others:

Your ownership of =E2=80=9Cexample=E2=80=9D conflicts with the =
=E2=80=9CExample=E2=80=9D module, owned by MSCHLUE

Your ownership of =E2=80=9Cswig=E2=80=9D conflicts with =E2=80=9CSWIG=E2=80=
=9D, owned by JASONS

Your ownership of =E2=80=9Cswig=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Ctext=E2=80=9D =
conflicts with =E2=80=9CTEXT=E2=80=9D (SHERZODR) and =E2=80=9CText=E2=80=9D=
 (AKHOBOV).

One way to resolve these permissions conflicts would be to rename your =
distribution, and then put all the other modules inside that namespace.

But given your swig distribution was last released in 1998, and hasn=E2=80=
=99t worked with any recent versions of Perl, I suspect that the better =
and easier course of action is to delete the distribution from CPAN, and =
drop your permissions on the relevant namespaces.

Would you be happy for me to do this on your behalf?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m working to resolve the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
