     why:

    I've worked with Brian Ingerson (INGY) before, and might be working
    with him again in the future. As you probably know, he's a prolific
    module-writer, as open-source-once-and-only-once is near the heart
    of his programming philosophy. One cannot work with him without
    becoming infected (or afflicted) by this thought. So, it's time I
    apply for an id.

    So far, I've only created an inconsequential Kwiki::Theme module,
    but might end up contributing a number of serious modules in the
    near future.
