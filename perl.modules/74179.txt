The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Protocol::IMAP
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Abstract IMAP mail protocol implementation
  userid:      TEAM (Tom Molesworth)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org/#io-async irc.freenode.net/#perl

  similar:
    Net::IMAPClient Net::IMAP::Simple Net::AXP

  rationale:

    Existing IMAP modules provide a good level of support for the IMAP
    protocol but are tightly coupled to the underlying TCP transport.

    This module provides an abstract API based on the underlying
    RFC3501 protocol, upon which other classes can be built to implement
    IMAP servers or clients. The core Protocol::IMAP class is there for
    documentation and some base methods, with the majority of the
    protocol implemented in the ::Server and ::Client subclasses.

    An example implementation is in Net::Async::IMAP which uses the
    IO::Async framework, this should be easy to reimplement as a POE
    component if required, and there's also the start of an
    IO::Socket::INET implementation in the examples/client.pl script.

    Since the network part of the protocol is abstracted, putting this
    under the Net:: namespace didn't seem to make much sense - there is
    also some inconsistency with Net::SOMETHING::Protocol vs.
    Net::Protocol::SOMETHING - and there appears to be precedent with
    Protocol::WebSocket for the top-level Protocol:: namespace.

The resulting entry would be:
