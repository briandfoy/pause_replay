I authored Net::vCard - that name space did not meet enough support to 
be registered. Subsequently Text::vCard is gaining sound approval from 
module-authors lists plus Leo who has written a comparable 
implementation. Leo and I are now collaborating on this project. Once 
this name space matter is complete I will be removing that module and 
directing all users to this work.

Net::iCal is alpha code written to support RFC2445 originating from a 
projected called Reefknot. It seems unlikely that this code will be 
continued to be developed. [ some key issues have caused the module to 
dead-end and requires complete revamping from what I understand ]

> Text::vFile
> Text::vFile::Card
> Text::vFile::Calendar

vCard can come in an RSS flavour as well ( The RSS form is in draft 
RFC). I anticipate the same with iCalendar format. The data format is 
expressed in what I have dubbed "vFile" and it is strikingly similar 
between the two modules. But, as you can see they need not be expressed 
exclusively in this form even though the actual information is 
identical.

We do feel that it would be of greater service to the developer to see 
in their code:
	use Text::vCard;
	my $card = Text::vCard->new;

than
	use Text::vFile::vCard;
	my $card = Text::vFile::vCard->new;

  The vFile is really secondary - the prime object is vCard, vFile is 
transport mechanism.

Therefore I would suggest that the vFile be buried in favour of the 
vCard taking the prominence.  Since we will use this parser cross 
module it does make sense to separate it out and treat it as an 
independent component as well.

Perhaps the Text::vFile name is misleading - but from our perspective 
was a core prerequisite to this whole process.

Thanks again for your input and consideration,
Jay Lawrence
