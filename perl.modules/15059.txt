i really do not like the Parse namespace for these sorts of things.
the things in Parse::* (Lex, Token, Yapp, RecDescent) build or are
part of parsers, rather than something that performs a task that
happens to parse something along the way.

Since the endpoint for all of your transformations are XML, i think
it belongs with the other XML application modules.

i'm also not thrilled with "Any", which just seems like a lie.  i
bet i can come up with more formats you can't parse than it can
actually handle.  you say it parses text, but that's hardly
"any". it seems purposedly deceptive.

the marketing aspect or a marketing department's investment in a 
name has no relevance in a proper name, in my opinion.
