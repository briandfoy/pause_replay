Subject: I have released Task:: as a successor to Bundle::

After much thought, I have finally gone with Task:: as my 
convention-rather-than-magic-feature successor Bundle::.

The basis for this decision is that "Task" has the highest ambiguity I 
can find in module terms, and there is a precedent of the "task" 
packages in debian.

For posterity, I've announced the new namespace in my journal

http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/27660

Thanks for the contribution earlier, I so nearly went with Bunch:: or 
Install:: but in the end it just wasn't descriptive enough.
