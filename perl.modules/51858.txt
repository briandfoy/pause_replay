Hello!

I'm CPAN contributor ARTHAS. I recently patched (almost rewrote) the module:

Template::Plugin::Textile

in order to support some features which were really missing (i.e. to 
disable the parsing of HTML tags within Textile).

I tried to get in touch with the author of the module, but couldn't. 
Since I'd like to release my work on CPAN, I'm writing you so maybe you 
can help me either in contacting the author (and see if he still wants 
to maintain that module) or help me in deciding what to do since I would 
prefer not to upload another module which will partly be a duplicate of 
the original.

Thanks,
Michele.
