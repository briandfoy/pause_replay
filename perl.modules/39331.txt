Hi there brian...
I translate them, with the pack/unpack function.
The module, is merely a pack/unpack quick through the data types.
It is a common day-by-day operation for me, so I thought it could be for 
other people as well.

Regards.
Denis A.V.Jr.

are you really translating data types, or merely data representations?

The computer doesn't store the data in ascii, hex, or decimal, and we
can easily represent it as something else with printf().  Perhaps
there is something else your module does that would be a better
example.
