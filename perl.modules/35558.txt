James,

 From your description, your module sounds like it would fit better in 
the CGI::* namespace than the HTML::* namespace.  Unless it is large 
enough to warrant a top-level framework-name like 'Maypole' etc.  See 
the CGI::* modules for possible examples of how you could name yours.

Also so you know, I have had a module (and friends) up on CPAN since 
4 years ago which does a lot of what you describe (they were also 
partly created to deal with shortcomings of CGI.pm).  Have a look at 
CGI::Portable and HTML::FormTemplate (plus the modules they use).

In my experience, you *may* be served by splitting your module set up 
if the components have a reasonable chance of being used on their 
own.  Don't split gratuitously of course; if you do, then each will 
need its own identity.  (Of course, I see you kept your DBI extension 
separate, which is a very good thing.)

You should have a module name that says how you differentiate 
yourself mainly from the other CGI::* or server-side-app frameworks. 
This is more important than the HTML thing and encompasses it.

In this day and age, when one of the most popular types of modules on 
CPAN is a CGI.pm replacement or enhancement (everyone wants to do 
it), or a DBI extension, you have to try extra hard to demonstrate 
how you are different from the others.

And the comparison has to be vs what is there TODAY, not when you 
started your modules.
