Does your module do something that the DateTime version can't? Since
both modules have to deal with the same computer clock and math
operations, can you fix any round-off errors in the DateTime version,
rather than creating a new module?

I think it would be much better to improve the DateTime version instead
of making a new module and creating another development path. :)
