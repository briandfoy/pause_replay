Ultimately my intention is to parse a query, then do some =
transformations on
the parse tree, and then pass the query for execution to DBI. All of =
this
will eventually happen behind the scenes, that is DBIx::MyParse would =
act as
a front-end to DBI, which is the idea behind many DBIx modules (such as
DBIx::Threaded)
