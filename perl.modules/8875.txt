Hi all,

as perl's a big part of my job I thought I really should contribute to the
open source movement and get a PAUSE account, the knock on effects being to
a) make the world a better place, and b) give the impression that I'm
moving up the perl food chain.

    Name: Piers Kent
   Email: pause@selsyn.co.uk
Homepage: none
      ID: PKENT

Planned uploads:
faithful reimplementation + more of BSD banner(1) - non-OO API. (cf.
Text::Banner)
tiny thing to recover passwords from WS_FTP (a seemingly popular Windows
FTP client)
a pragma called vague, to reduce precision in program flow, evaluation, etc.

And more seriously:
Perl module to send status messages to a Big Brother monitoring server.
I'll do a similar thing for Netsaint when my test installation is running.
There seems to be nothing at all related to BB or Netsaint on CPAN, but
correct if I'm wrong.

Any advice on namespaces for these items would be most welcome.

Also doing some work on WWW::Robot but that would be posted under the
maintainer's account I assume.

regards
P
