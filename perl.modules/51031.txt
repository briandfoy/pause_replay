     why:

    I have created a ProtectedString module which can be used to sanely
    handle storage of sensitive data such as credit card numbers, which
    have varying levels of sensitivity: empty string (for unauthorized
    users), a display version (i.e.: last four digits, for authorized
    users), and the plaintext full unprotected string (for credit card
    processing backend systems), for example.

    Additionally, I plan to contribute Catalyst plugins that provide
    Task-based request flow control. Tasks are an extension of
    already-implemented Continuations in Catalyst.
