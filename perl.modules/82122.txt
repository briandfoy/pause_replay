My concern is this:  The dependency chain for Bytes::Random::Secure is
anything *but* minimal.  It relies on Math::Random::Secure, which in
turn relies on Any::Moose, Crypt::Random::Source, and
Math::Random::ISAAC.  And two of those three have additional
dependencies, and so on.

On the other hand Bytes::Random has no dependencies besides Perl itself.

My thought was that Bytes::Random::Secure could be a drop-in
replacement for Bytes::Random.  It also provides a few extra
functions, but its primary function should behave exactly like
Bytes::Random, but using a higher quality rand generator.  That extra
security comes at a greater cost, so a developer could make it an
optional dependency without changing any code.

The name makes it clear that this is the cryptographically sound
implementation, removing any ambiguity as to which module might be
appropriate for a given purpose.

However, if you feel strongly that it should be wrapped into
Bytes::Random, I could get in touch with the author and try to work
something out.  I do have the additional concern that by making
Bytes::Random prefer the "secure" mode if dependencies are present,
and fall back on the unsecure mode otherwise, we introduce some
uncertainty that could be a little more difficult for the module's
users to manage.

For my own uses, I prefer to know for certain that when I request
Bytes::Random::Secure I get the secure version, and don't have to
explicitly ensure that its dependencies are present in a build so that
it will function as I expect.  As its own module, I know that when it
installs via cpanm, it's the secure version.
