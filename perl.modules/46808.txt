The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Proxy
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Framework for proxying network connections
  userid:      BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    irc://irc.perl.org/#perlfr

  similar:

  rationale:

    A proxy is a program that transfer data across a network boundary
    between a client and a server. Net::Proxy introduces the concept of
    "connectors", which abstract the server part (connected to the
    client) and the client part (connected to the server) of the proxy.

    This makes it very easy to implement specific techniques to cross a
    given network boundary, possibly by using a proxy on one side of the
    network fence, and a reverse-proxy on the other side of the fence.

    Examples techniques include: HTTP CONNECT, httptunnel, FEP (not all
    of them are included in Net::Proxy, but could be added by writing
    the appropriate subclass of Net::Proxy::Connector).

The resulting entry would be:
