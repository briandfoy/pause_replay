     why:

    I'm a long time user of perl who has spent nearly his entire
    development career sheltered in the quiet bays of a specific
    home-brewed MVC that is not publicly available to anyone. This has
    made me rusty, and I need to change that by becoming involved in the
    community, by doing some of my own projects, making them available,
    and incurring the necessary wrath of critical feedback. If I can,
    then, contribute something of value in return, then all the better.

    Right off the top of my head, I have notions of creating an
    easy-to-implement MVC bundle for social network microcosms; for
    crowd-sourcing knowledge streams, community resources, et cetera...
    higher level stuff than most cpan modules, I presume, but offered
    for free and potentially valuable to some people.
