PAAIA News Release

We seek to portray an Image of Iranian Americans worthy of their
contributions to America.
We are PAAIA.

May 1, 2012, Los Angeles, CA -  The  -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?PublicAffairsAllianc/7cdbaf157e/9e50a94a56/15204397=
98 Iranians Count 2010 Census Coalition ("ICCC") is continuing its
efforts to ensure that the number of Iranian Americans in the United
States is accurately reported by the U.S. Census Bureau.  With the
results from the 2010 Census officially tabulated, the ICCC recently
requested a special tabulation report on the number of individuals
who identified themselves as Iranian, Iranian American, Persian, or
Persian American in the 2010 Census.

According to the Census Bureau, a total of 289,465 responded to the
question of race in the 2010 Census by marking "x" in the "Some Other
Race" box and writing Iranian/Persian alone or in a combination.  The
majority of the write-in responses came from California (157,225),
while Texas (20,440) and New York (12,095) received the second and
third highest write-in responses.   -

The tally for Iranian write-in responses only represents people who
made a concerted effort to write in these particular responses in
2010. It does not represent, nor is it reflective of the total count
of the number of individuals of Iranian ancestry in America.

Federal data on Iranian Americans is not derived from the question of
race in the Decennial Census but rather from question of ancestry,
which is collected through the annual American Community Survey
(ACS). Data on Iranian ancestry from the annual ACS is available on
the Census Bureau's American Factfinder -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?PublicAffairsAllianc/7cdbaf157e/9e50a94a56/7bf38cc6=
1a  website.  The ACS is an ongoing statistical survey by the U.S.
Census Bureau sent to a small percentage of the population on a
rotating basis throughout the decade.  It has replaced the census
long form, which was sent to one-in-six households every ten years.=20
It includes a question on ancestry and provides communities with
demographic, social, economic, and housing information.

Like other ethnic groups, the number of Iranian Americans has
historically been under-represented in Census data.  The under
representation can be attributed to the lack of participation in the
census surveys as well as the method used by the Bureau to obtain
such information.  For example, although the ACS produces estimations
on ancestry, it covers only a sample population of 3 million
individuals per year (about 12.5% of the total population every five
years).  Unlike the ACS, the Decennial Census reaches every household
and has no margin of error.  However, it only asks ten basic
questions, excluding ancestry.
