Hi,

For a number of years now (maybe 10?) I've been the primary maintainer 
of XML::Parser on CPAN. Clark Cooper the original maintainer has been 
MIA and uncontactable for all that time...

I'd like to be able to add my own co-maintainers.

To that end is it possible to invert this relationship? Make me primary 
maintainer and Clark a secondary (in case he ever re-surfaces)?

Matt.
