The best way is to ask Mike to log into PAUSE and select "Change
Permissions" in the menu on the left. In the next page, under "3. Making
and unmaking co-maintainers", he can select the module name and press
the button labeled "3.1 Make somebody else co-maintainer" and enter your
PAUSE ID in the next form to add you as co-maintainer.

Best regards,
Steffen
