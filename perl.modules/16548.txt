Dear Sirs/Madam

Re =96 http://www.interhoney.com

The above named site goes live on 1st February 2003, we are looking for =
web sites to help us promote ours.

We believe after reviewing your site you may benefit from this request


If you put our logo in a prominent position (with hyperlink ) on your we=
b site, every time an order is completed and paid for from your referral=
, we will pay you a commission of 0.15 euros,=20
although the commission itself does not seem much if we recive  100  ord=
ers from your referrals a total of 15.38 euros will be sent to you. The =
more hits your web site takes the more=20
chances of a referral and commission. Payments will be made only when th=
e total commission due is 15.38 euros or more however there is no time s=
cale.

To activate this all you need to do is copy our logo and add  a hyperlin=
k to http://www.interhoney.com.=20

our postal address=20

Or call me on 07766 768389

good clean site and an honest and fast service I hope you will support u=
s. We will of course support you with a=20
