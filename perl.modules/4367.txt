FWIW I agree; I like the idea of having an actual implementation of
Net::SSH.

I've talked to the author of the current Net::SSH, and he suggested
something similar to what Kurt suggested: that we make Net::SSH itself an
interface to several different implementations. Mine a Perl implementation,
his a wrapper implementation, etc. And if someone writes an XS
implementation (which I actually investigated but thought it would be rather
tricky to maintain multiple ssh connections at once).

The question I asked him, and to which I haven't yet heard back, is how this
works w/r/t module maintenance. Who maintains which part, and who maintains
the main Net::SSH interface, etc.?

Thanks,
Ben
