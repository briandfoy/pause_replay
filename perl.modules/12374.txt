The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Debug
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Module Assiting the debugging process.
  userid:      AASSAD (Arnaud Assad)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    modules list, perlmonks.

  similar:
    Monitor, Carp::Assert

  rationale:

    This module uses Filter, this enable me to trigger the debugging
    features THROUGH COMMENTS. This also means that when the 'use
    devel::Debug' line is commented out there's no debugging code
    present (and I really mean 'present' not only 'enabled')

    This module also try to groups(and enhance) several features found
    in several modules into only one.

    I've tried to contact other people claiming Devel::Debug before but
    I got no answers.

    If no one disagree I prefer to release it under this name rather
    than the Filter::Debug which seems inappropriate to me.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Debug           adphp Module Assiting the debugging process.       AASSAD
