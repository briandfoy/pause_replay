The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Transaction
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: DBMS-agnostic nested database transactions
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    dbi-users@perl.org

  similar:
    DBI::Transaction

  rationale:

    DBIx::Transaction is a wrapper around DBI that helps you manage
    your database transactions. It pays attention to nested transactions
    (having a begin_work/commit..rollback inside if another
    begin_work/commit..rollback) and the AutoCommit attribute of your
    database handle, making your code simpler and more resistant to
    different database drivers and options.

    I think this module is neccessary to provide a database-independant
    way of managing nested transactions. It will also enable packages
    that use database handles to "not care" if AutoCommit is set or not;
    using DBIx::Transaction, they can just accept a database handle and
    do all their transactions with a "begin_work" ... "commit/rollback".

    DBI::Transaction exists, but it encapsulates the database handle
    (rather than subclassing it), is buggy, has next to nothing in the
    way of unit tests or documentation, and the author has not been
    receptive to either improving it or allowing me to do so.

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
