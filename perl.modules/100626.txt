Context guesswork:

- citations from toolchain
- possibly talking about ETJ/PDL-LinearAlgebra-0.13.tar.gz
- did you receive the email that pause sent to you after the upload?
- if you got it: what is not clear in that email?
- if you didn't get it: maybe look into your spam folder?
- ELLIPSE has firstcome permissions on PDL::LinearAlgebra and is the
  first authority to decide upon its fate
- when there is further context that I'm missing, please provide
  pointers
