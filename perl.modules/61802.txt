Subject: Module submission RWDE

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RWDE
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Rapid Web Development Environment (MVC type)
  userid:      VKHERA (Vivek Khera)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    www.rwde.org is coming soon with mail lists, blog, forums, etc.

  similar:
    Jifty Catalyst

  rationale:

    RWDE is an application framework like Jifty (and perhaps Catalyst).
    However, RWDE is extremely small, very easy to install because it
    only depends on a handful of other CPAN modules, and quick to learn.
    Furthermore, unlike the other frameworks, it is designed to work
    with database-based business logic -- it does not treat the DB as a
    dumb store. It is fully compatible with foreign keys, trigger-based
    updates, etc, and works best with a properly normalized database
    design.

    Like Jifty and Catalyst, it doesn't really fit inside any other
    existing namespace.

    The module will be co-maintained by DAMJANP and KAMELKEV

The resulting entry would be:

RWDE              bdpOp Rapid Web Development Environment (MVC type) VKHERA
