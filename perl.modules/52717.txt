The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::QOFQSF
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: Parse QSF XML files (QOF)
  userid:      CODEHELP (Neil Williams)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Provides a single home for all QOF objects expressed as QSF XML. A
    similar module for the SQLite backend is also planned for a separate
    module. Designed to provide simple perl access to data exported from
    any QOF project. Currently includes pilot-qof and gpe-expenses and
    will eventually include cashutil (which in turn provides access to
    gnucash data). XML::QOFQSF exports a single function, to parse a QSF
    XML file. Data from the file is read into an array of objects of
    each supported type and references to each array are added to the
    object_list hash using the object name as the key.

  enteredby:   CODEHELP (Neil Williams)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan 22 23:27:55 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::QOFQSF          adpfg Parse QSF XML files (QOF)                    CODEHELP
