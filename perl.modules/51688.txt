Is there a way to now add in a META.yml file? I think I'm not allowed to 
delete the file I uploaded and upload a new one with the same name? Does 
it in fact make any difference what the file name is? But if small 
problems keep arising and I have to keep changing the package and 
re-uploading it with a slightly different file name each time, that 
might not be ideal. What is the recommended process of going from an 
upload that gives a 'Failed: PAUSE indexer' report to an upload that 
fully passes?

Also, given a META.yml with "provides" attribute, will the indexer still 
try to parse VERSION anyway? Because it doesn't like one of the modules:

Status: Version parsing problem
===============================

      module: Bio::Ontology::SimpleGOEngine::GraphAdaptor
     version: undef
     in file: bioperl-1.5.2-RC3/Bio/Ontology/SimpleGOEngine/GraphAdaptor.pm
      status: The PAUSE indexer was not able to parse the following line
              in that file: C< ( defined $Graph::VERSION &&
              $Graph::VERSION >= 0.5 ) ? > Note: the indexer is running
              in a Safe compartement and cannot provide the full
              functionality of perl in the VERSION line. It is trying
              hard, but sometime it fails. As a workaround, please
              consider writing a proper META.yml that contains a
              'provides' attribute (currently only supported by
              Module::Build) or contact the CPAN admins to investigate
              (yet another) workaround against "Safe" limitations.)

Finally, what is the actual disadvantage of the indexer not fully 
passing? I note that I can find the modules that /did/ pass in a CPAN 
website search, but i /bioperl/ in cpan command line program doesn't 
show my upload. I presume the indexing must be perfect before it will 
appear there?

For one of the ones that worked, on the permission page it now says

Bio::Align::AlignI  	BIOPERLML  	first-come
Bio::Align::AlignI 	BIRNEY 	co-maint
Bio::Align::AlignI 	SENDU 	co-maint

Do I in fact have to take any action now? I think BIOPERLML remains the 
owner even after I upload?

When the next uploader is decided, I just need to add them as co-maint, 
right?
