Hi. 1 month ago I tried to contact the maintainer of "all" module and
still is no response. I think the maintainer is not active anymore.
His modules didn't have new releases for 3 years.

I contacted via email (response from mailserver is attached) and RT (Bug#40099).

I think is is good time to adapt his module and make it working.

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at x1.develooper.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<jduncan@fotango.com>:
Sorry, I couldn't find any host by that name. (#4.1.2)
I'm not going to try again; this message has been in the queue too long.

Hi. I've found you "all" package very handy and I'm interesting in
co-maintaining it. I would like to add some unbreakable test script
and take care that it builds cleanly with the latest Perl.

Or perhaps you prefer to get some patches and apply them by yourself?

TIA.
