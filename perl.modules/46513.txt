Subject: Module submission Term::ReadPassword::Win32

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::ReadPassword::Win32
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Asking the user for a password (for Win32)
  userid:      KTAKATA (Ken Takata)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Term::ReadPassword Term::Getch

  rationale:

    This is an alternative to Term::ReadPassword for Windows users.

    The name of this module was Term::ReadPasswd until ver.0.01. (The
    namespace Term::ReadPasswd has not been registered yet.) But now I
    think there is no need for a separate module just for Windows. So I
    rename Term::ReadPasswd to Term::ReadPassword::Win32.

  enteredby:   KTAKATA (Ken Takata)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 20 15:04:48 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Term::ReadPassword::
::Win32           Rdpfp Asking the user for a password (for Win32)   KTAKATA
