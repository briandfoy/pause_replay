The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::ResultsHelper
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: helps sort, paginate and display results set
  userid:      EARL (Earl Cahill)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Takes an array of arrays (which is a rather general structure for
    results sets), allows you to specify how many results per page,
    simple templates, sort specifications (numeric, ascii, regex out
    what to sort on, ascending or descending, multiple columns, uses my
    Sort::ArrayOfArrays), and outputs pages of results as per the sort
    order and the templates. A table of contents (like google 1, 2, 3,
    etc for pages of results and back and next links) with navigation is
    also generated.

    Data::ResultsHelper takes an array of results and returns a hash
    ref which can then be passed to Template::Toolkit, HTML::Template or
    the like, or to my Data::ResultsHelper::HTML.

    An earlier, messier version is used at my work to help display log
    files, result sets from sql queries, our webmail system, our
    shopping cart system, and countless other places. These utilities
    have been developed by me and several other engineers.

    A later version will allow results to be filtered, i.e., each
    column can be included or excluded depending on <, >, =, or a regex.
    I just haven't yet ported this code.

    An example, which uses Template::Toolkit, can be seen here

    http://spack.net/cgi-bin/tt?page=r2h.htm

    I earlier applied for Data::Results2HTML, but this is a better,
    cleaner architecture.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::ResultsHelper   MdpOp helps sort, paginate and display results set EARL
