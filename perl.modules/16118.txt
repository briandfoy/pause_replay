i've changed his configured email to yours.

you should have control over the account now.

i've sent you the acccount password (through "Forgot Password?" on
PAUSE).  once you get it you have control of the account and can
transfer modules, upload files, and whatever you decide you would
like to do.

please let us know if you have any problems.
