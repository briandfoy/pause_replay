The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::OnlinePayment::Cybersource
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Cybersource implimentation for B::OP
  userid:      PBOWEN (Peter A. Bowen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I needed to have the ability to use Cybersource from
    Business::OnlinePayment(BOP). I implimented it under the BOP
    framework, and this looks like the best place to put it. As far as I
    can tell there is not another BOP::Cybersource package on CPAN.

  enteredby:   PBOWEN (Peter A. Bowen)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 20 20:58:49 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::OnlinePayment::
::Cybersource     bdpOp Cybersource implimentation for B::OP         PBOWEN
