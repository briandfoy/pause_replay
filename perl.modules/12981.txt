Anything is too much to ask until someone actually bothers to give me
the necessary access so that I can upload a non-archaic version of
this module (something I've been trying to do for some years now, and
have never received any kind of response to my mail).

(the current version of News::Article is 1.26, not 1.13)

PAUSE denies the existence of my userid, and as far as I know I did
not obtain a password at the time I originally submitted the
module. Mail on this subject to modules@perl.org (the documented
address for registration issues) has gone completely unanswered.
