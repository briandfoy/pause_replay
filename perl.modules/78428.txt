This is just an idle thought, so I'm not really proposing anything
concrete.

I tend to do a lot of maintenance where I get other people involved,
but I don't really want to give them upload rights for various reasons.
Or, more specifically, I would want to limit them to uploading only dev
releases. I'd also like them to be able to affect the RT queue.
Ultimately, I want to reserve a stable distribution release to primary
and co-maintainers as we have it now.

It's just an idea, and it's not a pressing problem that I'm trying to
solve. I was thinking of it more like github's fork and pull request
stuff where there's much less risk in participation with people I don't
know.
