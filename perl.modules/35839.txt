     why:

    HTML::DBForms

    A module that generates HTML forms for searching and updating
    database tables. The exisiting modules available on the CPAN are
    either tied to a specific OO mapper (e.g. Class::DBI) or require
    configuration data to be stored in the database itself.

    Desiring an easy to use solution that works with the standard DBI
    and does not rely on specific database configurations, I have
    created one that has been useful in a few projects already. Very
    simple interface, but still flexable enough for many situations, and
    well documented. It has saved me many hours of tedium so far, so I
    would like to make it available for others.

    Thanks, -Ken
