Unfortunately, not.  That address came under sustained attack during
the mid 2000s (up to 10,000 messages/hour) and remains unusable now,
though the volume is much lower -- Google is kindly handling the
attack for me now, somehow.  I never found out what caused the attack,
other than that it seemed to originate in infected MS Outlook
installations.

My current address in that domain is david.megginson@megginson.com.  I
can establish that I own the megginson.com domain by placing a small
file of your choosing in the root directory of the web site.  Would
that be enough proof for you to change the email address record to
cpan@megginson.com (I'd prefer that to david.megginson@megginson.com
if the address is going to be published)?


Thanks in advance for your help,


David
