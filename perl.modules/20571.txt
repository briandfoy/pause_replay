To avoid further confusion, here's what I meant ;-)

If you have a look at e.g. lib/Convert/Binary/C.pm, you'll find the
following info in the header:

  # $Project: /Convert-Binary-C $
  # $Author: mhx $
  # $Date: 2003/04/20 13:47:05 +0200 $
  # $Revision: 43 $

This is what I mean by "real" revision. It's the revision of that file
in my revision control system.

  # $Snapshot: /Convert-Binary-C/0.40 $

The snapshot name is just the equivalent to the distro version.

What I've done between C::B::C-0.12 and C::B::C-0.13 is that
I've turned

  $VERSION = sprintf '%.2f', 0.01*('$Revision: 38 $' =~ /(\d+)/)[0];

into

  $VERSION = do { my @r = '$Snapshot: /Convert-Binary-C/0.40 $' =~
/(\d+\.\d+(?:_\d+)?)/; @r ? $r[0] : '9.99' };

because of the problems with CPANPLUS and Human Logic.

It seems that everything went fine this time.

I've deleted about 10 of the older distros on CPAN. I noticed there's a
delay of several days until the files are actually deleted (which is good).
Does this mean there's also a delay in the update of the module list?
If so, I guess uploading 0.40 was a better choice, since that change is
propagated a lot faster?
