The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::Coords
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO interface to astronomical coordinates
  userid:      TJENNESS (Tim Jenness)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    UK astronomy programmers and I am happy to set up a mailing list if
    there is demand

  similar:
    Astro::Coord Astro::SLA

  rationale:

    This module provides an OO wrapper around Astro::SLA (of which I am
    the author) and, in the future, Astro::Coord. Both the
    aforementioned modules have coordinate transformation functions but
    none take a unified transparent approach to coordinate
    transformation. The Astro::Coords class handles moving sources as
    well as equatorial coordinate frames transparently, transforming to
    other frames (eg Galactic or AzEl) on demand. (Something that
    Astro::Coord can not support).

    This module was developed for our internal telescope scheduling
    software. Time::Piece is used for handling date and time
    manipulation when calculating target elevation.

    A previous registration attempt was attempted in November but was
    ignored without comment.

The resulting entry would be:

Astro::
