The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Holidays::USFederal
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Determine US Federal Public Holidays
  userid:      MORRISNIH (Doug Morris)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Date::Holidays::UK

  rationale:

    The module is intended to decide if a day/date is a United States
    of America Federal Holiday. The module contains all US Federal
    holidays between 1997 and 2010 as mandated by the Office of
    Personnel Managment. The module is useful in projecting schedules,
    calendars, and other date specific applications using Perl.

  enteredby:   MORRISNIH (Doug Morris)
  enteredon:   Wed Sep 27 19:04:26 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Holidays::
::USFederal       Rdpfp Determine US Federal Public Holidays         MORRISNIH
