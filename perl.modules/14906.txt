DR CHRISTIAN OKEY
Director, Project Implementation,
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,
Falomo Office Complex,
Ikoyi - Lagos.



ATTN,
      The Managing Director
BUSINESS PROPOSAL 

It is my great pleasure in writing you this letter on
behalf of myself and my colleagues.


Your particulars were given to me by a member of the
Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) who was at
the Federal Government Delegation to your country
during a trade exhibition. I have decided to seek a
confidential cooperation with you in the execution of
the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it as top secret
because of the nature of this business.


Within the Ministry of Petroleum Resources where I
work as a Director, Project Implementation and with
the cooperation of four other top officials, we have
in our possession as overdue payment bills totalling
Fourteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars
(US$14,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad
with assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to
receive such funds. Moreso, we are handicapped in the
circumstances as the Nigerian Civil Service Code of
Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account
hence your importance in the whole transaction.


The amount represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to foreign bank account
you will provide by filing in an application through
the Federal Ministry of Justice for the transfer of
rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.


Since the new civilian government of my country is
determined to pay every foreign contractor all debts
owed so as to maintain good relationship with foreign
government and non-government financial agencies,
therefore we have decided to include our bills for
approvals with the cooperation of some officials from
the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank
of Nigeria (CBN). We are seeking your assistance in
providing a vital account or any virgin bank account
into which we can remit this money by acting as our
main partner and trustee. This we can do by swapping
of account and changing of beneficiary and other forms
of documentation upon application for claim to reflect
the payment and approvals to be secured on behalf of
you. This processes being pre-arranged with the
principal trustee of the original contractor and with
the consent of the original contractor.


I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the
transaction your share of the sum will be 30% of the
US$14.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses.


The business itself is 100% safe, on your part
provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is
not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and
hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavour to
e-mail me to know your position and include your
confidential telephone and fax numbers.

Thanks for your cooperation.


Yours faithfully,

DR CHRISTIAN OKEY
