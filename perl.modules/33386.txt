Subject: Thank you!

Thank you for your suggestion to the Cybercandy Taste Panel.

We're sorry, that we aren't able to reply directly to every suggestion. We receive so many each week that if we answered them all we'd never get any work done.

However we do read all the emails sent and all suggested new products are annotated to a comprehensive list for our future gastronomic research.  It's a tough job, but someone has to do it.

Thanks again.

The Cybercandy Taste Panel

p.s If you've sent an enquiry to our suggestions box by mistake please try sending your email again to enquiries@cybercandy.co.uk
