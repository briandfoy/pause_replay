Hello,

posting a letter in  news:comp.lang.perl.moderated
I was suggested to have a look at "The Perl 5 Module List".

But having never worked with PERL it is difficult for my to find out
what I am looking for: So I will tell you what's my problem:

I have got a language "Kurmancî" which has to be sorted like "Turkish"
but is distinguishing several accented vowels, too.  For example I need
a sorting algorithm which should sort these example words 
ez, êvar, pir, pîr, e, en, ê, ên, il ,îl, i, î, u, um, ûm, û ...

like 
e, en, ez, 
ê, ên, êvar, 
i, il, 
î, îl, 
pir, 
pîr, 
u, um, 
û, ûm ...

in any way, i.e. within Kurdish words, too.

This algorithm should NEVER sort them like 
e, ê, en, ên, êvar, ez, 
i, î, il, îl, 
pir, pîr, 
u, û, um, ûm ...

The Kurdish alphabet is ( to see it clearly it has to be selected
character set "Turkish"!)
a, b, c, ç, d, e, ê, f, g, h, i, î, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, þ[=
Ascii 0349], t, u, û, v, w, x, y, z 

My question is: May a find 
an algorithm 
a) sorting "Turkish" language
b) including this aspected vowel sorting
written in Perl?

If not may I find an existing similar one and do the necessary
changes myself? That will say: If a would have found a sorting algorithm
for Turkish sorting, I would like to do the few changes - I hope -
necessary for the above mentioned vowel problem.

With kind regards

Ernst Tremel
