Subject: Namespace registration: MSSQL::DBlib and MSSQL::Sqllib
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: sommar@algonet.se ((Erland Sommarskog))

I attempted to register these modules last August, but I haven't
heard anything, and I don't find them in the modules list, so I
make another attempt:

    MSSQL::DBlib    Md+O  Access MS SQL Server through DB-Library. SOMMAR
    MSSQL::Sqllib   MdpO  High-level interface using MSSQL::DBlib. SOMMAR

The modules were first released in the beginning of 1998, the first of
them being a port to MS SQL Server of Sybase::DBlib, the second is an
original work. MSSQL::DBlib includes a bunch of submodules for constant
(in lieu of the regular Autoload stuff and the generated constant() in
the XS modules; I never managed to get that working satisfactory with
ActiveStates 3xx builds.) Since then 1.005 was released Jan 99 and
1.006 in May 00. (1.006 has just been uploaded to CPAN.)

The letter M as in mature may seem preposterous, but since DB-Library
which is the base for these modules, is not further developped by
Microsoft, they constitute something of a dead end. Nevertheless, I
get mail from people from time to time indicating that the modules
are actually being used.

These modules only run Windows NT/95/98, as the underlying client library 
from Microsoft is not available on Unix.
