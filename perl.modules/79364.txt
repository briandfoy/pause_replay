Bron, the way I read the message below, Richard asked you to fork the 
module, not take it over. Now, my money would be on that this is just a 
slight misunderstanding and I'm being pedantic, but let me ask very 
specifically:

Richard, would you be fine if I gave Bron co-maintenance permissions (or 
even primary maintainer status) for the module so that he can make new 
CPAN releases under the same name?

Best regards,
Steffen
