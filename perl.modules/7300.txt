Greetings!     READ THE WHOLE LETTER AND YOU WILL AGREE!!!!!!

It doesn't matter how old you are, it doesn't matter if you are new to computers, you can create a business that is easy and fun to manage and make a LOT of money sending e-mail! I'm financing my college education (hardly a cheap proposition these days) with this money making program. Donald Trump, when asked what he would do if he had to start all over again with no money, said he would find a program like this one and use it! Seem impossible? Read on for details (no, there is no "catch")...

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.
 It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail. If you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've been waiting for, THIS IS IT! Simply follow the instructions, and your dreams will come true.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM), or network marketing, has finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods as more people get on the Internet.

This is a multi-billion dollar industry. Of the 3,500,000 millionaires in the world, 20% (700,000) of those millionaires made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show that over 100 people become millionaires every single day through multi-level marketing.

You may have heard this story before, but  Donald Trump (A
MULTI-BILLIONAIRE, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD) made an appearance on he David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. The audience started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and deadpanned his response. "That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!" Now, Donald Trump may not be your kind of person, but the man knows about money. If that's what Donald Trump would do to build up wealth again, don't you think it's a good idea for you to start out that way too?

With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct Commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business. Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing,  it also means getting paid for the work of others. That's what this email is all about.



                INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PROGRAM


    As with all multi-level network businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Because of the global nature of the Internet, you will be able to recruit new multi-level business partners from all over the world, and there are millions more people getting onto the Internet every few months! We offer a useful, informative product for EVERY dollar sent. Your orders for the information products and your cash payments come by mail, and you send the product to your customers by email, so you are not involved in personal selling, or inventory. You do it privately in your own home, store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere. This is what you must do:

    Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them). They will come to your email address. They contain information and advice about starting your own business. For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem in sending you the email) to the person whose name appears on the list with the report. Carefully wrap the cash payment in a few sheets of paper, to insure it is not stolen because someone could see the money through the envelope! When you place your orders, make sure you order each of the five reports, and double check all the addresses. You will need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer to resell them.

    Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to sell to the thousands of people who will order them from you.

    IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed below or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it.

    After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement and REM0VE the name and address under REPORT #5 on the list. This person has made good use of the information they bought and is counting their money!

Then, move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to where the
address for REPORT #5 used to be.

Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.

Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.

Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure
you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!

    Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, andsave it to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 Reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to place thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******

* THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately.

* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in because:

When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
product/report.

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your
results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't,  continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!

      THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:

Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you can generate from this business.

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her "hobby." I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM."

Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL


"The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in."

Sincerely yours,
Pam Hedland Halmstad, Sweden

"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I surprised when I  found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders! For a while, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return."

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program, 11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one! I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!"

Mohamed, Cairo, Egypt
