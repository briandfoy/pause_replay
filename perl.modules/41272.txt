The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sony::PSP
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Interfaces to PSP 'homebrew' development.
  userid:      MCGREGOR (Andrew McGregor)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    www.pspdev.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    Hi,

    3rd party development of Sony's new Playstation Portable (PSP) has
    begun. I am proposing to convert some existing C scripts to Perl.
    The scripts I currently intend to convert are for packing/unpacking
    Sony released files for flashing the PSP firmware. License tbc with
    original author.

    http://www.oopo.net/consoledev/files/pack-pbp-1.1.0.c

    I understand this is a grey area for free software, but notably I
    am not aware of MS taking any action against any member of the
    xbox-linux project.

    It's not that I am really keen, or even deserving, for a rootlevel
    namespace, but I'm not sure where else these modules would fit?
    Unless there is something existing that is similar to Console::PSP?
    ACME::Sony::PSP?

    Regards,

    Andrew
