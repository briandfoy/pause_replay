Ah.  Don't worry, I'm pretty thick-skinned, I just enjoy a good
flamewar :)

Sure.  Like I said, really either one is fine with me.  I'm not sure
if a single module in the Speech::Recognizer namespace is enough to
establish a precedent or not, though I think the analogy with
Speech::Synthesiser is valid (modulo the issue of 's' vs 'z' :)

You're right, it wasn't given a lot of thought.  An informal poll of
the people in the same room with me at the moment prefers
"Recognizer", I could go either way, though it is kind of inconvenient
to change the name of a module so I'd rather not if I don't have to.
