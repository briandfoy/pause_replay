I've just uploaded Crypt::PassGen to my PAUSE directory.

This module is similar to Crypt::RandPasswd but uses a different algorithm
based on the probability of 3 letters appearing together in a word. It
constructs a frequency table from a dictionary (and is therefore not
limited to English).

It is based on the PASSGEN program (that was part of the SPAN Security
Toolkit) hence the name. I can change the name if there are objections.
