Subject: Module submission Devel::MemoryTrace::Light

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::MemoryTrace::Light
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: A simple lightweight memory-growth tracer
  userid:      WOLFSAGE (Matthew Horsfall)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I intend to write a Devel::MemoryTrace module that's far more
    indepth than what Devel::MemoryTrace::Light provides, but I believe
    the name provides an accurate description.

    This module allows you to easily find out when and where your
    program is growing in memory with as little work as possible.
    (Currently only GTop and BSD::Process support exist, but as I
    evaluate other means of memory measuring I may extend that list to
    allow for greater portability)

    This is something I've found useful many times in my own work.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::MemoryTrace::
::Light           cdpfp A simple lightweight memory-growth tracer    WOLFSAGE
