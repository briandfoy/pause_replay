The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Asterisk::AMI
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A simple and powerful interface to the AMI.
  userid:      GREENBEAN (Ryan Bullock)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    http://github.com/rrb3942/perl-Asterisk-AMI.git, http://voipnerd.net

  similar:
    Asterisk::Manager, Asterisk::CoroManager

  rationale:

    This module takes care of a lot of the quirks and busy work
    associated with interfacing with the asterisk manager.

    It also provides easy access to many functions and commands in the
    AMI as well as a powerful event and callback interface for
    integration into event-driven, non-blocking applications (thanks to
    the use of AnyEvent).

    Unlike other modules for interfacing with the AMI, this one
    provides a more OO interface and also takes care of timeouts,
    matching actionids, buffering, callbacks for actions, as well as
    event dispatching. You can easily inter-mix events and multiple
    actions on a single connection.

    Rather than use Asterisk::Manager as a base, which only really
    contained one useful method (for reading packets), I created an
    entirely new one. This one is far better at parsing packets than
    what was is provided in Asterisk::Manager.

The resulting entry would be:

Asterisk::
::AMI             RdpOp A simple and powerful interface to the AMI.  GREENBEAN
