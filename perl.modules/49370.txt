    Oops. Just realized I replied to the first mail and thus didn't cc the
Module list.

>> The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

    Sure, no problem at all. There are some precedents of toy languages in
Language::* (Language::Befunge and Language::Ook spring to mind), but
I agree with the wisdom of using Acme::* instead.

   (this being said, do I have to change the module name on the module
submission form, or is this email sufficient enough for the Keepers of
the  Namespaces to do their magic?)

Cheers,
