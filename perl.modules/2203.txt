Subject: Can't load module Term::ReadKey

Hi there,

    Last time I downloaded/compiled/installed Net::Telnet
and it works fine.

    Recently on the same HPUX10.20 system I did the same
thing with Term::ReadKey.  All steps including "make test"
were finished all right.

    When I added "use Term::ReadKey;" on line 5  of my
test Perl script and ran it the following message printed
on the screeen:

Can't load module Term::ReadKey, dynamic loading not available in this
perl.
  (You may need to build a new perl executable which either supports
  dynamic loading or has the Term::ReadKey module statically linked into
it.)
 at ./test.pl line 6
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./test.pl line 5.

    Why one module works while the other doesn't?
"use Net::Telnet;" is on line 3 but no complaint about it. I
checked that Term/ReadKey.pm and Net/Telnet.pm are both
under the same site_perl directory.

    Please help.  Many thanks!
