I can see that.  I do think this module has something to contribute to
CPAN (else I wouldn't be trying to register it).  I also worry about
it getting buried in the sea of templating modules out there, (most of
which, imho, don't add a lot that the others don't already provide).

Well, in the interest of brainstorming, let me try to enumerate what
this module's key features are, as I see them:

   1. Simplicity; only one pure-perl module file.

   2. Safety: no variable interpolation or executable content.

   3. Ease of learning (I hope! ;-)  and use.

   4. Separation of content from value-population (yeah, every template
      module does that).

   5. One-stop shopping (template + fill-in values) in the *printf
      functions.

   6. Printf-like formatting in the template placeholders, whether the
      *printf functions are used or not.

I think that's about it.

I think that the module belongs in the Text:: hierarchy, and I think
that it would be good to have "Template" somewhere in its name.
Text::Template, Text::FastTemplate, and Text::SimpleTemplate are
taken.  I have thought about Text::QuickTemplate, Text::EasyTemplate,
Text::StupidTemplate, Text::SafeTemplate...

If we abandon having "Template" in the name, Text::FillIn would be
okay, but that's taken.  Text::Boilerplate doesn't really focus on
any of the module's strengths.  Text::Templette would be humorous,
but it's too cutesy, and would be pronounced the same as Text::Template,
which could be confusing.  Text::ExpandPlaceholders is prosaic, and
awful long.  Text::Overlay?  Text::Stringmaker? Text::Substitution?
String::Substitution?  String::Template?

I dunno, I'm just brainstorming here.  Suggestions welcome.

Eric
