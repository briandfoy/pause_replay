     why:

    Hi! Well, I'm planning on giving back to the community a little by
    uploading some home-made modules that I find useful, plus a couple
    of Acme::* ones. I also intend to develop an UMAC-64 (RFC4418)
    implementation and to provide the patch for Acme::Playmate to work
    again (a PAUSE id is also needed for the RT to work, apparently).
    Thanks!
