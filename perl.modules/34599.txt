Hi this is automated e-mail from johnv@edmunds.com.  I receive so much spam
that I'm forced to filter my mail.  You're receiving this reply because my
filters don't recognize your e-mail address.  You do not need to resend
your e-mail(s).

IF AND ONLY IF you have sent me email, please send me a blank message with
the subject 'not spam' (omit the quotes) and I'll unlock your address and
deliver the message(s) you've sent.

If you didn't send me email, either your computer has a virus which is
causing it to emit email or, more likely, your e-mail address is just
being used by a spammer.  In either case please IGNORE this e-mail and
have a nice day!

SPAMMERS TAKE NOTE: By unlocking your address as described above, you are
entering a legally binding agreement to pay $5000 per piece of spam received.

Thanks!
