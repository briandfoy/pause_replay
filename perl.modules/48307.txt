     why:

    I wrote a Perl/Tk - Widget ClassGraph.pm which displays graphical
    representations of inheritance-trees for Perl-classes. There are two
    additional modules to display all function/method-Names defined in a
    Class and its parents and to show the source code of that methods.
    ClassGraph is based on module RelationGraph.pm which allows to
    generate graphical representations of arbitrary directed Graphs. It
    has a nice drag and drop feature built into the TextBox -
    representation of the nodes... RelationGraph works for ClassGraph
    but it's far from beeing complete. Namely, there is no mechanism yet
    to create the view-side for nodes/edges that are added dynamically
    to an existing graph...
