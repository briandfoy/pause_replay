     why:

    Hi, The past 20 months I have been helping packaging perl modules
    for the Fedora Extras project. Several of the tasks envolved are: *
    report problems with perl modules upstream (for example, due to test
    suite failures) * forward problems reported via the project bugzilla
    upstream * help find solutions to the problems * supply possible
    patches Right now I have several CPAN tickets opened/active (e.g.
    #17637, #6558).

    I have also helped tracking down a problem with FindBin (core perl)
    and SELinux. The patch has been applied upstream as change 24753.
    http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse?patch=24753
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=127023#c45

    I am also planning to upload to CPAN the wakeonlan perl script I
    have been maintaining
    http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/jpo/software/wakeonlan/

    I am also one of the members of braga.pm.org (the ones who
    organized YAPC::EU::2005).

    Regards, jpo
