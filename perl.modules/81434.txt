The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTime::Calendar::Fiscal5253
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generate 52/53 week fiscal calendars
  userid:      BOFTX (Jim Bacon)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    DateTime mailing list

  similar:
    DateTime::Fiscal::Retail454

  rationale:

    A Google search shows that there is some good information, and a
    LOT of mis-information or confusion about 52/53 week fiscal years.
    This module removes much of the confusion by automating the task of
    generating period information for any given fiscal year as well as
    presenting definitions of terms as used by accountants.

    The Retail 4-5-4 year is a specific instance of the generic 52/53
    week calendar. It is intended that this module will replace my
    earlier Retai454 module.

    Also, it was suggested that it was not necessary to sub-class
    DateTime to do what I wanted. This module is an implementation of
    that approach.

The resulting entry would be:

DateTime::Calendar::
::Fiscal5253      adpOp Generate 52/53 week fiscal calendars         BOFTX
