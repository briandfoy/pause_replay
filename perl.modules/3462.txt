    As somebody who's occasionally made his code available to the outside
world, it's been my experience that open sourcing code takes a significant
amount of time ongoingly.  While I certainly don't want to gratuitously
add to your workload, rest assured that this is only the tip of the
iceberg.

    I'm not sure what you were looking for from modules@perl.org, if
not the best-considered advice of some people that have been helping
manage a large and successful software repository.

    If it doesn't suit you to take the time to discuss naming, then I
would recommend that you publish your code someplace like SourceForge
that doesn't provide a coordinated namespace or a group of advisors on
name selection.
