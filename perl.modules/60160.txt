Request to register new user

fullname: Alan Haggai Alavi
  userid: HAGGAI
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://drchost.com/~haggai/
     why:

    I am involved in a project: `Fixing Bugs in the Archive::Zip Perl
    Module'. I wish to have an account on CPAN. I am very interested in
    becoming part of the Perl community and developing modules for Perl.

    Hope you will look into my request.

    Thanking you, Alan Haggai Alavi.
