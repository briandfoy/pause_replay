Hello -

I'd like to request a CPAN ID, information as follows:

Name: Jonathan W. Eveland
E-mail: jweveland@yahoo.com
Preferred CPAN ID: JWEVELAND

Areas of current interest/development include modules
supporting various aspects of HL7 and X12 data
formats.

Also, I am soliciting input as to where in the module
hierarchy would be a good place to put such modules. 
They are ANSI standard formats, so should they list
under ANSI::HL7:: and ANSI::X12::, or would there be
someplace more appropriate?

Thanks!!
Jon Eveland
