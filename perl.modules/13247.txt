The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::FixedFormat
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Conversion between fixed format and hash
  userid:      PFAUT (Thomas Pfau)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Buffer

  rationale:

    This module belongs under Data:: because it deals with data format
    conversions. It is named FixedFormat because it deals with
    conversion to and from a fixed record layout. This module was
    written to provide access to data stored in flat files with fixed
    field lengths.

    Data::Buffer appears to provide similar functionality but it only
    provides only allows pulling one field at a time out of a buffer.
    Data::FixedFormat instead allows the user to describe the record
    layout once and provide names for the fields. Upon conversion from
    fixed layout to a hash, the user can then access the data by name.

    Data::BinStruct may provide similar functionality but it does not
    appear to be available.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::FixedFormat     bdpOg Conversion between fixed format and hash     PFAUT
