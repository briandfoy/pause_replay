Hi, 

I've been trying to get into contact with the maintainer of this module
for a long, long time but without success. 

I have a small patch for it (specifically, to make it buildable by mingw)
that would probably make sense to get put into a new version, say a 0.21 or
so... 

I'm unclear on how to go about it since the maintainer is
non-responsive...please advise? 

TIA, 

ken1
