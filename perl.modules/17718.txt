The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SWIFT::Factory::MT300
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Produce an MT300 SWIFT message
  userid:      SCHAFFTER (Gustav Schaffter)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I was surpriced to realize that there are no S.W.I.F.T. modules to
    be found on CPAN. I have written some modules that are application
    specific and doesn't belong here, but then I thought that so must a
    lot of other people have done the same thing. That's when the idea
    of a collectively maintained repository of S.W.I.F.T. related
    modules was born.

    About the module name: This module will implement one specific
    message type, the MT300. S.W.I.F.T. message types are all named as
    MTnnn in all upper-case. The middle level "Factory" in the name is
    important, since building messages and parsing messages are more
    different than similar. A next step will then be to register the
    SWIFT::Parse::MTnnn modules. But one step at a time... Finally,
    S.W.I.F.T. is correctly written with all those dots, but I deem that
    to be unpractical on CPAN and I want to ignore the dots when naming
    the module tree.

    Thereby I propose SWIFT::Factory::MT300.pm as a module name.

    About the category: I propose category "24, Interface Module to
    Commercial Software", but I'm open to suggestions. An alternative
    could be "5, Networking".

    Best regards SCHAFFTER

The resulting entry would be:

SWIFT::Factory::
::MT300           cdpOp Produce an MT300 SWIFT message               SCHAFFTER
