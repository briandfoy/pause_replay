Thanks.  Done.  And I think I know why I got confused into having an
impression that CPAN supports it: the perl distributions DO come
bzip2'ed.

Thanks for all the work you put in the support of these tools.  Also:
please do not forget than I'm sitting (for a couple of years now) on a
major patch to CPAN.pm.  In my experience, CPAN.pm is useless without
this patch if one has a _large_ pool of modules to install.  With this
patch, I know about one issue only (with the pool of about 160
distributions which I need to work with).

It is hard to be sure whether the remaining bug is a new one, or it
was present before, since it is impossible to analyse the logs of runs
of old CPAN.pm - too many bugs, unclear messages etc.

Cheers,
Ilya

P.S.  BTW, with one of the features of the patched CPAN.pm one could
      "bring CPAN into the 21st century".  Since automatic patching
      before installation is now supported, one could allow
      "distributed patching".

      E.g., CPAN authors could upload patches to CPAN, and some tool
      (PAUSE indexer together with CPAN.pm?) could scan for available
      patches on CPAN, and let the installer decide which ones to
      install.
