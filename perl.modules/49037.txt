Greetings:

With all due respect to the many fine folks that are
developing in php on the drupal / deanspace / civicspace /
civiCRM / civiMail line of development, but there are also
those of us who are developing tools for community
and electoral organizing in perl.  And I assert that we
need our own home where we can work together.  

I formerly served as staff to the Georgia (usa) Green
Party, helped organize a Code Weavers Network for US Green
Party activists who contribute their IT skills to the
Party's efforts, have consulted in two countries on IT
development to support electoral organizing and am now a
part of a commercial venture, CampaignFoundations.com,
offering online tools to support winning campaigns on the
issues and at the polls.  

I write to ask that the cpan leadership bless the creation
of a new top level namespace within the archives.  The
astricks (*) indicate those modules which I and
others I've worked with already have done development work
for. 

Here below is what I imagine, including some wrappers to
make this code base work with existing systems that can
serve the needs of community organizers and electoral
activists, like SQLegder, for instance.  

Obviously there is room in this heirarchy for writing a lot
of new code.  And usuable scripts and modules have already
been developed to address many of the function hinted at
below. With a CPAN namespace like Organize::, this code
could have a home where its public accessibility could
serve a broader audience.  And having such a home, could
motivate the refactoring of some of this older code to make
it suitable for public consumption.  

Your advice and consideration is appreciated.
