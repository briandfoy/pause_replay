Hi, 

I would like to ask for the creation of the top level namespace
GPS where it will be included the protocols, the serial and network
connection handlers and gps related functions and algorithms.

Currently there is work in the Garmin,NMEA and Magellan protocols,
the GPS device can be connected locally or remotely, if gpsd is
running on the host where the gps device is attached.


I've uploaded the currently pre-alpha 
perl-GPS-0.12, using the following packages:

GPS::Garmin
GPS::Serial
GPS::Garmin::Constant
GPS::Garmin::Handler


GPS::NMEA and GPS::Magellan are work in progress.


Currently perl-GPS is tested in Linux and Win32,
uses Device::SerialPort or Win32::SerialPort,
in Unix if Device::SerialPort isn't available,it'll
use FileHandle for the Serial connection.

Thanks in advance,
Joao Pedro
