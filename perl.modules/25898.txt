The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Server::POP3
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: The server side of the POP3 mail protocol.
  userid:      JONADAB (Nathan Eady)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Mail::POP3Client

  rationale:

    I could just about as well name it Mail::POP3Server, but I chose
    Net::Server::POP3 because the module is a subclass of Net::Server
    and because the SMTP equivalent (Net::Server::Mail) is in that
    namespace.

    I hunted all over CPAN for a POP3 server module and asked on
    Perlmonks if anyone knew of one, but I turned up none. I was
    reluctant to implement it myself, but clearly there ought to be a
    module for this, so since it appears that nobody else has done one,
    I decided it was worth doing myself if that was the only way to get
    it.

    I believe the module should be listed, so that anyone else who
    wants to work on or use a POP3 server module will be able to find
    it.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Server::
::POP3            adpOb The server side of the POP3 mail protocol.   JONADAB
