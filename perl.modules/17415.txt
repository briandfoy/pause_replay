WWW::Form is not particularly similar to HTML::Form. 
HTML::Form parses HTML to build Perl representations
of HTML form data.  WWW::Form does not parse raw HTML,
but rather, it takes a data structure that is used to
generate HTML form inputs.  Stylistically, WWW::Form
is more similar to HTML::FormTemplate than HTML::Form.

Right.  I guess the motivation for calling the module
WWW::Form is because dealing with HTTP POST data and
HTML forms is a common piece of most web apps.  So I
see it as fitting into a larger library that
encompasses web application development in general. 
If you think a different namespace is preferable,
please let me know.

WWW::Form (and WWW::FieldValidator, the validation
component of WWW::Form) differs from other form
modules that are used to validate input and generate
HTML form inputs in that it uses a very small API for
form handling.  A developer can handle most scenarios
involving HTML forms and processing HTTP POST data
with only 5 methods.  WWW::Form makes it easy to
handle both simple and complex HTML forms and
validation requirements.  WWW::Form is also designed
to be easily subclassed and extended.

In the spirit of TIMTWOTDI, I think WWW::Form and
WWW::FieldValidator provide developers with another
relevant choice for validating form data and
displaying HTML form content, i.e. error feedback,
form field labels, and HTML form inputs.
