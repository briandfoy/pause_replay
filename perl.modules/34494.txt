Subject: Module submission Net::Mac::Vendor
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Mac::Vendor
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Look up the vendor for a MAC address
  userid:      BDFOY (brian d foy)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::MacMap

  rationale:

    Clinton Wong created Net::MacMap to turn a MAC address into a
    vendor name taken from a static list. I wrote Net::MAC::Vendor to do
    pretty muchthe same thing, but supply all the information that the
    IEEE gives about the vendor (which is just the address, really).

    Net::MAC::Vendor will search for the info on the IEEE web site, and
    optionally cache things it has already seen. It can also parse the
    text listing of all MAC prefix assignments.

    I already coordinated this new release with Clinton, but rather
    than add to the previous name, I think Net::MAC::Vendor is more
    descriptive.

  enteredby:   BDFOY (brian d foy)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep  2 18:27:11 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Mac::
::Vendor          adphp Look up the vendor for a MAC address         BDFOY
