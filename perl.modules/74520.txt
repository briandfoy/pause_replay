I thought about that, but the stuff already in Devices:: seems more
like peripheral devices that you control from other devices, where
Robotics, at least in this case, seem more like self-contained thingys.

I ultimately decided that since Robotics is not vague or likely to
cause confusion, that it was a fine namespace.
