Subject: new MIME module - what name?

Hi,

I am in the process of creation the new MIME module based 
on the gmime sources. Since existing MIME-tools module is several times
slower than my xs version, I decided to release the GMIME module.
The first version would be beta version, not for use
on production servers. It would be nothing special, less
powerfull than MIME-tools, but fast and memory efficient.
Additionaly it should be RFC compilant and broken MTAs friendly,
as gmime C sources are.

For now I named it GMIME, and the possible packages/classes are:
GMIME::Message
GMIME::Part
GMIME::Header::Hash
GMIME::Content-Type
GMIME::InternetAddress
etc.

In the CPAN hierarchy there is already MIME subdirectory.
My question is: how I should call the new module?
Could it be in MIME subdir, and have name GMIME,
or I should use something like
MIME::GMIME::Message
MIME::something::Part
etc.

Best regards,
