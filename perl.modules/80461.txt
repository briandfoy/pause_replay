The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::YAARG
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Simple constructor argument processor
  userid:      ALUCAS (Anthony J Lucas)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    #perl on freenode

  similar:
    AutoArgs

  rationale:

    Y = Yet A = Another ARG = Argument (Processor)

    This module provides an easy framework to process and transform
    general key-based arguments and values. Users simply specify by key
    how to parse values and where to store them, and the rest is taken
    care of. This module is designed to play extremely well with
    plain-perl object-oriented classes and hierarchies, which are
    handled transparently and in an efficient manner.

    This effectively allows autobox / type-casting based on argument
    keys. Any constructor or method which takes nested structures, such
    as the structure [{ URI => 'http://dummy' }, ..], can simply tell
    this module that URI should be transformed to instances of
    'My::URI::Class'. You can also map keys to custom transform handlers
    to perform complex actions.

    This is under the Config namespace because it works extremely well
    with deserialised formats, such as if you wished to feed your
    object's constructor XML or JSON directly, and have this module
    extract useful values and cast / transform them to perl data types
    or objects as required.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
