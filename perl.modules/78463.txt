Sounds good to me ... I hereby accept this covenant for the modules I
maintain, present and future, until such time as I indicate otherwise in
email to modules@perl.org

I recently took over a module after 2 months, during which I tried a number=
<br>
of ways to track down the author, mailed various other people, and posted<b=
r>
to module-authors. That seemed appropriate, because the author had clearly<=
br>
put a lot of thought and effort into this, and his other modules.<br>
<br>
So, I went to Andreas Koenig, since he has more experience of module handov=
ers<br>
than most of us! The group behind <a href=3D"mailto:modules@perl.org">modul=
es@perl.org</a> have to balance two sides:<br>
respecting individual authors, and helping the continued development of CPA=
N.<br>
If none of the group know the current author, they have to err on<br>
the author&#39;s side, not CPAN:<br>
<br>
 =A0 =A0&quot;I&#39;ve heard too many upset developers going berserk becaus=
e they felt<br>
 =A0 =A0 [their module was expropriated]&quot;<br>
<br>
Asked whether he thought an explicit pledge would be useful, Andreas said:<=
br>
<br>
 =A0 =A0&quot;An explicit statement in a distribution like the one in your =
picture<br>
 =A0 =A0 would make our lives a lot easier&quot;<br>
<br>
As a number of others commented, Andreas feels it should be stated on<br>
a per-distribution basis, and not per-author.<br>
<br>
In a side-discussion, it was pointed out that sometimes an author would<br>
be happy for someone else to take over the module.<br>
In this case the covenant would become:<br>
<br>
 =A0 I hereby give <a href=3D"mailto:modules@perl.org">modules@perl.org</a>=
 permission to grant lead authorship<br>
 =A0 to [% distribution %], if the following conditions are met:<br>
<br>
 =A0 (1) There are outstanding issues in the module&#39;s public bug tracke=
r<br>
 =A0 (2) The requester wants to make worthwhile changes that will benefit C=
PAN<br>
<br>
There are at least three ways this could be provided:<br>
<br>
 =A0 =A0(a) a file included in the distribution. Eg Covenant.txt<br>
 =A0 =A0(b) text in the README<br>
 =A0 =A0(c) a feature on PAUSE, where you can select the &quot;ownership st=
atus&quot;<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0or similar<br>
<br>
The problem with (c), is that it&#39;s not very public; the information nee=

to be closely associated with the distribution itself. To make things<br>
