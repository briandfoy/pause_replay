Description of modules:

I've written an implementation of an evaluation engine for hyphen 
systems as defined in the book "Godel, Escher, Bach" by Doug Hofstadter. 
I plan to implement as many of these illustrative examples as I can, as 
I progress through the book. This first module is GEB::Hyphen. Other 
modules will be placed into the GEB namespace (and could conceivably be 
contributed by persons other than myself, with any luck).

I'm also working on a CORBA ORB, written entirely in Perl, as a 
complement to Fnorb, the Python ORB, which I am also contributing to.
It is currently available on SourceForge at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/perlorb. When it is a bit more complete 
and stable, I would like to contribute it to CPAN.

Regards,
Derek.
