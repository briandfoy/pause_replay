I propose a more sensible name of From::Memory - i.e.

  use From::Memory 'Package::Name';

This is not a pragma anyway.

You repeated poor behaviour was driving off people who were actually going
to contribute something useful.

Ricardo intervened and -stopped- you being banned for several further months
in order to try and get you to become a constructive participant on p5p.

Sadly, you prefer blaming everybody else to considering that if everybody on
a list finds your behaviour obnoxious (hence his being "fully supported") then
the problem is probably yours.

Any time you decide to try and be constructive and are able to clearly
articulate your plan for doing so in a way that indicates you understand this
fact, I will be happy to advocate for your reinstatement.

Until then, please don't pollute modules@perl.org with your social skills
problems.
