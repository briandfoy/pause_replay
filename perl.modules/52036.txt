Subject: Module submission DateTime::Fiscal::Retail454

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DateTime::Fiscal::Retail454
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Manipulate 4-5-4 calendar data
  userid:      BOFTX (Jim Bacon)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    datetime@perl.org

  similar:
    None that I have found

  rationale:

    At first glance one could place this in the DateTime::Calendar
    namespace, but this module also defines events for a 4-5-4 calendar
    as well, allowing for a placement in DateTime::Event.

    However, the module is highly specialized for fiscal use and also
    does date math.

    Considering all of the above I decided it was most appropriate to
    place it in the existing DateTime::Fiscal namespace. (A new
    namespace of DateTime::Retail might not be out-of-line, either as
    more features/modules are added).

    The module itself sub-classes DateTime and an object of
    DateTime::Fiscal::Retail454 inherits all of the capabilities and
    properties of the parent class. The module tests to ensure this is
    true.

    Details of the 4-5-4 calendar can be found at the Nation Retail
    Federation website. I have spoken with that organization and have
    received permission to reference them and the website in the
    documentation.

    I intend to upload the module in a couple of days at most.
