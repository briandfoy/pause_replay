The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Courier::Filter
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A mail filter framework for the Courier MTA
  userid:      JMEHNLE (Julian Mehnle)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    Courier MTA users mailing list
    <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/courier-users>

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Courier::Filter module is a purely Perl-based mail filter
    framework for the Courier MTA <http://www.courier-mta.org>.

    Courier supports an interface for mail filters (not unlike the
    Sendmail Milter interface) to examine mail messages directly on
    arrival, i.e. during the SMTP dialog, so messages can be rejected
    outright without having to first accept them and later generate
    concrete bounce messages. Courier::Filter implements this interface
    and provides a very simple way for others to write filter modules.

    In the tradition of widely used daemons such as Apache and Sendmail
    having their own root-level namespace, I consider it appropriate to
    grant the also widely used Courier MTA its own "Courier" root-level
    namespace, for it doesn't collide with any other widely used
    software.

    Obviously, and due to the fact that Courier's documentation speaks
    of its mail filter mechanism as "courierfilter", "Courier::Filter"
    is a good namespace for this perl module and its belonging classes.

    (Administrative note: I tried registering this module namespace in
    the past, but got no response. I asked for help and advice on
    <modules@perl.org> twice, but got no response. Maybe my requests got
    lost?)

The resulting entry would be:

Courier::
