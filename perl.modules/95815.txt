Hi Ken

At first, I was surprised by this proposal, since I often use App::Ack 
(https://metacpan.org/release/ack), but the examples in the docs make a 
good case for having this module too available to us.

Some Suggestions:

o Move the pod tests into xt/author, and make any modules used to test 
pod optional, so end users can install the module even if there are 
failing pod tests. Ah, I see running the tests that it requires 
AUTHOR_TESTING. Excellent, but could be a little bit better.

o Change search.cpan.org to metacpan.org.

Other than that, got for it!
