Announce in some public places with high traffic that you plan to take
over the modules. Some places that would work are use.perl.org,
Perlmonks, and any Perl/Qt mailing lists.

After a couple of weeks of no response from the author (or immediate
positive response) we can transfer the module.

Good luck :)
