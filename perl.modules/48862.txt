Subject: Module submission Time::UTC::Now

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::UTC::Now
  DSLIP:       Rdhfp
  description: determine current time in UTC correctly
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is the rigorous approach to finding the current UTC
    time. It handles leap seconds correctly where the OS makes this
    possible (e.g., Linux synchronised by NTP). This functionality
    doesn't seem to exist in any other module.

    The name relates to the existing Time::UTC module, also published
    by me. In addition to the obvious thematic relation, this module is
    designed to interoperate with Time::UTC, by using the same data
    format for UTC times.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Tue May 16 21:59:46 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::UTC::
::Now             Rdhfp determine current time in UTC correctly      ZEFRAM
