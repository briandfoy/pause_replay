Subject: Module submission XML::RSS::Tools

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::RSS::Tools
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: High level tool to obtain & xslt rss/rdf
  userid:      ATRICKETT (Adam John Trickett)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, perl-xml list

  similar:
    XML::RSS

  rationale:

    The tool, is a very-heigh leve tool that simplifies the
    downloading, manipulation and final display of RSS/RDF feeds. The
    module does nothing that cannot be achieved by using wget/curl/LWP,
    XML::RSS and XML::LibXSLT alone, but it provides a very simple
    interface for doing this.

    I don't know if Tools is the best name for the module, but it
    belongs in the XML::RSS space I think. I'd be happy to use another
    name if a better one could be though of.

    I have tried to contact the maintainers of XML::RSS to see if they
    mind, but so far have had no response.

    See http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=164033 to see my
    overview, the module, and comments so far recieved.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::RSS::
::Tools           adpOg High level tool to obtain & xslt rss/rdf     ATRICKETT
