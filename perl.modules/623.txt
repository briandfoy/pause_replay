a description of what you're planning to contribute
Convert::TNEF - A module to parse TNEF email attachments and extract the
actual files
attached.

for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry, which is:
Development stage, Support level, Language used, Interface style (see the
modulelist), and a 44 character description).

It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have
discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was
at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for submissions, but we
owe our users at least some rudimentary quality control. If your work has
never been discussed publicly, then it's extremely difficult for us to make
our judgement whether to accept the submission or not.

I did post something on comp.lang.perl.misc about what to name the module
(I decided on 'Convert::TNEF' as suggested by Graham Barr), but did not see
any
replies to the post there.
