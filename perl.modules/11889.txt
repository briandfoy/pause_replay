The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SDL
  DSLIP:       Rmchl
  description: Simple DirectMedia Layer Perl Interface
  userid:      DGOEHRIG (David J. Goehrig)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    sdlperl@sdlperl.org, http://www.sdlperl.org

  similar:
    SDL is the root of the SDL_perl-1.18.1, SDL-sdlpl-1.08 packages

  rationale:

    SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer, is a cross platform library for
    developing multimedia applications and games. SDL is the obvious
    root for the namespace, as it is the traditional abbrev. for the
    interfaced library.

    This module is the defacto SDL perl interface, as in the two years
    of existence not single effective alternative has arisen. Both I and
    Wayne Keenan have alternated maintainership roles, and there is a
    healthy development community contributing to it. It has also been
    used by games such as Guillaume Cotenceau's Frozen Bubble
    http://www.frozen-bubble.org and already has reached a large
    audience already.

    I am requesting to have SDL added to the module list on behalf of
    the dozen or so people who have mailed me recently asking why it
    isn't in CPAN. SDL is a natural candidate for a low level namespace
    as it encompases a number of additional modules which manage related
    libraries for handling images, sound effects, audio playback, mpeg
    movie playback, OpenGL, True Type Fonts, networking, graphics
    manipulation, and others.

    I'd be happy to answer any other questions,

    David J. Goehrig <dave@sdlperl.org>
