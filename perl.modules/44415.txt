I'd prefer Text::Textile... the module has been around for a couple  
of years outside of CPAN as "Text::Textile" (notably in Movable Type  
installations and blogging client software packages use it too...  
ecto for example).

Also, while it currently specializes in HTML, I eventually plan to  
support other formats.
