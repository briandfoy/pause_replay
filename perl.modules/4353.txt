Hi Kees,

> I was wondering if I could take over maintenance of Device::SerialPort?

CPAN allows "dual" or "team" maintainers. I am one of a group who maintain 
the MARC:: series of modules. I have no objection to you becoming 
co-maintainer, or even primary. But I would like to be able to keep the 
unix and Windows versions mostly compatible. Which means keeping the 
ability to post an update. So I don't want to completely exit the 
maintainer category. It might take Andreas Koenig to create the "team" (it 
did before).

I agree.

I just got FreeBSD to go with linux and Windows. But I don't have those 
others to test (and I believe you).
NOTE TO CPAN MAINTAINERS: Kees and I have had quite a bit of 
correspondence over the last year concerning his porting efforts.

We did a multi-maintainer Copyright notice for MARC:: and ControlX10::, so 
I know that is acceptable for CPAN use.

I don't see any obvious problems with the patch...looks good to me 
(without extensive testing as I am again on_the_road).
