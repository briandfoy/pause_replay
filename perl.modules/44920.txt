Isn't there a number of different ways of calculating future values? 
Isn't a great deal of statistics about doing this?

Perhaps Statistics::LinearRegression or Statistics::Regression?

Otherwise, if you have a solution that generalises forecasting and 
allowed multiple different alternate models, or plugins or such, then 
the more generic Statistics::Forecast would be very appropriate.

Your thoughts?
