Hello,

I signed up for a PAUSE account (spatocs) many, many years ago and then 
never actually used it.  I guess I got a little ahead of myself.  Now 
I'm ready to upload a module.

Anyway, since that time, my original email account 
(sandorpatocs@netscape.net) has been discontinued and I can't remember 
my password.  Unfortunately, AOL won't accept email for the netscape.net 
domain any more, so I can't get a token mailed to me.  :-(

Is this the right mailing list to request that an admin change the email 
address to sandor@patocspack.com?  Should I just set up a new account?
