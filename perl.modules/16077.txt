List::Compare  RdpO  Compare elements of two or more lists  JKEENAN

List::Compare is a simple object-oriented implementation of standard Perl
code for comparison
of the elements of two or more lists.

This module is already available on CPAN
(http://search.cpan.org/author/JKEENAN/List-Compare-0.15/) and has been
improved since its original distribution in June 2002.  At that time I sent
an announcement to module-authors@perl.org.  I have since been informed
that, in order for List::Compare to be listed as a "Registered Module" on
search.cpan.org, I should have sent this announcement to modules@perl.org.
I hope this corrects the problem.  Thank you very much.
