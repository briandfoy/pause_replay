Sounds good, I recontacted Mr. Fox about Math::Units from the email  
address on his site (which is the one he has on CPAN, but its non- 
cpan.org)

I am unable to find a non-cpan.org contact for Mr. Fitzgibbon  
(Authen::LibWrap). I did find an old address from an old list thread  
but the domain appears to be defunct currently.

Any ideas on how to contact him?

I understand, I hope I don't come across as frustrated or anything. I  
simply saw a solution and offered my assistance to them as a thank you  
for their work on it ( and so it can be useable again). In addition I   
was under the impression that asking modules@cpan.org was the next  
step in the process.

I do apologize again for that, that was never meant to happen in the  
first place and then delay after delay and here we are. I'll try to  
rectify it all ASAP. (I did delete some of the things right after FYI)

We've had a rough year with death's and birth's and what not, its hard  
to code in a hospital under stress. Please know its my intention to  
catch up and that I really am wanting to be a good CPAN resident and  
that I try to stick to and adapt to best practices. I do appreciate  
the reminders and very much appreciate  your understanding as well.
