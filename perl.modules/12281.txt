The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MySQL::Diff
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Compare table structures of 2 MySQL dbs
  userid:      ASPIERS (Adam Spiers)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Noone else appears to have produced a module with similar
    functionality, but the utility has been available from my website
    for quite a while now and several people seem to have found it very
    useful. MySQL::Diff seems the most intuitive name. Is Chapter 6 or 7
    of the module list more suitable?

  enteredby:   ASPIERS (Adam Spiers)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun 20 12:31:27 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MySQL::
::Diff            bdpOp Compare table structures of 2 MySQL dbs      ASPIERS
