Request to register new user

fullname: Peter Newman
  userid: PJNEWMAN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.pjnewman.co.uk/
     why:

    A port of http://offog.org/darcs/misccode/multimeter.py into Perl,
    like Device::MAS345 does, but for a different meter.

    Probably a few similar interface for some other devices, which may
    or may not be useful to other people.

    Hopefully also contributing something useful to Cisco::IPPhone,
    although I need to try and contact the author first.
