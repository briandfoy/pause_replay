Planning to contribute: improved versions of Convert::Recode
...which would look like this:

Convert::
Recode  Rdpf  Mapping functions between character sets  ED-AVIS

I sent the author of this module (Gisle Aas) a patch and he suggested
that I should upload a new version to CPAN myself.  I plan to make the
module more general so that it can convert between all character sets
supported by GNU recode, not just between 8-bit charsets.  This involves 
actually running recode for the more complex cases.

Because this is an improvement to an existing module, the name chosen
has already been discussed.  I have looked for other modules which do
what I want and I found Convert::Translit, but that too only handles
8-bit character sets.
