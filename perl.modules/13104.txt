Hello,

I uploaded the Text::Flowed module to CPAN recently. I'd like to have
it linked to CPAN.

This module provides functions that deals with formatting data with
Content-Type 'text/plain; format=flowed' as described in RFC2646
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2646.txt). In a nutshell,
format=flowed text solves the problem in plain text files where it is
not known which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, enabling
lines to be automatically flowed (wrapped and/or joined) as
appropriate when displaying.

Thanks.
