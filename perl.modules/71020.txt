The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::LineName
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: give names to source code lines
  userid:      NCLEATON (Nick Cleaton)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Symbolic names for source code lines in the test script are handy
    when testing things that produce messages with line numbers.

    I first uploaded this as Devel::LineName, since it's not actually
    tied to testing. However, testing is the only use for it that I can
    think of, so now I'm leaning towards Test::LineName.

    Please register it as Devel::LineName instead if you think that
    would be better.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::LineName        bdppp give names to source code lines              NCLEATON
