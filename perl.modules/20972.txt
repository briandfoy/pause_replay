I was just wondering about a similar problem in a module I want to write 
tests for -- it's a module that simplifies creating GUIs via Tk.  The tests 
would basically be of the form "this program should create a window that 
has thus-and-such kinds of widgets", but I don't see how to make these be 
automatable tests.  But I would like to have them be tests that a user 
could run if he wanted to -- and presumably each program would have a 
preface saying "Now, when the window comes up, press OK if the pulldown has 
the value X, otherwise hit Cancel" or whatever.

So, like you, I'm not sure where I should put those tests -- I infer that 
t/ isn't the place for them.

Advice, anyone?
