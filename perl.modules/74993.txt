Hi Jess,

That's great news, but please try to reach Kevin by any means possible 
before asking us to transfer maintenance permissions. Googling for his 
name turned up http://kevin.c.krinke.ca/ immediately. His home page also 
has a form for contacting him (in the about section).

If he doesn't respond within a few weeks, ping us again and we'll give 
you co-maintainer rights.

In case you wonder why the policy is what it is, have a look at 
http://cpan.perl.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover

Best regards,
Steffen
