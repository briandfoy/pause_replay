Subject: Module submission Crypt::Analysis

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Analysis
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Modules that perform cryptanalysis
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I believe it is more appropriate to create Crypt::Analysis rather
    than an additional root namespace of Cryptanalysis, as the root
    namespace Crypt is generic and is not indicative of any specific
    usage of cryptography. On the other hand, Mr Aas's root level
    namespace of Digest:: is also cryptography, but has branched out to
    it's own root. Therefore I am not 100% certain of the choice,
    however as we are to consider the ramifications of additional root
    namespaces; I have elected to use the nested one.

    There are no current cryptanalysis modules on CPAN, therefore my
    approach is unique.

    These modules will implement both classical and modern
    cryptanalysis techniques, and will be useful as classroom
    examples/tools, in server environments that use classical encryption
    (news outlets or within games), and eventually even modern practical
    attacks.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
