     why:

    I intend to take over as maintainer of Apache::Session::Memcached,
    as we (the developers on my team) have been unable to contact the
    current maintainer and have a small fix that we would like to share,
    as well as several possible contributions to the Rose::DBx namespace
    as a result of the extensive work that we are doing with
    Rose::DB::Object.
