Hello,

I would like to register as a contributor to PAUSE.  I am currently
finishing a relatively complete AOL Instant Messenger module and would
like to make it available on CPAN.

My information:
Name:     Riad Wahby
E-mail:   rsw@mit.edu
Homepage: (currently no homepage pertaining to Perl)
UID:      RWAHBY (I'd prefer RSW, but if there is a 4-character minimum
          the former is acceptable)
Contribution:
	DSLI: bdpO
	Description: OO AOL IM interface for writing AIM clients

I have discussed this idea with friends and colleagues at MIT, and
have seen a bit of interest in such an interface.  I plan to make an
announcement on comp.lang.perl.announce and to at least invite ideas
on comp.lang.perl.modules as to the best way to handle script-module
interaction.

I also have a question as to naming my module.  I had been planning to
call the module Net::InstMsg; however, upon reading the guidelines, I
found that it is likely that Net::InstantMessenger is a better module
name.  Which do you suggest I use?  If neither of these seems
acceptable, what would you suggest?

Thank you for your help.
