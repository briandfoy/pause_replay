Sorry, forgot to include the "DSLIP" information:

Name           DSLIP  Description                                  Info
-------------  -----  -------------------------------------------- -----
FTPServer      MmcOg  A featureful, extensible FTP server          RWMJ

I don't know whether to class it as "mature" or just "released",
but it is currently deployed with about 5m users, so it's certainly
not in beta :-)

There is a mailing list for development: ftpserver@annexia.org.

It's 99% Perl, 1% C (used to implement safe signal handlers for
Perl < 5.7).

It's object oriented. You can inherit from the base class in order
to customize the server and add virtual filesystems.

The license is GPL, but I might change it to GPL+Artistic if that
would somehow help people to adopt it.

Rich.
