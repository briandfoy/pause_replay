It's been 5.5 months since we discussed that.  I've kept Data-Alias up
to date as the core has changed under it: after the 5.11.0 and 5.11.2
breakages that I initially tackled, it got broken again by 5.13.1, 5.13.6,
5.13.7, 5.13.9, and 5.13.10.  I have still not heard from xmath.  Is this
an appropriate time to convert this arrangement to a full takeover?
