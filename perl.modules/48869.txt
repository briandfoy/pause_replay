The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Serdisp
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: Perl extension for talking to the serdisplib

  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)

  rationale:

    Sorry for my first short posting. I'm not familiar with registering
    a namespace so please forgive any mistakes.

    This perl library is just a frontend to the C library serdislib.
    With this library you can drive serial displays with built-in
    controllers. The interface represents a single interfaces regardless
    of the used display type (serial, parallel, usb display, ...). The
    serial in "serial display" characterises the way of how the data is
    transferred to the display controller not the connection type
    itself.

    So I think it's the best to name the perl library like the C
    library.

    See http://serdisplib.sourceforge.net for more infos about the C
    library.
