Hi Philip,

Thanks for copying me... your earlier email (3 days ago) arrived on
what is a 3-day weekend for me, so I was away.

You don't need to usurp it insofar as I'm perfectly willing for you
to take it over if that's what you like to do; and I'd be happy for
the improvements to be available to the community.

I'm on lots of other projects, so if you could let me know how (with
PAUSE or whatever) I can assist in the "takeover", if need be, let me know.

Dave
