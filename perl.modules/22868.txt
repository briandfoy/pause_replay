Hi,
	
	I'm interested in adding a new module for communication with
the XM satellite radio 'PCR'. It's a small user-interface-less box with a 
USB port.

	I have rewritten another author's code, and believe two good choices
would either be Audio::Xmpcr or Hardware::Xmpcr, with my preference
leaning toward the former.

	Do you have any opinions/recommendations on its location?

	Thanks!
