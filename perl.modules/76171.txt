Lets try that again.

I may be a co-maint, but it's not in my repository and Marek has done
the last few releases.

I was added to co-maint in 2007 but because Marek was doing stuff with
it I never ended up actually doing anything.

Since it's been a couple of years since his last release (of
Pod::Parser or anything else), I'm happy to pull it into my repository
and start doing release management if we can't get a response from
him.
