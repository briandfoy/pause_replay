PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET! 

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program
(USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry
away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously
buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the 
back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for
the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash..
Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly 
rubber-banded in labeled piles.

"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 41-year-old
woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my
husband earns in a year". The woman immediately called 
her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had
discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boys'
school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that 
where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in
the closet. 

As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of
"Report" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday
after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on 
his computer in his bedroom. 

"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name
on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says the
clever 15-year-old. 

The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send
one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at
the top and move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
your name to the top of the list. 

The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand
dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter
with your name at the top of the 5-address list. "I get junk E-mail all the 
time, and really did not think it was going to work", the boy continues. 

Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box
that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions
began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
$5 bills. 

"About a week later I rode [mybike] down to the post office and my box had
1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was also a yellow
slip that said I had to go up to the [postoffice] 
counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)". He goes on, "I
went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had
to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I 
could not carry it all". 

Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. "The
money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in
the closet, barely had time for my homework". He had also been 
riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5
bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. 

"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different
banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually
tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady
gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do
it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, 
but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)." 

Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting
news team examined and investigated the so-called "chain-letter" the boy
was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all. 
In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,
Title 18,Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code,
also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged
for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a
little note that read, "Please send me report number XYX". 
This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service
(A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.

BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say "Bull",
please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about
on the news lately. Due to the popularity of 
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described
below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also 
investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved
once and for all that there are "absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the
participation in the program and if people can follow the simple 
instructions, they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of
pocket cost". 

DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 

Note* follow the directions below, I had best results the second time when
I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports
instructions.

In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so
that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the
following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is 
accept money for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as
possible. 

This is what one had to say: "Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was
approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I
finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received
total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in".

Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long time
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the
mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a
total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re- 
entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it
again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps
and NOT change anything." 

More testimonials later but first, 

PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE 

Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT
LIST next to the 
report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER
in case of any mail problems.. 

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You
will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer..
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so
they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports 
and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. 


IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to
each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step "1 through 6" or you will loose 
out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this
method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! 
People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way.
Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So 
Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if
you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has

fortune.

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as
well just in case if you loose any data. To 
assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary
methods to get this venture going: 

METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each.. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response 
(the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also
many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only
5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 
5,000 e-mails. 

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0..2% responded with 
orders. That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. 

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3. 

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report
#4. 

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 
EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.....
$500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00 

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE 
A LOT OF MONEY! 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or
half or even one 4th 
of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150
million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many
people will do just that, and more! 

METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response. 

We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go
along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report
they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day 
service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out
with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not
advertise until they receive the report. 

AVAILABLE REPORTS


ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash
(U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash
is concealed by wrapping 
it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets
of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR
E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal 
address.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 

If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks,
continue sending e-mails until you do. After you have received 10 orders,
2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more 
for REPORT #2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails
until you do. 

Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN RELAX,
because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO 
REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by
watching which report people are ordering from 
you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND
START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can 
generate from this business!!! 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just
received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of
your life, with NO RISK and JUST A 
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and
months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It 
works exceedingly well as it is now.. 

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your
name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as instructed
above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you
will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, 
information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent..
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! 

MORE TESTIMONIALS

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about 
receiving "junk mail". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my
knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't
work.. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days 
later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was
ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work.
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 
responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $
147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her "hobby".

"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way 
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back". "I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice 
thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big". 

Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if
I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by 
someone else.11 months passed then it luckily came again... I did not
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks".
