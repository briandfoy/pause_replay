Hello,

I would like to register as a CPAN contributor.

Here are my details:

Name:
	James Morris

Email Address:
	jmorris@intercode.com.au

Home Page:
	http://www.intercode.com.au/jmorris/

Preferred user-ID:
	JAMESM

Description of planned contribution:
	Initially, I would like to contribute an existing and reasonably
well tested Perl module called perlipq, or as it is less affectionately
known IPTables::IPv4::IPQueue.  This is a Perl module for experimental
userspace packet queueing via Linux 2.4 IPTables.  Please see
http://www.intercode.com.au/jmorris/perlipq/ for more information.
