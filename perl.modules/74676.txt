     why:

    I am developing an application, to be named Mirchi, which will be
    an IRC-style network application with two features:

    (a) Ability for 6.7 billion simultaneous chatters (b) Realtime
    translation of chat

    Mirchi is an ambitious project that I am prototyping using CPAN
    modules such as POE::Component::MessageQueue, Net::Stomp, and many
    others. As I am working towards a full prototype of Mirchi, I am
    developing modules that I believe are useful quite generally. For
    example, I wrote a simple module, GoogleTranslate that is an
    efficient translator that uses the web interface of the Google
    translator and handles encoding issues correctly for Arabic-English.
    I would like a PAUSE ID so that I can put some of these intermediate
    modules for general use.
