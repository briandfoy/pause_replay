you should replace the last parts of those names with something
that describes your module.  what sets your module apart from 
other things that do CGI authorization or terminal interfaces?

these are your modules, and i do not think you are really trying to
come up with adequate names.  perhaps you should discuss your modules
in the Perl newsgroups, mailing lists, or other appropriate lists.
it is your job to come up with a good name.

as far as i am concerned, i'm closing the matter and not registering
your modules.  after you discuss he names with a wider audience,
submit new namespace requests.
