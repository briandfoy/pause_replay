The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::FindSimilars
  DSLIP:       MdpOb
  description: Fast Similar Files Finder
  userid:      SUNTONG (Tong Sun)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc,comp.unix.programmer

  similar:
    File::CheckTree File::Find File::Compare

  rationale:

    The module will find all similar files, not only identical ones:
    different version (.txt, .html, or .pdf) and different compression
    methods (.zip, .gz, .tar.gz, .bip2), MP3 files with different names
    or even different sample rates, etc. It uses advanced soundex vector
    algorithm to determine the file similarities.Thus, it is over
    hundreds times faster than any existing file content comparing or
    fingerprinting technology.

    It helps to find duplicated files too. Finding duplications using
    fingerprinting technology is slightly better than doing content
    comparing. Yet it is still way too inefficient, because creating
    check-sum is hundreds or even thousands times slower. Moreover, if
    there isn't many duplications, then probably 99% of CPU power is
    wasted on creating useless check sums. What's worse is that, it will
    not give the complete list. if there is any remote possibilities of
    the following cases:

    - Variation in file names. I used to make backups using distinct
    names, e.g., file.ver1, file.ver2, etc. If you ever backup your
    files this way, then finding duplications by names won't help much.

    - Variation in content. Since backups are made over the times, any
    slightly change in file content will break the check sum method
    entirely.
