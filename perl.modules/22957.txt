The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SSN::Validate
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl extension do SSN Validation
  userid:      KMELTZ (Kevin Meltzer)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:
    I didn't see any that did SSN validations.

  rationale:

    I sent this twice to modules@perl.org, but my email never seemed to
    arrive. So, this is what I attempted to send. I think I'm sticking
    with SSN::Validate so I can get it uploaded and get more active
    development done.

    ---- Hello, I'm working on a module to do some validating of US
    SSNs above any beyond seeing if they are "9 digits". I'm currently
    working off the area data located at:
    http://www.ssa.gov/foia/stateweb.html Currently, the module (infancy
    stages, so I want it on the CPAN so others can pitch in) validates
    SSNs based on those area ranges, making sure the group isn't '00'
    and the serial isn't '0000'. I plan to work in the High Groups next.
    As well, it will return the state for a given area. I am working
    with the package name of SSN::Validate. No SSN:: root namespace
    exists. I'm not sure if it should be Validate::SSN, as it would then
    sit next to Validate::Net which could be seen as a namespace
    pollution. I'd rather follow suite with the *::Validate modules.
    Does SSN::Validate or SSN::Valid seem ok to use? Any other
    suggestions? Cheers, Kevin
