Hi Hugh

Looking through that list of modules, I think I see where you are trying 
to go, and I'd say that I for one would be in favour in-principle of a 
top-level namespace.

But personal I find Organize not particularly great. For one, it's very 
generic. One can "organize" pretty much anything, and "organize" is also 
spelled with the relatively little used American dialect of English, 
rather than the more common British English, so it certainly scrapes 
against my brain even more uncomfortably.

I'd also note that some of your specific modules belong in other places...

For example, "Federal" isn't required, generally we would do something 
like...

Politics::Campaign
Politics::US::
Politics::US::NY::

etc etc

Other things might need to go in other places...

Things that aren't specific to either Non-Profit/Community work in 
general, or Politics specifically (for example) might belong in Business::

So I'm thinking maybe you need two or three namespaces if you want to 
spread your wings over such a large area.

Business:: (existing) for general things which are usable in business or 
non-profit scenarios.

Politics:: (which I think is clean and specific) for things that are 
very specific to political activities (such as the VoteDB namespace I 
see there)

And for the rest, well LegisTrack is a brand name and could go directly 
under, say, Politics.

The Registration:: stuff is tricky, it looks almost more like a product 
that a namespace.

And your Treasurer stuff will be hard too, because as with most things 
financial it is very hard to do things in a way that works across 
various countries and legal systems...

So in summary, erm...

I'd be very happy to have a Politics:: to firewall off the stuff that is 
highly specific to politics (electoral, lobbying, etc) as long as you 
remain strongly resistant to US-bias (which has damaged other namespaces).

Anything with a specific branding, like LegisTrack is fine directly in 
the top level. Anything generic you probably want to put under a 
country-specific second-level.

Politics::US::...

Fortunately, I think your international experience should stand you in 
better stead that some of the people that don't realise the rest of the 
world uses Perl as well :)

But still, if you going to throw up a module as Politics::Campaign, be 
aware that it's going to potentially need to be used by a lot of people 
in a lot of places.

And I think you are most certainly going to need to forget the idea of a 
namespace quite as wide as you envisage Organize.

Politics is obvious, parts of what you have there will fit into 
Business::, and as for the remains... I think it's worth discussing them 
on a case be case basis here to find the best fit.

In any large endeavour, you'll find modules tend to be spread around and 
rarely exist all in one place.
