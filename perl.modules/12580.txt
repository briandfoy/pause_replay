The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::CrossTable
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Tables with automatic col/row/total sums
  userid:      BIGJ (Janek Schleicher)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Table

  rationale:

    This modules handles of tables with automatic generated
    col/row/total sums. A simple example could be: 1 2 3 4 Sum 1 4 5 6 1
    16 2 1 2 3 4 10 3 10 1 1 2 14 Sum 15 8 10 7 40

    Setting the values into the tables will force to recalculate the
    sums. That is e.g. used when generating statistical reports.

    Of course, you can use any associative, distributive operation
    instead of sum (e.g. multiplication makes sense when working with
    probabilities).

    It's a special form of a table, so the name Data::CrossTable should
    be O.K..

    Of course, it's easy to implement, but this module enables a more
    easier and less errorprone possibility to work with such tables (in
    fact, in my first hacked versions, I sometimes switched rows/cols or
    forgot whether 0 or 1 was the first line/row with some subtils
    errors). As I believe, it's a standard form of output, used by some
    people, it should be at CPAN.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::CrossTable      idpOp Tables with automatic col/row/total sums     BIGJ
