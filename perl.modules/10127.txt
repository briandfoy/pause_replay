I'll be working on the LotusNotes or Domino (depending on what it ends up
being called) database modules. This work was started but never completed
by Martin Brech. I'm continuing it and moving Martin's use of the C API
to the C++ API. (Lotus makes things easy that way)

I'm registering as myself since Martin has not started a spot on CPAN
already.
