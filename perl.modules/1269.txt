DBD::RAM       ampO  DBI interface to in-memory data structures   DBIML

I've discussed this on the dbi-users and dbi-dev lists and had quite a
bit of interest.  Alligater Descartes is adding it to the DBD list on
symbolstone and said: "Cool idea. Possibly the sickest thing I've heard
for a while, but very cool nonetheless!".  He also said it was lurid. 
How can you pass that up?

If you'd like to look at the module itself or its POD:

Thanks!
