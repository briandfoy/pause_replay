Hi, I'm running apache 1.3.19 on a Windows 2000 system.  I would really like
to get asp support going although I don't even know where to begin having
read all the info on mod_perl and the available ASP::Apache modules out
there.  Is there any simple way to explain it to a newbie?  I know about the
httpd.conf in apache and I have no problem running the server as a
standalone and use of .php and .html documents etc...  I just can't figure
out the first step in getting the mod_perl thing to work and have no idea
where the rest of these modules go or what they do.  Any pointers would be
greatly appreciated.


Thanks in advance,
Mike Thierfelder
