Dear maintainers of the CPAN namespace,

I would like to "apply" for some additional namespace (2 new modules)
which I need in order to extend my "Date::Calc" package (oncoming
version 4.4).

The first module is called "Date::Carp" for obvious reasons:

       This module is closely based on Carp.pm from Perl
       5.005_03. It has been modified to skip all package names
       matching /^Date::/. Thus when your script date.pl calls
       module Date::A, and module Date::A calls module Date::B,
       an exception raised in module Date::B will appear to have
       originated from date.pl where Date::A was called, and not
       in Date::A where Date::B was called, as the unmodified
       Carp.pm would try to make you believe :-). This works
       similarly if Date::B calls Date::C where the exception is
       raised, etcetera.

       In other words, this blames all errors in the Date::*
       modules on the user of these modules, i.e., you. ;-)

All "Date::*" modules can use and profit from this module.

The proposed entry into The Perl 5 Module List would be:

Name              DSLI Description                                  Info
------------      ---- -------------------------------------------- ----
Date::Carp        bdpf Throw exceptions outside Date::* packages    STBEY

The second module is an object-oriented front-end to "Date::Calc" with
overloaded operators.

This module is intended to make frequent things easy (and infrequent or
hard things possible), such as, for example:

    use Date::Object;

    $yesterday = Date::Object->today - 1;
    $tomorrow  = Date::Object->today + 1;

    Date::Object->date_format(3); # the most verbose

    print "Yesterday was: $yesterday\n";
    print "Tomorrow is:   $tomorrow\n";

The proposed name is "Date::Object", also for obvious reasons.

But maybe you'll think that this name is *too* generic, I don't know.
The module's name should be something very short, however, because it
will be something users will have to type frequently (as in the example
above). Another idea for a name would be "Date::ooCalc" or "Date::OOCalc"
(or "Date::CalcOO"?), but this looks a little queer ("OO" means "rest
room" in many countries). I'd really prefer "Date::Object" for this
reason.

The proposed entry into The Perl 5 Module List would be:

Name              DSLI Description                                  Info
------------      ---- -------------------------------------------- ----
Date::Object      bdpO Date::Calc OO frontend w/ overl'd operators  STBEY

A beta version of "Date::Calc" 4.4 containing these two new modules can
be downloaded from

    http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/pkg/Date-Calc-4.4.tar.gz

Please see also

    http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/pkg/Date-Calc-4.4.README

for a list of changes and new features and why it's still called "beta".

Thank you very much in advance for your consideration and help!

Best regards,
