I've registered HTML::GetToc now. Sorry for the delay.

We've never received a request to register HTML::Toc. That makes it
harder to find, but it's OK, we do not want to force anybody to
anything.

The module list is trying to be comprehensive, but will never be as
comprehensive as the real thing. To let CPAN grow out of its bounds it
must not depend in any way on the module list and in fact, it doesn't.

Both users and developers need to do a more exhaustive search today
than 3 years ago to find modules on CPAN. search.cpan.org, the module
list, the archives of the many mailing lists are the places to visit,
and finally direct emails to developers who work in similar problem
domains can often help to make effective use of the CPAN.
