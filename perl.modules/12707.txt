but there's no cost to an extra level, right? and you have the level anyway,
it's just that the taxonomy is inconsistent... I mean, if underscores were
preferred for levels then we'd call it Proc_PID_File, no?

If you object to an extra level then we could just lump that functionality
into Proc::PID (which then also have to do other stuff like ::Of) but then
you'd be forcing people to have functionality they don't care for.
Proc::PID could then have stuff that Proc::PID::File needs, which is as it
should be.

Okay.

I still don't think it's worth an extra level. PID_File and PID_whatever etc
seems just fine to me. There won't be that many of them.
