Registration rejected.

The abandonment of a module is not sufficient for the registration of a 
different module that is similar or identical, but with updated features.

A convention already exists for taking over maintenance of a module that 
has been abandoned, especially in the case of bug fixes, and also in the 
case of completely back-compatible improvements.

The convention for contacting the authors is "A number of times by a 
number of methods over a number of weeks".

That is, you should try to contact them over a number of weeks (which 
you have done) via both the official email, and any other methods you 
are able to find (such as a phone number if you can find one).

If you are still unable to contact them after this time, we all add you 
as a co-maintainer for the module, so that you can make bug fixes and so on.

If you want to make more significant changes, generally it is best to 
wait a bit longer to see if the author returns (particularly for 
something like Time::Piece where the author is relatively well known).

Often they will give you official blessing to take over primary 
maintainership anyway, if you have shown enough interest to take over 
and make bug fix releases.

Once you have fulfilled the contact criteria (which you mostly have 
already) please email the modules@perl.org list directly, stating you 
case, and we will add you as a co-maintainer.
