Subject: New name space K acceptable?

From: markpf@gmail.com ("Mark Pfeiffer")

I have a written a module to interface with kxsystems' K language. See
kx.com for a run down on the language/database. However, what name?

Can't find any pre-written K interface for Perl anywhere.

My problem is that K is such a short name and probably not that
acceptable as a module name. Other options could be:

    KDB+  # hopefully the plus wouldn't be an issue, haven't checked
    KDB

My module isn't a DBD as K even though it is a relational DB is
actually much more than that. It has scalars, Dictionaries, Lists,
Tables and much more. It also isn't row oriented in nature, storing
table data in columns.

Comments?
