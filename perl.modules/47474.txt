You may want to consider Net::GPSD or possibly GPS::Net::GPSD if this is 
just the code to implement the gpsd client.

Unless the protocol itself actually has a name, in which case you should 
probably be using that.

Lowercasing the gpsd isn't a good idea, and indeed GPS::gpsd, because 
it's not clear if you are implementing a client or a server.

Lower case like that is sometimes used to indicate you are implementing 
the thing itself, or that you simulate some very specific things, such 
as the File::chmod and File::pushd examples, which implement equivalents 
of very specific things from C.
