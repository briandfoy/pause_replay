The trick is to install your fixed version somewhere that a CPAN
upgrade won't overwrite. You don't want to install patched modules into
a directory that might update itself, for instance, when a module with
an IO::Capture dependency decides to install the CPAN version.

However, there is a tricky and clever way to go about that. Not that I
recommend it, but Andreas provided a way in CPAN.pm to patch distros
before you started to install them. Again, I'm not recommending it, but
I think it's pretty cool. For very small changes I might use that, but
for big changes, not so much.
