Hello Jarkko Hietaniemi, in a previous mail you wrote:

But as I said, the problem is that users won't be able to decide whether they
want to accept the speed penalty of the OO frontend or not if I put all
together into one and the same module.

So I'd rather like to keep the core module and the OO wrapper separated.

Therefore I still need a good name for the OO frontend module.

Any suggestions? (I personally find Date::CalcOO pretty ugly)

Don't worry, happens to all of us, sometimes even at the day of light! :-)
