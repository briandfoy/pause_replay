The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chipcard::APDU
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Object representing an ISO7816 apdu
  userid:      LVREGENT (Jason Fox)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    pcsc

  similar:
    Chipcard::PCSC Net::Z3950::APDU

  rationale:

    I went with Chipcard as the root namespace because the entire point
    of this is to enhance smartcard parsing. I chose the sub namespace
    of APDU because I would like to be able to subclass APDU in the
    future, such as an ISO14443-centric implementation. (Class::APDU
    itself will be ISO7816-centric, becuase that should cover the
    majority of the APDU specifications) The reason I am writing this
    module is to have an abstracted view of an apdu that I can call
    get/set on the various parts and also use a tied hash underneath in
    order to drive apdu parsing (for example - call cla_found when the
    CLA byte is encountered during parsing)

  enteredby:   LVREGENT (Jason Fox)
  enteredon:   Mon Jun 12 12:52:41 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Chipcard::
::APDU            idpOp Object representing an ISO7816 apdu          LVREGENT
