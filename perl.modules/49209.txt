Hello,

On May 10th, I registered my first module distribution which is pre-alpha i=
n=20
development, and on May 12th someone with the excellent name of "gomer=20
hump" (http://cpanratings.perl.org/user/gomer) commented absolutely=20
negatively!

Could you please delete this inappropriate review by "gomer hump."

His comment is "absolutely useless!"  I know of no means for myself or anyo=
ne=20
else to contact "gomer hump" personally to get him to retract his ill-forme=
d=20
views.  This exclusively negative-commenting person, not just with me but=20
with others too, didn't have a clue of what I've been trying to do, and at=
=20
that time early on, my focus was on the getting the code up there to regist=
er=20
the namespace, get familiar with the fundamentals of the distribution=20
process, and get all my Module::Build conversion problems taken care of.

And within one week I had everything cleared up, and my other two=20
distributions that were uploaded on May 15-16, passed cpan-testers on May=20
19th.
