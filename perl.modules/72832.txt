Thanks a lot Steffen!  I took a look and it looks like you're right,
that is the same Jeff, and he's close enough to my network on LinkedIn
that I could send an introduction request through contacts, we'll see if
it works its way through to him or not.  I'll let you know what, if
anything, turns up there.

Thanks,
Tim Wilde
