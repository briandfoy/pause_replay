The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::DMAC
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: Uses block ciphers to produce secure MACs
  userid:      JCDUQUE (Julius C. Duque)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:
    CBC

  rationale:

    This is Double MAC (DMAC), also known as Encrypted MAC (EMAC).
    Unlike HMAC, which reuses an existing one-way hash function, such as
    MD5, SHA-1 or RIPEMD-160, DMAC reuses an existing block cipher to
    produce a secure MAC. Using the block cipher and a secret key, a
    message is encrypted in CBC mode, and encrypted again with a second
    secret key.

  enteredby:   JCDUQUE (Julius C. Duque)
  enteredon:   Wed May 14 14:52:18 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::DMAC            bdpfg Uses block ciphers to produce secure MACs    JCDUQUE
