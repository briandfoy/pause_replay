     why:

    Hi. I'm working with perl since 2001 and have some ideas I want to
    share with people. Sometimes the library is short and easy, but it
    is impossible to release it "just now" without an account. The most
    important problems I am solving at my work are resource comsumption,
    incapsulation and strict interfaces, so the classes I usually write
    have this focus during the development process. I hope this will be
    useful not only for me. The nearest plan is to finish work with a
    little ORM, which encapsulates group operations with objects.
    Another solution which is ready and can be published is RPC-like
    interface allowing to run methods/functions on remote server without
    changing the code of the sub. Also I have sent patches to CHI,
    File::Find::Object authors; the patch for URI is ready and will be
    sent after more aggressive testing.
