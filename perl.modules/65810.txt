Subject: Module submission Parse::Stallion

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Stallion
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: regexp parser and tree evaluator
  userid:      ARTHUR (Arthur Goldstein)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parse::RecDescent Parse::Gnaw Parse::Yapp

  rationale:

    It's a parser. The stallion part comes from a String being
    represented by a Tree of And, Leaves, Or Nodes.

    The module can take a grammar represented by EBNF, with related
    subroutines written in perl. This allows the perl compiler to check
    for errors as well as allowing one to call other perl routines
    easily.

    It is faster than Parse::RecDescent, it has a submodule,
    Parse::Stallion::RD which is faster than Parse::RecDescent and takes
    a similar input and Parse::Stallion itself is still faster than
    Parse::Stallion::RD.

    It is fully documented, has many test cases and examples.

  enteredby:   ARTHUR (Arthur Goldstein)
  enteredon:   Sun May 10 04:43:22 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
::Stallion        RdpOp regexp parser and tree evaluator             ARTHUR
