Hi Ingy,

this is the regular reminder that you promised to make a new Spoon and 
IO::All release.

You promised back in August. The changes/fixes are committed to your SVN 
repository as you suggested. I'm still open to doing the releases for 
you if you make me co-maintainer via PAUSE.

I'm CC-ing the PAUSE admins in case you would want me to do the releases 
but can't be bothered to reach to pause.perl.org.

Cheers,
Steffen
