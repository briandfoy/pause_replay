The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FWS::Lite
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Light version of FrameWork Sites CMS  utils
  userid:      NATELEWIS (Nate Lewis)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, website, forums, chatrooms

  similar:

  rationale:

    FWS (FrameWork Sites) is an opensource CMS written entirely in
    Perl. It has over 500+ web installs worldwide. The core code is
    actually a project that has over 5000+ installs over a 15 year
    existence but was private held and obfuscated.

    Our decision 3 years ago to move to an open source was very well
    received and other developers have jumped on board using the modules
    and contributing to our base while being maintained by myself. The
    software is currently only available from our distribution installs
    and is web optimized for maximum compatibility to 3rd party hosting
    environments. Moving them to CPAN to make the software public and
    easily accessible with a Lite version is the next step in our
    distribution process. This will give developers easy access to the
    software's core functionality. Once this is complete we will be
    releasing a verity of other associated FWS modules that hold other
    benefits for the FWS CMS.

    The API is vast, hardened, secure and very robust being used by
    enterprise and small business. The FWS::Lite version we are
    publishing first in CPAN will contain all the data model
    connectivity so FWS developers can use this module as an easy way to
    create non web based functionality using FWS tools they are used to.
    And of course access web based data and files via the same libraries
    they have available in the IDE within the FWS platform.

    We hope you give high consideration to approve our namespace as we
    will be working over the course of this year to port all our core
    code under this namespace contributing our code and our data
    methodologies to the community.
