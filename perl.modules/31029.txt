Subject: Module submission DBD::mysql::SimpleMySQL

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBD::mysql::SimpleMySQL
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: A simple interface to DBD::mysql
  userid:      LINNIN (Jacob Boswell)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wrote this module simply because I was tired of writing "SELECT
    ... FROM ... JOIN ... WHERE" and I could not find a module that did
    this for me.

    In reference to my previous submission for "SimpleMySQL" I relized
    the error of my ways and the stupidity of the comment "I could not
    find a logical parent." This module as it is fits very nicely into
    DBD::mysql. I will be making the appropriate changes in my code and
    uploading it shortly.

The resulting entry would be:

DBD::mysql::
::SimpleMySQL     bdpfp A simple interface to DBD::mysql             LINNIN
