Brian -

    I uploaded 0.17 a few days ago, but 0.13 is still showing as the
tip. If you go to http://search.cpan.org/~rkinyon/Excel-Template-0.13/
and click on the CPAN Testers link, you'll see that 0.17 has been
tested (and passed), but it's not the tip ... ? You can't go to
http://search.cpan.org/~rkinyon/Excel-Template-0.17/

    I also uploaded 0.14, 0.15, and 0.16 - now all the uploads have
been in the last 2 weeks, two on the same day. But, that shouldn't
have been a problem, right?

Thanks,
Rob
