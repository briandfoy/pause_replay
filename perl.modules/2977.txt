I'm planning to contribute a simple module that aids in the scripting of =
VXML
in the same way that CGI.pm outputs HTML.  This is intended to increase t=
he
functionality of CGI.pm and promote the use of VXML.

Name: VXML.pm
DSLI: rdof
Description: Dynamic scripting tool for VXML

Category: Dynamic scripting tool for VXML (modeled after CGI.pm)

This module has already been distributed by Tellme Networks at =

http://studio.corp.tellme.com/downloads/code-vxmlpm.html

It was designed in particular to work with Tellme Studio
(http://studio.tellme.com) a platform dedicated entirely to the open sour=
ce
VXML developer community.  Programmers can develop applications for free =
and
publish them as part of the main Tellme service at 1-800-555-TELL.
