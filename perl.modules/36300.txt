Well, we already pondered over that on #perl IRCNet, tossing up stuff like 
::OnTheFly, ::Stream, but couldn't really find one that would hit the 
spot. I don't think ::Diskless would suffice, since disklessness is just 
one alternative mode of operation. I believe ::Stream received the second 
most support in our discussion, but I'm open for suggestions.
