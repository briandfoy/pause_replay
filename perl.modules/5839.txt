Hello - I have a couple of scripts I wish to share with the Perl community at
large. Here is the requested information for PAUSE registration purposes:

Description:

2 scripts - mgcpgen and mgcsim (category Networking)

a) mgcpgen:

mgcpgen is a barebones MGCP message generation tool (Media Gateway Control
Protocol - rfc 2705)

This script, though standalone, is intended to be used with `mgcsim' also 
available at CPAN scripts. These scripts were mainly developed to test
parsing on a Media Gateway supporting MGCP 1.0. They have been used 
extensively in real test environments for call setup and debugging. Given 
their simple functionality, bugs should be minimal - please let me
<vikram@acc.com> know if you find bugs and/or if you find these 
scripts useful. 

mgcpgen is really minimally `protocol dependent' because the commands
come from a text file. It should easily be ported to other text-based
protocols such as H.248 (the author feels that the bigger effort in the
port is rewriting the pod).

b) mgcsim:

mgcsim is a dummy MGC (receive side) simulator.

This script, though standalone, is intended to be used with `mgcpgen' also 
available at CPAN scripts. These scripts were mainly developed to test
parsing on a Media Gateway supporting MGCP 1.0. They have been used 
extensively in real test environments for call setup and debugging. Given 
their simple functionality, bugs should be minimal - please let me
<vikram@acc.com> know if you find bugs and/or if you find these 
scripts useful. 

Thanks,
