The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IO::Filter
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Generic filters for IO handles.
  userid:      RWMJ (Richard Jones)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    IO::Handle IO::File IO::Socket

  rationale:

    I wanted a way to take an existing IO handle and transparently
    filter it (in particular, pplying gzip or bzip compression to it)
    and return another IO handle which I could use in place of the
    original. After searching CPAN I was surprised that such
    functionality was not already available, so I wrote it :-) It's used
    in Net::FTPServer.

  enteredby:   RWMJ (Richard Jones)
  enteredon:   Sun Sep  2 22:40:08 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IO::
::Filter          adpOg Generic filters for IO handles.              RWMJ
