     why:

    An object oriented Perl module (class) that saves the time of
    repeatedly writing a module (class) to handle: 1) Command line
    parameter processing 2) Configuration file processing 3) Usage
    messages 4) Debug messaging It's all the small but important time
    consuming features that any non-trivial Perl program uses all tucked
    away in one small little package.

    You subclass the module and get a foundation on which to build and
    test your program and can move on immediately to writing the code
    that's unique to the program you're trying to create.
