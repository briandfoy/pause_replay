The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::Pod
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Apache2 mod_perl based pod file handler.
  userid:      KYPREOS (Theron Lewis)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Apache::Pod

  rationale:

    Apache::Pod was released with dependencies against the Apache
    libraries for Apache 1.3.xx. When I was using CPAN to install this
    module, the dependencies required that I installed apache 1.3.xx and
    the associated mod_perl libraries to use this, despite the fact that
    I had Apache2 and modperl already installed. I ported this library
    to work with the Apache2 mod_perl libraries, updated the
    dependencies, and implemented several features that the author of
    the original module had indicated he wanted to implement in the
    comments of his code. I used the Apache2:: namespace to be
    consistent with other packages I was using such as Apache2::ASP and
    Apache2::modperl. After contacting the author, he reccomended I
    maintain this package as Apache2::Pod as I had named it.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache2::
::Pod             bdpfp Apache2 mod_perl based pod file handler.     KYPREOS
