Hi Stephen,

First off apologies.
Secondly I released IO::All mid October.
Thrid I released Spoon 2 minutes ago.
Finally, I gladly accept your offer to comaintain these modules and
actually as many of my modules as you wish.

All I ask is that you ping me via email or irc or IM prior to a release.

I will add your pause id to the comaint of these two dists. Email me
back if you want more.

FYI, I have started a reorganization of Kwiki called Kwiki 2.0 at:

    http://2.kwiki.org
    http://svn.2.kwiki.org

The idea is to make things a lot easier for a lot more people to be
involved. Well that's part of the plan anyway. Mostly I intend Kwiki to
be downloadable and installable via subversion rather than cpan.

While I don't intend to completely abandon cpan, I also am not so
interested in keeping cpan up to date. Really it should be automated
somehow. Anyway, all this is to say that if you want to shepard Kwiki on
cpan, you are most welcome to.

Cheers, Ingy
