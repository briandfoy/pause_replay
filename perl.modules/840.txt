Yes.

id3v1:
128 bytes that live at the end of a file, with a very rigid format
You can make a C struct representing a complete id3v1 tag.

id3v2:
arbitrarily large, lives at the beginning of a file, constructed of
a series of frames, each of which has its own format specification,
some of which are also arbitrarily large.  The whole thing is versioned 
and extensible with more frames.  There are currently at least three
frames dedicated to describing the title of a recording.  Frames for
lyrics synchronized with the recording, frames for pictures of the band,
...

While anything is possible in software, and you could conceivably 
squash them both into the same module, they are more useful and
flexible apart than together.  They are both well-behaved and
can be use-d in the same program without ill effect.

Btw., sander and I sit in the same cubicle, and we did certainly
discuss it.
