The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plugin::TwoStage
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: two stage processing with 1st stage caching
  userid:      ALEXK (Alexander Kühne)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Template-Plugin-TwoStage

  similar:
    Template::Plugin::Cache

  rationale:

    Template::Plugin::TwoStage delivers two stage processing of TT
    template blocks with first stage caching.

    Processing results of the first (precompilation) stage are cached
    away for subsequent repeated processing in the second (runtime)
    stage. Precompilation and runtime tags are seperated by using
    different tag styles.

    Template::Plugin::TwoStage aims to bring the "lazy" precompilation
    approach of Template::Plugin::Cache to dynamic templates.

    Features include:

    * parameterized precompilation of a single block: Pass keys as
    additional identifiers of a BLOCK, based upon which the BLOCK
    produces a different precompiled output/version of the BLOCK.

    * expiration: Give the precompiled BLOCKs a 'time to live' before
    they expire.

    * namespaces: Distinguish different e.g. applications in one
    process by the use of namespaces.

    * development mode: Edit your templates with caching turned off.
    The development mode also gives you convenient access to the
    precompiled versions produced for validation of your separation of
    precompilation and runtime directives.

    * flexible customization: Set your basic configuration in a
    subclass, and override any configuration option on plugin
    instantiation or even on specific plugin method calls in the
    templates.
