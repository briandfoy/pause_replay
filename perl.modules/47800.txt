You mean like:

Apache2::Authentication_Users_Sessions_Groups_And_Access_Control;

?

I originally called it "Apache2::AAA" (Authentication, Access Control and
Authorization), but realized that didn't include sessions... so I thought
"AAAS", which would probably sound like the word "ass" in a deep german
accent... which led me to "Aus", which actually is a german word...

I don't know. Now would be the time to change the name since I'm just about
ready to go from alpha to beta, so I'm open to suggestions. If there's a
compelling alternative, Schema::RDBMS::AUS would end up being renamed as
well as all the SQL tables etc...

	Thanks,
		Tyler
