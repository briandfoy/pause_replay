Dear CPAN Maintainers,

As evidenced by the following message, Ed Avis (author of Term-ProgressBar 1)
and I have been in communication, and we have a agreed that I shall take over
maintainership of Term-ProgressBar.  Please can the relevant data of CPAN be
updated?  I have uploaded a Term-ProgressBar 2.00 into my directory (FLUFFY),
(a slightly updated version than the 2.00c referred to).

Thank you.

Martyn J. Pearce

Subject: Re: Status of Term::ProgressBar

To Martyn J. Pearce <fluffy@inpharmatica.co.uk>.  This is to say I'm
happy for you to take over the Term::ProgressBar namespace and upload
the 2.00c version you sent me (or a later version) as the new official
Term::ProgressBar distribution.  I suggested some improvements, but your
current version is good enough.

You could maybe wave this in front of the CPAN maintainers to convince
them to hand you the namespace, if they trust my rather amateurish use
of PGP.
