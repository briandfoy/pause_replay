... is in a late alpha stage. All API features are implemented, and
mostly documented. There is a 28-point test script included that also
serves well to demonstrate the class's use.

It has compiled and tested cleanly on:
	x86	- Linux 2.6 Gentoo 2004.0
	x86	- Linux 2.6 Fedora FC2
	x86	- Linux 2.4 Debian 2.2
	AMD	- Linux 2.6 Fedora Core 3
	PPCG4	- Mac OS X 10.3

It has compiled and tested with warnings on:
	x86	- OpenBSD 3.4 - possible Test::Harness bug
	Alpha	- Linux 2.2 Debian 3.0 - va_list warnings

It has compiled but not tested on:
	x86	- FreeBSD 4.8 - no Test::More
	x86	- NetBSD 1.6.1 - no Test::More

It will not compile on Solaris due to the absence of LOCK_? definitions.

All test servers except Gentoo and Mac were provided by SourceForge,
and had a variety of PERL versions ranging from 5.004 to 5.8.5.

Some required manual installation of:

	Test::Harness
	Test::More
	Storable

There are two dependencies whose list entries have yet to be approved:
	Class::Multi
	Class::Attrib

They can be downloaded from my CPAN directory, or from their respective
SourceForge CVS trees. Their UNIX names are: class-multi and
class-attrib.

IPC::Shm::Simple can be checked out from:

CVSROOT=3D":pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net/cvsroot/ipcshm-simple"

module name 'ipcshm-simple'.

To build, 'perl Makefile.PL' etc. as usual.

A release is being considered for the near future.=20
