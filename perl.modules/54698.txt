Since in my experience, Tassilo has been a responsive CPAN contributor, 
I would think this is because his most-published mail address went dead 
and not because he's refusing to help.

I would suggest the following steps with some time in between each:
1) File an RT ticket with this issue.
2) If Tassilo is working with him, try to contact Uri and ask for an 
up-to-date email address. I wasn't able to find one using google, by the 
way.
3) Report back to modules@perl.org and we'll give you co-maintainership 
if and only if Tassilo can't be reached at all.

You'll understand that we aren't keen on transferring modules without 
the authors consent.

Best regards,
Steffen
