[MinimumPerl] attempts to scan files marked as having the "bytes" encoding, which is used as a sign to Dist::Zilla components to "stay out" and treat the file contents as opaque bytes of unknown content.

Apocalypse, are you receiving email notifications?  Are you still interested in maintaining your Perl modules?  I have tried to contact you several times over the last year in other tickets and queues and haven't heard back from you.  If I don't hear anything back soon, I will request maintenance permissions from the PAUSE maintainers, as you wrote some useful code.
