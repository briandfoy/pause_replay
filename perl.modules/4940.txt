It produces lyrics with a correct grammar but with with absolut no 
sense because the words a choosen from a random pool. The pool consists 
of some *.lex with different kind of words (nomen, adjectives...). One 
class are the important mnemonics. A mnemonic look like the following

SUB0002 UND SUB0002 KOM SUB2001 VRB11

and a resulting Sentence may be: Hexen und Teufel, der Weg verweht.

So long... Fuzz
