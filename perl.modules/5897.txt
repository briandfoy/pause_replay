The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attribute::Overload
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Attribute that makes overloading easier
  userid:      MARCEL (Marcel Grunauer)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, vienna.pm and london.pm mailing lists

  similar:
    overload Attribute::Handlers

  rationale:

    The C<Overload> attribute, when used on a subroutine, declares that
    subroutine as handler in the current package for the operation(s)
    indicated by the attribute options. Thus it frees you from the
    implementation details of how to declare overloads and keeps the
    definitions where they belong, with the operation handlers.

    For details of which operations can be overloaded and what the
    overloading function gets passed see the C<overload> manpage.

    Note that you can't overload constants this way, since this has to
    happen during BEGIN time, but attributes are only evaluated at CHECK
    time (at least as far as C<Attribute::Handlers> is concerned).

The resulting entry would be:

Attribute::
::Overload        RdpOp Attribute that makes overloading easier      MARCEL
