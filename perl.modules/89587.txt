The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Wrangler
  DSLIP:       Rdphr
  description: file-manager like metadata handling app
  userid:      CLIPLAND (Clipland)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    github

  similar:

  rationale:

    Ok, this is a request for root-level namespace "Wrangler" ...sigh.

    Why? Well, apart from the distribution's internal directory layout
    (which is ./lib/Wrangler/... and not nested under
    ./lib/App/Wrangler) it would be nice to have a root-level module
    name because Wrangler is a complete application (and was quite an
    effort so far).

    Being aware of the fact that Padre and Kephra, to name only two
    similar sized applications, are older distributions, from back when
    the promotion of the App:: namespace wasn't where it is today, it
    still would be nice to have the root level for Wrangler as well.
    That said, we could promote Wrangler to App::Wrangler any time when
    the App:: namespace has become (more) obligatory.

    What do you think?

    Best regards, ~
