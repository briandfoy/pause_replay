It's not Catalyst that did that.

Frameworks deserve single level names since they aren't providing a
piece of something but the whole thing they intend you to use. How they
do it is just an implementation details.

So far, we haven't really judged names on whether we like them, but
mostly on their clarity and user-friendlyness. Frameworks with long,
nested names are likely to be ignored or misunderstood as peices you
need to integrate, say, like DBIx::Class, into something bigger. 

Frameworks with short names have better branding and user attachment,
and since they aren't designed or conceived as part of some other
hierarchy, lineage, or pedigree, I've been encouraging their use when
appropriate.

As such, I've approved the registration.
