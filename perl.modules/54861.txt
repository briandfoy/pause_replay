Subject: Module submission Web::Beacon

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Web::Beacon
  DSLIP:       bdhhg
  description: A web beacon that creates a log file
  userid:      JEREMIAH (Jeremiah Foster)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The name space choice is directly related to the functionality of
    this project. The goal is to create a web beacon or web bug which
    creates a log file. The log file then gets parsed and turned into a
    pretty report. I have looked fairly carefully on CPAN and seen no
    results for "web bug" or "web beacon." Looking though everything
    with the word "web" revealed a lot of results but still nothing
    similar. The particular usefulness of this method is that it "busts
    the cache" and prevents robots from entering the log.

  enteredby:   JEREMIAH (Jeremiah Foster)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun 13 20:16:21 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Web::
::Beacon          bdhhg A web beacon that creates a log file         JEREMIAH
