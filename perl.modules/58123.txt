It's not, but 0.9.1 < 0.900.0 (see below for why that happened)

In FLAT-0.9.0.tar.gz you used this line in FLAT.pm:

$VERSION = 0.9;

NOTE only a single decimal point; this makes it a floating point version.

In FLAT-0.9.1.tar.gz, on the other hand, you used this:

$VERSION = 0.9.1;

NOTE two decimal points; this a bare v-string, which some code will interpret
correctly as a $VERSION.

You are mixing your version declarations without the magic of version.pm to
protect you.  You should either use floating point versions exclusively or use
extended (multiple decimal places) versions exclusively.

In particular, the conversion between floating point and extended versions works
differently than you might suspect: floating point decimals are split on 3 digit
boundaries for conversion to extended versions, so

	0.9 => 0.900 => 0.900.0

I see that you have already used PAUSE to reset the maximum version, so your new
release is indexed now.  I strongly urge you to install and read the version.pm
POD and convert your modules to using this form:

	use version; $VERSION = qv(9.0.1);

This is guaranteed to work, even if you only give it a single decimal place (qv
forces the extended version mode for you).  This will even work with Perl 5.6.x
(though I see you are limiting yourself to 5.8.0 or better based on your
Makefile.PL).
