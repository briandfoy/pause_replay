I just noticed WWW::SMS namespace was assigned on October 26 to AWRIGLEY http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-10/msg00613.htmlhttp://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-10/msg00613.html

I first asked for a CPAN id on October 17
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-10/msg00509.html

There i say i wanted to provide a new module which development was already in progress as WWW::SMS.
I started discussion on perlmonks.org
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=119116
and on comp.lang.perl.modules
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=SMS&hl=en&group=comp.lang.perl.modules&rnum=2&selm=72074463.0110170423.7e73d117%40posting.google.com
(note that code and interfaces changed a lot from that submission)
On the same day i also started the project on sourceforge.net at http://sourceforge.net/projects/www-sms/
The CVS tree activity is a witness to the work progress
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/www-sms
Now i just can't understand how AWRIGLEY got an authorization for the WWW::SMS namespace. An authorization i also got but sometimes later http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-11/msg00165.html
and that doesn't work cause the namespace is already registered.
So I'd like to have some explanation of what is going on here. I can just blame AWRIGLEY, cause i was the first to write him an e-mail telling him about my project. And a few days later i see he sniffed the namespace i was proposing for!
Anyway my activity as an opensource developer is well documented and i got developers from Bulgaria, Russia, England, France and Finland that are working with me on new submodules.
Please tell me what you think about it.
Thanks.
