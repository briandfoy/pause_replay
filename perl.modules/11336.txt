Dear CPAN/PAUSE Administrators;

I respectfully request access to PAUSE.

I've written a large number of modules over the years for various purposes,
and presented them at Phoenix Perl Mongers with good reception. 
I've read the FAQ carefully, and promise to coordinate my package naming
with authors of modules in those spaces, and to search
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/ before naming or
uploading anything.

As examples of what I wish to upload, I've updated Mmap-0.10.pm to
work on modern Perls, protect against deadly reallocation, offer an OO constructor and tied
interface. To be coordinated with original author.

A system for exposing SQL, HTML, XML, SMTP fragments from a database or
HTML file as functions, allowing tight data and code coupling without
being HTML centric, and allowing data reuse and editing.

Vastly improved FuzzyLogic module, with subclassed combinatrics behavior,
OO, overloaded operators, designed to be useful for real applications instead 
of for demonostration.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
-scott walters
