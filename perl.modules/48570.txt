The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       com::clarify::cbo
  DSLIP:       cdhOg
  description: Interface for Clarify CRM Generic BO's
  userid:      HKAREKAR (hkarekar)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:

  rationale:

    com::clarify::cbo

    Amdocs Clarify CRM is a CRM product
    (http://www.amdocs.com/products.asp?SID=717&ID=626)

    CBO stands for Clarify Business Objects.

    This is what I want to suggest because for a clarify application,
    the way to import in Java is import com.clarify.cbo.* This is the
    package where all the core classes are. I would like to follow the
    same structure in perl too to help easy identification

    License would not be necessary for this because for this to work
    Clarify application has to be installed anyways. So anybody using
    will have a clarify license. We are just exposing clarify generic
    cbo functionality via perl. This is beneficial for any applications
    which may want to use the advantages of perl for processing clarify
    data.

The resulting entry would be:

com::clarify::
::cbo             cdhOg Interface for Clarify CRM Generic BO's       HKAREKAR
