I would like your advice about the naming of a module, especially
with respect to the 11-char limit.

This module will be in Dave Rolsky's DateTime::Calendar domain
and will deal with the French Revolutionary calendar.
I would like to name it
   DateTime::Calendar::French::Revolution
while Dave prefers
   DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolution
or even
   DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary

(see http://datetime.perl.org/developer/
http://archive.develooper.com/datetime@perl.org/msg01612.html
and http://archive.develooper.com/datetime@perl.org/msg01613.html)

Dave's argument to reject my proposal:
- The only French specific calendar was the Revolutionary one.
So, there will never be any other module named:
   DateTime::Calendar::French::Whatever
Therefore, we should keep a 3-level name, not include a superflous
4th level.

My arguments:
- I don't like bicapitalization, and I try to avoid it as much as I can
- In 00modlist.long.html, part 1, paragraph 2.5, it is stated that in
a module name, each level should be 11-char long or smaller.  This is
for compatibility with some OS'es (the 8.3 scheme for MS-DOS and
Win-3.1 and the 14-char limit for very old Unix; some other case?)

Dave would deny this argument with the following ones:
- The 11-char limit is obsolete. Computers still running MS-DOS or
an old Unix are a rarity. They do not (cannot) support the latest
versions of Perl. The people running them know there is a big lot
of software they cannot run, and my module will just be one among
many.
- If people running very old computers still want to install my module,
all they have to do is to rename a single file and then to change the
name of the package wherever it occurs, not forgetting MANIFEST (a
fine task with EDLIN... well, maybe they can use Perl instead)
- There are already a few modules with elements longer than 11 chars.
I have looked in 00modlist.long.html part 2 and I have found
examples. There is a=20
    PostScript::PrinterFontMetrics
module with a 18-char element, with runners-up
    Algorithm::Graphs::TransitiveClosure
    Tk::ChildNotification
    PostScript::ISOLatin1Encoding
    HTTP::SimpleLinkChecker
(well, it seems I work harder defending Dave's point of view
than mine :-)

So is this 11-char limit still in force or is it obsolete?
