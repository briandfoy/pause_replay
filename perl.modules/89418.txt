Request to register new user

fullname: Alexey Sergeevich Shatrov
  userid: ASHATROV
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.ashatrov.ru
     why:

    I have made a package that helps authorize users via many social
    networks as a single interface. Before it was a problem, when a
    perl-programmer has has to read alot of documentation of many social
    network systems or use thirty-part services like loginza.
