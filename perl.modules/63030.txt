Hi!

= license

Simple things first. :) While I can live with Standard-Perl license,
I usually prefer to release my work in Public Domain. Is it allowed on
CPAN? If allowed, then which one license I should choose in 'Register
Namespace' - distribution_allowed?


= POWER::Utils

Now about name spaces. Right now I've about 30 modules in my local CPAN
overlay (http://powerman.name/perl/overlay.html), more than 250 files
(counting all versions). I mostly used top level POWER:: name space for
them, to avoid clashing with CPAN modules. Now, to upload them to CPAN,
I have to rename them.

Not all modules deserve to be uploaded, of course - for example there some
modules with unsorted utility functions, which probably doesn't really
useful for other people. Example: POWER::Utils. But problem is, most
other, much more useful, modules _use_ these modules with utility functions.

How to handle this issue in best way? Inline required functions from
POWER::Utils to other modules? Try to release POWER::Utils to CPAN in some
way under some obscure name? Create top level POWER:: category and upload
all modules as is?


= WITH

I've fresh module, which was developed with CPAN in mind (i.e. it doesn't
use POWER::Utils :-)). But I've no idea how to name it to fit CPAN
structure anyway. I have uploaded WITH-0.0.2.tar.gz to PAUSE, as it
recommended, but doesn't tried to 'Register Namespace' for it yet.

This module has unusual interface (somewhat similar to pragma or source
filters, but not exactly).

WITH give you ability to define values for some other module's constants
when loading it with 'use'. This needed to allow hardcore optimizations
to allow perl to optimize away some constructions based on constant values.
Without WITH it's possible to get same effect with environment variables:

  package Some::Module;
  use constant DEBUG => $ENV{PERL_SOME_MODULE_DEBUG};
  if (DEBUG) { ... } # optimize me away if possible, please

  package main;
  BEGIN {
      $ENV{PERL_SOME_MODULE_DEBUG} = 1;
  }
  use Some::Module qw(:ALL);

but that's ugly. WITH used this way:

  package main;
  use Some::Module WITH => { DEBUG => 1 }, qw(:ALL);

What's recommended name for WITH module?


P.S. How to subscribe to this list to get replies? Or I already subscribed
(after creating PAUSE account)? Or only way to get replies is read archive
