Ick - I wish you'd have answered the last once or twice I tried to register
the namespace - I just uploaded the thing this time.  Oh well.  We'll just
change it.  As to your question:

The library can be best classified as a weak OO persistence tool, or perhaps
even a cross between a persistence tool and an RDBMS OO mapper.  It's
somewhat different than tangram as instead of starting with an object and
configuration file and mapping that to the database, the library is designed
to be subclassed and the subclasses mapped to an existing data source (not
necessarily a RDBMS).  Each subclass defines its database, and overloads the
SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE methods.  Relationships are provided
internally, and while data-integrity (the smae tangram idea of "one instance
in memory at a time) is planned, it's not yet implemented.

The main difference is that it's not meant to be used as a end-tool, but
rather as a framework to creating a custom persistence layer to be used by
the application by subclassing it.  This differs from the other frameworks
avaialable, which are generally intended to be used directly by the final
application.

A presentation I did on the idea behind the library is avaailable at
http://epoch.jct.ac.il/YAPC/

I'd appreciate input on both the library, and the new namespace to give it.

Thanks!
  Issac
