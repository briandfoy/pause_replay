I've already written applying for a namespace to place this in, but I'd
like to run my module by the group.

I am working on a suite of modules for TIBCO software's TIB/Rendezvous
Messaging Middleware tools.  These are heavily used in B2B transactions to
send messages from one place to another.  Working in the financial sector,
I use TIB/RV to communicate with Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and
several other major firms; to this end I've developed some sets of modules
to do TIB/RV in perl, which I'm looking to release under the Artistic
License.

The core group of modules are rewrites of the badly done 'example' XS
bindings to perl that ship with TIBCO.  These provide basic interfacing to
TIB/RV's C API.  I've rewritten these for some optimisation and
enhancements.  At a base level, some perl users who know the C API may
prefer to use these to talk to TIB/RV.

For those who don't know TIB/RV C, or just want something simpler, I'm
working on a suite of abstraction layers to let perl users easily monitor,
manipulate, and interact with TIB/RV anywhere from a basic to an advanced
way depending on needs.

I would be looking (based on my 'correction of module submission') to
place these within a Messaging::TIBCO (or maybe MessagingMiddleware::TIBCO
or Middleware::TIBCO based on what is best for CPAN) namespace.

I'm hoping the module list maintainers have some thoughts on this
moduleset.
