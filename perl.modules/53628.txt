Elections:: is a top-level namespace I wish to avoid.  Not all voting is
used for electoral purposes.  Indeed, my own use of ranked pairs is to
determine the ordering of images in a set from most appealing to least
appealing.

I like Voting::Condorcet::RankedPairs.  ;)

I feel that anything except for Algorithm::Vote:: is an abuse of the
Algorithm namespace.  There are lots of voting systems, and I feel it's
necessary we have some place for them to be grouped.  That's particularly
important when some of them have names that could easily result in
confusion; the purpose of Voting::Ranged is pretty clear, but
Algorithm::Ranged isn't.

Is it evil for us to open a Voting:: top-level?

Cheerio,

	Paul
