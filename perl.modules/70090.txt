The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::RU::Inflect
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Inflect russian names
  userid:      SHOORICK (Александр Сапожников)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    I don't know right now

  similar:
    Lingua::RU::Sklon

  rationale:

    Declension of words (and declension of given names too) is popular
    task for russian developers.

    Many of them wrote own modules for this task, but CPAN contains 1
    of them: Lingua::RU::Sklon which have wrong name based on russian
    word, Lingua::RU::Sklon uses bad identifiers and constants (sklon,
    pads, IMEN, TVOR) based on shortened russian words too, default
    encoding of Lingua::RU::Sklon is CP1251 (not UTF-8).

    I plan to make module which will decline various russian words, now
    my module can decline only given names and it can denect gender by
    name. Declension of russian given names is similar with declension
    of common nouns and adjectives: I plan to extend functionality of
    module to decline common words too.

    Russian word "skloneniye" translated as "declension", but some
    linguistic modules for other languages named Lingua::*::Inflect (*
    == EN, FI, PT). May be Lingua::RU::Inflect is good name for my
    module?

  enteredby:   SHOORICK (Александр Сапожников)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb 25 18:34:31 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::RU::
::Inflect         Rdpfp Inflect russian names                        SHOORICK
