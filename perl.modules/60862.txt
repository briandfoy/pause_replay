The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Iterator::File
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: File iterator, optionally stateful & verbose
  userid:      WREARDON (William Reardon)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    wdr1@pobox.com

  similar:
    Iterator Class::Iterator File::Iterator

  rationale:

    The objective was to take some of the tedium & repetition over
    processing flat files, especially large/long-running one. It can be
    optionally stateful (e.g., if the process terminates, it can pick up
    where the prior run left off automatically), report status in a
    variety of ways (i.e., every X lines, every X seconds, or
    logarithmically), and do other things such as auto-chomp, etc.

    State can be managed via a temp file or shared memory.

    An OO interface is provide, as well as one that uses overload
    (e.g., making things such as $i++ viable).

The resulting entry would be:

Iterator::
::File            Rdphp File iterator, optionally stateful & verbose WREARDON
