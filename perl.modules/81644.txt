     why:

    Reading "Intermediate Perl" (2nd Edition) I was told to do so when
    I came across exercise number one ;-)

    Actually I am reading this book to learn more about creating
    distributions. Currently I am planning to create a distribution
    belonging to the App namespace. It will contain an interactive tool
    I have written that deals with sending "wake-on-LAN-signals" to
    hosts.

    Greetings, Stefan Oberwahrenbrock
