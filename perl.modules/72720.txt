Roland,

I had previously asked for access to IO::Stty, assuming Austin was the
owner so I could put some fixes in place to the module. Pause admins
helped me out when Austin had trouble getting pause access and also
gave me IO::Tty access which I didn't have access to. After releasing
a dev release for IO::Tty, I just realized I never asked for or was
granted by you access to release fixes for this module. I'm sorry for
the confusion and the pre-mature release.

That said, if you're ok with me continuing to have access, I've picked
up and worked 4 tickets and rolled them into a dev release. They'll be
on CPAN shortly and testers can help us validate that they work as
expected. I just found your svn repo and if you want to give me commit
bits on source forge (todd_rinaldo), I can port my github history over
there.

Again I'm sorry this happend and hope I didn't step on any toes with
the release. Let me know and we'll make it right.
