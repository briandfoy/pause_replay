Why is this namespace unavailable?  The one person who had something
in it had it there by accident and has since removed it.


The namespace has been available for the asking for the past several
years if anyone wanted it, yet no one bothered to ask the accidental
holder of this namespace if they meant to use it (they didn't).

I thought this established a pretty clear cut case for not really caring
about the namespace other than for casual or decorative reasons.

As I stated, I'd be more than happy to negotiate if they wanted
to use the namespace if they'd be willing to pick up a fairly
stable set of what has been 5 functions for the past 2-3 years.

Can this be fixed/addressed?
