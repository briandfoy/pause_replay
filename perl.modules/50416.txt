It's a good address because here are the people who have admin access
to PAUSE.

In the ideal case you write to the author a friendly email in which
you offer to take over maintainance and CC this email to
modules@cpan.org. Then let enough time pass to give the author a
chance to get better or come back from vacation or set up connectivity
after moving to a new country or whatever.

In the email try to sum up the situation and explain how urgent the
case is. If you can find more email addresses of the author than the
CPAN indexes provide, please use all of them in the To field, maybe
the author does not receive mail for some of the addresses. If you
have opened a ticket on rt.cpan.org (which is always a good idea, so
other potential maintainers know about your plans), CC the ticket
address.

If no answer comes after a few weeks write us again and ask for
maintainance transfer. Make this second request as visible as the
first one, so the author has a chance to see it.

You can search through the modules@ traffic at
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules to find other cases
where maintainership was (or was not) transferred.
