It is true there is no *module* PerlPoint::Package, but the namespace is
used for the *distribution* PerlPoint::Package with several modules
(PerlPoint::Parser, PerlPoint::Backend, PerlPoint::Generator and more)
for which there were about 40 releases so far.. This might be comparable
to the libwww and libnet distributions which are not named like a module.

The distribution contains the basic parts of the PerlPoint framework. As
there is no main module that could be used to name the entire
distribution I suggest to stay with the established name.

Thank you for your work

                          Jochen Stenzel
