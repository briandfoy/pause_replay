The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::UncertainGeometry
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Statistical Geometric Reasoning in 2D and 3D
  userid:      HEUEL (Stephan Heuel)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    perl-ai, comp.lang.modules comp.lang.modules.moderated

  similar:
    Math::Geometry

  rationale:

    Approach --------

    This is a geometrical toolbox for constructing and testing points,
    lines, planes and transformations in 2D and 3D. The toolbox is based
    on projective geometry and a simple but effective uncertainty model,
    though one can use the tool without statistics.

    Representing uncertainty is useful if you are not 100% sure about
    the exact values of your points, lines and planes. For example if
    you measure the length of your notebook with a simple ruler, you
    might be sure about your measurement up to a tenth of a millimeter,
    but definitely not up to - say - Angstrom (=1 hundred-millionth of a
    centimeter); comparing length requires comparing uncertainty, too:
    do I compare within Angstrom or Millimiter?. And this gets even more
    complicated as soon as you do constructions with 3D lines, points,
    projective cameras etc.

    Namespace Discussion --------------------

    One could call the module Math::FuzzyGeometry, too - but I have the
    objection that this reminds of "Fuzzy Logic", which is not
    Statistics (as used in this module).

    Another option would be Math::UncertainProjectiveGeometry, but this
    is way too long, IMHO.

    As a personal side note, I'd vote for a Geometry:: root level on
    its own, which could be used by people from Computational Geometry
    and Computer Graphics, both huge fields of interest. Lots of
    geometric algorithms are outthere!
