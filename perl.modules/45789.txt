Welcome John Kristoff,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

    JTK

Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

  Name:      John Kristoff
  email:     CENSORED

  enteredby: Johan Vromans

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
if you want to protect yourself from SPAM. If you want to do this,
please visit
  https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred
or

If you need any further information, please visit

Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team
