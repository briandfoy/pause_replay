The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::WxM2
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Device driver - Davis Weather Mon. 2 station
  userid:      MMABRY (Mark Mabry)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a device driver, so I'm suggesting that it go in the Device
    section. There is a device driver for another kind of weather
    station, and it is in the Device level.

  enteredby:   MMABRY (Mark Mabry)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 23 15:34:48 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::WxM2            bdpOg Device driver - Davis Weather Mon. 2 station MMABRY
