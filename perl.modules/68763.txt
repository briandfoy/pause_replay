The point of a co-maint bit is that you can revoke it if they get it wrong.

I'm a little tired of listening to the "trust" meme. Nobody using FCGI.pm
even thinks you're maintaining it - the community holds no trust whatsoever
and only because I've been running round saying "hey, no, he's still here,
we're working with him" have people not forked it already.

Abandoning it would be fine; CPAN already has a means to deal with those
and assign new maintainers.

Right now, by -not- abandoning it the only thing you're achieving is
continuing to delay fixes getting to CPAN.

All of the people involved in this conversation use this stuff in production
on a daily basis. Except so far as I'm aware, you - since you've already said
you haven't done fastcgi stuff in some time.

The easiest solution for us, as interested users who already maintain lots
of code atop FCGI.pm and have worked round various things at a significant
cost in time, would be to fork it. The second easiest would be for you to
abandon it and then the PAUSE admins can reassign maintainership to one of us.

We're actually working through the hardest of all solutions because we're
aware that when you were working on this you did solid work and we don't want
to simply ignore your effort and contributions to the community.

If you don't care anymore, please just abandon the module.

If you do care, please can we sort out something more effective than "send
me patches in email and I might release this year" ?

The Catalyst community already took over FCGI::ProcManager; right now FCGI.pm
is the weakest link in the best practice production stack for perl web
applications.

Please can we try and find a better way to move forwards on this?
