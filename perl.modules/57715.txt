Hi Luke,

I know that you got the suggestion for this name on Perlmonks, but Dave
Rolsky, the maintainer of most of the DateTime stuff, requests that
people talk to him about DateTime additions first. You might want to
post to the datetime@perl.org mailing list too.

One of the problems here is that DateTime has a particular idea about
date math which your module won't follow (see the comments in
DateTime::Duration for instance).

Time::Fuzzy sounds like a better name, although it is already taken. A
number of seconds is a good a time value as anything else, it just
isn't a *time of day*.  I think this belongs in the Time::* namespace
somewhere. It doesn't handle dates, so it's not thinking about half of
DateTime.

Thanks and good luck,
