The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAP::Clean
  DSLIP:       adpOd
  description: For exposing legacy appls as web services
  userid:      STODGHIL (Paul Stodghill)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    SOAP::Lite

  rationale:

    SOAP::Lite attempts to integerate web services functionality into
    Perl. Remote services are exposed as Perl functions or methods and
    remote data types are transliterated into Perl datatypes.

    SOAP::Clean, on the other hand, is designed to quickly and easily
    expose existing applications as web services. It also provides
    client tools for using web services in a "batch-oriented" manner.

    SOAP::Clean has been developed as part of a NSF-funded project on
    adapative software. It provides a framework for turning a set of
    pre-existing codes running at different institutions into an
    integrated, distributed computational science application.
