Hi, Franck.

I can help you out.  You need to show me that your new email address
is associated with a public profile that is recognizably you.  Ideally
one that shows your Perl identity.

One typical option people have used lately is sending me a LinkedIn
invitation.

I have a party all day tomorrow so probably won't be able to actually
sort this out until later in the weekend even once you send me some
evidence.

Regards,
David Golden, PAUSE Admin for IDs
