Subject: Tidying up CPAN author directories [FROGGS, GARU, JTPALMER,

Hi Tobias, Jeffrey, Kartik, Garu,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that =
we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master. This is =
caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author =
directories. So we=E2=80=99ve identified the authors who can free up the =
most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

You all have old versions of SDL in your author directories, and given =
the size of an SDL release, purging all the old ones will release a good =
chunk of diskspace. Tobias has all the recent releases, so maybe the =
rest of you can delete all releases from your author directory?

And while you=E2=80=99re there, old releases of other dists could be =
tidied up too :-)

There are at least 3 ways we can make this happen:

1. you could use the script here: =
https://gist.github.com/xdg/1739bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38
2. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
3. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

The script mentioned in (1) was written by David Golden and Rik Signes. =
It keeps all developer releases later than a stable release, keeps up to =
3 stable releases, and deletes everything else. Use at your own risk, of =
course. Jeffrey, Garu, and Kartik: even if you use the script, please =
consider deleting all SDL releases in your directory, unless there=E2=80=99=
s some reason to keep one of them around?

If you give me permission, I would delete everything other than the =
latest release for anything older than a year, and 3 releases of =
anything less than a year old. When marked for deletion, you=E2=80=99d =
have 3 days to check and revert anything you=E2=80=99re not happy with, =
before PAUSE would actually delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil
