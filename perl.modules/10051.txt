The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Golf
  DSLIP:       idpOa
  description: Utilities to run and judge Perl Golf games.
  userid:      BOOK (Philippe "BooK" Bruhat)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    fwp@perl.org, CVS repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    The game of Perl golf is becoming increasingly popular. Perlmonks
    runned some, The Perl Review #0 runs one, the Fun with Perl
    mailing-list has run several in a few months, with great success.

    Until now, the judge have had to write extensive test programs to
    check and score the players entries. And they probably did the
    leaderboard by hand.

    This module aim to provide an easy way to prepare Perl golf
    contest, by writing a little configuration file and writing the test
    programs as .t files.

    The included scripts will do all the work of testing a player's
    individual entries, and doing all the hard scoring and testing stuff
    for the judge. Methods to compute statistics, leaderboards are also
    provided.

    A GUI is also planned.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::Golf            idpOa Utilities to run and judge Perl Golf games.  BOOK
