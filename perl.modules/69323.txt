     why:

    Have used perl since 1996 on AIX, Unix, Linux, Windows... Have
    written some system admin perl utilities that might help other perl
    users. Nothing fancy, but they work.

    In the last 5 years, I have stopped writing "C" and shell code, and
    do all cgi, data base, etc. programming in pure perl. The
    performance improvements in the newer versions of perl have just
    been amazing. Hope my scripts can help.
