Encode::FixLatin looks promising. I wasn't aware of that. Actually, my code
was a non-modular script from late 2006, and I thought it useful to convert
it to a module. Grant McLeans started much later :-)

Au contraire! The guessing is the interesting part. My return value 
is nice statistics about the mixture.

But from a first glance, Encode::FixLatin does the right thing.  
It even was motivated by the same problem: Text data in Postgresql. :-)

Thanks for the Pointer!
I retract my submission.
