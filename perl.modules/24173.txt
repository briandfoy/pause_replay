I've found some bugs in Data::Compare, and would like to take over
maintenance of the module so I can fix 'em.  I have a patched version
ready to go just as soon as I am allowed to upload it.  I will, of
course, be happy to hand maintenance back to the original author if he
ever shows up again.

The original author has not responded to email for a couple of months
now.  Nor has he responded when I posted in comp.lang.perl.misc and
comp.lang.perl.modules asking for him to contact me.  And when I posted
to his local perl mongers mailing list, someone there told me that he'd
forwarded my message on to him - but no response.

The bugs are:

Inappropriate use of /o on a pattern match which has an interpolated
  variable in it, and which should be reinterpolated each time;
Breaks when data structures contain Scalar::Properties objects

Also someone else has mentioned a potential bug with how it handles
references to references to (scalars|arrays|hashes) although I haven't
confirmed this myself, I just told him "patches welcome".

Despite all its complexity, fuzziness, uncertainty and spooky action-
at-a-distance, quantum mechanics is probably a Good Thing.  However, I
must also note that QM permits Microsoft Windows to exist
