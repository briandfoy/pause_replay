I'm just ignoring SKI, and I'd hate to close down PAUSE to anyone, but
I can see the case if he doesn't at least respond to Adam's comments.

We've been much more active about responding to inappropiate behaviour
and locking down things (where means "we" means Andreas doing the real
locking down), but let's also be careful that we don't get drunk with
power and start responding to lesser offenses similarly.
