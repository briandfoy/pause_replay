Subject: Module submission Devel::Trace::Method
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, steveb@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Trace::Method
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Follow and track method call interaction.
  userid:      STEVEB (Steve Bertrand)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    will set up a mailing list, and within the git repo

  similar:
    Devel::TraceMethods Debug::Trace

  rationale:

    After three years of putting it off, I feel I just need to get
    *something* up on the CPAN. The code from this module came out of a
    very large project I wrote years ago, and have recently been using
    it as a standalone library within other projects.

    Although relatively basic in the functionality as of yet, I do have
    a lot of plans for it, and just want to get up my first project :)

    My module allows an object to track its own method calls from
    within, while the data is stored outside of itself.

  enteredby:   STEVEB (Steve Bertrand)
  enteredon:   Fri Mar  2 23:45:13 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::Trace::
::Method          adphp Follow and track method call interaction.    STEVEB
