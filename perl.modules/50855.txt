Can we blow this thing away before the RT queues and all that get
created?  I didn't realize the name of the tarball became the name of
the dist, I just thought it had to be !the same as the other release :/ 
(In fact, the indexer guessed the name of the dist just fine.)

I'll upload 0.02 to replace this.

Regards,
Jonathan Rockway
