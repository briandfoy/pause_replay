Hi all,

While working with Dan Sugalski's mail_attach.pl script, I found several
file-name suffixes missing.  I added them and sent back a new script to
Dan, but I also thought that the big hash in the program might make a
good module.

I've discussed this a bit with Dan and come up with an idea of providing
a default map/hash, then have OS-specific maps overriding definitions in
the main map.  The main interface would be a subroutine that takes a file
name or suffix and returns the MIME type and its "customary" encoding
method.

My proposed name is MIME::Types.

Comments and suggestions?

Thanks,
Jeff
