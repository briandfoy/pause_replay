    More precisely, only to people who do business with Lloyds TSB.
That group will probably include expats, world travellers, and a few
businesses.

    I just waded through it before posting this response, and I didn't
find it onerous.  If I were looking to do IPC to, e.g., my fictional
HSBC account, I would have found the module I wanted in about 10
seconds.

    I don't find the naming convention so terrible, but the lack of
standard interface is certainly daunting.  Renaming modules won't
improve that situation, though . . . .

    Lingua::Foo doesn't mean it's only _of interest_ to citizens of
Foobria; it means it's only _applicable_ to texts written in Foobric.
This seems to me to be the same sort of distinction that exists
among the Finance::Bank modules.

    I think the country codes are counterproductive.  What if Lloyds TSB
opens a branch in Ottawa?
