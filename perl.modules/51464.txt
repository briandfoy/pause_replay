One does not associate files with the mailing list ID, one associates
modules with it. So the respective owners of namespaces (I suppose
this is only Ewan) go to PAUSE and click "View Permissions" to see
their own permissions. Then they click on "Change Permissions" and
pass all their modules to BIOPERLML. To verify that it did work, they
click "View Permissions" again and should now have "co-maint" status.

This procedure has to be repeated whenever somebody becomes primary
maintainer of a namespace by uploading.

Fear not: if a namespace is forgotten, everything can be repaired
after the next upload.

As soon as BIOPERLML owns the maintainership, one of the managers of
the group ID (this means you!) go to the "Change permissions" page and
make the next uploader comaintainer. The uploader uploads and receives
a mail about success or failure.

If the mail complains about permissions then somebody has forgotten
one step above. Then the respective owners of permissions do their
work and finally the uploader uses the "Force Reindexing" page on
PAUSE to get a new mail from the indexer.

No, it was already there but I had my eyes dirty or something:)
