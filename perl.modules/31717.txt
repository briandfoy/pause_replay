     why:

    What I'm planning to contribute:

    * misc small syntactic extensions I have made for myself, e.g. my
    own preferred version of a 'throw' function

    * some slightly larger extensions, e.g. _yet another_ OO perl
    helper module - my one makes class and instance data inaccessible
    and offers implementations of 'private' and 'protected' class
    members

    * (still just an early prototype but...) I have some ideas for a
    perl app-server framework; have looked at what's available, think I
    can create something different - more flexible and general-purpose
    perhaps
