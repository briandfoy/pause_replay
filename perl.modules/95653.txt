Subject: Tidying up your CPAN author directory

Hi Taniguchi-san,

    Summary: please delete old CPAN releases from your author directory


I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that =
we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master[*]. This is =
caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author =
directories. So we=E2=80=99ve identified the authors who can free up the =
most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

Your CPAN directory has a lot of old releases of Number-ZipCode-JP:
   http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TA/TANIGUCHI/
Deleting all of the old releases could free up nearly 90M. Note that =
everything you=E2=80=99ve ever released to CPAN will always be available =
in your BackPAN directory:
   http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/T/TA/TANIGUCHI/

You could also delete old releases of other dists in your directory, =
like Number-Phone-JP for example.


There are at least 3 ways we can make this happen:

1. you could use the script here: =
https://gist.github.com/xdg/1739bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38
2. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
3. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

The script mentioned in (1) was written by David Golden and Rik Signes. =
It keeps all developer releases later than a stable release, keeps up to =
3 stable releases, and deletes everything else. Use at your own risk, of =
course.

If you give me permission, I would delete everything other than the =
latest release for anything older than a year, and 3 releases of =
anything less than a year old. When marked for deletion, you=E2=80=99d =
have 3 days to check and revert anything you=E2=80=99re not happy with, =
before PAUSE would actually delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil

[*] This is a temporary problem, which will eventually be resolved with =
more diskspace, but in the meantime we need to help out the NOC by =
freeing up some space.=
