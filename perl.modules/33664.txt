I'm aware of the closure of the Accessible Odeon website at the above URL,
that's what inspired me to write this module.

IANAL but my impression was that the Dracos site was closed down because
it emulated the look and feel of the real Odeon site too closely -- even
down to apparently having a credit card number submission form on the site
on the booking page. It doesn't seem to have been closed down simply
because it was screenscraping Odeon's site.

However at the end of the day, my WWW::Odeon module is merely a wrapper
around LWP::Simple and a little extra parsing code. The www.odeon.co.uk
site has nothing to indicate that robots may not retrieve data from their
site -- there is no /robots.txt and nothing in any Terms & Conditions that
I could find. Redisplay on a public website of the screenscraped data
*might* conceivably be something that they could get upset about, but as
WWW::Odeon merely returns data structures, not output, that's irrelevant.

If the lawyers come for me, I shall deal with them myself. I find it
extremely hard to believe that they would come for CPAN, too.
