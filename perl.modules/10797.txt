Project description:
	I am creating a Perl script interpreter that uses the XML format. So
far I have included the basic script 	constructs: variables, flow control,
basic utilities (chdir, math, etc.), and user defined functions. It has
built-in handling of ftp and email. Job logging will be automatic.
