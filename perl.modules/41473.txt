The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::RecordDeduper
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Remove duplicate records from a text file
  userid:      KIMRYAN (Kim Ryan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::RecordParser

  rationale:

    A standard part of the data cleansing process is to detect and
    remove duplicated records. Utilities currently exist to do just this
    in several database and data warehousing products.

    A duplicates can be defined by the user as an entire line of text
    or one of more fields, or partial fields within the line.
    Additionally the fields can be case insensitive. Aliases can be
    created so that 'Bob Smith' is classed a duplicate of 'Robert
    Smith'.

    Text records will typically be in CSV or fixed width format, but a
    record could also span several lines.

    Future extensions could include fuzzy matching.

The resulting entry would be:
