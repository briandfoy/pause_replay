All,

This module is based on DBI, but it doesn't include all of DBI's
features, so I was lazily branding it for MySQL only. The missing
features are for parameterized queries (although part of the code is
there, but I actually took that out some years back and have been
working with the lighter version for so long that it was my preferred
form). I do have the original version, but with so many "DBI" wrappers,
I thought the MySQL focus might actually be attractive. The original
version has been used against MySQL and Oracle.

IMHO, this module is for the casual perl hacker. I know most of you are
perl gurus (and me too), but most of my students/clients/colleagues are
biologists, and "abstract" or "general" doesn't do them any favors
(which is why this module is procedural (and fully documented) and not
"upgraded" to OO). :}

Shall I rebuild/resubmit for DBIx::MySperql?

Must I rebuild it for "all DBI" and rename it?

Any suggestion appreciated.

Thanks,

Roger



Thanks!

Roger

DBI extension modules live in DBIx::*

Also, is this speciically only for MySQL? It's DBI, so can the same
thing work for other servers?
