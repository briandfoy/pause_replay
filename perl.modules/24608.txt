02packages is still listing Compress::Bzip2 1.00.  This module is four years
old and appears to no longer work with current bzip2 libraries.  The
author, AZEMGI, has never posted an update and appears to be awol.

1.01 was posted back in 2001 by another author, ZOOVY.  It was never listed 
in 02packages because the original author never gave out ownership.

1.02 was posted last July by yet another author, KCARNUT.  Again, its not 
indexed because the original author never gave away ownership.

There are a number of complaints about Compress::Bzip2 which stem from the
fact that users are downloading 1.00.  I would like to be able to make a
dependency on the module and get the latest version.  I'd say after AZEMGI 
being inactive for four years and ZOOVY inactive for two that they're not 
coming back.  

Could we have some sort of orderly transfer of ownership to KCARNUT so the 
latest version gets indexed?

If God made anything more guerrila than your breast, I hope he kept it for
your father.
