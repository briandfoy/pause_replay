The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SIAM
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: Service Inventory Abstraction Model
  userid:      SSINYAGIN (Stanislav Sinyagin)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://github.com/ssinyagin/SIAM

  similar:

  rationale:

    SIAM (Service Inventory Abstraction Model) is designed to speak to
    an ISP's or other Enterprise's proprietary service inventory
    database, and present its data in a standardized and uniform way.
    This will allow to save costs in integrating other open-source
    software with the proprietary inventory systems.

    Currently the API and a reference dataset, alongside with the test
    suite, are ready. A commercial project with real-life data will
    start within a month. It will integrate Torrus software with the
    ISP's internal inventory database.

    SIAM object model and API are designed to be extensible, so
    third-party contributions will be welcome within the SIAM name
    space. Also some open-minded enterprises may be willing to publish
    their SIAM drivers, which would be most probably under SIAM name
    space.

    The package is distributed under MIT license, as its primary
    purpose is to work in enterprise environments as part of the
    enterprise software suite -- therefore GNU GPL would be too
    restrictive.

  enteredby:   SSINYAGIN (Stanislav Sinyagin)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr  4 18:32:49 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SIAM              adpOo Service Inventory Abstraction Model          SSINYAGIN
