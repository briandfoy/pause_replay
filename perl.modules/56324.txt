From: jeffreykegler@mac.com (Jeffrey Kegler)

Initially I confused myself with the ticket you (I hope it was you!)  
create.  It had expired by the time I tried to use it.  After some  
thought (and, in desperation, actually reading the error message), I  
realized all I had to do was create myself a new ticket.  I did so,  
and all has been smooth sailing.

I've added Parse::Marpa, and hidden the original Marpa.  Marpa would  
be a dubious choice for a first-level namespace if I were submitting  
it today.  It was created when nobody thought to worry about Perl  
module namespace issues.  As Marpa is unlikely to be wanted for any  
other purpose, and may come in useful someday, my thought is to keep  
it reserved, but hidden.

PAUSE, now that I get to see it, is really a very nice tool.

thanks, jeffrey kegler
