Subject: Module submission File::KeePass
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, rhandom@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::KeePass
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to KeePass database files
  userid:      RHANDOM (Paul Seamons)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Internal work discussions

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    I choose the namespace File::KeePass because it is
    reading/writing/manipulation of KeePass db files - an alternate name
    could've been Data::KeePass. I think either would be appropriate.

    There are no other KeePass modules. At the moment this module only
    does v1 databases, but will eventually do v2 databases as well.

  enteredby:   RHANDOM (Paul Seamons)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 29 14:25:17 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::KeePass         RdpOp Interface to KeePass database files          RHANDOM
