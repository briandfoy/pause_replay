I have created Term::Prompt 0.12. I do not own Term::Prompt. I am on
the list of people who have patched it in the past. I get about an
email a week from people who have patched the 0.11 at CPAN. I keep
handing out my 0.12. I have contacted the author a number of times
over the past few months with no response. What's the protocol for
uploading 0.12 when I am not the owner-of-record for the module?
Yes,  I already have a CPAN/PAUSE id.
