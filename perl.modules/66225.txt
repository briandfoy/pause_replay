It's been a good long while since I've done any work on this, but I'm
gearing up to start again.

I don't think I heard any word back on whether the namespace choice
was kosher, so I guess this is the same query to the DateTime folks,
et al.

Either way I'd like to find a place that it can fit.

Thanks,

Brian
