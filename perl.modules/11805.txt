Hello!

Thanks for your time.

I've written Perl bindings for FreeType 2 and would
like to share.

Name: Andrew Robertson
Email: critter_75075@yahoo.com
Homepage: in pieces
Username: CAFFIEND (prefered) (last name is too long,
mabye just use ANDY or ANDREW)
Contribution: FONT::FT2, wrappers and shortcuts for
using Freetype Two to render text.  Already written is
render character, render table, render string, rotate,
scale, etc....

I did not see Imager:: until FONT::FT2 was functional.
 But, FONT::FT2 is biased more towards the text end
and less towards graphics.

Thanks!
    andy
