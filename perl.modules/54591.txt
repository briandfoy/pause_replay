     why:

    I used to use Eric Cholet's Dirwatch, there were some flaws in its
    operation for my purposes. Also he has completely rewritten it using
    moose amongst other things. This was a pain last time i had to
    install. So i rewrote his old version tailored to my use. I added
    more features, included using Glob instead of dirhandle, while
    keeping the functionality compatible with DirWatch 0.02 users. I
    hope to keep this project going in its own path that differes from
    the new DirWatch::Object. It will be called GlobWatch. I also hope
    to add more to cpan as time goes on. I have only just learnt perl
    since Jan and really enjoying working with it
