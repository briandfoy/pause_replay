The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::SQLEngine
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Extends DBI with high-level operations
  userid:      EVO (Matthew Simon Cavalletto)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:
    DBIx::SearchBuilder DBIx::Easy DBIx::Portable DBIx::Recordset

  rationale:

    This is the most recent version of a collection of libraries that
    I've used over the last several years to develop business data
    applications and object-relational mapping toolkits.

    Its goal is to simplify dynamic query execution with the following
    capabilities: * Data-driven SQL: Ad-hoc generation of SQL statements
    from Perl data structures in a variety of formats. * High-Level
    Interface: Standard operations are handled by a single method call
    each. Error handling is standardized. * Full API Access:
    Pass-through arbitrary SQL and allow access to entire DBI API for
    cases when high-level interfaces are insufficient or inconvenient. *
    Portability: Dynamic subclassing (via DBIx::AnyDBD) to allow
    platform-specific support for driver idiosyncrasies and DBMS
    workarounds.

    The DBIx namespace seems to have emerged as the standard place for
    modules like this.

The resulting entry would be:
