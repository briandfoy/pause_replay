Subject: Module submission Attanium
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, vanamburg@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Attanium
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A medium-weight web/db framework.
  userid:      VANAMBURG (Gordon Van Amburg)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Application Titanium

  rationale:

    This is a web framework based on CGI-App similar to Titanium, but
    with a different focus. Attanium puts more focus on developer
    productivity and standardization of project strucuture, while
    maintaining adequate performance under CGI for moderate use apps.

    In the words of Mark Stosberg:

    "Titanium is just one vision of what can be built on top of
    CGI::Application. Someone else could easily combine their own
    combination of CGI::Application and different favorite plugins, and
    publish that with a different name."

    Attanium is one more vision.

  enteredby:   VANAMBURG (Gordon Van Amburg)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep 17 15:53:55 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Attanium          bdpOp A medium-weight web/db framework.            VANAMBURG
