     why:

    I am involved in several areas of development. First and foremost,
    I'm currently developing PERL modules for use by our huge number of
    clients. I'm part of the technical staff put together to support a
    state-wide library automation project. This project has proven to be
    the largest-scale library automation project on the planet involving
    over 2000 libraries. The automation software we use is copyrighted
    and provides very strict rules regarding the distribution of it's
    code but does allow some configuration and feature enhancements
    through PERL.

    In particular, the use of Z39.50 communication protocol, is where
    my interest lies.

    I am also a developer of web-based applications for the golf
    industry. Many of these applications are complex and are normally
    acquired for a fee. I've developed these applications using PHP, ASP
    and C and am intersted in porting the most popular modules to PERL.
