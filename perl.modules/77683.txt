Graham,

I really appreciate your help; I've found a few more copies of the
file(s) that need to be removed:

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.10/t/problemdocs/problemdyerfile.pdf

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.09/t/leodocs/tuition.pdf

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.19/t/leodocs/tuition.pdf

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.20/t/leodocs/tuition.pdf


I cannot thank you enough for helping us get this stuff taken care of.
