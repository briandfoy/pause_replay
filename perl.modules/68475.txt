All,

well, I tried to finally upload Net-Frame-Layer-ICMPv6-1.03 (and 1.04 now),
but it appears Paolo already uploaded a version on CPAN.

My upload fails, though I am the owner of Net::Frame::Layer::ICMPv6.

What's next ?

Figured might as well contrib back to CPAN. My PAUSE application is taking a while it seems, so I thought I'd email you first. Attached is the patch to ICMPv6-1.02, tested against live ICMPv6 dumps.

Was there a reason you wrote it otherwise? I hope you find my code acceptable.
