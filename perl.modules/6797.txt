From: guidopian@yahoo.com (Steve Piantadosi)

I have developed a perl module which allows users to
run a Game of Life simulation in any number of
dimensions. For example, users can run a GOL
simulation in 3 dimensions, or 4 or 900.  Users can
specify the rules, the number of dimensions, and the
size of the dimensions. The program then runs, and
returns 
information on which cells are alive and dead.  As of
now, I have not foundn a good way to represent an
arbitrary number of dimensions, so the program returns
an array of the coordinates of living cells. It can
also return a string of 0s and 1s represnting live and
dead cells, which works fine for 1 or 2 dimensions. 

My name is Steven Piantadosi. My email is
guidopian@yahoo.com . I do not have a homepage, but i
am the founder and perl-database developer for
www.webdesignerfind.com , a site which is not yet
finished. If you will host my GOL simulator, I'd like
my ID to be GUIDOPIAN , if possible. 

Thank you.
