The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Skipjack
  DSLIP:       bdhOg
  description: Crypt::CBC-compliant block cipher
  userid:      JCDUQUE (Julius C. Duque)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:
    Anubis Misty1 Noekeon Khazad

  rationale:

    Skipjack is the secret key encryption algorithm designed by the
    National Security Agency, and is used in the Clipper chip and
    Fortezza PC card. It was implemented in tamper- resistant hardware
    and its structure had been classified since its introduction in
    1993. Skipjack was unclassified on June 24, 1998.

    Skipjack is an 80-bit key, 64-bit block cipher.

  enteredby:   JCDUQUE (Julius C. Duque)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun  4 18:56:06 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::Skipjack        bdhOg Crypt::CBC-compliant block cipher            JCDUQUE
