Sorry, vacation and such distracted me, but I got around to emailing
the current maintainer of Sys::Uptime last week, and I haven't gotten a
reply yet. How long ought I wait before the module could be declared

I currently dispatch to the right thing for FreeBSD and Linux, and I'm
working on OpenBSD and Darwin.
