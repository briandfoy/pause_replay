Andreas,

I'm not too sure what causes the error, but I think it could be the line at
the top of 00modlist.long.html

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

I think that IE can't access the file at DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd.
Either it's not there or since on FTP (where servers are often full) the
request to the file is denied and IE can't gracefully handle that situation.
This would account for the error only coming up on ftp versions of the page.

For a solution, my guess would be to replace  DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd
with an absolute URL off of a web server, like
http://whatever.com/whatever/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd  that way there is
a greater chance that the file can be accessed.  It's just a guess, may not
work at all.  I have no real XML knowledge, but that's the only XML document
referenced in the code, and the error is an XML error for a "The system
cannot locate the object specified."

Hope it helps,
- matt
