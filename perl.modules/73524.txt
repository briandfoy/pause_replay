Subject: I think that clears the PAUSE request backlog
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: xdaveg@gmail.com (David Golden)

Sorry for the flurry of new user emails. I just went through
everything from September and early October before I got a PAUSE admin
bit and tried to approve everything that looked sane.  I think Kurt
was still approving back in August, so I hope that gets us more or
less current.

I've asked Andreas about creating a PAUSE admin page to more easily
see open requests so trolling through the newsgroup for old requests
isn't necessary in the future.
