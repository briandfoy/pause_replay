He released a module in March, so I don't know how gone he is. In our
module takeover guidelines, we suggest several other ways to try to
contact authors‹including queries in well trafficed areas of the
internet. We don't want to transfer modules merely because one email
address doesn't work. :)

His website lists some other ways you might try to get ahold of him
(http://pedrofigueiredo.org/about.html). Let us know if you have any
luck.
