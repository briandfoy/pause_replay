Hi!

I'd like to propose 2 corrections to the list:

1) I wrote a Net::Dict module. It is in my directory (Id = DIMRUB).
Therefore the entry must be replaced for Net::Dict (A developer named
ABIGAIL has once registered the idea, but never implemented it). The
DSLI entry is: RmpO

2) I'd like sometimes to write a module that performs SMIME. I need it
in order to perform a major addition to majordomo functionality. So
there. The DSLI entry is: idpO

Thanks!
