hello

I'd like to apply for a cpan id, please. here's the requested information:

name: William Ross

email: will@spanner.org

homepage: http://www.spanner.org/will/

preferred user id: 'thpfft', assuming that i can't have 'will'.

planned contributions:

the impetus for my request is currently called TagFilter.pm, while it 
waits for a namespace. It's a subclass of HTML::Parser that limits 
the markup of html to an arbitrary set of tags, tag attributes and 
tag attribute values, and can be as coarse or fine-grained as the 
caller wishes. i use it to filter user input before storage, but it's 
fairly versatile and could, for example, be used to remove all tag 
attributes with a certain value across a set of pages, or all image 
tags during low-bandwidth translation.

You can see it at  http://www.spanner.org/will/TagFilter/

In the longer term, I spend most of my time developing content 
management systems for big charities, and run 
http://www.amnesty.org.uk and http://www.scope.org.uk as well as 
several other more activist-led sites, so there are frequently 
occasions when i need to develop something that will be generally 
useful if done sufficiently well.

I'm also hoping to be able to help with developments around 
Class::DBI, since I use it constantly, but that conversation hasn't 
started yet and probably won't until there's something I can show 
people as evidence of worth :)

thanks

will
