Subject: Module submission RADIUS::XMLParser

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RADIUS::XMLParser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Radius log file XML convertor
  userid:      AAMEND (Antoine Amend)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    CVS repository

  similar:
    RADIUS::Dictionary

  rationale:

    Working for a large telco operator, I have to parse all over the
    day thousands of RADIUS log file (300K lines each, - 10Go each) and
    store them into a database. Due to massive data set I need to deal
    with, I have realized that RADIUS events are actually randomly
    displayed in a given file (e.g. STOP event does not immediately
    follow a START event) and therefore cannot be processed as-is. Any
    events must be first retrieved / parsed and then grouped by their
    unique session ID before being loaded as a one into a database /
    FS...etc. Besides, this module will convert the Radius proprietary
    log file format into a XML format, processable by any data load
    process.

    In addition, before I internally released this module, most of the
    processing time was actually due to a specific event lookup based on
    its Session ID. All events (STOP / START / INTERIM) are now reported
    on hash table (stored in memory), and the processing time has been
    significantly improved. Processing 24h of log file is taking now
    around 3h compare to 10-15h as it was on previous versions.

    Every developers working for Internet Service Provider companies
    should be aware about the waste time spent on analyzing these data.
    I have no doubt this module might be really useful for all of them,
    as it was for myself.

    I sincerely hope this module will be officially released, and I am
    available for any question, remarks you might have.

    Sincerely, Antoine Amend
