I disagree.

In ISO 8601:1986, the basic format for the complete representation of a
date is 19991231 and the extended format for a date is 1999-12-31 (see
section 5.2.1 Calendar Date and in particular 5.2.1.1 Complete
Representation).

There is discussion about week numbers, but it occurs much later in the
standard (section 5.2.3 Date Identified by calendar week and day numbers).

[I know there is also ISO 8601:2000, but I don't have a copy of it to
quote from, and I understand that the changes are minor.]

As to web sites that document this, the best I know is:
	http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html
The opening section launches straight into YYYY-MM-DD format.
