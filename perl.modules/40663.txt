Hey there Friend,

Here we go again!

Just got done reading some more online news about the realestate crash that's "supposed" to happen any day now. Looks like it's got some people really worried. Seems like this has been getting a lot of press lately, but the fact remains that the same cynics who have been predicting this "crash" have been saying that since 2001.

The funny thing is, one guy who wrote that article also "predicted" the dot-com crash. But what most people don't realize is that he was about 6 years off the mark on that one. And yet, the masses are taking his word as gospel...and I can practically see out my window the herds of people, carrying on in the streets about how this guy just KNOWS what's up. Well, that's a slight exaggeration, but still...

Come on, now! 

Aren't we brighter than this, folks? Since when do we listen to some guy and what he has to say when there is just NOTHING even remotely scientific to back it up?

Hey, I've got it! 

Maybe I should write a book about how gas prices are going to go up to five bucks a gallon...and when they do 20 years from now I can go on the Oprah show and tell the world that I predicted it!

Or better yet...how about I predict that I will have gray hair? And in the future when my hair turns gray, I can say I can predict the future because I said just that years back. 

Sorry for the sarcasm, but I think if you're going to go public and spout off "predictions" that can affect people's lives, then you better have some kind of track record that shows you kinda know what's going on and you're not just talking to hear yourself talk, or just throwing out wild guesses. 

Claiming that YOU predicted something right before just doesn't cut it for me. I gotta see more than that.

Why? Because people like me and thousands of my clients have been taking this industry by storm...while some poor people who follow bogus advice end up sitting on the sidelines and just watching everyone else flourish. It's discouraging.

So is the guy right about the crash? Who knows...but I doubt it. Billionaires who develop realestate for a living highly doubt it. The average American who made more off their house in one year of appreciation than from working over full-time for the last five years highly doubts it, too.

Who do YOU want to listen to?

Just do what I do, and what countless other experts do. Hold some units for long term...and flip some properties. That way you will never risk the market falling apart.

If you're new to flipping for immediate gain, you'll want to see http://www.one-stop-real-estate.net for more info.

I'll leave the site up for another 48 hours.

Have a safe Memorial Day weekend!

Lou
