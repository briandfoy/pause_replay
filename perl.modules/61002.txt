The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Provision::Unix
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: provision accounts on unix systems
  userid:      MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    provision@tnpi.net

  similar:
    there have been a few stabs at this type of framework but nothing
    ever made it to release quality

  rationale:

    There are several other modules on CPAN that provide small portions
    of what unix::provision does but nothing (I've seen) that provides a
    higher level solution. I have seen stabs at this done by others but
    nothing that ever went anywhere (useful).

    The package I provide will be a 'drop in' solution that web hosts
    can use as the back office for their billing application. IE, go buy
    a billing system such as modernbill, WHMCS, or ubersmith and then
    configure its API queue to send arguments to the unix::provision
    programs. The suite will have methods for building system user
    accounts, apache or lighttpd vhosts, sendmail/qmail/postfix/vpopmail
    accounts, BIND/tinydns/nictool DNS entries, jail/vps accounts on
    FreeBSD/xen/openvz, etc.

    If there is another perl framework like this that I could build
    upon, I don't know about it. My expectation to succeed at this is
    that I have already written several predecessors of this for other
    projects. A bit part of this is consolidating and enhancing large
    chunks of code I have already written, and then putting a decent set
    of interfaces on it (command line & CGI to start).

The resulting entry would be:

Provision::
::Unix            cdpOp provision accounts on unix systems           MSIMERSON
