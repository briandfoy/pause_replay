Subject: Module submission DBIx::Interpolate

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Interpolate
  DSLIP:       Rmphp
  description: Interpolate Perl variables into SQL with DBI
  userid:      DMANURA (David Manura)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/SQL-Interpolate

  similar:
    DBIx::Abstract SQL::Interpolate

  rationale:

    This is a wrapper that merges SQL::Interpolate functionality into a
    DBI-like interface.

    In terms of the interface, SQL::Interpolate is to SQL::Abstract as
    DBIx::Interpolate is to DBIx::Abstract. However, in terms of
    implementation, DBIx::Interpolate reuses SQL::Interpolate, and both
    are part of the same distribution (SQL-Interpolate).

  enteredby:   DMANURA (David Manura)
  enteredon:   Tue Nov  8 01:52:51 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Interpolate     Rmphp Interpolate Perl variables into SQL with DBI DMANURA
