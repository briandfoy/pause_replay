The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::WorkCrew
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Easy sub-process management with IPC
  userid:      MEGAMIC (Michael Potter)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    IRC:#moose SVN:mxwc.googlecode.com/svn

  similar:
    MooseX::Workers

  rationale:

    After building several manager/worker style programs at work,
    largely to handle the need for processing asynchronous web-service
    calls, using a combination of IO::Select, socketpair and fork, I
    though there must be an easier and more robust way to create and
    manage this style of program.

    Around the same time, I had become increasingly interested in
    Moose, and this led me to MooseX::Workers, a module that provided
    basically what I was looking for, minus some important capabilities
    such as IPC between the manager and worker threads. Rather than
    simply patch MooseX::Workers, I decided to start a new module based
    upon it, with the following improvements in mind: * natural way for
    workers to have private data * serialization and passing of complex
    data strutures including objects * event-driven mechanics in the
    worker thread (ie. receive_instruction) * manager can easily
    identify and respond to workers

The resulting entry would be:
