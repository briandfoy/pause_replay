     why:

    I have a Win32 script which checks the available free disk space
    for all drives on a list of computers. Notification of free disk
    space below the desired limit is sent to a different lists of email
    addresses depending on responsibility. Notification is also sent to
    a list of computers in a system pop-up message via the "net send"
    command. This script is very useful to prevent database servers from
    running out of free disk space and stopping production. You can view
    the script at http://www.mcgintech.com/FreeDiskSpace.txt This link
    does not contain the POD information you require. I am in the
    process of adding this information. Thank you.
