The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cloud::Infrastructure
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: common infrastructure interface library
  userid:      EWINDISCH (Eric Windisch)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    irc.freenod.org#annelidous cloudforum@googlegroups.com
    git://github.com/annelidous/annelidous.git http://www.annelido.us

  similar:
    Net::Cloud Net::Amazon::EC2 Net::Amazon::S3 Net::Mosso::CloudFiles
    -- This module will provide a common interface to interact with such
    services (such as DBI does for databases).

  rationale:

    Please disregard my previous request for Net::IaaS, to be replaced
    by this request. Furthermore, I have had a discussion with the owner
    of Net::Cloud. For now, these will be separate projects and we are
    NOT applying to take over that namespace as might have been
    inferred. I apologize for any confusion as a result of these
    preceding actions.

    I understand that this request would result in the formation of a
    new root namespace, 'Cloud'. I believe that this namespace should
    exist and should not be underneath any other namespace, just as
    'WWW' and similar technologies have their own roots.

    The goal of this project is to provide a common client interface
    library for "Cloud Infrastructure" services, as DBI provides for
    databases. The project also builds a framework on which new
    Infrastructure services may be built. To this end, we have already
    completed functional code which communicates to a private cloud
    implemented as a subclass of our ::Connector module. This is very
    much functional and is in production use.

    Currently, the project goes by the name "Annelidous" and uses a
    top-level namespace of Annelidous in its modules. We will change
    this to whatever we can agree upon with CPAN.

    I'm very open to discussion and suggestions. This project is simply
    looking for a suitable namespace within CPAN to operate. I thank you
    for your consideration and review.

    Regards, Eric Windisch
