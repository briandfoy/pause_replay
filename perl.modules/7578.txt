Have you looked at Array::Compare and talked to its author?  Also, you
may find that something like this already exists on CPAN... it's
certainly already in the Perl FAQ (perldoc perlfaq4, "How do I
compute the difference of two arrays?  How do I compute the intersection 
of two arrays?")

Which is not to say that you shouldn't write it and contribute it, just
that you shouldn't reinvent the wheel.  Also, don't call it
ArrayCompare.pm as a) there's a perfectly good Array:: namespace
already, and b) Array::Compare is already taken.
