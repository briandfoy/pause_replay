Hi Ron,

It might be that PAUSE is getting confused. It was refusing to index my 
updated VCS, which included VCS::Cvs (including lowercase), on the basis 
that you owned it. (I see you've added me to VCS::CVS (all uppercase)

Anyway, thanks for the quick and helpful response!

Cheers,
Ed

Hi Ed

Added ETJ to co-maintainers of VCS::CVS.

Note the case of CSV.
