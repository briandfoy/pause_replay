Subject: Module submission String::Trim

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       String::Trim
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: trim whitespace off your strings
  userid:      DOHERTY (Mike Doherty)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    String::Util

  rationale:

    String::Util depends on Debug::ShowStuff, which depends on Taint.
    Taint doesn't appear to have passed it's test suite in years. This
    module provides a (hopefully) good implementation of trim (only)
    with no non-core dependencies.

    This module was inspired by code at
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=36684 written by japhy,
    dragonchild, and Aristotle. The Perl module proposed for inclusion
    in the module list was written by Mike Doherty.

  enteredby:   DOHERTY (Mike Doherty)
  enteredon:   Sat Nov 27 00:43:06 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

String::
::Trim            bdpfg trim whitespace off your strings             DOHERTY
