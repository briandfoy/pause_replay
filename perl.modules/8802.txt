Hallo,

since I'm planning to contribute a module to CPAN I kindly ask you for
an author ID.

Description of module planned to contribute:

String::Similarity::Trigram - Find similar strings by trigram method

(I know the name is long and - partly - occupied anyway, it's just a
working title for me as I think this would be the best place to put it)

The module computes the similarity of two strings based on the trigram
method. This consists in splitting a given string into triples of
characters and comparing those to the trigrams of some other string. For
example the string kangaroo has the trigrams {kan ang nga gar aro roo}.
A wrongly typed kanagaroo has the trigrams {kan ana nag aga gar aro
roo}. To compute the similarity we (roughly) divide the number of
matching trigrams by the number of all trigrams. For our example this
means dividing 4 / 9 resulting in 0.44.

Thanx and greetings,

Tarek
