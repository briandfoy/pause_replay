From: adam@npjh.com (Adam Flott)

I have a Pidgin plugin which implements IRCSRP 2.0
(http://www.bjrn.se/ircsrp/) which is:

    ... a method for securing IRC group chat. It is an updated version of the
    first version of IRCSRP, fixing some issues in the original specification.

    IRCSRP is based on the SRP-6 protocol for password-authenticated key
    agreement. While SRP was originally designed for establishing a secure,
    authenticated channel between a user and a host, it can be adapted for
    group communcations, as described in this document.

And I'm going to break out the IRCSRP code from the Pidgin specific portions
and need some advice on the name space. I was thinking (in order of
preference) Algorithm::IRCSRP2, Algorithm::IRCSRP, Net::IRC::IRCSRP2.


Thanks,

Adam
