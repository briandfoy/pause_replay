Hi Ashley & Germain,

I emailed you back in June:

> I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m =
working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package =
names case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where =
two or more people are owners of namespaces previously considered =
distinct, and now considered the same.
>=20
> Ashley (AWIN) has ownership of Qt::Base, which is on CPAN in =
PerlQt-1.04.tar.gz, and Germain (GGARAND) has ownership of Qt::base, =
which is on CPAN in PerlQt-3.008.tar.gz. To resolve this conflict, I =
propose dropping AWIN=E2=80=99s permissions on the older Qt::Base, and =
also deleting all of the older releases of PerlQt from Ashley=E2=80=99s =
CPAN author directory (there are a number of older releases of PerlQt =
appearing in the CPAN index, because various module names were changed =
across a number of releases. As a result someone could (theoretically) =
accidentally install the wrong version of PerlQt).

Are you happy for me to make these changes? Seems like they=E2=80=99re =
the right thing to do: I don=E2=80=99t think they=E2=80=99ll cause any =
problems, it will resolve the conflict, and also prevent anyone from =
accidentally installing an old release.

Cheers,
Neil
