Hi, my name is Felipe (user Leprevost) and I recently start using the PAUSE.
First of all I have a simple doubt about the uploaded modules, I got this
module in version 0.1 uploaded and indexed some days ago and now I have a
new version of it, what is the correct procedure? I mean, should I upload
the new version and the remove the old one ?
The second thing is about my @cpan mail, I don't think its
working, I'm not receiving any forwarded mail.

Thanks in advance, CPAN and PAUSE are great and you guys make a good job.
