Subject: CPAN account, POD to HTML converter

Dear Perl community,

I'd like to apply for a CPAN account. Yes, I have been watching CPAN for
quite a while now (I administer my company's Perl installation) and I am
in close contact with other CPAN contributers (Brad Appleton, Nick
Ing-Simmons, Steffen Beyer, Norbert Gruener, Sean M. Burke, Russ Allbery)
on POD issues.
Andreas Koenig encouraged me at the 2nd German Perl Workshop in March to
put my developments on a new POD to HTML converter on CPAN to let others
test it and comment on.

First of all, here's my personal data, according to
http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/04pause.html#registering

Name: Marek Rouchal
Email: Marek.Rouchal@gmx.net
WWW (although pretty outdated): http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/~marek
CPAN user id wish: MAREKR

Planned contribution: MarekPodHTML-0.40, a preliminary version of a
possible successor of all the POD to HTML converters on CPAN. See also
below.

The metadata for this is:

Development Stage: a - alpha testing
Support Level: d - Developer
Language Used: p - Perl-only, no compiler needed, should be platform
               independent (BUT: depends partially on HTML::Parser, wich
               is "c")
Interface Style: O - Object oriented using blessed references and/or
                 inheritance
Description: Script and Module for converting POD documentation to HTML

I've discussed this topic vividly with Nick, Brad and Wolfgang Laun. I
presented my work done at the mentioned Perl Workshop and people
encouraged me to continue my work and make it available to a broader
audience. It seems that a lot of people would also like to improve
existing converters but simply lack the time (ask Nick ;-) After a
thorough review I'd be happy if my work would become part of the Perl
core. But there may be still a long way to go.

I'd like to publish this module as Marek::Pod::HTML first for review, so
that the existing converters can be benchmarked against my work without
interference (cf. Russ Allbery's pod2roff that since 5.6.0 replaced the
old pod2man). When everyone eventually agrees on what I've coded, the
namespace should be changed to Pod::HTML or the like.

Hope to hear from you soon! Please correct me if I made some obvious
mistakes.

Sincerely,

Marek

PS. I have further ideas and/or projects in work that I
might want to share eventually with the community: further POD converters
(pod2mif [FrameMaker], pod2latex), a LaTeX parser and HTML converter, a
VHDL/Verilog (VLSI hardware description language) parser with OO
interface.
