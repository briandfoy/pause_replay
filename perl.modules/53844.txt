Yes, deprecated modules can have releases.

Basically, put abstract in POD and Makefile.PL to "(DEPRECATED) ..." add 
a bold recommendation of module to use instead in DESCRIPTION at top.

The module stays around for people that have it as a dependency, but 
over time as people notice the deprecation they should port away to the 
replacement.
