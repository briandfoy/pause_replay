Subject: Math::MatrixReal extension
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: msouth@fulcrum.org (Mike South)

Hi,

My name is Mike South, I would like to contribute an extension to 
Math::MatrixReal, which I am proposing to call Math::MatrixReal::Ext1.
I think it would be better inside Math::MatrixReal, but I have not been
able to get the authors to respond to the email listed in the 
README or on 00whois.html (that one bounces, in fact).  It seems to
me that a reasonable alternative is to just put this in a separate
file and then, when we get in contact with the author, we can
open the discussion on absorbing it.  That allows this extension
to get out there, and provides a nice way of merging the two,
since we can just replace the Ext1.pm file with an empty subclass
thingy if they are one day integrated.

the module is at

	http://www.fulcrum.org/personal/msouth/code/Math-MatrixReal-Ext1-0-04.tgz

with the pod2html output next to it at

	http://www.fulcrum.org/personal/msouth/code/Math-MatrixReal-Ext1-0-04.html

Here's the synopsis section of the pod:

  use Math::MatrixReal::Ext1;

  $ident3x3 = Math::MatrixReal::Ext1->new_from_cols( [ [1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1] ] );
  $upper_tri = Math::MatrixReal::Ext1->new_from_rows( [ [1,1,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1] ] );

  $col1 = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string("[ 1 ]\n[ 3 ]\n[ 5 ]\n");
  $col2 = Math::MatrixReal->new_from_string("[ 2 ]\n[ 4 ]\n[ 6 ]\n");

  $mat = Math::MatrixReal::Ext1->new_from_cols( [ $col1, $col2 ] );

here is the information requested in the instructions on your web
site:

an extension for Math::MatrixReal that lets you create a matrix from
rows or colums, passed in as perl arrays rather than in the string format
which is currently required by Math::MatrixReal.  The new methods are
new_from_cols() and new_from_rows(), complementing the existing
new_from_string() method.

RdpO  Convenience extensions for Math::MatrixReal


I think this would be better off inside Math::MatrixReal, but
I have had no luck contacting the authors.
==========================================

I posted this to comp.lang.perl.modules and comp.lang.perl.misc.  You can 
find the archives of that discussion on google.com by searching in these
groups for the subject "ANNOUNCE: Math::MatrixReal::Ext1".  I posted
a summary and response which I have included below.  If you would
like me to send my archives of the discussion to you in a tgz or 
something I would be happy to do that.

Thanks for you time,

mike
