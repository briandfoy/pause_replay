Dear administrators:
This letter is to draw your attention to the situation that has arisen in
the Perl 6 community with user HOLYGHOST. In a nutshell, for the past
months he's been uploading new modules and new versions of modules to the
tune of several a day sometimes. These modules have barely any tests (or no
tests at all), and in many cases they don't even compile since they are
written in an invented version of Perl 6.
In most cases, if not all, they are uploaded directly to CPAN without the
intermediate step of using a source control system. That is not a problem
per se, the main problem is that, by dint of simply not compiling (or not
taking the time to compile them before uploading them to CPAN), they don't
pass the minimum standard of quality required for Perl 6 module (not to
mention a syntactically correct program), yet they show up in searches, in
modules pages and in the Twitter bot that does such thing, provoking
confusion among users.
We have repeatedly drawn this to the attention of the user. Just a few
examples:
* https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-28#l196
* https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-28#l241
* https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-28#l413
* https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-28#l424
* Here I told him, in no uncertain terms, that I would take measures if he
kept uploading modules to CPAN
https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-28#l629. His
answer was: "Sure".

In this conversation in the #perl6 channel, he agreed on deleting all the
modules from CPAN
https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2019-05-29#l194

Yep today he's uploaded a new version of another module. This is why I
kindly ask to revoke his uploading privileges to CPAN, or take the measures
that are usual in these cases so that this situation stops.

Thanks a lot
