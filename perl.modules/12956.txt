At first, I would have loved to see simply 'Petal' (it's not like it's
too generic...) but it doesn't seem possible.

Everyone seem to think that Template::Petal is great...

I just don't. I know it's a bit stupid, but I'm not ready to spend time
developing a module and think 'bloody hell it sucks' each time I type
"use Template::Petal".

I think I'll just keep it in my CPAN home directory and have it not
listed in the CPAN module list. It's not the end of the world, if it's
good people will use it anyway.

Sorry for the time I've taken from you guys.
Cheers,
