Why not simply file the missing dependencies as bugs on the relevant modules?

If you're having trouble getting those addressed, shout and I'll hit the
relevant people with sticks on your behalf.

To get all the dependencies for Moose one should only need to type 'cpan Moose'
- releasing a bundle (which are generally frowned on in favour of Task::
modules these days) isn't a good solution; getting the dependency specification
errors in the relevant modules fixed would be (hence why I'm volunteering
to help :)
