ANNOUNCE: Class::MethodMaker v2.0.6

Class::MethodMaker allows module developers to quickly define object  
constructor and accessor methods by reusing templates for these common  
types of functions.

I am soliciting feedback on a major revision of Class::MethodMaker prior  
to releasing it to CPAN. Version 2 provides a wide range of additional  
features while retaining nearly complete compatibility with version 1.

This release, 2.0.6, provides closer compatibility with earlier versions  
of Class::MethodMaker, and fixes a few platform and Perl-version  
specific bugs found in last week's 2.0.5 release; see the CHANGES file  
for details.

The distribution tarball may be retrieved from here:
  http://work.evolution.com/dist/Class-MethodMaker-2.0.6.tar.gz

A brief overview is available in the included README, or here:
  http://work.evolution.com/dist/Class-MethodMaker-2.0.6.README

I would be particularly interested in:
- knowing if this release breaks any existing code;
- correcting any Perl-version or platform dependencies;
- any suggestions towards improving the documentation;
- or any general feedback or suggested changes.

Please send any feedback to me at simonm@evolution.com.

After resolving any issues brought up in the current round of feedback,  
I will be working with the maintainer of version 1 to post the new  
version to CPAN.

Thanks,

-Simon
