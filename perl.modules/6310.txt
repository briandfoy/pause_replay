I would like a PAUSE id.

contributions:
1. With all due awe I would like to contribute
Array::Virtual which allows one to store an array on
the disk.  This is in the module list with LWALL next
to it, but it has been there at least six months, is
still marked as idea, and Mr. Wall no doubt has better
things to do with his time than write this little
module (like working on Perl 6).
After issuing a tie call, the array is available as if
in memory, but it persists on the disk.  The mechanism
is actually a tied hash where the keys are numbers and
the values are the array elements.  To the calling
program it behaves as a regular array.  Perl has so
many nice things and homemade ties are one of the
glorious ones.
2. A set of scripts that aid the Java programmer in
placing graphical Components using the GridBagLayout
manager.  A simple input file syntax results in
compilable code which lays the elements out on the
screen in compact rows.
3. An educational script which implements the
Pseudo-Assembly Language (PAL).  PAL is an assembly
simulator useful for teaching computer science
students.  It is reduced to eliminate the overwhelming
complexity of modern assemblers.  It is simulated in
Perl (there is also a Java version) so that it runs on
any platform.

Please advise me of the best place to put the scripts
within CPAN.
