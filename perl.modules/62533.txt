unfortunately, this isn't quite as simple. We have to take great care to
not take away an author's module because he is on a long vacation or in
hospital or similar. Therefore, it is important that we let some time
pass before we transfer maintenance permissions and that you make every
reasonable effort to contact the author. In doing that, it's also
crucial that you leave a visible trail so that if the author comes back
after a while, we can prove that nobody simply snatched his work.

Here's the plan:
a) Try to reach the author via email and CC modules@perl.org.
b) Google for him, his email addresses and other forms of communication.
c) Use publically visible places such as perlmonks or your use.perl.org
journal, etc. to search for him.
d) If all attempts to contact the author failed for several weeks, ping
us again to get co-maintenance permission.

We're sorry for the inconvenience, but these steps are unfortunately
necessary.

Best regards,
Steffen
