Adam,

We already have almost finished monitoring system for Linux OSes, which 
would be requiring its separate name space in some way or another. Due 
to that I thought it might be possible to register helper modules (which 
were written in general manner and are convenient on their own) in the 
same name space or similar manner.

But, if you see it as absolutely impossible on both accounts (helper 
modules and the monitoring system), I will respect it, switch this 
module into Tie::FileSystem name space and will try to figure out 
something regarding my/our future submissions.

Please, give it one last thought and reply to me with "final decision".

Vadim.
