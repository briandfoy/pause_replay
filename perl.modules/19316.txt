All,

Jos and I have resolved this (through T::R's 'debug' object method). The issue
was that Jos's local maildomain was unable to be determined, and thus when
Net::SMTP (via T::R) went to send the mail it resulted in:

MAIL FROM:<kane@freggel.local (kane)>
450 Could not resolve freggel.local

Since the mail was unable to be sent, T::R reported that it was unable to send
the mail.

There are three independant solutions:

1 - Install Net::Domain (which is a T::R recommended prereq, but not a mandatory
    prereq), which will make T::R try even harder at guessing the mail domain.
2 - Install Mail::Send (which is a T::R recommended prereq, but not a mandatory
    prereq), so T::R won't be forced to use Net::SMTP.
3 - Explicitly set the 'from' method via the T::R object.

Jos brought up the point that CPANPLUS's integration of T::R could use solution
3, via explicitly setting T::R's 'from' based on the value of 'from' that
CPANPLUS itself collects during its installation process. Of course, this means
that CPANPLUS end-users should not be able to set CPANPLUS's 'from' to an
arbitrary, non-resolvable value.
