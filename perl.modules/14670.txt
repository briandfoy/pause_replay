how does it know what a company name is?  if you can only
find public company names, for instance, then the name
should say something about that.

i also don't think this is the best name.  i thought it
was something completely different (a translation from
ticker symbols to names and the other way around).  perhaps
something like "Extract" should be somewhere in there. :)
