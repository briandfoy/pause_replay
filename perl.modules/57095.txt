The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Compare::Util
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Additional file comparison methods
  userid:      KRUGGLE (Kevin Ruggles)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, forums

  similar:
    File::Compare

  rationale:

    File::Compare::Util will expand on File::Compare. Offering some
    basic file comparison methods and giving the user control over what
    is returned by the module. Will also allow the user to check for
    user defined equalities or differences in files via a callback
    function. The original function of File::Compare will also be
    included.

  enteredby:   KRUGGLE (Kevin Ruggles)
  enteredon:   Sun Oct  7 00:48:05 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Compare::
::Util            cdpOp Additional file comparison methods           KRUGGLE
