The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SQL::Library
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple tool for managing SQL libraries.
  userid:      DGORLEY (Doug Gorley)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    This provides some similar functionality to Text::Repository, but is
    much simpler to use for small projects.

  rationale:

    This tool is intended as a _simple_ tool for managing libraries of
    SQL statements used in a perl program. The module name,
    SQL::Library, accurately describes the intended use, and doesn't
    conflict with any current CPAN modules. The modules interacts with
    SQL statements in a library file that looks somewhat similar to a
    Windows INI file, but without the key=value pairs. An entry might
    look like this:

    [baz-query] select * from baz;

    This format makes the library simple to manage, even for those with
    absolutely no perl knowledge.

  enteredby:   DGORLEY (Doug Gorley)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 17 20:38:30 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SQL::
::Library         bdpOp Simple tool for managing SQL libraries.      DGORLEY
