They appeared in the $Revision: 3.20 $$Date: 1999/11/01 21:00:07 $
update in the style

::FileLRUCache    a    N/A                                          SNOWHARE

The policy hasn't changed but the software now allows editing. The
policy is bound to fail when there is too much real life intrusion.
I'm glad users have the ability now to edit their description. That
reduces the overhead here considerably.

Nope, that's not the case. Adding of modules, deletion and moving
around are still left to manual editing.

The entries will have the values you gave them at the next update.

[sound of andreas running a few make commands]

They are now in the $Revision: 3.21 $$Date: 1999/11/02 03:46:56 $
