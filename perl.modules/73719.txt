The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::NzbMatrix
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO wrapper for V1.1 of the NzbMatrix API
  userid:      OGMONSTER (Paul Grove)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    WWW::Newzbin

  rationale:

    The proposed WWW::NzbMatrix module is a OO interface to the
    nzbmatrix api version 1.1 as described here:
    http://nzbmatrix.com/api-info.php

    Sujested to place under WWW, along side the WWW::Newzbin module.

    Newzbin and NzbMatrix are two similar sites which both provide the
    same nzb indexing service, but both sites were written independently
    from each other and provide different APIs.

    Both APIs have different limitations and have wildly different
    interfaces, as such seperate modules are required for each site.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::NzbMatrix       adpOp OO wrapper for V1.1 of the NzbMatrix API     OGMONSTER
