The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       UI::All
  DSLIP:       cdhOg
  description: Common interface to the many /G?UI/ toolkits
  userid:      RHANDOM (Paul T. Seamons)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    A little at Utah valley perlmongers but mostly this is a personal
    itch. Well that isn't strictly true - I see people post vague ideas
    to similar concepts on perlmonks all the time.

  similar:
    All UI toolkits are a little bit the same. No other modules try to
    unify them (yet)

  rationale:

    There are Qt, Gtk, Tk, Win32::GUI, Curses, Wx and probably other
    toolkits for creating user interfaces. They all have fairly similar
    feature sets but widely different implementations and API's.

    I don't want to learn all of their interfaces (well I had to to
    write this module). I'd like to write once and then let the
    application work automatically in as many desktop flavors as
    possible.

    It is a fair undertaking so there will be a sourceforge project
    aimed at getting more involvement.

The resulting entry would be:

UI::
::All             cdhOg Common interface to the many /G?UI/ toolkits RHANDOM
