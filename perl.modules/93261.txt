Yes, developer releases don=E2=80=99t get indexed, so modules in the =
release don=E2=80=99t end up in 02packages.details.txt

> I could not find any information about when I am supposed to get an =

That document does mention the lack of indexing (my highlighting):

PAUSE will leave the underscore distributions alone: no readme will be =
extracted, no index will be updated, no symlinks will be created. Of =
course many users on the CPAN will take note of the developer releases. =
Cpan testers will test them and bug chasers will probably file bug =
reports in RT.

We could update that doc to make it clear that you won=E2=80=99t get a =
second email from PAUSE. Can you add a ticket for that on PAUSE=E2=80=99s =
github issues please?

Cheers,
Neil
