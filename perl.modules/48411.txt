It looks like SUPER was indexed but the other modules in the dist
weren't.

You have the first-come permission for SUPER, 

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=me&pause9
9_peek_perms_query=SUPER&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit

but DB belongs to DMR 

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=me&pause9
9_peek_perms_query=DB&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit

and UNIVERSAL belongs to P5P

https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?pause99_peek_perms_by=me&pause9
9_peek_perms_query=UNIVERSAL&pause99_peek_perms_sub=Submit
