Hello,

I would like to register for module development.

Module Description: 
I wrote a Net::IMAP::Simple module. It's mostly compatible with
Net::POP3 (I've used it to migrate a Net::POP3 application to an IMAP
server), and adds some methods for mailbox handling.

Net::IMAP vs Net::IMAP::Simple
Net::IMAP will be a full IMAP implementation, and it seems to be in a
very
early stage of development. Also, the API will be necessarily as
complicated
as the IMAP protocol. There's a need for a simpler API that hides all
the
complexity from the programmer, when all he wants to do is retrieve a
message
from the server. I found the Net::POP3 API much more easier to
understand.

Net::IMAP::Simple only implements the basic features needed for message
retrieval from the IMAP server, etc. Net::POP3 -> IMAP migration is
really
easy to do. By using a small subset of the IMAP protocol, and being
compatible
with Net::POP3, the module is very easy to learn.


The DSLI fot the module is bdpO.

Thank you,

Joao Fonseca
