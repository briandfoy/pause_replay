Hi George,

Thank you.

I have dropped your permissions on the =E2=80=9CLoad=E2=80=9D and =
=E2=80=9CDelete=E2=80=9D namespaces, which resolves the problem =
conflict.

You can delete your old releases while you work on your updated version, =
or I can do it for you, if you like.
Or you could just leave them there until you release a new version.

Cheers,
Neil

This now clashes with the =E2=80=9Cload=E2=80=9D module, which is owned =
by PAUSE user ELIZABETH.

the modules in your distribution to follow the usual convention of all =
