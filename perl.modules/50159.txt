The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Psichedb
  DSLIP:       cdhho
  description: interactive, attachable Perl debugger
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    www.presicient.com/psiche perlmonks.org

  similar:
    perl5db Devel::ptkdb Devel::ebug::HTTP

  rationale:

    Using the interfaces provided by Devel::RingBuffer, Devel::Psichedb
    provides an attachable, multiprocess/multithread-friendly Perl
    debugger (The name is derived from PSiCHE, "Perl Scalable ithreads
    Component Helper Extensions", a set of modules and techniques for
    simplifying the construction of threaded Perl apps). The user
    interface is browser based (ala Devel::ebug::HTTP, but with better
    support for multithreaded/multiprocess apps, and without requiring
    the large number of supporting modules; see
    www.presicient.com/psichedb for a very prelim version). An
    application started with "-d:Psichedb" can run uninterrupted with
    minimal performance degradation until an external instance of
    psichedb (a small HTTP server coupled with the Devel::RingBuffer
    communications i/f's) is started, and a browser is connected to its
    port. When debugging is complete, the debugger can be detached and
    the app can continue to run.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::Psichedb        cdhho interactive, attachable Perl debugger        DARNOLD
