   Not really, no...   I thought about using that when I originally started 
with the idea (years ago) but decided against it for the following primary 
reasons: 

1)  The name "Fidonet" has trademark issues, at least in the U.S., & I'd 
prefer to avoid that issue altogether.
2)   It's not generic enough.   Although the the software & associated 
technology was originally developed for what is & was referred to as 
"Fidonet", it has long since been used for "Othernets";  also known as 
Fidonet Technology Networks, hence commonly referred to as FTNs. 

  Note also  that although perhaps new to CPAN, neither the FTN::Utiltiy 
module itself nor the FTN namespace idea is particularly new, haveing been 
availabe publically for over 4 years.   Specifically for FTN::Utility:  
reference also http://ftnpl.cvs.sourceforge.net/ftnpl/modules/FTN/Utility/ , 
where I originally imported it into CVS there at Sourceforge in 2001. 

  From what I've been reading lately,I really should have originally used 
the name FTN::Log;  & I plan to split it off that way, but it has been 
available as FTN::Utility for years so I thought I should get it  (the name) 
registered anyway.
