From: monkey@monkeynet.ca (Derek Wueppelmann)

Hello,

  A while back I had uploaded Webservice::AutoTask to cpan and was 
maintaining it by myself for some time. I then got a request from 
another user of the module to be added as a co-maintainer to the 
project. I did so and didn't think anything of it until recently when I 
was asked by another individual to make them a co-maintainer as well. 
However I realize now that I actually made the other user the primary 
maintainer of the project and now I'm just the co-maintainer. I've tried 
to contact the other user CMADAMS to see if they could fix this for me, 
but they never got back to me. Is there a way to get it so that DWUEPPEL 
is the primary maintainer and CMADAMS is a co-maintainer?
