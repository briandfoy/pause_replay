The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AutoCons
  DSLIP:       bnpfp
  description: A cons-based build system
  userid:      RIDDLE (Michael Howell)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker Module::Build

  rationale:

    AutoCons is a cons-based build system. It supports perl module
    building as well as C program compiling. Cons supports features
    unheard-of in make, such as proper MD5 hash-based dependency
    resolving, simple, to-the-point, perl-based input files (the
    Construct), and is written in pure perl (it should run on any
    platform perl will). The implementation is comparable to
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build.

    This module, unlike ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build is not
    limited to module building. As a result, it cannot be placed it
    those namespaces.

The resulting entry would be:

AutoCons          bnpfp A cons-based build system                    RIDDLE
