Forwarding a mail from Neil Bowers that he tried to send to modules@ but
which disappeared on the way to the list.

Neil, I've made you co-maintainer of Lingua::EN::Numbers. I know you as
a conscientiously and thoroughly working man and I'm glad you're
persuing the fix of the bug you discovered. I would believe that it's in
the best interest of Sean that you take over the mainteinance of this
module. Thank you very much for doing that.

I've added co-maintainer rights for Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate and
Lingua::EN::Numbers::Years too. If it turns out you don't need them, you
can remove the permission bits for them on the PAUSE interface.

Sean, if you read this and do not agree, this is completely reversible,
please let us know if you would prefer a different solution.

Jonathan Bailey, I'm CCing you too because you are a co-maintainer and
may have the urge to say something on the matter.

Thanks, everybody!

This one is perhaps slightly less clear cut.

Allison Randal (one of the co-maintainers who took over Pod::Simple from Sean)
commented in email to me:

So if he's expressed a clear preference somewhere / to someone, then I don't
want to go against that, but on the other hand, I've made quite a bit of effort
to get in touch with him, and no-one else seems to be stepping forward.
