Kirrily --

  Of course I'm happy to change the namespace of the module.

  I guess I was just thinking that it would go along well with Gd...
use Gd;
use MNG;

  ...although I understand your concern.

  Is there anything I need to do (as far as module submission) to change
the namespace registration?  Do I need to re-register?

Thanks,
-Dave Mott
