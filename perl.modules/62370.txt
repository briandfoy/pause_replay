The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDL::Graphics::POGL
  DSLIP:       cdhhp
  description: PDL interface to Perl OpenGL
  userid:      CHM (Chris Marshall)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    pdl-porters mailing list

  similar:
    PDL::Graphics::OpenGL OpenGL

  rationale:

    This module incorporates code to refactor the PDL 3-D graphics
    capability (PDL::Graphics::TriD::* et. al.) to use the Perl OpenGL
    module as the base interface to the OpenGL and GLUT libraries. This
    provides important advantages:

    * A separate namespace will allow the refactoring to exist
    alongside legacy code until the support is completely transitioned
    to POGL

    * Allows PDL 3-D graphics to build on more platforms

    * Adds updated/improved support for OpenGL and FreeGLUT since PDL
    will be using the newly re-maintained Perl OpenGL (POGL) modules

    * Step 1 in unbundling of PDL into component modules that can be
    installed/updated/removed individually

    * Decoupling the admin of PDL::Graphics::POGL from the main PDL
    module will allow better support of releases (e.g. notice the
    current PDL-2.4.3 is listed as UNAUTHORIZED because we were unable
    to determine who had what permission to do what with the release)

The resulting entry would be:

PDL::Graphics::
::POGL            cdhhp PDL interface to Perl OpenGL                 CHM
