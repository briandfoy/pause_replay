The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Fork
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Simple interface to fork() system call.
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    news::comp.lang.perl.modules, RPI lily

  similar:
    Proc::Forkfunc, but that appears to be defunct.

  rationale:

    Logically, this module belongs in the Proc:: hierarchy, and since
    its only function is syntactic sugar for the fork() system call,
    Proc::Fork seems appropriate.

    Forking is easy, but the specifics require attention to detail. I
    always have to stop and think "What does fork return if I'm the
    parent? The child? Oh yeah..." Since forking is mostly the same
    every time (with only a few variants), and since you have to stop
    and think about it every time, it seems a good candidate for an
    off-the-shelf, easy-to-use set of functions. I hope this module fits
    the bill.

    I tried registering this module once before, but it didn't make the
    module list. Either I goofed in registering it (likely), or the
    request was silently ignored (or lost along the way). This is my
    second attempt, hope it works this time.

    Thanks, Eric.
