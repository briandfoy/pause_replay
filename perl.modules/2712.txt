From: jwadsack@wadsack-allen.com (Jeremy Wadsack)

As of 0.42 (and I just posted 0.50 today), the package GDGraph3d
includes the GD::Graph3d namespace. The modules in the package are all
in the GD::Graph namespace, but including the GD::Graph3d namespace
makes it easier to find in CPAN (e.g. perl -MCPAN -e'install
GD::Graph3d').

I would like to have this 'officially' registered for my account (WADG).
Martien Verbruggen (who uses the GD::Graph namespace) is ok with this
and we work together on keeping these packages consistent and connected.

Here's the modlist line for this module:

GD::
::Graph    RdpO     Create 3d charts using GD and GD::Graph    WADG


Thank you in advance,
