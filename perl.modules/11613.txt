Hi!

Recently I required access to Solaris shadow passwords for a client
project. I could not find an existing wrapper module, so I wrote one.

I would appreciate any comments, especially about:
- namespace
- availability of the shadow password API on other platforms

Here is the README:

Unix::ShadowPasswords
   Description
     Unix::ShadowPasswords Perl interface to the Unix shadow password API

   Download
         You can download Unix::ShadowPasswords from my website at
         http://free.prohosting.com/~lupe/Personal/Perl/Unix-ShadowPasswords/ .

   Prerequisites
     perl 5.005_03  While it is quite possible that this module will work
                    with earlier or later versions of perl, it has only been
                    tested with 5.005_03, 5.6.1, and 5.7.3.

     shadow password C API

                    Solaris             Tested with Solaris 2.6 and 8.
                                        Solaris does not provide the
                                        sgetspent() function.

                    Linux               Tested with Debian GNU/Linux 3.0.
                                        Linux provides the sgetspent()
                                        function.

                    FreeBSD             FreeBSD 4.5 does not have a shadow
                                        password API.

                    Others              If you try to install this module on
                                        a different platform, please send me
                                        feedback about it's shadow password
                                        API. I need the value of the $^O
                                        variable to identify the platform,
                                        the output of "man getspnam" et al,
                                        and the shadow.h include file.

                                        I will then try to integrate support
                                        for your platform. Of course, if you
                                        do that yourself, patches are
                                        welcome.

   Bugs
     Support for Threads is not implemented. It would use the getpw*_r
     functions. Currently, the non-reentrant functions are always used.

   Build/Installation
     Standard build/installation supported by ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3)...

             perl Makefile.PL
             make
             make test
             make install
