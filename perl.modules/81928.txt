I would like to open a discussion regarding a module name for a new 
ordered-hash module that I've been developing under the proposed name 
"Data::Hasray" (short for hashed array).

Here's some info from my README file:

FROM THE SYNOPSIS

Data::Hasray provides an object-oriented interface to tied, ordered
hashes. Hash elements may be assigned keys explicitly or automatically
in mix-and-match fashion like arrays in PHP.

It also includes support for trees of nested hasrays, tree traversal,
and conversion to and from native Perl data structures.

Suggested uses include structured configuration information or HTTP
query parameters in which order may at least sometimes be significant,
for passing mixed positional and named parameters, or for porting PHP
code.


ALTERNATIVES (FROM SEE ALSO)

Array::AsHash
    An array wrapper to manage elements as key/value pairs

Array::Assign
    Allows you to assign names to array indexes

Array::OrdHash
    Like Array::Assign, but with native Perl syntax

Tie::IxHash
    An ordered hash implementation with a different interface and data
    structure and without auto-indexed keys and some of Data::Hasray's
    other features

Tie::Hash::Array
    Hashes stored as arrays in key sorting-order


RATIONALE AND DIFFERENCES

Hashes are a natural data structure for organizing information, and arrays
are a natural data structure for building ordered lists. Sometimes you
want your organized data (hashes) to be ordered too, like an array. One
example would be resource configuration information, organized by
resource name, for resources that must be loaded in a specific order
(e.g. due to dependencies) rather than some pseudo-random order.

Some of the key features that distinguish Data::Hasray from other
implementations are as follows:

1) The ability to mix-and-match values with and without explicit keys.
    Values without keys are assigned a sequential index as key
    automatically. PHP, for example, also supports this.

2) Built-in path traversal that supports auto-vivification of nested
    data structures just like you would expect when using native hashrefs
    and arrayrefs.

3) Easy conversion to or from native Perl hashes and arrays either at
    the level of a single hasray or as a nested tree of hasrays, with
    either an array-based or hash-based emphasis.

** CUT **

The full pod docs show more about how the interface and syntax differs 
from other implementations, and I'll be happy to post them upon request.
