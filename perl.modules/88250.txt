The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WL
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl Wayland protocol binding
  userid:      LKUNDRAK (Lubomir Rintel)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    https://github.com/lkundrak/perl-wayland

  similar:
    X11

  rationale:

    Wayland is a display server protocol for communication between
    graphical application and compositors in Linux. It aims to replace X
    Window System.

    The protocol is object-oriented and the Perl bindings map Wayland
    object hierarchy to Perl objects.

    Name "WL" was chosen so that Wayland objects, requests and events
    don't have overly long names when mapped to Perl objects.

    A top level namespace is used for the above reason as well as
    because no other top-level namespace seem to be really suitable.

    Bindings for X Window System are another case of this approach
    (shortened to "X11" and using top-level namespace).

    The convention of shortening "Wayland" to "wl" is used in the
    official C bindings too.

    If you're going to suggest an alternative please bear in mind that
    with long names the request/event names might get inconveniently
    long (currently e.g. WL::wl_shell_surface::ping or
    WL::wl_buffer::release).

The resulting entry would be:
