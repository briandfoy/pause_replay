Hi Dirk

DBI-1.45-5.8.4 is provided at no (zero) cost per unit, and can be 
downloaded from the following URI. Click the "Download" link.

http://search.cpan.org/~hoymich/DBI-1.45-5.8.4/

Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.17 is provided at no (zero) cost per unit, and 
can be downloaded from the following URI. Click the "Download" link.

http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-2.17/

The product "ME-Lite-3.01_05" does not exist.

However, I believe your client may be referring to the product 
"MIME::Lite-3.01_05".

MIME-Lite-3.01_05 is provided at no (zero) cost per unit, and can be 
downloaded from the following URI. Click the "Download" link.

http://search.cpan.org/~yves/MIME-Lite-3.01_05/

A formal quotation for these products should not be necessary, as all 
are released by their respective authors at no cost.

However, please note that no warranty of any kind is offered for these 
products, including that of merchantability. Please see the licensing 
details in the respective products for details.

If you require a warranty or support for these products, I believe the 
author of the DBI product provides a support service. For the other two 
products, their respective authors (details on the product page) may 
provide this, or alternatively there are a few companies that provide 
general support for CPAN-based modules if you absolutely require 
support. Information available on request.

All products are cross-platform, and should run on most operating 
systems, subject to any ongoing bugs or errors for those products.

For details of any outstanding issues for each product, please see the 
"View/Report Bugs" links and the CPAN Testers "View" link on each of the 
respective product pages, which will detail any outstanding bugs/issues, 
and details the platforms that those specific versions have been tested 
as being correct on.

For maximum international compatibility, maintainability and 
collaboration, by convention all products in the CPAN are delivered in 
English, and in almost all cases in United States English (EN_us).

All software is delivered electronically (via the aformentioned 
"Download") links.

I'm afraid there is no fax number available, as the CPAN is an entirely 
virtual organisation. Hopefully the lack of any need for an invoice will 
negate this issue.

I have cc'ed this response to dhaller@ccpsoft.de

Finally, I would further note that this email list is not the most 
appropriate destination for this request. Indeed, because all products 
are provided at zero cost, generally you may simply download any product 
you wish at any time you wish.

See http://search.cpan.org/ for the interface to locate the products you 
need out of the 10,000 available on the CPAN.

Warranty or support is often available from the respective authors, or 
again, there are some companies that provide general support in this area.

Best Regards

Adam Kennedy
