First of all - thanks for replying to bulk88's query. That put aside, I'd like
to note that I hereby volunteer to maintain Time::HiRes (which I'm making an
active use of) - assuming I am found suitable enough for that, and that no
more suitable candidate will volunteer. I do hope other people will volunteer
though, in which case I'll try to collaborate with them. 

Regards,
