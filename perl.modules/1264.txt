Hello,

I was trying to make a couple of minor changes to Net::DLookup's pod after
logging into pause (in the edit module section).  Though the module is listed in
the modules list (at http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html), it's not
shown in my edit modules section.

How would I go about updating the module?  Delete the previous one? Try to
overwrite it?  Wait a few days until it shows up in the edit modules section?

Any suggestions you can offer would be greatly appreciated,

Jasmine
