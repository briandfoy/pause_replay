I agree that a new top-level hierarchy "Genetics" would be a good idea
for this functionality, especially with all of the talk about Perl and
bioinformatics.  But it's usually a good idea to not use the top-level
spot for the module name directly.  If you can't make the name be more
specific, how about Genetics::Tools?
