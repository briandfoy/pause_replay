It indeed looks much more intuitive than before. Just one thing,
there's a long standing tradition to discourage
extremely::deep::nesting::namespaces. E.g. one could shorten
Net::Address to NetAddr. No matter how ugly it looks, it seems
understandable and less to type. Leading to

         IP::Address             -->     NetAddr::IP
         Tie::IP::Address        -->     Tie::NetAddr::IP
         Net::Subnet::Count      -->     NetAddr::IP::Count

Other opinions welcome,
