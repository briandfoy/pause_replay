Correct. I was hoping the others would follow automatically:

Step 1:

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::DateTime.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::ZirePhoto.

Step 2:

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::Address.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::Datebook.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::Mail.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::Memo.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::PDB.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::Raw.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::StdAppInfo.

Made CJM primary maintainer of Palm::ToDo.
