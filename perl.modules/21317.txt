Well, I made a mistake with Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB. I should have realised
that it would only be of interest to UK Perl hackers, and now we have
Finance::Bank::HSBC, Finance::Bank::Fubon::TW, Finance::Bank::Postbank_de,
Finance::Bank::DE::Netbank, to name but a few. Lots of different naming
conventions, and a namespace (Finance::Bank::) which is now unpleasant to
wade through.

I'm working on some code which handles UK postcodes, and I don't want to
make the same mistake again. Should there be a way of naming modules which
designates them as only of interest for a particular country, like the
Lingua::X:: stuff? I considered Locale::<iso country code> but Locale
is generally used in a stricter sense. Country::<iso code>? Or does it
make sense to do something like Finance::Bank::DE::Netbank, and put the
country code at a higher level?

Or am I just worrying unduly?
