} Can someone please make JJORE the owner of B::Utils?  Simon is 
} co-maintainer on it, and I'm not at all, so I can't give it to him.
} 
} I've already given him B::Generate.

Your change didn't take effect; pause does not show my name on
B::Generate.

I don't know what happened to B::Utils since it isn't visible from the
PAUSE's View Permissions page. Does this mean I can publish a new
version and it falls into first-come permissions under my name?
