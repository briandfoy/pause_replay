The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Web::Scaffold
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: build minimalist fancy web sites
  userid:      MIKER (Michael Robinton)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Web::Scaffold is a module that allows you to easily and quickly
    build a fancy web site with drop down menus an a variable number of
    columns. This is accomplished with a simple specification and a
    series of minimal html page includes that are written in very basic
    html.

    Web::Scaffold is much simpler and easier to use than templating or
    sophisticated web site management tools.

The resulting entry would be:
