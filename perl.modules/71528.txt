Hello - I=A0inadvertently=A0uploaded a module to PAUSE (Dist::Zilla makes
this a little too easy) without intending to and while I have
scheduled it for deletion, I was hoping there might be a way to delete
it sooner as it's not intended to be open source (as the license
indicates). =A0I use Dist::Zilla to upload to an internal CPAN server
and I didn't realize when I changed my dist.ini over to use the @Basic
plugin bundle that it included the UploadToCPAN plugin (in addition to
my internal release publishing plugin).

In short, I was hoping to have BPHILLIPS/DR-SAP-015.tar.gz (and any
associated files) deleted ASAP rather than having it sit out there
(http://search.cpan.org/~bphillips/DR-SAP-0.15/) all week. =A0If
possible, preventing it from being archived on BackPAN would be ideal
but I realize these systems are probably automated such that some
things may be more difficult to circumvent.

Can anyone help me with this? =A0I would be in your debt :-)
