I considered that. The short answer is: That was my first idea. Please=20
check out the module at http://xuefang.com/perl/ and compare its code
and POD with Vanilla. If you still feel the same way, I'd like to know.=20

I don't say 'inappropriate'. When I started work, I thought it was a=20
trivial hack best submitted to current maintainer (CHORNY) as a patch. I
committed to compatibility; '::Any' can be used exactly like Vanilla=20
S::C. Currently, it passes all tests shipped with Vanilla 1.0.4=20
(modified, of course, to load ::Any instead).=20

Turned out that the work to be done was non-trivial. Vanilla prints
smart output from different places and in different ways. The issue
arose: What exactly is the scope of a use() of this module? If it is
used with different args, how does it maintain state?=20

Not to commit /l=C3=A8se majest=C3=A9/, I found the code itself hard going.=
=20

    "...almost every maintainability issue is, by itself, marginal.=20
     It=E2=80=99s  only collectively that subtleties, clevernesses, and=20
     esoterica begin to sabotage comprehensibility."    --PBP p165

I have broken out a lot of compact code and added a large number of
plain old dumb comments. I've changed many identifiers. My code may be
too verbose. Diffs to Vanilla are starting not to make sense.=20

The issues interact. I did not find any way to shoehorn state into some=20
routines without rewriting them. I could not untangle some idioms
without introducing a new variable, possibly caller-dependent. Adding
$state_of($caller_id) to most subroutine calls meant that long lines
became longer; named parameters made them longer still. Then breaking
the long lines caused other issues.=20

This process of rewriting is only going to continue as I implement=20
features, eliminate bugs, and improve stability. So far, I speak only of
fully compatible versions. But compatibility is a straitjacket and I can
see the possibility of a 2.0 release that would not be a drop-in=20
replacement for Vanilla 1.0.4.=20

Meanwhile, although the current maintainer is, so far, silent, the=20
original author, Damian Conway, has weighed in:
[http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=3D851245]. He favors 'Devel::Comments',
as does another PerlMonk.=20


Brian, you *have* put your finger on the key point. If I release my
work=20
under a new name, any choice will please some devs and annoy others.
The=20
only choice which requires a different process is submission as=20
Smart::Comments 1.1.0.=20

Personally, I'm leaning (today) toward 'Smart::Comments::File'. I don't=20
feel the 'Smart::' top level namespace was an ideal choice;
'Devel::Comments' might have been more in line with general module
naming conventions. But now, it may be unwise to put the current module
anywhere except under 'Smart::Comments::'. This is where devs will
search.=20

I feel the code I've worked on is good and the stuff waiting to go in is
better. It will be much better still if I can solicit comment and=20
incorporate suggestions. I need to pick a name, so I can point to the=20
work in progress. http://xuefang.com/perl/ is a clumsy workaround.=20

Please let me emphasize that my opinions on the name issue carry no=20
weight. The determining opinions are of developers who may want to use=20
the new/upgraded module.=20

--=20
