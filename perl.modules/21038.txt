Yes, I'm still here. Sorry, the last mail I recall getting from you=20
was about "ragged diff hunks".

There's already A::Diff and A::DiffOld in my package. As far as=20
combining the efforts, I wouldn't mind. Nor would I mind you using=20
the Algorithm::Diff::Apply name. However, I don't really have much=20
time to maintain Perl (and I'm not using Perl any more). Are you=20
interested in picking up A::D?
