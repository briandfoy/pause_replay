The latter.

When I registered that namespace, I chose "pre-alpha", and the code
hasn't changed since 2001.

However, I did decide to upload it in its present state; though I
haven't written tests for most things, I think a fair bit works -- or
worked when I last tried it. So it could be useful for somebody, and
perhaps now that I've been reminded of it I might even get it into
slightly better shape.

So, there's now code on CPAN (Lingua::Zompist::Cuezi v0.01).

Cheers,
Philip
