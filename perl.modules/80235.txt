Ryan, when did you try mailing Matthew? Generally speaking, before we 
transfer ownership of the module, please have a look at

http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover

and search a little for Matthew. I found 
https://plus.google.com/105423347105054802559/posts which could very 
likely be the right Matthew for you to contact. We prefer to solve these 
issues with active cooperation from the author. If you still fail to get 
a reply within a couple of weeks or if Matthew replies and lost his 
PAUSE credentials, we'll gladly assist in the transition.

Best regards,
Steffen
(for the PAUSE admins)
