     why:

    I have been programming on OO perl for years and have numerous
    ideas for modules I would like to write and contribute to the
    community. I currently work in the Indiana University Digital
    Library Program and during my course of work, feel that I have
    written numberous modules that would be of benifit to the perl
    community as a whole.

    More immediate, and OO module to get information about a tiff file
    that I think is abstract enough that anyone who uses perl and tiff
    images could benifit.
