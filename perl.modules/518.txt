Hi, I have an author ID (DMUSGR) and, after a period of inactivity, I
have uploaded my modules - all OK so far. I received an email from someone
looking to download the module who pointed out that there is no Full Name
entry in the by-authors list.

This is _not_ a big problem but I report it in case it is evidence of a
bug. I guess that something happened between my registering (16 Aug 1999)
and first loading my module (22 Oct 1999)

HTH, Dermot
