Dear CPAN/PAUSE admins:

Last July, I identified some major flaws in Sub::Uplevel.  I opened a 
ticket on RT ( https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13893 ). 
Shortly thereafter, I wrote a patch and sent it to the author by email. 
  At that point, the author said he had computer issues and would get 
back to it.

I emailed him very briefly about once a month until November or December 
just to remind him that I was waiting for him to look it over, and never 
heard back.  In one of those, I offered to take it over if he didn't 
have time to manage it.  I didn't hear back.

I emailed him again a couple weeks ago about it, after noticing new 
warnings being thrown by the module after the Perl 5.8.8 "no warnings" 
bugfix.  Again, I offered to take on comaintainer responsibilities to 
get a quick patch out for the warnings bug and a developer release for 
the bigger change.  I re-posted the patch on RT (including the warnings 
patch) to attract attention (in case my email was lost in spam filters). 
  I got no response to the email or RT message.

Based on the apparent lack of interest by the current maintainer, I 
would like to request a transfer of maintainership for Sub::Uplevel. 
The immediate goal will be a 0.09 release that fixes warnings under Perl 
5.8.8.  I would also release a developers' version, 0.10_01, with the 
more substantial bug fix to allow those using Sub::Uplevel (such as 
Test::Exception) to test the new version before a production version is 
released.

Respectfully,
David Golden (DAGOLDEN)
