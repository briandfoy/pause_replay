I'd like to register the a new module I'm working on as:

HTML::StickyForms adpO HTML form generation for mod_perl/CGI    PMH

I realise the name isn't very nice, but it's the best name that came out of the
discussion on modperl@apache.org which wasn't already taken. This module is
basically the <INPUT> generation routines from CGI.pm, but with a much more
restrictive interface, and a lot smaller code. The reason for this is to
provide "sticky" input fields, whose values may be gathered from CGI (2.x),
CGI::State (CGI 3.x) or Apache::Request objects.

replying, "I don't see why not.  It's got bloody well everything else."
