Hi Autrijus, 

Thanks for the patch. I have applied it and rolled a new release (0.03)
which is available from http://vipul.net/perl/sources/sidekick/

I have retracted the VERSION patch for the moment for two reasons: Perl
versions are real numbers, and your patch treats them like canonical
version strings. This might cause a problem in future, eg when we go from
0.3 to 0.11; in perl 0.3 > 0.11.

Also, CVS insists on starting revision numbers with 1.x. I am sure there's
a way to force it to use 0.x, I just haven't figured it out yet.

A question for those reading the SDK list and module@perl.org: should I
upload sidekick to CPAN?

best,
vipul.
