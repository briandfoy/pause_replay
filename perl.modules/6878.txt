No worries.  I'm actually surprised that the CPAN uploader system
allowed you to do it.  I thought there was supposed to be some permissions
system in place.

It's been a long time and I get a lot of mail.  (-:

I do admit to being rather slack given that quite a few people
have sent mail about various bugs in Netpacket.  Unfortunately it
wasn't something that I used regularly anymore so I didn't manage
to find much time for it.  Netpacket is now on sourceforge which
will hopefully make it easier for other people to commit stuff
and/or take over maintainership of the project if that is necessary.

You were probably justified in releasing something given that it
has been a couple of years since I did, and how unresponsive I've
been.

Sorry - I'll update the changes/readme file to include a list of
contributors for the next release.  Unfortunately I didn't keep
your original mails. )-:  I now have a habit of committing changes
with the email address of the patcher in the CVS message to
remind me where the patch came from.

Hey, I remember this email address bouncing before - odd...


Regards,
