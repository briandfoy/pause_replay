Description: INSPEC module -- allows extraction of citation information
from INSPEC via the www.  Supplying the journal name, volume and page
number this module will retreive the citation (authors, title, abstract
etc.) from INSPEC and put it in your BibTeX database.  visit
www.uark.edu/misc/getcite to learn more.

Development stage: working beta
Support level: free
language used: perl 5.0 or > only
Description: INSPEC to BibTeX translator via www

This module contains a script and two .pm files.  The script calls the
.pm's and the user can use the script or write his own using the library
interface contained in teh .pm files.

I have discussed this with some people locally, however no public
discussion on any of the perl lists or newsgroups.  I dont think there is
any perl module that provides an interface to INSPEC, so I dont think this
can be tagged onto another project.  This utitliy is very usefull and
saves a lot of typing for the BibTeX user.  Several people are using it at
our location and are very happy with it.  As with all software however,
there are features and improvements that can be made so I would like to
make it availible to as many people as possible to solicit suggestions.
