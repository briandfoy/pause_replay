Hi Bryan,
Someone did indeed fix it, the problem was that when we tried to make
changes the public email field (set to CENSORED by default) was failing some
sort of validation, I somehow didn't notice the error message. We changed
the field to include an @ and all was well.

Thanks for your attention to this.

Kind Regards
Alec

Someone may have already fixed this for you, but I didn't have a
problem changing your account info and getting the changes to stick. It
looks like the hompage value now has http:// in front of it.

Besides someone fixing it fo you, maybe it worked the first time but
there was a browser or cache issue showing you old versions. *shrug*
