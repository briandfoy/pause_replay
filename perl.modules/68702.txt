The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Browse
  DSLIP:       MdpOa
  description: Flexibly list rows with delete and link-outs
  userid:      ROGERHALL (Roger A Hall)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.ourpug.org/

  similar:
    CGI::List DBIx::Browse CGI::CRUD Catalyst::Plugin::CRUD
    CatalystX::CRUD

  rationale:

    The related modules DBIx::Browse, CGI::CRUD,
    Catalyst::Plugin::CRUD, and CatalystX::CRUD provide a one-stop shop
    for CRUD/BREAD functionality. While this can be very handy for many
    situations, sometimes you really need *very customized* forms for
    create/edit/update.

    CGI::Browse is more like CGI::List with additional flexibility. It
    focuses on providing just the review/browse functionality plus
    deletes, while enabling link-outs from any number of columns (each
    based on any columnâs value). This allows the developer to build
    lateral or drill-down links in addition to or instead of edit/update
    links. Additional features that can be enabled include: clickable
    column headings for sorting rows, single row or multiple row
    deletes, default HTML layout or hashref values for use with Template
    layouts, and CSS styles including flexible alternating row coloring
    for readability. Also included are traditional review/browse
    features like âprevious/next linksâ (move to contiguous pages),
    âshow X rowsâ text box (set view window), âgo to pageâ drop
    down (move to any page), âstarting on row Xâ index label, and
    âsorted by columnXâ sort label. Each of these features are
    included in the default HTML layout but may be excluded by using a
    Template.

    The package includes a stylesheet, default template, javascript
    file, working CGI scripts, and the actual SQL data used in the
    examples. The documentation illustrates all features and outlines
    the necessary changes to get the sample scripts running on any
    server. Running examples can be tested at
    http://www.ourpug.org/cgi-bin/eg/browse.cgi and
    http://www.ourpug.org/cgi-bin/eg/browse_tmpl.cgi.
