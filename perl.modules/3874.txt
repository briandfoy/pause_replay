=head1 NAME

Bundle::Bugzilla - A bundle of the modules required for Bugzilla.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Bugzilla'>

=head1 CONTENTS

DBI

Data::Dumper

DBD::mysql

Chart::Base

Date::Parse

This bundle installs the prerequisites for Bugzilla.

After installing this bundle, it is recommended that you run the magic
checksetup.pl script to check that all modules are in place and setup
the tables in the database.

=over 4

=item DBI
This module is used to connect to the database that Bugzilla uses
to store its information.

=item Data::Dumper
The Data::Dumper module provides data structure persistence for Perl
(similar to Java's serialization).  It comes with later sub-releases of
Perl 5.004, but a re-installation just to be sure it's available won't
hurt anything. Data::Dumper is used by the MySQL related Perl modules.

=item DBD::mysql
This module is used to connect to the database that Bugzilla uses
to store its information.

=item Chart::Base
Used to create the bug charts in the reporting functions in reports.cgi.

=item Date::Parse
Enables SQL-style search query statements for Bugzilla.

*    It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you
have discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there
was at least a little bit of interest. We are quite open for submissions,
but we owe our users at least some rudimentary quality control. If your work
has never been discussed publicly, then it's extremely difficult for us to
make our judgement whether to accept the submission or not:

I discussed this idea with the bugzilla team in #mozwebtools on the
irc.mozilla.org server and received enthusiastic support as this would
shorten the installation time for the product.

Thanks

Zach
