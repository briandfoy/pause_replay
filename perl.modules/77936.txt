I just briefly looked over it, to verify that it made sense... Save for the obvious coding
convention preference rant, I can't really comment on the design as it appears to be made
for a totally different purpose than ours...

Our creation that got as far as beta, before the feature/upgrade got indefinitely delayed
was intended to be an on the fly (and low io) exporter machanism, which used to (and AFAIK,
still does) crawl through the system to look for your selection, copy them to a temporary
location, create a .tar on the disk, and stream that to the browser...

Our creation was basically a bare bones implementation of "here's a handle, archive A as /foo/bar,
B as /boo/baz, wait for more"..
