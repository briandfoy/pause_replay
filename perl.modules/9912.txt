Greetings.

I am 25 year old guy on a mission to inspire young people all
over the world to chase their dreams.
I am going to do this by showing that you can have your dreams, 
no matter what they are, no matter how crazy
or ridiculous they may seem, no matter what everyone tells you,
and no matter how far they are from your
present reality. Believe it?

I am trying to gather support for what I am doing, and so am asking you to
take 5 mins to visit http://www.ificandream.com/ (pronounced If I Can Dream)
and let me know what you think.

I am not trying to sell you anything and there is nothing to buy, just a
chance
to help me show young people that we can have whatever our heart desires.

Sincerely requesting your help,
Nathan Damianos.
