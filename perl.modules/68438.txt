The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Forks::Super
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: extensions to fork/wait/waitpid
  userid:      MOB (Marty O'Brien)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parallel::*, Proc::Fork, Proc::Launcher

  rationale:

    This is a kitchen sink module for fork()'ing and managing
    background processes, implementing useful features from several
    existing modules plus a few new ones:

    + forking directly to shell command or Perl subroutine + throttling
    by number of background procs, cpu, memory, or by (*) arbitrary
    user-defined criteria + apply timeouts to background processes + (*)
    schedule jobs to start after a delay + obtain detailed info on
    background processes like (*) current status, exit status, (*) start
    time, (*) end time, (*) reap time + access to child process's STDIN,
    STDOUT, STDERR filehandles for convenient IPC + user-defined
    dependency relationships between jobs (i.e., job 2 must wait for job
    1 to complete before starting) + (*) prioritized queues so
    blocked/deferred jobs are started in order of their urgency + set
    operating system priority and CPU affinity of child processes + (*)
    wait, waitpid calls with timeouts

    (*) - new feature, AFAIK

    The working title of the namespace is Forks::Super. I have several
    other suggestions, and appreciate the collective wisdom of the
    Modules List maintainers for selecting a good module name:

    Forks::Ext Parallel::Super Parallel::Ext Parallel::KitchenSink
    SwissArmy::Fork

    Feedback appreciated at mob@cpan.org .

The resulting entry would be:

Forks::
::Super           adpfp extensions to fork/wait/waitpid              MOB
