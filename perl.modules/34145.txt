The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::Frink::Eval
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Wrapper for evaluating Frink expressions
  userid:      CMO (Clayton O'Neill)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Email

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is a wrapper around the Frink interpreter that allows
    normal, and restricted evaluation of Frink statements and
    expressions. I think the module fits into the existing Language::
    namespace. Since it's possible I, or someone else, may write other
    Frink related modules, I thought it best to qualify it with ::Eval,
    to limit the scope.

    Blurb from the Frink web page: "Frink is a practical calculating
    tool and programming language designed to help us all to better
    understand the world around us, to help us get calculations right
    without getting bogged down in the mechanics, and to make a tool
    that's really useful in the real world."

    More information on Frink can be found at
    http://futureboy.homeip.net/frinkdocs/

  enteredby:   CMO (Clayton O'Neill)
  enteredon:   Sat Aug 14 15:56:31 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Language::Frink::
::Eval            adpOp Wrapper for evaluating Frink expressions     CMO
