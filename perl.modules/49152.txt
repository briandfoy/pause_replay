Subject: Module submission Net::Bluetooth

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Bluetooth
  DSLIP:       bdhhg
  description: Perl interface to Bluetooth
  userid:      IGUTHRIE (Ian Guthrie)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    Currently there is no module that gives a user access to Bluetooth
    functionality. The module I am working on will allow users to access
    Bluetooth via the BlueZ library on different flavors of Unix. Python
    and Java currently have interfaces for the BlueZ library but Perl
    does not.

    The API for this module is quiet extensive and has to support a lot
    of varied functionality. I am currently about 2/3rds of the way
    done. So far there is support for local device detection, remote
    device discovery, remote service discovery, and RFCOMM connections.

    Once the BlueZ interface is finished, I would also like to add
    support for Windows.

    I want to go ahead and register this namespace since I am nearing
    completion and I have put a good amount of work into it so far.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Bluetooth       bdhhg Perl interface to Bluetooth                  IGUTHRIE
