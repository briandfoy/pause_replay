Subject: Opportunity isn't knocking for Friend...

Friend,

Ever hear that old saying, "opportunity knocks only once?"

Well, I'm here to tell you that opportunity isn't knocking on your door...no, it's literally kicking it down right now!

Here's the story - I've got my hands on something so cool that I absolutely need to get it into your hands this week!  There's not enough room to tell you about it here - so I posted it on a special website for valued clients just like you.

Just check it out:

Thanks,

Lou

P.S.  Stuff like this does not come around often...are you willing to let it pass you by??
