Hi Ron,

I thought you'd be interested to know that with me being added to the 
various other modules in the distro, a new upload has now worked.

Thanks again!
Ed

If you still have a problem, let me know (and hopefully someone else
will read this thread and know what to do :-).

It's 18:48 here now so I'm going off-line.
