I'm pretty sure that's the problem. PAUSE doesn't execute your code, so
it makes its best guess with a regex. In
PAUSE::mldistwatch::packages_per_pmfile, there is:

                $pline =~ m{
                         (.*)
                         \bpackage\s+
                         ([\w\:\']+)
                         \s*
                         ( $ | [\}\;] )
                        }x) {

http://pause.perl.org:5459/svn/pause/trunk/lib/PAUSE/mldistwatch.pm

It's not the best thing in the world, and you're the unlikely candidate
who trips it. If you make your source not match that regex, you won't
trip it. 

I didn't follow the code path to see if a simple 'noindex' would filter
that though.
