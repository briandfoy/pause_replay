The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MRTG::Config
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Parse large, complex MRTG config files fast
  userid:      SSCAFFIDI (Stephen R. Scaffidi)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    email,mailinglists,repository,perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    After thinking about it, I wish to use MRTG::Config instead of
    Config::MRTG since I have not seen MRTG's config file format in
    other applications, except ones related to MRTG.

    There is a definite need for improved tools for the MRTG
    application. This module will provide loading and parsing of the
    config file format that is an improvement over the methods used in
    MRTG_lib, and better suited towards writing applications around
    MRTG.

    I may eventually add facilities for the creation and manipulation
    of MRTG configuration files, as well as modules for managing large,
    complex MRTG installations. By choosing to use the MRTG:: namespace
    I can keep them all together so other users and developers will find
    them more easily.

The resulting entry would be:

MRTG::
::Config          adpOp Parse large, complex MRTG config files fast  SSCAFFIDI
