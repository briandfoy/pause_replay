Subject: Module submission App::Hiveminder

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Hiveminder
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: command line interface for Hiveminder
  userid:      GENEHACK (John SJ Anderson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Hiveminder API list, #hiveminder

  similar:
    Net::Hiveminder

  rationale:

    I'm writing a command line interface for the Hiveminder website
    using Net::Hiveminder and App::Cmd. Earlier, I proposed to call this
    module App::Smoker. That proposal was turned down (for predictable
    and understandable reasons).

    After brian d foy's suggestion to include 'Hiveminder' in the
    module name, I've emailed with Jesse Vincent (Hiveminder/Best
    Practical) and Shawn Moore (author of Net::Hiveminder), and they're
    okay with this module/CLI app being called App::Hiveminder, and it
    does seem like the most logical thing to name it.

    thanks, john.
