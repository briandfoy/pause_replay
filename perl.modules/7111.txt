The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CompBio
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: basic Comp. Biology (bioinformatics) library
  userid:      SEANQ (Sean P. Quinlan)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Boston Perl Mongers mailing list

  similar:
    bioperl

  rationale:

    Provide a set of modules and utilities used for many common, basic
    bioinformatics proceedures. CompBio is for computational biology,
    the original term used for what is now more commonly called
    bioinformatics. The bioperl project already has the, well, bioperl
    namespace, as well as bioinf.

    As indicated in the docs, my hope is not to replace or try to outdo
    bioperl (certainly not on my own!), but to provide a simpler
    solution to approaching many of the more common tasks I have found
    regularly needed. Besides CompBio.pm and CompBio/Simple.pm, I plan
    to make available asap CompBio/DB.pm which is a library of methods
    using DBI to provide easy ways to getting at commonly needed data.

    These modules, and some additional utilities and modules which I
    will upload to CPAN latter if the community feels they are
    appropriate, have all been developed wholly or patially under grants
    from the D.O.E. and the N.H.B.L.I. More info will be available in a
    post I'll send out to comp.lang.perl.modules shortly.

    Thanks for your time and consideration! -Sean Quinlan
