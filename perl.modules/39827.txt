Subject: Problem installing Image::Epeg

Hello,

I registered for and got the Image::Epeg namespace. However, even after 
uploading Image-Epeg-0.03.tgz (and being able to browse it on cpan.org) 
I'm unable to install with cpan.pm. I think something may be out of 
sync, but I'm unsure how to check.

I'm able to compile and install just fine if I actually download the 
.tgz. Thanks much for any insight.
