Subject: Module submission Class::Measure

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Measure
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Create, compare, and convert measurements.
  userid:      BLUEFEET (Aran Clary Deltac)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://www.arandeltac.com/ClassMeasureModule

  similar:
    None that I can find.

  rationale:

    Currently there is no easy way to convert between measurements. I
    have a semblance of this ability built-in to Geo::Distance, but want
    to abstract the concept so that anyone can mix and match measurement
    data. It works in a similar fashion as Class::Date, which is what
    inspired me interface-wise.

    This namespace (module) is necessary because it makes the handling,
    conversion, and math of measurements a lazy and perlish endeavor.
    Also, of the most benefit in my opinion is that modules that work
    with measurements can toss around measurement objects when before
    that would have been incompatible because of a lack of common unit
    types.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Measure         bdpOp Create, compare, and convert measurements.   BLUEFEET
