     why:

    I am writing a Perl module to list and extract the content of the
    Symbian SIS software installation package files. I wrote this based
    on the open source SIS package creation program makesis which is
    published at the Symbian web site. SIS package is something similar
    to rpm or deb packages but has different characteristics. I would
    like to contribute other programs too in the future.
