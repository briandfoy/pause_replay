There's also a messaging mechanism in PAUSE [0] which I just used to
write him a message into all of his pages he sees on PAUSE. So if he
is using a browser he now gets:

  This is the Message Board for user SKI. On the message board you see
  messages posted by an admin to a user in case that email doesn't work:

  2007-07-27 05:32:06 from ANDK@cpan.org

  You seem to be non-contactable at the moment. Please mail to
  modules@perl.org to clarify the status of your recent uploads.
  Thanks!

  Note: Only the poster of a message can delete it from the message
  board. Please contact them, so that they clear the board for you.


If this doesn't help I'm ready for a temporary nologin.
