The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Webqq::Client
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A webqq client in Perl Language
  userid:      SJDY (Perfi Wang)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    webqq is a service of tencent company in China this is so many
    implementation in different language on GitHub , like python java
    node.js but few in Perl Language I think there should be one webqq
    is widely used in China and A webqq robot is also welcomed in China
    Perl Developers by now There is no module namespace beginning with
    Webqq::* I think it's reasonable to use this namespace

  enteredby:   SJDY (Perfi Wang)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 26 16:06:08 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Webqq::
::Client          RdpOp A webqq client in Perl Language              SJDY
