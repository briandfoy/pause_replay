Anyone feel like taking care of this so older versions of CPAN.pm
Do The Right Thing?

Yes.  This problem should be fixed, though, for all core modules that 
are also useful for earlier versions of Perl.  (I know you can't fix 
this yourself, of course, except by bumping the version number.) 
The problem described on p5p earlier this week persists, and will 
until CPAN thinks that File::Spec comes from your tarball rather than 
from the Perl 5.6 distribution:

cpan> test File::Spec
Going to read /usr/local/src/.cpan/sources/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
CPAN: Compress::Zlib loaded ok
Going to read /usr/local/src/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
Scanning cache /usr/local/src/.cpan/build for sizes
Going to read /usr/local/src/.cpan/sources/modules/03modlist.data.gz
Running make for GSAR/perl-5.6.0.tar.gz

The most recent version "0.8" of the module "File::Spec"
comes with the current version of perl (5.6.0).
I'll build that only if you ask for something like
     force install File::Spec
or
     install GSAR/perl-5.6.0.tar.gz
