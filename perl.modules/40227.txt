hi there,
there is a small bug in the recent Net-xAP bundle, which is three typos that
lead to not being able to compile the package.
no problem though, but i wrote the author an email, which isnt existing
anymore, neither is his homepage (found on cpan).
what to do? :)
best regards, johannes russek
