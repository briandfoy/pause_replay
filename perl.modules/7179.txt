Andreas said he'd introduce me, but I'll introduce myself :)

I just volunteered to help out here, and so here I am.  I think most of
you know me already, so I won't really bother giving my life story or
anything.

I see a few emails today which I have comments/thoughts on, including:

Diff.pm/Patch.pm 
	probably shouldn't be at top level; how about Devel::?

LANGMEAD/Data::MacResFile
	Data is a meaningless top-level namespace -- almost *every* CPAN
	module deals with Data.  This module would be better off in
	MacOS:: even if it can be used by other platforms, IMHO

DISHMAEL/Net::DHCP
	What is the relationship, if any, between this module and
	Net::DHCPClient, which already exists on CPAN?


Anyway, what is the process here?  Do I just email these people and Cc
you guys?  What tools/etc do we use to create new PAUSE IDs if we need
to?  How do things actually get added to the module list?  Is there 
anything else I need to do or need to know?  

K.
