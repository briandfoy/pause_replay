     why:

    I am immediately planning to contribute a module to talk to a
    specific multimeter chipset (datalogging over RS232). There is no
    currently-available module to talk to this chipset. This module is
    currently in development.

    After this, I'd like to expand this module. I also have other
    'in-house' developed perl modules to talk various odd network
    protocols that may be brushable-up to a state where they can be
    released for public consumption.
