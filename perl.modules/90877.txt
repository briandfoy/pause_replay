The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Toolkit
  DSLIP:       idphg
  description: Scripts to analyze problems in Bioinformatic
  userid:      WHG (Wenhui Gao)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Bio::ToolBox

  rationale:

    The scripts that I want to upload are used to conduct the problems
    about Bioinformatics, so I choose the Bio as the rootlevel
    namespace. The Bio rootlevel namespace is a well known one, like
    Bioperl and something else. The second namespce Toolkit is similar
    to the Bio::ToolBox, but there are some different between them, my
    module will focus on the more basic tools, like sequence parse, gene
    prediction result format conversion etc., which is helpful for
    common bioinformaticers to use it.

  enteredon:   Fri Jul 25 15:23:02 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
::Toolkit         idphg Scripts to analyze problems in Bioinformatic WHG
