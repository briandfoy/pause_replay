Request to register new user

fullname: Ben Daglish
  userid: BDAGLISHH
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: www.ben-daglish.net
     why:

    Help! I have a PAUSE account as BDAGLISH set up 9 years ago, and
    just requested a password reset but I suspect the original (possibly
    work-related) email address disappeared into the ether long ago,
    although I did just check my Yahoo account(!) and there was nothing
    there. Ermm - I'm definitely me - my website I think is reasonable
    proof that I'm the guy that wrote Music::Scales etc. :) Could
    somebody arrange for a reset to the above address, rather than a
    re-registration? Thanks!
