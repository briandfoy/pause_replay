Hi,

I have just uploaded Glade-Perl-0.40.tar.gz to PAUSE and it has already
appeared in the RECENT arrivals of my local CPAN mirror, great!

It is a module that produces Gtk-Perl source code from a Glade UI
definition file and, a while ago, I had some correspondence about it with
andreas.koenig@anima.de (Andreas J. Koenig).

Glade (the Gtk+/Gnome UI builder) will also be released as a part of Gnome
soon and I see that Gtk-Perl (KJALB) is linked under Gtk and Gnome in the 
08_User_Interfaces/ category. I guess that my module could be sensibly
linked in the same places but I'll be happy with whatever you think best.

Many thanks for all your hard work.

Regards, Dermot
