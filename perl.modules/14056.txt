The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::FreeDB2
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Clean OO FreeDB/CDDB access modules.
  userid:      ZOCCAV (Vincenzo Zocca)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    CDDB, Net::CDDB, FreeDB, Net::FreeDB, Audio::CD , CDDB::File,
    WebService::FreeDB and Net::CDDBSca

  rationale:

    The modules in the Net::FreeDB2* name space provide a clean OO
    interface to FreeDB/CDDB. It's structure is inspired by the
    Net::LDAP modules (Graham Barr).

    I know of the following name spaces to be related to FreeDB/CDDB: -
    CDDB - Net::CDDB - FreeDB - Net::FreeDB - Audio::CD - CDDB::File -
    WebService::FreeDB - Net::CDDBScan

    However, IMHO, my approach is rather clean and yields to less code
    for FreeDB/CDDB database access. Also, in Perl there's more than one
    way to do it.

    FYI I include the Net::FreeDB2* name space history: 1) The
    Net::FreeDB2* modules were first developed as CDDB*. When
    development was finished, I realized CDDB was already in use (Rocco
    Caputo). 2) FreeDB was the next alternative as FreeDB is not
    registered at PAUSE. Indeed, I did rename CDDB to FreeDB (renaming
    is resource intensive). Then I found that there is already a FreeDB
    module out there (B. W. Fitzpatrick, J.I. van Hemert and Richard
    Martin). 3) Net::FreeDB was again the next alternative. I did not
    check it out at PAUSE but did do the renaming after which I
    discovered Net::FreeDB was already in use (David Shultz). 4) Then I
    did some research and found the following related modules/name
    spaces in use: CDDB, Net::CDDB, FreeDB, Net::FreeDB, Audio::CD ,
    CDDB::File, WebService::FreeDB and Net::CDDBScan. 5) I checked them
    all out leaving the withdraw option open. 6) My conclusion is that
    Net::FreeDB2* is complementary to the already available modules. 7)
    Next time I'll check out PAUSE first.
