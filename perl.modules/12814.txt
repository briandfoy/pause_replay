Subject: ANNOUNCE diagnostics-1.2-alpha1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: J-FORGET@wanadoo.fr ((Jean Forget))

I have released a new alpha version of diagnostics-1.2 on CPAN
(user JFORGET). It should be available in a few hours.

The new features, compared with the previous alpha version:
- use File::Spec, so it will hopefully work with VMS, Mac OS and OS/2
- new parameter encoding, so the output will be UTF-8 or other
- some (not all) new 5.8.0 messages are explained in French
- advice to module writers regarding diagnostics.pm
- a few bug fixes.

The new featuers compared with the stable version
- you can select the language for the explanations (for the
moment, only French available)
- you can select a module instead of, or in addition to, the Perl
compiler/interpreter
- a few bug fixes.
- compatible with 5.6.0 or later.
