I haven't heard anything back from my request early last week for a
better namespace for my new module (which is tentatively under the name
Term::TUI).  I'd like to put it on CPAN, so I'd like to make sure that
the namespace is approved (and I have no objection to changing it at
this point).

Term::TUI is a simple text-based user interface module based on
Term::ReadLine.  Basically, it allows you to very easily define a
text interface to a bunch of perl modules.  The interface created
is similar to the gnuplot or lpc unix commands.  For more information,
you can look at the man page at:
   http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sbeck/TUI.html
or you can get the module at:
   http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sbeck/TUI.tar.gz

I'm not sure it should go in the Term:: namespace, but I don't see a
better alternative either.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks
