     why:

    I am reading Intermediate Perl and I would like to be able to do
    the exercises in Chapter 11: Contributing to CPAN.

    I am also enrolled in a year long software project course at my
    university, Charles Sturt University. We need to build a real system
    using Unified Process as the software development model. I may or
    may not decide to do this as a CPAN contribution.

    My primary interests are artificial neural networks,
    neuroplasticity, human interface devices and assistive technologies,
    and computer graphics.

    My project will probably be in one of those areas but I haven't
    decided on a specific problem or implementation technology yet.

    Thanks!
