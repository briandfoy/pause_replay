Hello PAUSE administrators,

These modules I recently received this notification about exist and
are on CPAN:

    RFID::Matrics
    RFID::Alien
    RFID::EPC

RFID::Base is not a module on its own, but is the home to the base
classes for the RFID classes implemented above.  There actually aren't
any classes in the RFID::Base namespace (I changed my mind about the
class names after registering); they are simply in the top-level RFID
namespace, for example RFID::Tag and RFID::Reader.  If it is better, I
could register those as seperate namespaces, or register the top-level
RFID namespace.  Feel free to make these changes on my behalf if it is
convenient.

Thanks,

----Scott.
