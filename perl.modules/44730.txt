Subject: Module submission JavaScript::Squish
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JavaScript::Squish
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Ccmpact JavaScript code to minimal length
  userid:      UNRTST (Joshua I. Miller)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Perl::Squish File::Comments

  rationale:

    Ccmpact JavaScript code to minimal length

    JavaScript::Squish provides methods to compact javascript source
    down to just what is needed. It can remove all comments, put
    everything on one line (semi-)safely, and remove extra whitespace.
    It breaks the process down into individual steps, and one can pick
    and choose what parts to complete to get a custom amount of
    compactness.

    Having a way to squish JavaScript allows one to comment the code to
    their hearts content, and not worry about burning up bandwidth.

    The module name was discussed here:
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2005-09/msg01198.html

    A few new features were also added since then: Copyright notices in
    comments can now optionally be retained. Comments may be pulled out
    into an array of all comments. String literals may be pulled out
    into an array.

    The second will likely be useful for File::Comments, which
    currently lacks proper parsing (not that this method is perfect, but
    it's better).

    Thank you
