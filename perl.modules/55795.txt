From: hds@caffeineconcepts.com (Hayden Stainsby)

I'm (re-)proposing a new Perl module using the namespace Metaweb.

The module will allow developers to authenticate to and query a  
Metaweb instance. A Metaweb is a database like information store that  
can be accessed via an HTTP connection using the Metaweb Query  
Language. The best (and to my knowledge only) example of a Metaweb is  
Freebase (http://www.freebase.com). Freebase is currently in alpha,  
and you need an account to access it, but once it reaches beta it  
will be accessible by everyone.

The main difference between a Metaweb and a traditional SQL based  
database is that queries and results are in a tree-like structure,  
rather than the traditional table-like results. Due to this and the  
possibility for expansions on the Metaweb namespace I have decided  
not to create a DBI driver such as DBD::mysql.

Any suggestions, comments, queries are more than welcome.

Thanks.
