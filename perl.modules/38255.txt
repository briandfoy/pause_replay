The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Conversation
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Turn a conversation into threads.
  userid:      RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    module-authors mailing list; IRC.

  similar:
    None known.

  rationale:

    After much deliberation on module-authors, I still wasn't willing
    to accept that this module is network-centric, or IRC-centric. The
    current maintainer of POE::Component::IRC also didn't think it was
    IRC-centric. Richard Soderberg suggested on IRC that it be called
    Text::Conversation, and at least one responder on module-authors
    agreed that it sounded good. That's why I'm requesting it go there.

    While the efficacy of a modules list has been debated a lot
    recently, I think this module should appear in it (provided it still
    exists) because there's nothing else like it. The name also doesn't
    evoke the module's threading nature, so having the description
    somewhere prominent will help people find it.

    Thanks!
