As Andreas knows (since I told him), I was somewhat taken unawares when 
I found out Damien's "Perl Best Practices" book was coming out with his 
recommendation that version.pm be used.  Although I can add a warning to 
the version.pm docs, I would rather help Andreas to get support into 
PAUSE so that this becomes a moot point.

I'm finally getting some wider real-world testing of version.pm and 
discovering the [hopefully] last remaining edge cases.  0.48 should be 
out soonish, which will include a structural change to the underlying 
version object, but also the initial changes required to support either 
XS or pure Perl version objects.
