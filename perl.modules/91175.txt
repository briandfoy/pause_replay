Request to register new user

fullname: Amarnath Ravikumar
  userid: AMARNUS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://amarnus.me
     why:

    I have been working a lot with the Mojolicious Perl framework over
    the past few months. I think some of the custom plugins that I have
    written could be useful to the wider Perl community in general and
    would like to share them on CPAN.
