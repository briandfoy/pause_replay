I agree as well. Though I'm interested in why Domizio says "for me is
problematic to not even know that someone is installing my modules".

I'd certainly *like* to know who's installing the DBI module, for
example, and I'm sure other authors would be interested for their modules.
But I would think it rude to have the software automatically report
information to me. Not to mention being an invasion of privacy.

Perhaps some standard mechanism could be built into perl module
installers that could be optionally enabled by users who are
willing to share that information.

Tim.
