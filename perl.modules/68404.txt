modules@perl.org is an administrative mailing list. We deal with 
permission issues and missing authors. For support of a specific module, 
please use the contact given in the module's documentation, use public 
help forums such as perlmonks.org or stackoverflow.com, or as a last 
resort, contact the maintainer directly.

Best regards,
Steffen
