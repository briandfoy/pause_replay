Steven was victim of the same bug I fixed on Sunday. Since then this
problem can be solved by reindexing. New uploads won't have it
anymore. I do not know how many uploads before Sunday are affected.
They can be identified in that "View Permissions" shows a
co-maintainer but no maintainer.

Offhand I do not see a simple SQL statement or perl program that finds
all of them. If it comes up more often, I'll think about it some more.

Sorry, Steven, for the bug. You're now officially blessed as the
maintainer. It just needs a day to propagate through the CPAN.
