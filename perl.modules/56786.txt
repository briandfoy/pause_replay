No, to the best of my knowledge, there isn't. Perhaps there should be a
list of modules-waiting-for-adoption. modules@perl.org-readers: What do
you think? Should there be something like that? How could we implement
it? Would just having a list of orphaned modules do? Or should we have
something like Adam's open repository (but with official blessing) house
them for collaborative maintenance on demand?

Andrew: I'll remove the registration from the deletion list since it's
valid.

Best regards,
Steffen
