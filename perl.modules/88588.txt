> Does that make sense to anybody??  Here's an example:

The idea sounds interesting and makes sense, but I wonder if there's a
better name for it. 

I didn't immediately think of Markdown with MD in this context, but
maybe that doesn't have to be part of the name. The main feature is
including parts in a MIME format, right?

If you still settle on the name you have now, that's fine.

Good luck, :)
