The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::MatchEntry
  DSLIP:       RmpOp
  description: Entry widget with advanced auto-completion
  userid:      WHOM (Wolfgang Hommel)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.tk, ptk@lists.Stanford.EDU

  similar:
    Tk::HistEntry,Tk::JBrowseEntry, Tk::SelectionEntry

  rationale:

    Tk::MatchEntry is yet another combination of an entry widget and a
    listbox attempting to provide user-friendly auto-completion.

    This one is modelled after the "recipient" entry widgets in modern
    email clients and differs from other currently well-known widgets
    (BrowseEntry, HistEntry, JBrowseEntry, SelectionEntry) as follows:

    - no "arrow button" attached. Instead, the listbox with
    auto-completion choices pops up automatically if there are at least
    2 different choices which match. If you need a button to popup the
    listbox, you can use the popup() method.

    - the listbox with auto-completion choices only shows those entries
    which still can match what the user is entering. Thus, the number of
    choices shown to the user usually decreases with increasing length
    of manually entered text.

    - advanced handling of case-insensitive auto-completion. Example:
    you provide an auto-completion choice "John Doe", and the user
    starts with a lower-case "j". Auto-completion will make "john Doe"
    out of it, however if the MatchEntry widget is left with accepting
    this auto-completion choice, "john Doe" will be auto-converted to
    "John Doe". On the other hand, the user could enter all-lowercase
    "jane doe" without auto-completion messing up anything.

    Available at:
    $CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/W/WH/WHOM/Tk-MatchEntry-0.1.tar.gz

  enteredby:   WHOM (Wolfgang Hommel)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb  7 14:01:44 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::MatchEntry      RmpOp Entry widget with advanced auto-completion   WHOM
