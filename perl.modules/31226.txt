It must be the same with you.  
Secondly, I want to assure you that this business is
100% risk free, real and very transparent. I will desire to deal with you =
personally alone, if you are capable as i will not want to involve a lot of =
people as regards making sure of strict confidentiality which is one of the =
keywords to the success of the transaction.
This money  presently is  deposited with an internationally affiliated =
private  Security
company in MADRID (SPAIN) as a personal consignment which was deliberatly =
done belonging to an associate of mine (presumably you) to be delivered
to him on request. 
I have almost concluded with the arrangements to have
this consignment delivery to my partner presented to
the firm and proceed with banking and transfers to our
chosen destination.
For this money to be used for further investment, I
will need the following from you.
1. To be very honest with me as well as show the highest
amount of seriousness, promptness and maintaing
confidentiality.

transfers or any other means to our chosen country or destination..
3. Furnish me with full details your full name,your
private phone and fax phone number including cell
phone and for easy reach and your occupation.
4,To act as my fund manager as well as investor in assisting me make sure =
that the funds are meaningfully used as that the funds are the only major =
hope of survival now and also to be a host to me and my family, comprising of =
my wife, two kids and an aged mother in your country once we finalise with =
transfering the funds safely from any of this affliated office.
Due to limitation of time I have to move out this
consignment as soon as possible and we need to get
familiarised fast as time is no longer on my side as I
need to conclude as soon as possible.
I have all the relevant deposit document as regards
the transaction and I can forward them to you 
for your perusal upon reaching a good business and
friendly relationship as well as agreement with
you.Please get back to me immediately  because we need to finalize soonest, =
ever y underground logistics works have been taken care of so we need not to =
