Probably you're a bad person, but that's not the point.
If you're only care to fix bugs, ask people like Adam Kennedy (or me) to take responsibility to
upload the releases to CPAN, use Adam's open repository to fix the bugs and all people will
be happy.

From my point of view, as CPAN author and as packager of CPAN packages in pkgsrc
this is a real and legitimate critic - if you take it personally, you're choice.

I sent you 3 month ago a patch for Tie::DBI - explaining what the patch does and why,
no reaction. Repository on github is not up-to-date comparing to uploaded releases at CPAN.
Tux (H.Merijn Brand) asked friendly for a co-working in Tie::DBI regarding his Tie::Hash::DBD
work - practically no response from you.

Be sure, I don't touch github more than necessary. It's not my world. You made the release,
you are responsible. This isn't a one-time-issue, you seem to have more responsibility than
your time seems to allow.

Again: if you're only interested in fixing bugs, this is very ok for me, but then go and find
a responsible person who ensures the quality of the uploaded packages. There are some
and I'm really thankful for any person who's fixing bugs. Great, welcome, awesome.
But frankly, persons who fixing bugs doesn't need to be the same persons who make
releases.

>Enjoy.

I do :)
Please keep enjoying!
