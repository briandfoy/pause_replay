Dear brian d foy,

sorry, found this e-mail very late, so please excuse this late response. 
Yes it it is, easy but in my opinion the question is,
what kind of programming style you prefer. I think it makes sense to 
build objects even  from simple data structures
for two reasons:

   * the code does not look so abstract. There is a point where I put my 
subroutines in. So I give it a name.
      If it is the right name, is questionable, but until today I did 
not found a better one.
   * the other reason is more technical. The interface is restricted and 
can be easily shared between a lot of modules.

Please see Chest.pm and related reviews where even that what you pointed 
out is criticised too.

http://search.cpan.org/~sknpp/Chest-0.082/

I'm interested to improve my work, so it is welcome on CPAN.

With best regards,
Sebastian Knapp
