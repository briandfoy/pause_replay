The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hostfile::Manager
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Manage a hostfile by composing fragments
  userid:      MIRABELLA (Anthony Mirabella)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Hostfile::Manager module is named to simply and clearly reflect
    its function. It is a simple object-oriented interface for managing
    hostfiles, primarily targeted at *NIX-type systems but that should
    be usable on other systems with hostfiles as well.

  enteredby:   MIRABELLA (Anthony Mirabella)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 30 03:04:28 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Hostfile::
::Manager         bdpOp Manage a hostfile by composing fragments     MIRABELLA
