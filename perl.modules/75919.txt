Subject: Module submission PDL::Graphics::PLplot
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, dhunt@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDL::Graphics::PLplot
  DSLIP:       Mdch2
  description: Interface to the plplot plotting library
  userid:      DHUNT (Douglas Hunt)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    perldl@jach.hawaii.edu (PDL mailing list), PLplot development list
    <Plplot-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>

  similar:
    PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT PDL::Graphics::OpenGL

  rationale:

    This module has existed and been used for years. It does not seem
    to be installable from CPAN, and I'd like it to be.

    It is currently also a part of the main PDL distribution, but I
    like to have an external module as well so I can add new features
    more easily.

    Regards,

    Doug Hunt
