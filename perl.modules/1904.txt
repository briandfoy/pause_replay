Hello,

I would like to contribute an XSUB module I wrote to clone a nested hash 
or array object. It can be called either as a function or method and allows
the depth of the copy to be specified. Simple benchmarking of the application
I had written it for gave a 5 time speed increase over similar code written
in perl.  The following is a description in module list format:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Clone          idch  Recursive copy of nested objects            RDF

My name and email are included below, and I would prefer the user-ID RDF.

Sincerely,
Ray Finch.
