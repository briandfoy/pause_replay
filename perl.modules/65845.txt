The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ExtUtils::PerlToExe
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: Build a binary executable from a Perl script
  userid:      BMORROW (Ben Morrow)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    PAR::Packer pl2bat

  rationale:

    This module builds binary executables from Perl scripts. Unlike
    PAR, these executables don't need to unpack themselves before
    running. Currently the module can't pack up an @INC tree along with
    the script, so it's more of an alternative to pl2bat than to PAR.

    I'm not entirely convinced ExtUtils is the best place to put this
    (it hasn't really got anything to do with building extensions), but
    I couldn't see anywhere better. If you have any suggestions I'd be
    glad to hear them. I haven't uploaded it yet in case the name
    changes.

The resulting entry would be:

ExtUtils::
