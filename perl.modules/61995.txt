Subject: Module submission Net::TDMA
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, alex@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::TDMA
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Time Division Multiple Access in Perl.
  userid:      ALEX (Alex J. Avriette)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    professional user circles (e.g., users of computer-radio devices)

  similar:
    unknown

  rationale:

    I'd like to have Net::TDMA. It's not taken or anything. TDMA is not
    really a network protocol, as such, it's more of a way of conveying
    data across a connection. So, you can run, e.g., TDMA on top of tcp
    or more likely, hf/uhf. I'm not sure where else it would fit. I want
    to make sure the namespace is okay before I sed through the whole
    thing (just called 'TDMA' at present because I didn't think it fit
    in Net::) and change appropriately) and subsequently upload.

    thanks for your time.

    regards, alex
