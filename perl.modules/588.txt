I notice incidentally while looking for a module on CPAN that you
had listed Log::Agent and VDBM as placeholders.

Curious, I also looked for CGI::MxScreen, but it's missing. Here's an
entry proposal:

CGI::
::MxScreen        i    Screen multi-plexer framework                RAM

Finally, I have a question. How is the DLSI updated? Manually, I
presume, since there's no such key in ExtUtils::MakeMaker?
