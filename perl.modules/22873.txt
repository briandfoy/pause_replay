The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Boggle::Board
  DSLIP:       RdpOn
  description: Create a boggle board.
  userid:      AJDELORE (Anthony DeLorenzo)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Games::Boggle

  rationale:

    Games::Boggle tests various words to see if they are present on a
    boggle board. It does not provide functionality to create a board.

    Games::Boggle::Board creates a random boggle board which is
    compatible with Games::Boggle. However, it does not have to be used
    with this module -- it could be used on its own to play boggle.

  enteredby:   AJDELORE (Anthony DeLorenzo)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 14 00:31:47 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Boggle::
::Board           RdpOn Create a boggle board.                       AJDELORE
