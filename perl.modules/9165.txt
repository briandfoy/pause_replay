OK. I just read your bitbucket@perl.org mail, and I do what you tell me:

	If we have problems or comments with your proposed namespace, we'll
	respond within a week with our opinions.  Note that you can still upload
	a module before we approve the namespace -- it just won't appear in the
	official modules list, and we may ask you to change the name before
	we'll list it there.

Sorry for having missed that on first reading.
Cheers,
Wolfgang
