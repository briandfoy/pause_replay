Because I goofed. I broke PAUSE. I am sorry.

I did apologize in a mail to all 28 people you have had troubles
uploading. BLOONIX@cpan.org was on the list of recipients. Maybe some
other bug somewhere else prevented the mail to arrive at your site.
Nowadays mail tends to get lost too often.

Please retry uploading. Everything seems to work again. If it doesn't,
please send details.

Thanks *and sorry again*
