Dear CPAN volunteers,

I'm developing a GNU-licensed Perl-based ecard application: Penguin
Greetings (pgreet):

    http://pgreet.sourceforce.net/

This application now has a number of Perl object modules that share code
across three Perl programs.  These modules aren't (for the moment anyway)
usable outside of Penguin Greetings, but I would very much like to allow
users to be able to install them with the CPAN installer tools.

My question is should such modules be included in CPAN and if so under
what namespace?  The UNIX name: pgreet is unique as much as Google can
ferret out, so it could be dropped just about anywhere.  The closest sub-
category I could imagine is HTML, but that really describes the
application more than the modules.

Could someone give me a pointer as to what do in such circumstances?

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Peace, Edouard :-)
