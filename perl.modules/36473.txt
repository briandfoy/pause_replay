The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Commands::Guarded
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Better scripting through guarded commands
  userid:      TREY (Trey Harris)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    The LISA System Administration conference 2004, Atlanta, GA --
    invited talk 11/18/04

  similar:

  rationale:

    I bounced ideas with Damian Conway about the naming of this module.
    The name is actually his suggestion. I pored over the current
    rootlevel namespaces and couldn't find one that fit closely at all.

    This is not actually a very new idea--it's used in cfengine, and
    Dijkstra discussed it in 1975 (as Damian pointed out to me). But I
    don't know of anything else--certainly no Perl module--that
    implements these "deterministic, verifying, rectifying guarded
    commands" (as Damian put it) in a general way.

  enteredby:   TREY (Trey Harris)

The resulting entry would be:

Commands::
::Guarded         bdphp Better scripting through guarded commands    TREY
