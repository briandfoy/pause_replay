The latest version of Authen::CAS::Client has switched to a LICENSE file of:

> This software is information.
> It is subject only to local laws of physics.

This is certainly not going to pass corporate compliance departments, as
a few of us are currently trying to explain to the author on a bug, but it
also makes me wonder:

Do we have a restriction officially stated anywhere of "software you're
allowed to upload to us, that we then have rights to distribute" ?

In the Nagios::Plugin case the issue was who had the copyright; in this
case the issue is that the copyright holder isn't granting enough via the
license, but I'm wondering whether (a) we need to do anything about this
(b) even if we don't *legally* need to, do we have a policy that we can
quote to try and get the author to pick a license that people can use?
