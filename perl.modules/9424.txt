I'd like to receive a PAUSE userID.  
Here's required information:

[your name]
Vladimir Bogdanov
 
[our email address]
b_vlad@telus.net 

[your homepage if you have one]
vladb.perlmonk.org

[your preferred user-ID on CPAN]
VLADB

[a short description of what you're planning to contribute]
I'm currently building a CFML-Parser module and
would like to contribute it once done.  There's also
a few CVS related modules/scripts that I wrote and
that also could be of some use to others.  

Cheers,
vlad.
