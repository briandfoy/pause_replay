The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::GameMonitor
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Get info about public game servers from GM
  userid:      WILSOND (Dusty Wilson)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://dusty.hey.nu/

  similar:
    WWW::BF2S

  rationale:

    Like WWW::BF2S, this module fetches data over an XML feed from a
    website, in this case Game-Monitor.com. The two modules fetch
    different data from different sources and do different things with
    them, but they are related in that they are fetching data about game
    players and servers.

    This module fetches data and restructures it into an easily usable
    hashref. The module automatically handles data caching, as well.

    It uses LWP::Simple and XML::Simple to do most of the data fetching
    and structuring work.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::GameMonitor     bdpOp Get info about public game servers from GM   WILSOND
