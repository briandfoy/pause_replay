The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Median
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: finds the set median of a set of strings
  userid:      LMETCALF (Leigh Metcalf)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The set median of a set of strings is defined as the string with
    the smallest sum of distances. This is often used in clustering of
    strings, in particular, within the self-organizing map of strings.
    In this module, we allow the developer to determine what distance
    algorithm will be used in order to determine the set of strings. For
    example, Text::Levenshtein, String::Similarity, and
    String::KeyboardDistance are all valid distances that can be used
    with the module. We also allow the developer to add strings and
    recalculate the text median of the larger set.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Median          adpOp finds the set median of a set of strings     LMETCALF
