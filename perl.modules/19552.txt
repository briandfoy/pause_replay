This is the central mistake, we do not speak ex cathedra and won't and cannot.

Thank You!

No doubt is it a useful addition to CPAN. So far you have got a single
answer that says, Text::InputRepository doesn't fly. It would be good
to hear more suggestions, not necessarily from us. How are your users
communicating? Should there not be a mailing list for your users where
you could ask for namespace suggestions? Quite often the best ideas
come from the user community. Couldn't you ask them?

Maurice Makaay has taken the route to start a Curses::UI namespace
where he puts all of his modules. Wouldn't it be a good idea if you'd
do likewise?

The crux with having a team that gives advice on namespaces is that
you cannot improve the advice by increasing the team size.

Yes, you were extraordinary unlucky so far, I'm sorry for that. I've
already analysed the case of Parse::PlainConfig in a recent posting.
Now it's about Text::InputRepository which has already been called an
unlucky choice.

I still have the impression that you're working on something that can
be called a framework. Frameworks deserve their own namespace, like
e.g. Curses::UI, Mason, Alzabo, MHonArc, POE, Zoidberg and what not.
