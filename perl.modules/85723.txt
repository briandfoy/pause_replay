Log-Dispatch-File-Stamped-0.10_002 has been uploaded to PAUSE as an unauthorized release, as my $company is using it in its production code now, but I'd really like this to get your blessing :)

(cc modules@perl.org - this is the third attempt to contact you over a span of a few months -- earlier attempts are when I filed this ticket, and when I inquired about a public repository and/or process for patching, via https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84228)
