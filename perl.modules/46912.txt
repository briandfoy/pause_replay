It probably is. If, however, you develop modules that would be of use 
outside your Asterisk framework, it's a good idea to put them in a 
separate namespace. For example, BioPerl includes a lot of code which 
could be put to good use in a different environment. But few would want 
BioPerl as a dependency for a small utility module.
