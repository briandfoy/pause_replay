The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Slides
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: serve presentations on the Web
  userid:      POLETTIX (Flavio Poletti)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=608585

  similar:
    None known to me

  rationale:

    This library is to eventually build a system for serving slides on
    the web. The metaphor is that of a main speaker that gives a talk to
    an audience of many attendees, and the screen is represented by each
    browser used by each attendee.

    This is not a system to generate HTML slides from a somewhat
    comfortable format, but rather a system to take those slides and let
    the speaker decide which one should be seen by each attendee.

    The underlying trick is based on HTTP streaming and CSS support. A
    connection between the browser and the server is always kept open,
    and slides are shown or hidden using the 'display' property of the
    slide's div. A working demo (script/console.pl) is available for the
    curious.

    For these reasons, I thought that the best name would be
    WWW::Slides, because the basic WWW protocols and interactions are
    involved (hence the WWW part) and it is meant to serve slides (hence
    the Slides part).

    The discussion link provided above is somewhat weak, I know, but I
    did not get any technical feedback so far.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
