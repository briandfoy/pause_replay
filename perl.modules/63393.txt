The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SOAPjr
  DSLIP:       bmpOg
  description: The love child of SOAP and JSON-RPC for AJAX
  userid:      ROBMAN (Rob Manson)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://SOAPjr.org, it's mailling lists, irc channel and svn/git
    repository

  similar:
    SOAP.pm (etc.) and JSON-RPC.pm

  rationale:

    Traditional SOAP is no longer the Simple Object Access Protocol it
    was initially designed to be. It's bloated and overly verbose making
    it bandwidth hungry and slow. It's also based on XML, making it
    expensive to parse and manipulate - especially on mobile or embedded
    clients. However, it's core Envelope/Head/Body design pattern is
    really useful for AJAX style API's.

    SOAPjr uses a similar Envelope/Head/Body model, but instead of
    bloated and verbose XML it uses lightweight and easy to manipulate
    JSON. After all, there's no X in SOAP and it's Envelope/Head/Body
    concept is not bound in any way to requiring XML.

    In contrast to SOAP, JR (JSON-RPC) is overly simplistic and
    basically tunnels HTTP GET style key/value pairs within a query
    string using JSON. However, within JR there is no Head/Body
    separation leaving metadata to pollute the main data space.

    SOAPjr combines the best of these two concepts and is designed to
    create modern AJAX API's that can easily be used by mobile devices,
    embedded systems or PC browsers.

The resulting entry would be:
