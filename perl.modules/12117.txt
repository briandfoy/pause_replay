Simon,

It seems that your new module, HTML::TableParser, has the same name as
one that I released to CPAN a while ago.  I attempted to get the name
space registered, but there was no action by the modules folks, so now
it appears that we have a problem.  I know of several packages which
depend upon my module, so it'd be far less confusing if you would rename
yours.

See

for the details of the registeration requests.

Thanks,
Diab
