It can be done, although the preference is not to.

Generally the ones that are were from people with good ideas, who 
registered and then promptly ran out of interest and didn't bother.

So it would be nice to see at least something ready for upload first.

The place for modules that work with data is Data::, personally I'd say 
we should have ACTUAL data packages in there too.

Note Data::Package, which I created as a starting point for pure-data 
modules, and which might be a good starting point for you. I'd also 
hoped to get some stuff into Data::Package for helping with the sort of 
things you are doing, but didn't really get around to it, with the 
exception of doing some experimenting with JSAN::Client, which does 
exactly what you are talking about. (Pulls the data, then provides a 
CDBI wrapper to it).

Also, if these data-object modules are read-only, you might also find 
File::ShareDir interesting.

But again if you have something specific to register, provide some 
examples and we can advise.

Won't Register, for now.
