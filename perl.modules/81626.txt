The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       JSONP
  DSLIP:       cnpOl
  description: For web applications based on AJAX and JSONP
  userid:      ACANFORA (Anselmo Canfora)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI

  rationale:

    The idea is to provide an handy module for the so-called "web 2.0"
    applications. I wish to enable module users to keep a complete
    separation between static and dynamic parts of their applications.
    This will be obtained exchanging all data in JSON format. The blend
    between data and presentation is intended to be done entirely on the
    client browser. I want to use JSONP calls to enable the programmers
    to completely decouple the static and dynamic parts, keeping them on
    different servers/domains/CDN if needed, hence the proposed name. I
    do not want to subclass JSON or CGI modules for the very following
    reasons:

    - JSON: this module, which will be the only dependency in my
    intentions, is an encoding/decoding module, my intended one will be
    a module for web development.

    - CGI: it is a module for generic web development, with even the
    support for HTML page element generation on server side. I wish to
    build a lightweight and agile module to support only JSONP data
    exchange.

The resulting entry would be:

JSONP             cnpOl For web applications based on AJAX and JSONP ACANFORA
