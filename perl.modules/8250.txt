I really wanted to see XML::Simple classified under Chapter 12
(Option, Argument, Parameter and Configuration File Processing).
 My rationale is:

 * XML::Simple was designed for reading/writing config files
 * People who want to read/write config files wouldn't
   necessarily think of looking for an XML module

It is true that XML::Simple is useful for more general XML
parsing tasks (within limits) but people who know they want to
work with XML can easily find XML::Simple by searching for XML
modules.

Is it possible for one module to be classified under more than
one chapter?  If so, then 11 and 12 would be fine.  If not, my
preference is for it to appear under chapter 12.

Grant
