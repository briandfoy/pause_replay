Tiered of get rich quick scams I will be honest with you this is not for everyone 
you will need to stay with it for a bit If you have a product that you want to 
Market this could be the way. Use this URL

Order a mail package and I will send you 
A link for an email program that will allow you to send 100 email at time and 
That's for free.
$8 per 1000 And Ill send 1000 free to first time clients
$10 for a list of drop shippers I have them to.
Or you can sell my list.I just ask that you send a dollar for each 1000 you sell
