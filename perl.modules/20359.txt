The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::ZipCode
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Perform distance queries on zip codes
  userid:      ALLENCHEN (Allen Chen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Will set up a web site (http://achen.cjas.org/perl/ZipCode/)

  similar:
    Geo::PostalCode

  rationale:

    Honestly, I'm not sure if this should go under the Geo or Geography
    namespace since they seem to contain very similar modules.
    (Shouldn't Geo be shown under the Internationalization Locale
    chapter, too?)

    I want to note that Geo::PostalCode is very much similar, but
    doesn't seem to work as evidenced by CPAN-testers. Since I already
    have working code to do this, I figured it would make a good
    addition to CPAN.

    What makes it unique (compared to Geo::PostalCode): -it uses DBI
    instead of Berkeley DB as a source of data -features the option to
    use a less-accurate, but higher-speed query for very time-sensitive
    applications -built to work with the publicly-available US Census
    2000 ZCTA data (which I'm planning to possibly bundle with the
    module), but can be configured to use other sources (such as
    commercial zip code databases)

  enteredby:   ALLENCHEN (Allen Chen)
  enteredon:   Sat Apr 12 14:48:45 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::ZipCode         cdpOp Perform distance queries on zip codes        ALLENCHEN
