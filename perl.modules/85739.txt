The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Framework::Core
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Modular application framework
  userid:      CODECHILD (David Helkowski)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    newsgroups, bug tracker

  similar:
    App::Core

  rationale:

    There currently exists no root namespace to contain application
    frameworks on Cpan, despite there being a number of modules that
    -are- application frameworks. Some of them are hosted under App (
    such as App::Framework::Core )

    Others are hosted at the root ( Catalyst, Jifty, etc )

    I had originally chosen the name App::Core for this module, due to
    it's dependence and creation around the features provided by the
    Class::Core module. A preliminary version of the new module is
    currently uploaded on my Cpan account under that name.

    I would like to rename it to Framework::Core and register that
    namespace, so that a root 'Framework' namespace can be created, my
    module can go there as 'Framework::Core', and other Cpan module
    authors could place their frameworks there as well, rather than
    continuing to pollute the root namespace or other special purpose
    namespaces such as 'App' ( which is specifically stated that it
    should only contain actual applications, not components )

    Thank you.
