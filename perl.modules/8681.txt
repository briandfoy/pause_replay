Hello,

I posted this about a week go, but may have used the wrong subject for the
email, as I havent been registered yet.  Here it is again.....pls let me know if
this is not the correct way to register:

I would like register as a developer to submit a
module to CPAN.  Here are my details:

name:    David Rowe
email:    david@voicetronix.com.au
web:    www.voicetronix.com.au
preferred user ID: VOICET
short description:

Telephony::CTPort encapsulates the functionality
of a Computer Telephony (CT) card port in an
object.  A CT card is a PCI card that interfaces
your PC to telephone lines.  The ports look
electrically like a regular telephone, but can be
controlled via the PC.  CT cards are used to build
IVR systems, voicemail, Voice over IP systems etc.

Thanks,

David
