Subject: Module submission Apache::FastForward
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::FastForward
  DSLIP:       RdpOr
  description: HTTP POST request with CSV body
  userid:      JWACH (Jerzy Wachowiak)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/fastforward/

  similar:
    Apache Apache::XMLRPC

  rationale:

    The FastForward framework allows fast development of 3-tier
    spreadsheet applications accessing any sort of data stored on a
    server. The spreadsheet is used as a browser, which can send and
    receive data using HTTP POST request. The request and response data
    can be edited in a common way in the spreadsheet. Which data is sent
    to the server and how the response is mapped back to the
    spreadsheet, is described by tags. The project implements a
    spreadsheet add-on and data manipulation library for the server
    site. The namespace registration is for Apache module, which
    implements the server part. For more details see:
    http://fastforward.sourceforge.net

  enteredby:   JWACH (Jerzy Wachowiak)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 19 20:47:50 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::FastForward     RdpOr HTTP POST request with CSV body              JWACH
