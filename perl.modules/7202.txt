Those two examples aren't analogous.

I'm expect to find platform-independent tools for identifying Windows
file types or for manipulating the Windows registry under Win32::,
however.  I'd expect to find popen under POSIX::.

I just asked on #perl and the response was unanimously "Mac", and
unanimously against "Data".  One mac-knowledgeable person there asked
what resource-fork model your module worked with, and suggested
Mac::Resources::Netatalk or Mac::Resources::LinuxHFS or similar.

A suggestion was made for starting a top-level namespace for
cross-platform tools, but no good name was suggested for it.

The general process you should be doing is drilling down on this blurry
"data" thing and saying "what sort of data is it?"  Well, it's a file.
OK, so how about File::?  Perhaps something like File::Mac::Resources?
Or if it's more like a file system (I'm not very knowledgeable about
macs) then perhaps Filesys:: 

But *not* Data.
