Hi Rob:

There is already a ControlX10:: top namespace. You would be welcome to
join that one. I've downloaded your first package and will look for possible
conflicts in naming. Bruce Winter and I have used CM11 and CM17 so far -
but others are in development. The ControlX10:: namespace was arrived at
after extensive discussion back in September (and will be discussed in a
forthcoming article in The Perl Journal). It is in section 5 of the Module 
List.
