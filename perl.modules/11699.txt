The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CORBA::XS
  DSLIP:       cdpOa
  description: IDL compiler to extension between Perl & C
  userid:      PERRAD (Francois Perrad)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    "Make XS easier to use" is an entry of perltodo.

    This module is an alternative to h2xs and XS language when an IDL
    interface is available. But system-level module like POSIX always
    needs XS language.

    This module supplies an IDL compiler to extension interface between
    Perl and C code. This compiler uses OMG specifications : IDL -
    Interface Definition Language CDR - Common Data Representation (for
    serialization between Perl and C)

  enteredby:   PERRAD (Francois Perrad)
  enteredon:   Wed May 15 18:41:44 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CORBA::
::XS              cdpOa IDL compiler to extension between Perl & C   PERRAD
