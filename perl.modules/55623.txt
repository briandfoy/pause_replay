If the code is forked, and the API is compatible with the original, and 
the author has gone AWOL, a better approach may be to consider taking 
over the original module.

Would you be interested in this?

I would recommended trying to continue contacting the author, using 
alternate methods if you can find any information (phone, other email 
addresses, etc).

If you still can't track the guy down, we'll look at giving you the 
namespace.
