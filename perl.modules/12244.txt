Hi people,

Time for a post that's a little different than your usual "New user" and 
"New module" e-mails :) I'm posting here since it seems like the most 
appropriate place to discuss these issues.

I adressed an issue on the mod_perl list lately concerning the Apache:: 
namespace organization. As you may know, all mod_perl modules are currently 
grouped under Apache::, which creates a pretty extensive mess now that 
there are many of them.

You can see the thread here: 
http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl/skeldkendtrau . The RFC was generally 
well received, so I think we are going to go through with it.

Of course, we cannot change the current modules, but it would be preferable 
to get new modules to follow certain conventions, like others on CPAN.

Why am I adressing you? Because Randy suggested, and I agreed, that some 
kind of module listing in categories would be interesting for the modules 
and for the mod_perl community--probably having a page dedicated to 
mod_perl modules. However, we don't want one person to maintain such a 
category: just like PAUSE exists to avoid one person to take care of all 
CPAN modules, it would be preferable to get module authors to categorize 
their modules themselves. This can only be done satisfactorily with PAUSE, 
to handle password protection etc... So I'm wondering if this is doable: 
for example, on the "Register namespace" page, there could be a category 
called "mod_perl modules", which would then bring you to a second page 
where you choose your mod_perl category.

Just tell me what you think. It would be interesting to get this working.
