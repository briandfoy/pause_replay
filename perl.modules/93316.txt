Hi, Chris.  Once you've uploaded something to CPAN, the account ID can't be
deleted.  However you can "give up" an account in a couple ways:

(1) log-in and change the account info to have only a secret email address
and then disable forwarding.  You still control the account, but you'll
stop most emails related to it.

(2) request that the account be transferred to "custodial status".  You'll
need to verify that you are you (e.g. by putting "custodial" into the
account name on the info page) and then tell me the PAUSE ID of the
account.  Then I will finish the process of changing the name, email
addresses, and password, effectively removing you entirely from the account.

Regards,
David Golden
PAUSE admin for IDs
