From: tima@mplode.com (Timothy Appnel)

I'm preparing to submit my contribution to CPAN 
and wanted to make sure I'm "doing the right thing."

I wrote a modularized implementation of core 
TrackBack 1x functionality. I have until now made 
it available on my own site under the name 
XML::TrackBack.[1] In retrospect, I think I should 
have put it in the Net heirarchy. So before I put 
it into CPAN I'm going to rename it 
Net::TrackBack. Would you agree this is a good 
idea. The documentation since the first release 
has labeled this code as being subject to changes. 
I'm only aware of one such public implementation 
using the module so far.

Assuming the name change is advisable, I'll 
increment the version from 0.2 to 0.21 to denote 
the name change.

I was hoping to upload what I have very shortly. 
Any thoughts on this matter are appreciated. Thanks.
