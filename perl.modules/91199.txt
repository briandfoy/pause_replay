The ironic thing, Karen, is that your module is absolutely massive compared
to what was already there.

https://metacpan.org/source/DMUEY/Acme-Tiny-0.6/lib/Acme/Tiny.pm

vs

https://metacpan.org/source/ETHER/Acme-Tiny-0.003/lib/Acme/Tiny.pm

0.6 has RSS 1464 and 0.003 has RSS of 2092 -- that's 43% more memory usage
just to do nothing!  Ouch!!!
