Subject: FOO@cpan.org forwarding broken?
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: eric.roode@gmail.com (Eric Roode)

I sent a message to ROODE@cpan.org today, from an unrelated e-mail
address (this one, in fact).  It bounced.  The bounce message began as
follows:

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at x1.develooper.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

    <**********>:
    67.117.168.86 does not like recipient.
    Remote host said: 551 ************* illegal name for an account
    Giving up on 67.117.168.86.

    --- Below this line is a copy of the message.

There are two problems with this.  First, I have not changed my CPAN
"forward to" address in quite a long time, so there is no real reason
for it to have bounced.  Second and muh more serious, where you see
asterisks above, the message actually displayed my "Secret email
address only used by the PAUSE, never published."  I can only presume
that anyone who sends mail to ROODE@cpan.org is seeing my "secret"
address too.

I logged in to pause.perl.org.  Everything looked fine there.  I
changed my secret address and re-sent a message from this address.  It
bounced with the same message -- again listing the old secret address
as "illegal name for an account".  Back at PAUSE, I checked the radio
button for "forward mail to my public address" and saved the changes.
I sent another message to ROODE@cpan.org, and again it bounced with
the old secret address.  I went back to PAUSE and blanked out my
"secret" address and saved the change.  But yet another message to
ROODE@cpan.org bounced.

Now, I know that the update page says, "please allow a few hours for
any change you make to propagate."  So it's possible that it's not a
problem that the changes I made above (trying to diagnose or work
around the problem) didn't have any effect.  However, it most
certainly is a problem that messages were bouncing with the so-called
secret e-mail address displayed in plain view.  I worry that this is
happening for all cpan.org addresses.

Yours,
Eric J. Roode
