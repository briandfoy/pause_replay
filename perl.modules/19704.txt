The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DB2::db
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Framework for creating/using IBM DB2
  userid:      DMCBRIDE (Darin McBride)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    DBD::DB2 DBIx::*

  rationale:

    The new root-level namespace is similar to the Oracle and Sybase
    namespaces already on CPAN. This framework provides
    database-vendor-specific capabilities that DBIx modules cannot offer
    since they are intended to be vendor-neutral.

    This framework arose from that vendor-specific desire: to
    dynamically create DDL required to create a database and
    corresponding tables, making tables easy to recreate on multiple
    systems, esp test vs production systems.

    Once the framework already knew about databases and tables, it was
    a relatively minor step to provide functions for querying,
    inserting, and updating those tables. Rather than discovering the
    table format for each query (as DBIx must do), the table format is
    already located in the framework, allowing for certain
    simplifications in code (not always optimal either). It is possible
    to manipulate DB2 databases with a minimal amount of SQL through
    this framework, whereas DBIx modules usually require more indepth
    knowledge of SQL.

    Modules in this package include:

    DB2::db DB2::Table DB2::Row

  enteredby:   DMCBRIDE (Darin McBride)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 24 00:18:56 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DB2::
::db              RdpOp Framework for creating/using IBM DB2         DMCBRIDE
