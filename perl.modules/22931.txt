The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       perl5lib
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Honour PERL5LIB even in taint mode
  userid:      NOBULL (Brian McCauley)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.moderated

  similar:
    lib

  rationale:

    Placing this in the root namespace name was suggested by Ilya
    Zakharevich, I would never have been so presumptuous myself :-).

    Currently pragmas seem to be in generally in the root namespace so
    I would be breaking with convention to do otherwise. However, if it
    is felt that a root namespace name is not justified I'd be just as
    happy to see this as lib::perl5lib

    This module addresses a common need amongst those people who
    develop modules and CGI scripts on shared servers. Because of the
    nature of this module it would be really good to see it get into
    Development Stage "S". A module that allows users to access their
    own module diretory is not too useful unless it's in the system-wide
    module directory.

  enteredby:   NOBULL (Brian McCauley)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 18 16:38:59 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

perl5lib          bdppp Honour PERL5LIB even in taint mode           NOBULL
