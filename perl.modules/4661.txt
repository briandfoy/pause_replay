Hi,

libxml-enno is a Perl distribution on CPAN that contains XML::DOM,
XML::XQL, and XML::Checker, among others.  Enno Derksen, the original
author of these modules, has all but disappeared, and I'm volunteering to
take over the maintenance.  I've already applied some bug fixes, and I
would like to know if anybody would have any objections to me assuming
maintenance for this distribution going forward.

You may download the modified version from
http://tjmather.com/CPAN/libxml-enno-1.04pre.tar.gz

I have included the CHANGES file below.  In summary, I have applied bug
patches that users have submitted to me and posted on the perl-xml
list.  In addition I have updated libxml-enno to work with XML::Parser
2.30.  However, since XML::Parser's API has changed from the 2.27 release,
libxml-enno-1.04 is incompatible with XML::Parser 2.27.  If you are using
XML::Parser 2.27, then you should download libxml-enno-1.02 from your
local CPAN mirror.

I want to make sure that this distribution is stable before I upload it 
to CPAN (assuming nobody has any objections) and I would appreciate any
feedback or bug reports.

Change history for libxml-enno:

1.04 (tjmather)

- CHK: Fixed bug in XML::Checker::Parser with the setting
  @InterceptedHandlers (William Horka)
- CHK: Fixed errors in test case t/chk_batch.t.  Most had to do with change
  from "well-formed" to "well-formed (invalid token)" in error message.
  Also, the tests in chk_batch.t for the xml file attr3 did not return any
  errors any more, since XML::Parser >= 2.28 doesn't seem to call the entity
  handler more than once if a entity is repeated.
- CHK: Updated t/chk_batch.t to be independent of the order of the error
  messages generated.  This is because the order of the error messages
  seems to be dependent on the version of perl used (e.g. 5.005 vs. 5.6.0).
- DOM: Fixed XML::DOM::DocumentType::replaceChild to call
  SUPER::replaceChild instead of SUPER::appendChild (John Salmon)
- DOM: Fixed XML::DOM::Text::splitText to use substr instead of
  (non-existant) substring and insertBefore instead of (non-existant)
  insertAfter (Duncan Cameron)
- DOM: Fixed XML::DOM::Text::print to encode '>' and '"' (John Cope)
- DOM: Added code to convert Model argument of XML::Parser::Dom::Element
  from XML::Parser::ContentModel to string.  XML::Parser >= 2.28 passes
  a XML::Parser::ContentModel object for the model arg of the Element handler
  while earlier versions passed a string.  Fixed cannot find equals
  method in XML::Parser::ContentModel in dom_extent.t.
- DOM: Updated XML::DOM::Entity and XML::Parser::Dom::Entity to reflect
  new Entity handler API in XML::Parser >= 2.28.  There is a new isParam
  parameter and the name no longer starts with '%' if it is a parameter
  entity.
- DOM: Fixed errors in test cases t/build_dom.t t/dom_attr.t by changing
  hair (none | blue | yellow) "yellow" to hair (none|blue|yellow) 'yellow'
  Also fixed t/dom_jp_attr by changing equivilent japenese text.
- DOM: Fixed errors in test cases t/dom_print.t and t/dom_jp_print.t
  by changing <!ELEMENT doc (beavis | butthead)*> to
  <!ELEMENT doc (beavis|butthead)*>
- DOM: Fixed error in test 3 of t/dom_jp_attr.t under Perl 5.6.0
  by changing $FILE->print("$name $type") in XML::DOM::AttDef::print.
- XQL: Updated XQLParser/Makefile.PL to use yapp instead of yapp.pl
  since yapp.pl was renamed to yapp starting with Parse::Yapp 0.30.
  This fixed a problem where it mangled XML/XQL/Parser.pm if
  Parse::Yapp >= 0.30 was installed.
- XQL: Replaced '>' in __DATA__ section of t/xql_big.t with '&gt;'.
 
1.03 (enno) (not released)
- XQL: Fixed $intersect$ operator. It used to throw exception when parsing 
  the XQL expression. Something like "xql_check method not implemented".
  (Thanks to Tatiana <tasc@lbd.dcc.ufmg.br>)
- XQL: Fixed q// and qq// operators. Typo in RE caused them to be unrecognized
  by the XQL expression parser.
- XQL: Fixed 'any' and 'all' modifiers. Typos in Parser.yp caused them to fail.
  (Thanks to James Curran <jcurran@staff.cs.usyd.edu.au>)
- XQL: Fixed warning on Windows when using XML::XQL, related to tput.
- CHK: Fixed errors in test case t/chk_batch.t for Windows. Most were related
  to differences in newlines.
