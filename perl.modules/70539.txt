I would like to clear out the RT queue on Net::DAV::Server.
I've also found a number of unreported issues that make my current  
project more difficult.

Since Net::DAV::Server has not had any development since July 2006, I  
was wondering if it would be possible to take on co-maintainer status  
on this module. I'd even be willing to be primary maintainer if the  
current maintainer has run out of TUITs for the project.

Looking forward to your response.
G. Wade Johnson
