Hi there,

I want to release some of my modules to CPAN.

Curently I'm working on a project to monitor weather data. Im Using a
serial device called 
WS 2000 to collect data from wireless sensors (up to 16).

Until now I've finished the module for the lowlevel comunication with
the device.
The module for analysing colleted data is already working, but not
finished.

I'ld like to release the modules as
Device::WS2000::IO  and
Device::WS2000::Data

Please let me know whether there are any problems with these names, if
so please suggest other names

thanks
/\/\ichael
