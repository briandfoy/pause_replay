Thanks for the input on naming.  I've managed to reach DeWitt Clinton,
author of Cache::Cache, and we are going to cooperate on a new module
(name TBD) to replace Cache::Cache.  So, this work will be incorporated
into that.  Not sure if we'll go with Cache::Cache2, Cache::Unified, or
something else.  We'll probably be back for advice on that later.
