There is nothing "mere" about this convention.
It was inaugurated by Larry, and has been observed
without controversy by every Perl programmer except you.

Please note that in contexts such as these, "p5p" should be
understood to be essentially synonymous with "Larry Wall".
They are simply carrying on the work he began, with his
blessing and oversight.  If Larry sez "the lower-case names
are reserved for my use," who are you to argue?  The fact
that the reservation is not enforced by the perl interpreter
is irrelevant.


And I hope, after all this, we all have a greater appreciation
for what a sensitive undertaking the naming of modules is.

Sorry to have to disagree with you, Michael, but the
module, as you have decribed it, is anything but pragmatic.
It does not change the behavior, real or apparent, of
the perl compiler.  It has no effect but to import names,
and as such, is no more pragmatic than any other module
that exports names.

(Btw, "pragmata" is plural.  "A pragmata" makes no sense.)
