Hi there. I'm back to keep the list informed about this problem, as
requested by Ron Savage.

As I told in my previous message, I deleted all versions of App::GitGerrit
from CPAN, waited for the deletion to take effect and uploaded a new
version (v0.017) hoping that this time it would be indexed. Unfortunately,
it didn't work. The problem remains.

Yesterday I decided to rename my module/distribution to see if the problem
had anything to do with that. I renamed it to Git::Gerrit and uploaded
v0.018. It didn't work either. The new version can be seen at
http://search.cpan.org/~gnustavo/Git-Gerrit-0.018/ but it's not on
http://www.cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html.

I've regenerated the 0.009 and 0.010 distributions (I use Dist::Zilla and I
hadn't saved those tar balls) from the respective tags to compare them.
Perhaps the problem has to do with a change I made between those versions,
because it started to happen on v0.010. The "diff -Naur" of them is on
https://gist.github.com/gnustavo/7180499 if anyone is interested.

The only thing I could see there that made me wonder was the change I did
on the $App::GitGerrit::VERSION variable, which is at lines 242 and 245 on
the gist. I define the variable as 'unreleased' and dzil takes care to
redefine it later. This way I can see if I'm using a released version or
not. I wonder if PAUSE would care about this...

I'm going to release a new version without changing this variable to see if
it works. I'll keep you informed.
