The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unicode::Stringprep
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Preparation of Internationalized Strings
  userid:      CFAERBER (Claus Färber)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::IDN::Nameprep

  rationale:

    Currently, there is no perl module fully supporting stringprep as
    defined in RFC 3454. As the module only does string preparation, it
    belongs into Unicode::* and not Net::*. Unicode::Stringprep compiles
    a profile into a perl function that can be used to do the actual
    string preparation.

    Net::IDN::Nameprep already provides some of the functionality.
    Unfortunately, as of version 0.02, it is not fully compliant with
    RFC 3454 and 3491. Net::IDN::Nameprep does not allow implementing
    Stringprep profiles different from Nameprep, either.

    Currently, Unicode::Stringprep is hidden in the developer version
    of Net-IDN-tools. I plan to move it into its own distribution when
    it's ready.

The resulting entry would be:
