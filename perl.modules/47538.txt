I have a CPAN account (CHRISJ), that hasn't been used in awhile, and I
have a couple of code uploads that I wanted to make.

Unfortunately, I don't remember what the password for the account was, and
the email address associated with the account is no longer forwarding
messages.  So I'll need help from a CPAN admin.

Could I get the email address assocaited with my CPAN updated?  Or can I
get an admin to set me up with a temporary password?

Thanks in advance.
