The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::DE::Mutations
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Transliterate german mutations with ASCII
  userid:      HOLSTEN (Andrea Holstein)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  similar:

  rationale:

    I like to write german text in pure ASCII. So I transliterates
    mutation characters like 'ä', 'ö', 'ü', 'á' or 'ß' with 'ae',
    'oe', 'ue', 'a', 'ss'.

    I think it's the normal style for a programmer, but for
    non-programmers it's hard to read. So I'd like to have a module
    which creates from a standard german text (with mutations) a
    7-bit-ASCII code AND reverse.

    Unfortunately the reverse 'ae' => 'ä' transliteration is a little
    bit more complicated than only a s/ae/ä/g - statement. There are
    many exceptions like 'Abenteuer' != 'Abenteür', 'Bauer' != 'Baür',
    'Clique' != 'Cliüe', 'Kongruenz' != 'Kongrünz', ... . Many words
    from foreign languages like 'blue' should not become 'blü' and even
    many latin abbrevations ending on 'ae' make problems. Obviously, to
    decide when an 'ss' is in reality an 'ß' and when not, is the most
    difficult.

    There are enough reasons to write a perl module for and to throw
    away all these 4-5 liners which had never worked right.

    I'm not sure about the namespace. I choosed, Mutations, because
    [äüö] are in fact mutations. From a non strict linguistic point
    of view, [áàó...] are mutations, too. Of course 'ß' is not - but
    it's only one character :-). T prefer the plural form Mutations,
    because the module never cares about only one of the characters -
    always of all.

    On the other hand, Mutations has a very tough assosziation to
    biology. Other possible names could be Lingua::DE::ASCII,
    Lingua::DE::ASCIICharacters, Lingua::DE::ProgrammersStyle,
    Lingua::DE::Umlaute or whatever you will suggest. (Even
    Lingua::DE::Goethe is a possible name - as the 'ae', 'oe', ...
    writing is typical for the time Goethe had lived :D)

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::DE::
::Mutations       idpfp Transliterate german mutations with ASCII    HOLSTEN
