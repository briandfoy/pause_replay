     why:

    Some of the code I need to write for some of my projects seems
    generic enough to be useful. In the short term, I'm working on a
    module which allows random access to large documents over HTTP
    without downloading the entire thing, e.g. for extracting one file
    out of a large archive without downloading the whole archive. As far
    as I could see, this doesn't already exist.
