The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Logfile::EPrints
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Parse Apache logs from GNU EPrints
  userid:      TIMBRODY (Tim Brody)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    GNU EPrints developers

  similar:
    Apache::ParseLog awstats

  rationale:

    I can't find a library for processing Apache log files into Perl
    structures (i.e. an API for use in bespoke applications). There
    appear to be plenty of end-to-end analysis tools though ...
    (awstats, webalizer et al).

    There's also a need for a library to convert Apache log entries
    into the corresponding *purpose* of the Web hit (e.g. performing a
    search, downloading a full-text). This functionality is essential to
    analysing the usage and development of Institutional Repositories.

    This API is intended a generic architecture for building
    event-based parsing of log-files, so that e.g. a generic robots
    filter can be built that will work for any Web server, or a generic
    IR analysis tool for GNU EPrints, DSpace, Fedora etc.

The resulting entry would be:

Logfile::
::EPrints         cdphp Parse Apache logs from GNU EPrints           TIMBRODY
