Regarding both your Date:: modules, could you go and have a talk to the 
DateTime.pm people first? They have pre-existing APIs for this sort of 
stuff already that you can just slot into.

About the only modules that generally don't fit into DateTime are ones 
like the French Revolutionary time module, which doesn't use normal seconds.
