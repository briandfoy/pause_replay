The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Diff
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Diff algorithm generting XML diffgrams
  userid:      SDETHER (Arne Claassen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-xml list

  similar:
    XML::DifferenceMarkup XML-SemanticDiff

  rationale:

    This module will also be accompanied by XML::Patch. At its
    simplest, the modules provide Diff and Patch analogous utilities,
    producing/ingesting XML formatted diffgrams.

    The modules use an algorithm inspired by the Doctoral Thesis on
    XyDiff (http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~cobena/cdrom/www/xydiff/eng.htm),
    which is a tree-based difference algorithm. The choice not to make
    it a perl wrapper around XyDiff was the desire to create a pure perl
    implementation, although it does have a dependency on XML::LibXML,
    since it uses the DOM tree.

    The initial diffgram schema will support insert,update,delete and
    move operations.

    The difference of the proposed solution to existing modules is as
    follows:

    XML::DifferenceMarkup is based on Algorithm::Diff, which uses LCS
    for comparison. Given that XML is really a Tree, a tree-based
    algorithm can capture a lot more contextual information, produce
    better diffgrams and utilizing XPath in the diffgram produce output
    that can be read and evaluated by a greater set of tools.

    XML-SemanticDiff is a useful for analyzing difference between XML
    documents but does not produce diffgrams or any way to generate
    derivative XLM document using the knowledge about the differences
    found.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
