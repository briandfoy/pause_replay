The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDFREP
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: PDF Report Writer / Creator
  userid:      TWIBBLER (Trevor Ward)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    egroup PDFREP

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is named PDFREP for the reason it is designed to allow
    the creation of business reports directly into a PDF file.

    It allows for the creation of the PDF from any platform without
    having to use any Adobe software and allows for text and images
    (graphs etc) to be output. It works very much like a business report
    where the columns are set by using a fixed font and outputting text
    with fixed spaces.

    It was developed for a large company who's business software is
    developed using Intranet technologies and they wanted a reporting
    tool which allowed for PDF files to be output from within another
    perl program grabbing the data from Oracle.

    PDFREP was born to run on Unix and NT.
