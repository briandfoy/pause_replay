Subject: Module submission Plugin::Language::DML

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Plugin::Language::DML
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Plugin language handled by Plugin::Installer
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    NY.pm mailing list

  similar:
    Linuga::Romana::Perligata

  rationale:

    The Plugin::Installer module provides a simple functional/OO
    interface to subs/metods defined in a hash metadata. Having the
    languages live in Plugin::Language::NAME simplifies keeping track of
    them in programs.

    P::I requires a handler for the metadata, DML provides a compiler
    (token+args -> closure) that produces sub's installable by
    Plugin::Installer.

    This doesn't really belong in Class:: since the installed plugins
    can just as easily be functions (and Class:: is getting pretty
    overused anyway). This could also go into Language::Plugin::DML, but
    "Language::Plugin::Installer" didn't seem all that intiutive to me.

    The only other inline Little Language I know of is L::R::P, but
    "Lingua::Plunina" didn't seem all that descriptive.

The resulting entry would be:

Plugin::Language::
::DML             bdphp Plugin language handled by Plugin::Installer LEMBARK
