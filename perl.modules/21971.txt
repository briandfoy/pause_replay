Thank you.

Understood, as the filenames for perl module bundles are sometimes not
strictly named after the module namespace, so you have to be careful. A
reasonable technique for searching for conflicts would be to browse the
long module list, since it clearly enumerates the namespaces. Patrick's
Time::Period is in that list. However, modlist.long doesn't accurately
reflect everything which has been uploaded to CPAN.

On different note, I'm not quite clear on the real mechanism which
controls what becomes incorporated into modlist.long and what just winds
up sitting in CPAN.
