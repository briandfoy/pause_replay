NAME
       Date::MySQL -- Manipulate dates back and forth between
       human-readable and MySQL formats

SYNOPSIS
        use Date::MySQL;
        my $md = Date::MySQL->new();
        print $md->toMySQL("5/31/87");    # prints "1987-05-31"
        print $md->frMySQL("1987-05-31"); # prints "05-31-1987"


DESCRIPTION
       The MySQL RDBMS requires dates to be supplied in
       YYYY-MM-DD format[1,2], but humans expect dates to be
       presented, and to be able to enter them, in MM-DD-YY
       format or similar. This module converts dates back and
       forth between human-readable and MySQL format.

[ ... ]


Obviously the basic functionality here could be accomplished by other
generic methods. The module's goal is to make it very easy to go back and
forth between these two formats, with error checking built in. It also
provides several optional format controls.
