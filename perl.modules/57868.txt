Hi all.

I am thinking about registering a new namespace for an application I am
writing.  The instrucations on PAUSE say to discuss on 'modules' but the
mailing lists indicate that this is a closed list.

Since Module-Authors seemed to be begging for traffic, I subscribed
there and I've CC'd 'modules' to see what happens ;-).

Some of the code I have written is applicable outside the application so
I would try to use existing namespaces but some of the ones, which
appeared appropriate seem to be "polluted".  In particular Class::* is
full of stuff.  One of the classes I've written, might be the same as
something already there but there is so much, I have no idea how to find
it.  I am therefore thinking of using a second new namespace for some of
the more general things.

I do not have a website yet ... when that happens, I will put stuff
there.
