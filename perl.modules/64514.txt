The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Behaviour::Spec
  DSLIP:       Rnpfp
  description: Interiors of tests for BDD.
  userid:      TOCIYUKI (MIZUTANI, Tociyuki)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::More::Behaviours

  rationale:

    Let's play we are the Behaviour Driven Developers, writing short
    notes in usual tests casually. For casual approach rather than the
    coercion of code references by the similar module, I focus writing
    behaviours with two functions: 'describe' and 'it'. These arguments
    are only plain strings. Once we write a behaviour with them, we get
    it by 'spec' function for the test name. Since the names of these
    functions are took from the RSpec framework for Ruby, I choose the
    the name of this should have the word 'Spec'.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::Behaviour::
::Spec            Rnpfp Interiors of tests for BDD.                  TOCIYUKI
