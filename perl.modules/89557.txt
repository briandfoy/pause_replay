     why:

    I have written a module called Census::US that extracts information
    from the United States Census bureau's FTP sites and caches it in
    SQLITE files, returning the results in a hash. It also retrieves
    TIGER/LINE shapefiles. It is useful for doing demographic analysis
    and creating maps without having to manually retrieve the
    information from the Census Bureau.

    I am also developing a system called Litigation::Database, a
    mod_perl web application for managing and reviewing documents and
    information. It is primarily a Debian package (it has a lot of
    non-Perl dependencies), but the core API is in a separate Debian
    package called liblitigation-database-perl that can be also be
    hosted as a CPAN module.

    I have written various pieces of code that I would like to turn
    into CPAN modules someday, including code for creating Google Maps
    KML files using data from Census::US.
