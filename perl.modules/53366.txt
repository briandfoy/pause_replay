Well, I've actually already contacted him and got a response too. We are
currently talking how to combine the two modules.

But the weird thing is, that my version nevertheless has been added to
CPAN: http://search.cpan.org/~tlinden/Data-Validate-0.04/, which I can't
really understand. Fortunately it's got a lower version number than
Richards module so a search would lead users to his module and not mine.

The plan is to rename it to Data::Validate::Struct and to inherit
methods from Data::Validate.
