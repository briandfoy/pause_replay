The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::StoredOrderHash
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Ordered associative arrays for Perl
  userid:      TFM (Tom Murtagh)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    internal mailing lists ... mail to developer until this is remedied

  similar:
    Tie::IxHash Tie::InsertOrderHash Tie::LLHash

  rationale:

    There are several other CPAN modules that iterate over
    insert-order, which is very close to store-order, but these
    typically use an array-list to keep track of ordering.
    Tie::StoredOrderHash uses linked-lists internally, and reorders
    whenever an insert or update is made. It's more suitable to
    applications requiring a least-recently-used structure.

    Tie::StoredOrderHash was developed for a mundane project, it's
    lightweight, I hope someone finds it useful rather than it wasting
    away.

  enteredby:   TFM (Tom Murtagh)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul 20 15:17:09 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::
::StoredOrderHash bdprp Ordered associative arrays for Perl          TFM
