Hi, Bogdan.

"registration" of a namespace is a legacy process that is deprecated and no
longer necessary.

All you need to do is have your module "indexed" by PAUSE.  When you upload
a distribution, you should get two emails.  One says your distribution has
entered CPAN -- that means the tarball will be mirrored. The other says
your module is "indexed" -- that means that any client can install it via
"cpan MyModule".

Regards,
David
