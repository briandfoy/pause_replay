The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weblogic::UserAdmin
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Automation for Weblogic 8.1 Administration
  userid:      DAVIDP (David Peters)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Weblogic has all sorts of functions required to be used in order to
    administer the application. Most Sites have more than one
    application server and unless you are using LDAP for authentication
    performing user administration is required to be performed multiple
    times. This is an interface to the various user and group
    administrative functions designed to ease the load. I could not find
    any rootlevel module name in which this could fit.

  enteredon:   Tue Apr 26 23:14:42 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Weblogic::
::UserAdmin       bdpOp Automation for Weblogic 8.1 Administration   DAVIDP
