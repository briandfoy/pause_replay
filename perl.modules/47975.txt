The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Remote::Object
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Transparent access to objects on remote host
  userid:      AKIMOV (Akimov Alexey)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module represents the core to organize Perl-based cluster.
    This module allows to work with objects that exist inside
    Perl-interpreter on remote host, the same fashion as with local
    objects. Remote::Object emulates object's and class's interfaces as
    much as possible.

  enteredby:   AKIMOV (Akimov Alexey)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 22 06:03:02 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Remote::
::Object          bdpOl Transparent access to objects on remote host AKIMOV
