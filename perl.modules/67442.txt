The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::GeoTIFF::Tiled
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: An interface to libgeotiff for tiled TIFF's
  userid:      BLAKEW (Blake Willmarth)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    http://github.com/blakew/Image-GeoTIFF-Tiled

  similar:

  rationale:

    Note: I previously applied for the namespace Geo::TiledTIFF for the
    same module - please discard it.

    No functional implementation of the libgeotiff library exists on
    CPAN (that I'm aware of - see
    http://search.cpan.org/search?query=tiff&mode=module). My class
    provides a partial coverage (for now) of this interface but for
    tiled TIFF images only; reason being is I wrote this to deal with
    large raster data stored in tiff format and accessing the data
    per-tile is more efficient than per-row (the two options).
    Furthermore, I needed to collect and extract data in the image
    corresponding to arbitrary shapes, so I have classes to do that
    also. All non-trivial methods rely on the image being tiled and I
    have no plans to provide per-row support, hence I've hard-wired
    "Tiled" into the namespace. The main class is an object storing a
    handle to the tiff file, and the name I think reflects this.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::GeoTIFF::
::Tiled           adhOg An interface to libgeotiff for tiled TIFF's  BLAKEW
