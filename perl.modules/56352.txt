That's an interesting case. I'd definitely say that this kind of
namespace registration is valid even without an explicit implementation
of the namespace on CPAN.

Perhaps you could include a documentation only MMDS.pm in the
distribution? The reason is simple. Try clicking on the "MMDS" link
under "registered modules" in your search.cpan.org page. It will yield a
"no matches" page.

Anyhow. I'll delete the registration from the list. (And email you the
URL and login for the list separately.)

Best regards,
Steffen
