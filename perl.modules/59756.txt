     why:

    My first contribution is an additional Lyrics::Fetcher module,
    based on the lyrics site LyrDB.com. Since David Precious made a
    great system for allowing these modules to be distributed, I felt
    compelled to contribute and LyrDB.com has a great web service for
    programmatically accessing its many listings. This contribution will
    happen immediately.

    In a few weeks, I'd like to contribute a Perl script that goes
    through a directory, with a recursive mode for digging into the
    subdirectories under it, that automatically finds and embeds song
    lyrics into any mp3's it finds. This is a program that I have wanted
    for a while, and I think other feel the same way.

    Thank you in advance for your reply.
