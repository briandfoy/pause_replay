It appears to be indexed as "RawInput" not "Term::RawInput".

Your META file says that your distribution provides "RawInput" so it's
indexed that way.  Perhaps you have a stale META.yml file.  The META
claims to be generated by Module::Build, yet you appear to be using
Module::Install.

Bump your version number, regenerate your META.yml file and check that
it's correct.  Then upload again.

Please go onto PAUSE and delete RawInput from the index, too.
