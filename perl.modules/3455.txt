	Reasonable?  Who knows.  How about biting the bullet for the
	"right" solution even if it means short-term confusion and
	pain?

	The "right" solution, IMHO, is to unify the two
	modules/distributions into a single, fast, efficient one.  The
	reason I invented my own and didn't use his in the first place
	was that his API is not as elegant as it could be (IMHO) and
	not very fast.

	If a unification happens, people will eventually deal with it.
