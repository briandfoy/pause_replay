The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CAD::Firemen
  DSLIP:       bdphg
  description: Helpers to maange PTC Creo configurations
  userid:      LANGENJO (Joachim Langenbach)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    Good Afternoon,

    we want to register the namespace CAD::Firemen, because the
    distribution provides scripts and modules to analyze and manage PTC
    Pro/Engineer or Creo (it's the successor of Pro/Engineer)
    configurations. Both systems are 3D-CAD systems.

    To avoid any trade marks of PTC (like PTC, Pro/Engineer, Creo) in
    the name of the distribution, a fancy name was choosen. It is
    Firemen, because the last release of Pro/Engineer was named Wildfire
    and this distribution contains scripts to help the user "fighting"
    against that fire. ;-)

    May be the choosen chapter id is not the best, so any suggestions
    are welcome.

    Kind regards,

    Joachim Langenbach
