That wouldn't be a good name.  There are plenty of YA things
out there (not necessarily on CPAN), and in most cases those
names say "I'm only as good as all the other things that 
already do the same thing".

I'd choose a common word to represent the project.  For instance,
Bricolage, Krang, Maypole, Shishi, Mason, and Starburst not
only sound cool, but they set the project apart and stick in
people's minds. :)
