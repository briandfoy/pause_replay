Dear Sirs,

My name is James Michael DuPont,
my nickname is Mike and UID is normally mdupont.

My email is mdupont777@yahoo.com

I am a perl programmer for 2-3 years and am working on a project called 
the gcc xml node introspector project.
http://introspector.sourceforge.net

a brief description of the project is :
The GCC XML Tree Node Introspector project consists of a patch to the
gcc compiler to output the internal compiler tree nodes in XML and
programs to process that XML.  The tree nodes are complex data
structures which represent the source code inside the compiler.
Through these tree nodes, users are able to extract information from
their programs that would be otherwise very difficult to obtain.
Modules exist to store these nodes in XML or in a PostgresSQL
database.  The long-term goal of the project is create a high-level
API that will make the programmatic manipulation of programs easier
than it is now.


Mike
