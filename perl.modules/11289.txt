The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Associates
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Handle XML interface to Associates program
  userid:      CYBAEA (Allan Engelhardt)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://freshmeat.net/projects/associates/ ,
    http://forums.prosperotechnologies.com/am-assocdevxml

  similar:

  rationale:

    Amazon.com has a very popular Associates (or affiliate) program.
    Recently they launched an XML interface into their databases,
    available to Associates who want to build more complex or
    sophisitcated links than what is possible with the standard
    Build-A-Link functionality from Amazon.

    This is a package that helps you manage and use this XML feed.
    Currently only Amazon has such a feed, but it is envisaged that the
    package will be extended to other retailers as they make XML
    interfaces available.

    It is the featured solution on the Amazon.com announcement of the
    new XML interface.

    The name was proposed on comp.lang.perl.modules with no objections,
    and Amazon.com is happy with it.
