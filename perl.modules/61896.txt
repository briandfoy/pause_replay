The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WebService::Eulerian::Analytics
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: SOAP Interface to Eulerian Analytics
  userid:      MJONDET (Mathieu Jondet)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    cvs repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    The WebService::Eulerian::Analytics is targetted towards the
    customer of the Eulerian Analytics web-analytics / tracking
    solution.

    It will allow Eulerian Analytics customer to interact with the
    back-end of the Eulerian Analytics allowing for administration of
    marketing campaigns of all types and requesting report generation
    and data-fetching.

    The namespace reflects the fact that it's a WebService, the company
    name is Eulerian and the product name is Eulerian Analytics, hence
    the WebService::Eulerian::Analytics package name.

    The module will be opensource and used as the reference
    implementation of the API in Perl, so that implementation in other
    languages could check of it works.

The resulting entry would be:

WebService::Eulerian::
::Analytics       adpOp SOAP Interface to Eulerian Analytics         MJONDET
