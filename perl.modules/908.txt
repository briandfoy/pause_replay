Hello, I'm Dan B
email: dan_b@mail.com
website: http://openjapan.cjb.net
preferred userID: danb

Proposed Module:
Simulate::Life, or Statistics::Life (or something like that)
or maybe (something)::SimpleLife or (something)::ConwayLife (to save Life for something more complicated)
(I'm open to other ideas as well)

Uses John Conway's simple cell growth algorithm:
Start with a grid (2d array)
 a) if any one cell is surrounded by 3 living cells it lives
 b) if any one cell is surrounded by 2 living cells it remains as it is
 c) if a cell is surrounded by any other number of cells it dies

Each time you use the run() method, it will run through the algorithm the number of times you specify as the argument.

Module List Format: aDPr or aDPO
(it's all OO except for one function, random_life()...would that make it r?)

Concise Description:
Simulates life using Conway's algorithm.

I've started a 'discussion' in comp.lang.perl.modules about it, but there were no responses...
( http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=563565411.1 )

I do think it would be a good module to have, however, as it can be used to, well, simulate life, but it can make a screensaver in Tk (I would think), it could be used to draw interesting GIFs, a CGI life simulator, or a part of artificial intellience for a bigger project.

Thank you!
-Dan
