Subject: Module submission IP::World
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IP::World
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: Fast IP to country-code from multi-databases
  userid:      MACKENNA (Craig MacKenna)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    IP::Country Geo::IP

  rationale:

    IP::World uses multiple data sources for more complete and
    hopefully more accurate coverage of the IP4 space. Two of its modes
    are faster than the modules noted above, while another mode uses
    very little memory.

  enteredby:   MACKENNA (Craig MacKenna)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb 16 08:26:06 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IP::
::World           bdhOp Fast IP to country-code from multi-databases MACKENNA
