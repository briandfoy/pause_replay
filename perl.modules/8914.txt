I hope, every module contain some useful functions
Please describe, which ones this contains.

Please describe why your module should have the name TAPORlib.

Do you want to provide some special functions for a product of your
house,
which is always identificated with TAPOR.

I'd better imagine to create top level namespace TAPOR.
Of course only for products everybody will associate for you.

The you can create namespaces like TAPOR::Input, TAPOR::Output, ... .

But I'm also very surprised that a firm name shall be the name of a
namespace.
Namespaces should represent their function as first.

Note, even Windows modules are under Win32::, not under Microsoft::


Greetings,
