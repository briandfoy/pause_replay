The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Jabber::Bot
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Simple interface to building a Jabber bot.
  userid:      TODDR (Todd Rinaldo)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Bot::JabberBot jpb-NOT-CPAN

  rationale:

    This bot is the only bot that leverages Net::Jabber, which is
    really just a vague wrapper for Net::XMPP. To my knowledge, nobody
    else has created a bot for this interface, which is the most
    complete interface I've seen.

    The two alternatives I've seen were not good candidates for
    adaptation to my needs:

    1. jpb (Jabber perl bot) is not on cpan and is very clugy to setup
    and use.

    2. Bot::JabberBot I missed on my initial search. It is not very
    complete and seems to not use XMPP underneath.

    Question: Why is this not a part of Net::Jabber? Answer: 1.
    Net::Jabber is really more focused on the protocol, not a bot, so
    it's really a separate category.

    2. The author of Net::Jabber is MIA and has not responded to my
    emails in a month. I may at some future point be requesting the
    project be declared abandoned and take it over, but regardless I see
    the bot as a separate project.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Jabber::
::Bot             bnpOp Simple interface to building a Jabber bot.   TODDR
