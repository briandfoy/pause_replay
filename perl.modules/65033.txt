Ken, I'm really sorry I couldn't respond earlier. I'm still having
trouble with my SMTP server and I couldn't read this list as the
nntp://nntp.perl.org interface was down.

Generally speaking, this document explains the process. Please read it
carefully:
http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover

Essentially it says, try to reach the author by all means, then wait. If
you can't reach him or her, get in touch with us and show us indications
that you have been trying to reach the author by all reasonable means. I
assume you've tried your best and now have waited for quite some time.

Given that there hasn't been a release from Ferdinand in over six years,
it is probably safe to assume he has moved on.

Ferdinand, I will grant Ken co-maintenance permission on the
Win32::ToolHelp module. Nothing is being taken away from you, this is a
reversible process.

Best regards,
Steffen
