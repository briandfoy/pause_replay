Hi all,

so I got the attached bounce when I tried to contact Eric Roode
who is currently the maintainer of Proc::Fork. Where do we go
from here?

it's been more than a while by now.

I'd like to get my patches in at some point; but I thought it's
been so long since my last attempt that I thought the curteous
thing to do is make another attempt to get in touch before I
attempt a hostile takeover.

Would it be okay with you to relinquish ownership?

Regards,
