I still love it as one big piece. I wouldn't mind producing additional

If search isn't programmed to be fast, we are in deep troubles. Maybe
the code should be made publically available and setting up mirrors of
search should be made easy. That could serve two purposes: attract
contributing programmers and later clusterize search services. Maybe
such a tarball is available already?

Sure, looks much better than before, thanks! I've replaced the thing
on PAUSE's incoming directory with this fix.

This is most definitely a bug on search

  cpan> m Date::GetDate=20
  Module id =3D Date::GetDate
      CPAN_USERID  ANDK (Andreas J. K=F6nig <andreas.koenig@anima.de>)
      CPAN_VERSION 2.02
      CPAN_FILE    A/AN/ANDK/Date-GetDate-2.02.tar.gz
      INST_FILE    (not installed)

What search doesn't know is that both TOMC and ANDK are on an access
control list, so uploads from either of them will get indexed while
uploads by anybody else will be ignored. We need either to propagate
the ACL to search or search needs to follow
modules/02packages.details.txt.gz more closely. I'm not sure which of
the two.
