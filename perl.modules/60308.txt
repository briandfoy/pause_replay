Hi,

while I appreciate the project, I'm not sure this is a good name for it. 
First, I think DBI::* is reserved for modules internal to DBI itself. 
Extensions generally live in DBIx::*. However, there are a couple of 
DBIx::HTML::* modules out there on CPAN already.

I was going to suggest DBIx::Web, but that exists already. Then, I 
checked DBIx::Admin, but that also exists. That leaves DBIx::WebAdmin. 
What would you think about that?

Come to think of it, why would this have to live in the DBI::* or 
DBIx::* namespace at all? You could find a catchy top-level namespace, 
for example. (But please don't suggest something as generic as 
DatabaseAdmin or so for a top level namespace, but rather a name.)

Best regards,
Steffen
