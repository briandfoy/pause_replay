Hi Folks,

As per my emails below with Andrew Schamp (ASCHAMP), could I be added as
co-maintainer to Andrew's distributions. As I currently maintain several
distributions that depend on his modules, I'd like to update them, fix any
outstanding bugs and create GitHub repos for them. The modules in question
are:

WWW::Scraper::ISBN
WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver
WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Record
WWW::Scraper::ISBN::ISBNnu_Driver
WWW::Scraper::ISBN::LOC_Driver

Many thanks,
Barbie.
