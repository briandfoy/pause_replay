The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Error::TryCatch
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: OO Exception Handling thru source filtering
  userid:      NILSONSFJ (Nilson Santos F. Jr.)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:
    maybe perlmonks

  similar:
    Error Exception::Class::TryCatch

  rationale:

    This module implements functionality very similiar to Error.pm (in
    fact, it's almost a drop-in replacement). The main difference is
    that it's a source filter module.

    Its main goal is to implement the same error handling interface as
    Error.pm (since it's the best i've seen in perl) without its
    inherent problems due to memory leaks and implicit anonymous
    subroutines through prototypes. As far as I can tell, it
    accomplishes this nicely.

    Regarding the name itself... this is my third attempt at naming
    this thing. I've followed your advices on naming modules and this is
    really the best I came up with. So, well, despite anything else, now
    its name is officially Error::TryCatch.

The resulting entry would be:

Error::
::TryCatch        adpfp OO Exception Handling thru source filtering  NILSONSFJ
