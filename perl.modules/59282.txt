The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mac::Pasteboard
  DSLIP:       adcOp
  description: Manipulate Mac OS X Pasteboards/Clipboards
  userid:      WYANT (Tom Wyant)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl.macosx

  similar:
    Clipboard

  rationale:

    The namespace choice was discussed on newsgroup perl.macosx (thread
    "Proposed Mac::Pasteboard"), since this is a Mac OS X-specific
    module. With the exception of Dan Kogai's MacOSX::File, all Mac OS
    X-specific modules known to me are in the Mac:: namespace, even if
    they do not support Mac OS 9 or below. The relevant thread on
    perl.macosx confirmed this.

    There was considerable discussion over whether the name should be
    Mac::Pasteboard or Mac::Clipboard. ::Pasteboard was my preference
    since the Mac OS X Pasteboard is more like the BeOS pasteboard than
    the Windows Clipboard. It was proposed that Mac::Clipboard be used
    for a simplified interface, without the bells and whistles. You may
    wish to review the thread to see what the arguments were.

    The only other module I was able to find that accesses Mac OS X
    pasteboards is Clipboard, which is an umbrella that works
    cross-platform. In the Mac OS X case it simply shells out to the
    'pbcopy' or 'pbpaste' executables, which allow text to be placed
    onto or removed from the system clipboard. The subject module is
    able to access any pasteboard to which it can gain access, and any
    type of data I have thrown at it.

    As for registering, I personally find the registry useful both for
    finding the modules of others by function and because it provides an
    opportunity for the author to communicate his or her perception of
    the development stage of the module and how it is to be supported.
    Should support become impracticable, it provides a way to put the
    module up for adoption. In short, it is the only mechanism I know of
    to provide high-level cradle-to-grave management of a Perl module;
    and so I request registry of this module's namespace.

The resulting entry would be:
