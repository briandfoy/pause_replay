Given that the author doesn't work for Redhat anymore and has expressed
no will of continuing maintaining it, I'd see no problem with that.

Note, however, that perl-RPM is now distributed with RPM since 4.4.3
(Jeff Johnson's version) so you'll need to sync patches with him. (via
the rpm-perl mailing list, see
https://lists.dulug.duke.edu/mailman/listinfo/rpm-perl ).

Although my own opinion is that the perl-RPM bindings show their age,
and that RPM4 is better :)
