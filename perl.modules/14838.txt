The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Mini
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: pure perl API to create and parse XML
  userid:      PDEEGAN (Pat Deegan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    XML::DOM

  rationale:

    Hello,

    This submission overrides that made in
    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg14734.html as I'd
    not realized that the XML::Simple namespace was already being used -
    sorry.

    To re(re)cap, this is a resubmission with a new name, based on
    previous discussions
    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg14811.html and
    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg13839.html) of a
    pure perl, object-oriented API that provides classes for XML
    documents, elements and nodes and allows you to generate, parse and
    manipulate XML documents.

    XML::Mini is a "stand-alone" module in that it does not require
    additional libraries or even a compiler to install and is, in my
    opinion, flexible and easy to use. A project site was created
    (http://minixml.psychogenic.com) where you can find detailed
    information on the interface. Developer response has so far been
    positive.

    The module is

    simple: The API is easy to learn and use. While providing a number
    of classes in the package and offering XML generation and parsing
    functionality, users only need to interact with 2 of those classes.

    independent: The package is small and has no external dependencies
    or requirements. You can therefore easily install it on any host,
    for instance in the case of a web server to which you only have FTP
    access - just upload it and begin using the module in your CGIs.

    portable: All modules are written in pure Perl, ensuring maximum
    portability.

    I've run a quick script using the latest version of the module,
    which simply reads in a (large) XML file (which you can find at
    http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.xml - it is the XML
    specification ) and parses it. I then request the document be
    stringified. This is a good test of the parsing abilities as the XML
    is completely decomposed then recreated. You can find the resulting
    output attached to message
    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg13887.html
