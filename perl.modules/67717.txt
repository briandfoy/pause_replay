     why:

    AN::Tools is my attempt at a suite of modules that will provide the
    framework needed to create a UTF-8 based, multi-lingual website. It
    provides internal logging and log cycling, templating, database
    management and several little methods like financially-accurate
    rounding.

    It's primarily meant to be a single module that can be loaded and
    provide a user with everything they need to build a web-based perl
    site. I am sure there are others that do this, but I think it's
    unique enough to be on CPAN (though I am, of course, biased).

    The module is not complete yet, but the final version is being
    prep'ed after about three years in development. I am expecting the
    first version to be ready by the end of the year.
