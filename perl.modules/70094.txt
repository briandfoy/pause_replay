     why:

    I already had a PAUSE ID and two namespaces before, but they were
    terminated because of inactivity. This occured because of personal
    and professional changes right in the period when I was planning to
    release code, which I couldn't foresee.

    I am now back into Perl module development and thus would like to
    regain access to PAUSE.

    A module I have ready for upload is tiny piece of code to wrap a
    lcoal companie's mail to SMS gateway. Some other modules are in
    planning phase.
