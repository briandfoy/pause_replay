No

They would be more logically grouped as Regulator.

Grouping them as Power would be like grouping everything to do with 
data storage. eg: Data::File::Open, Data::DBI. Regulators are a 
specific group of devices.

I am happy with Hardware::Regulator::Plasmatronic, or 
Regulator::Plasmatronic, or even Device::Regulator::Plasmatronic.
We could even go for Power::Regulator::Plasmatronic.

But to replace Regulator with the word Power is probably not totally 
desirable.

Of course the most important word is Plasmatronic (the brand of the 
regulator and protocol) so if the strong feeling is for 
Device::Power::Plasmatronic then I will go with that.
