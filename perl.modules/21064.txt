The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Nmap::Scanner
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perform and manipulate nmap scans using perl
  userid:      MAXSCHUBE (Max Schubert)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    www.insecure.org

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    This module was discussed over a year ago on the PAUSE list ... it
    was determined at that point that Nmap::Scanner would be the best
    name space for this as their might be other nmap-related modules
    appearing in CPAN and the Net:: namespace not appropriate as it
    dealt with generic/RFC/standard protocols.

    Applying again for this namespace in the hopes that this time my
    request will be read and honored by PAUSE/CPAN :).

  enteredby:   MAXSCHUBE (Max Schubert)
  enteredon:   Mon May 12 18:59:25 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Nmap::
::Scanner         RdpOp Perform and manipulate nmap scans using perl MAXSCHUBE
