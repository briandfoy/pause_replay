The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Myasp
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Another template base system for web pages
  userid:      HANSPOO (Hans Poo)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Apache::ASP HTML::Template

  rationale:

    A was looking a long time ago a template based system, with two
    main concerns: - Keep the mod_perl API runing without the ASP (page
    style entry), oriented flow of control. - Keep the programs apart
    from the pages to the most - Permits some kind of WYSIWYG idea in
    the team of designers - Be very simple

    This module has been the product of trying a simple aproach for
    teams of beginers in the mod_perl world. Oriented to keep the power
    of the API, giving the tool to write template based systems.

    Thers is too, a clear separation between the source HTML file and
    the dynamic content.

    The module uses a tag based zone declaration that exists as the
    XMLSubsMatch directive in Apache::ASP.

    It's running actually in various sites. I was not sure about
    uploading, because in some way, it just take functionality present
    in other two projects, but, the actual programmers using the library
    are urging me to post it on the CPAN. Actually, i send email copies
    to my friends.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Myasp           bdpfp Another template base system for web pages   HANSPOO
