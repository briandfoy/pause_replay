Hi,

I'd like to register to contribute to CPAN.

My name is Robert Graff,
my email address is rgraff@robertscloset.com
My homepage is http://www.robertscloset.com
I'd prefer rgraff as my user-ID

I'm currently developing Apache::MP3::Skin which subclasses
Apache::MP3::Playlist and through the power of HTML::Template allows all the
functionality of Lincoln Stein's creation to be skinned.

I've completed 90% of the functionality, 70% of the documention, and am
looking into a small number of known bugs.  I expect to have something for
serious testing later this week.

A stable demo with a test skin can be seen at http://www.apachemp3.com/demo/

Thanks,

-Robert
