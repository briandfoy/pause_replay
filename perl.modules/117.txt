Greetings,

As part of a recent project, we've built a small perl module around
ARM, the Application Response Measurement standard from the CMG.
It would seem that an expanded version of this module would be
useful for a wider audience, and I'd like to register with PAUSE
to help foster the discussion and developement.

Wrapping DBI accesses to Oracle with ARM start and stop calls has
provided a very quick way to collect response time metrics, and 
may be useful to other DBI users. On our particular test system,
this let us use an all perl setup to exercise an Oracle database 
and view transaction performance with Measureware.  

Currently the module is based on a SWIG generated wrapper around the
ARM 1.0 functions (in a vendor supplied shared library),
and provides only a procedural interface to the
ARM functions. However, that's a good first step towards a
more generalized OO and procedural module that supports
ARM 2.0 functions, and runs on other platforms with other ARM toolsets.

Rather than explain the alphabet soup of acronyms involved, here's a 
pointer to the ARM faq: http://www.cmg.org/regions/cmgarmw/armfaq.html

Finding a logical place in the existing CPAN namespace for this
module has been a bit more challenging than I was expecting. It
probably belongs in a generic performance or measurement category,
but looking at 
http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html#Part2-ThePerl5Mo
a new section in "23) Miscellaneous Modules" starting with 
Perf::ARM or something like that. I imagine the folks in 
compl.lang.perl.modules will have some ideas on how this fits
into the module naming scheme. 

I believe the appropriate DSLI for the current state is "cdcf", but
I'd very much want to move to "adch".
