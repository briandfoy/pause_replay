The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::InsideOut
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: safe, simple inside-out objects
  userid:      DAGOLDEN (David Golden)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:
    Object::InsideOut Class::Std

  rationale:

    From the Pod:

    This is a simple, safe and streamlined toolkit for building
    inside-out objects. Unlike most other inside-out object building
    modules already on CPAN, this module aims for minimalism and
    robustness:

    * Does not require derived classes to subclass it * Uses no source
    filters, attributes or CHECK blocks * Supports any underlying object
    type including foreign inheritance * Does not leak memory on object
    destruction * Overloading-safe * Thread-safe for Perl 5.8 or better
    * mod_perl compatible * Makes no assumption about inheritance or
    initializer needs

    Additional comparison is in Class::InsideOut::Manual::About
