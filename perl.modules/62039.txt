Hi Stefan,

from reading your mail, it looks like you went through the necessary
steps. We generally require that people try to contact the original
authors by all means possible and in particular in public places so it
becomes evident that the attempt has been made.

Now, we should wait for a while to see whether Neil responds to your
posts to inline@ or perlmonks.

If not, please ping us again and we'll give you co-maintenance permissions.

Until then, you can already upload new versions, but they won't be
indexed. Since developer releases (with underscores in the versions)
aren't indexed anyway, you could use those for test releases without
having to fear that anything breaks when you get co-maintenance.

Best regards,
Steffen
