Subject: Module submission Algorithm::Functional::BFS

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::Functional::BFS
  DSLIP:       Rdpho
  description: Functional approach to breadth-first search
  userid:      CWW (Colin Wetherbee)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    GitHub

  similar:
    Algorithm::Search

  rationale:

    I chose Algorithm::Functional:: to specifically identify this
    module as having a functional (i.e. callback-based) approach to
    algorithm use.

    This module is a function-oriented implementation of the
    breadth-first search algorithm. It is distinct from the one provided
    in Algorithm::Search because it does not require the graph to be
    formatted in any particular way; rather, the user provides callbacks
    that tell the algorithm how to find, for example, adjacent nodes in
    the graph. Algorithm::Search, on the other hand, requires the graph
    to be stored in a set of objects, each of which must have specific
    methods, etc. I found that approach to be too restrictive when I was
    looking for a BFS algorithm for another project, so I just wrote a
    function-oriented one and decided to make it open source and
    contribute it to the community.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::Functional::
