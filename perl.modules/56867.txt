Dear Steffen,

Thanks for the notification.
There is no error in the PAUSE server, just becoz I was too busy and still
haven't wrap up the implementation from ideas.

I'm not sure when I would finalize the implmentation, though I already have
brief idea of the module.
Please go ahead to purge the module if it's not good to hold it for long
time.

Thanks a lot.

Tom
