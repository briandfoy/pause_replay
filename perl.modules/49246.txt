Adam K and all:  

I've been hacking together perl scripts for perhaps four or
five years now.  But only in the last year, through some
diligent study, could I even imagine calling myself a
programmer.  That being said, in the realm of choosing
namespace for public consumption, I'm more of a babe in the
woods.  

I had imagined that namespace would be a guarded thing and
was doubtful that a new top level would even be
considered.  I appreciate that we're even having this
conversation.  

So now I'm hearing that you folks would be ok with me using
both Politics:: and Community:: and also though that I
ought to name "the obvious ones into the most-correct
places".  

It might be helpful to me if I could view the namespace
heirarchy in a single place.  But I'm not sure where it is
I can do that.  http://search.cpan.org/ is as close as I
have found.  

So Let me try this again.  How about something along the
lines of:  
	
	WWW::htmlgui *
	Email::MailingLists *

Are there other "obvious ones" that should be reassigned
"into the most-correct places".
