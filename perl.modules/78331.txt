Subject: Namespace help for new IO Priority module

Hello,

I am writing a new module to provide access to disk IO Priority 
scheduling. Due to kernel support, this is really Linux only at present, 
but I plan to support other OS as soon as the capabilities are there.

Could I have some help selecting the right Namespace: Sys:: is 
discouraged, IO:: is for filehandle rather than disk IO.

Is there somewhere obvious I am missing?

Many thanks

Mark
