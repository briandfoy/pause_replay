I've uploaded 2 versions :
http://search.cpan.org/~perrad/CORBA-XPIDL-0.02/        18 May 2004
http://search.cpan.org/~perrad/CORBA-XPIDL-0.03/         07 Jun 2004
and the following query finds this module :
http://search.cpan.org/search?query=3DCORBA-XPIDL&mode=3Ddist

so, I think that it's an error.

Regards.

Fran=E7ois Perrad.
