     why:

    A perl module that I currently use in 2 projects and that can be
    useful for other people too. It provides a set of functions to help
    perl development (ProjectBuilder::Base as a proposal) and another to
    help dealing with Linux distributions (ProjectBuilder::Distribution
    as a proposal)
