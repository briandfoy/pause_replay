hi,

Andy Lester tried to transfer ownership over to me of Games::Go::SGF (my PAUSE 
id is DEG), however he was unable to.

He thinks he must have transferred it to somebody already, but they haven't 
updated the page, so we don't know who is the current owner.

Can you find out who is the current owner and either let me or Andy 
( andy@petdance.com ) know?

thanks

dan
