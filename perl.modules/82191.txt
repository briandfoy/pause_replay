The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Tidx
  DSLIP:       Rd+O2
  description: Range-indexing for delimited text files
  userid:      EARONESTY (Erik Aronesty)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Tree::R

  rationale:

    Text:Tidx allows you to index any text file using key fields
    start-stop coordinates, and, later, use that index for binary-search
    lookups into the file, even though there is a range of responses.

    It's similar to Tree:R in that it does similar indexing. However,
    it exclusively operates on delimited text files, and is a tool that
    goes with Text:CSV in some ways.

    Although it was designed for chromosome, stop, start indexing, it
    is not genome specific, and can index any delimited text file.

    It's pretty similar to "tabix" which is why I wrote it (tabix was
    too slow).

    The other names I though of was: Text::Chrdex ... but the
    format/structure is really flexible enough to index anything... with
    a few tweaks it could be even moreso (arbitrary fields,
    double-precision support, etc.)

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Tidx            Rd+O2 Range-indexing for delimited text files      EARONESTY
