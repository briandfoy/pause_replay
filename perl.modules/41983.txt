Dear colleagues,

I recently posted an RFC to Perlmonks and, while I got a nice response in 
positive votes, I got a minimal response in terms of suggestions, which is 
what I was really after.  The perlmonks article is here 
(http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=477283) but I'll summarize again for 
the list.

In short, it's a (yet another) inside-out object generator aimed at 
minimizing some of the repetitive typing associated with perl objects.  It 
was inspired by the talks on Lexical::Attributes and Spiffy at YAPC::NA, but 
it avoids souce filtering and most other evil (or, at least, tries to be 
less evil).  Key features so far include:

* Provides $self automatically to methods -- without source filtering

* Provides dynamic aliasing of properties within methods, eliminating 
accessor calls in methods -- again, without source filtering

* Uses attributes to mark properties and methods, but only in the BEGIN 
phase so should be mod_perl friendly (though I haven't tested this yet)

* Under the hood, uses local() and dynamic scoping of package variables 
($self, et al.) while remaining 'strict' friendly

Here's a short example of use:

package My::Object;
use strict;
use Object::Local;

give_methods our $self;

our $name  : Prop;
our $color : Prop;

sub as_string : Method {
     return ref($self) . " named '$name' with color '$color'";
}
__END__

As you can see from the subject and the example above, my working name for 
it is "Object::Local" (makes objects work using "local") but I'm not 
entirely sure that's the most clear.  On Perlmonks, someone suggested 
"Object::LocalVars" which isn't bad either.   I'm generally trying to find a 
name that is short, evocative, catchy, but not frivolous.  I'd greatly 
appreciate comments and suggestions.

Regards,
David Golden
