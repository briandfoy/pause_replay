Hi guys.  I'd like to volunteer for modules@perl.org duty.  I've been
following the recent "www.namespace.com" thread on p5p lately and it would
seem that you are in desperate need for some help!  I think I've been
involved with Perl long enough to qualify as somewhat lazy - perhaps 3
years now.  I'm the author of HTML::Template and HTML::Pager, id
SAMTREGAR.  Let me know what you think...
