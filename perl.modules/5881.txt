Good morning!

I'm requesting a category change for POE, but I honestly don't know
which chapter it belongs in anymore.  It has evolved from a MUD/game
engine into a general pseudo-threaded application kernel.  Do you have
any idea which category would best fit it?  I'm leaning towards #20
(control flow utilities: callbacks and exceptions, etc.).

I've also uploaded some POE::Component network client modules and will
be submitting proper requests for namespace on the module list.  They
seem to belong to the networking category, but POE in general doesn't.
Would you prefer that they stay in POE's category anyway?
