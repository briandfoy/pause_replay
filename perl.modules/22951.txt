The New York Times calls it "A delightful, quirky collection."
"A Word A Day" is now a book (ISBN 0471230324). Find it in your local

"When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone,
"it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less."
                        -Lewis Carroll [Through the Looking Glass]
