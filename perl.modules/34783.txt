Unfortunately, I cannot upload the file again.  I've tried deleting
it...it's scheduled to be deleted this Friday.  If you can delete it now
(and remove the delete from the cronjob), then I can upload again right
away, otherwise, I'll wait until Friday.  I perfer you delete it now, but
don't want to cause inconvenience.

btw, do you guys also handle the search.cpan.org ?   In particular, I like
to upload this version to:

http://search.cpan.org/src/IBMTORDB2/

Thanks.
