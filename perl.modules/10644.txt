From: goldbb2@earthlink.net (Benjamin Goldberg)

I'd like to register for a PAUSE id so I can upload the modules I've
written to CPAN.

My name and email [which should be in the From: of this message, but in
case they aren't] are Benjamin Goldberg and goldbb2@earthlink.net.

I don't have a homepage.  My prefered user-ID is GOLDBB.

The modules I've got written and am planning on putting on CPAN are:

   IO::Capture, a module that allows data sent to a filehandle to be
captured, without using ties (eg, if you use it to begin capturing
STDERR, and then fork off some program which prints to stderr, it will
capture that program's output.  A tie wouldn't do that).

   IO::Multiplex, a simple framework for building chat-like programs
using IO::Select to perform nonblocking IO.

   IPC::Multiplex, a module which allows one to do nonblocking reads
from multiple sources on systems where select() doesn't work on pipes.

   ex::lib::www, a pragma which lets you put a url in your @INC.  It
doesn't yet work with ex::lib::zip, but perhaps it will in the future,
if there's a demand for it.
