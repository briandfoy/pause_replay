Subject: The "Variable" module in old Parse-Nibbler releases

Hi Greg,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

You have ownership of the =E2=80=9CVariable=E2=80=9D namespace, which =
was part of the 0.23 release of your Parse-Nibbler distribution (the =
latest release of which is 1.10). That release (0.23) has a number of =
modules which are no longer in the distribution, but because 0.23 is =
still in your CPAN author directory, they=E2=80=99re still appearing in =
the CPAN index.

Your ownership of =E2=80=9CVariable=E2=80=9D now conflicts with =
ABIGAIL=E2=80=99s ownership of the =E2=80=9Cvariable=E2=80=9D namespace =
=E2=80=94 they were previously considered separate, but now are treated =
as the same by PAUSE.

To resolve this conflict, I propose dropping your permissions on the =
=E2=80=9CVariable=E2=80=9D namespace, and other package names that =
haven=E2=80=99t been used since the 0.23 release, and also deleting the =
older releases of Parse-Nibbler from your author directory.

I don=E2=80=99t think these steps will cause any problems, but wanted to =
check =E2=80=94 are you happy for me to do this please?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let situations like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m resolving the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
