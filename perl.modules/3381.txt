Hello Folks,


I would like to submit a new module to CPAN.

This is a config parser module. It supports a config file format similar
to the well known apache server config format but with some additional
features like here-documents, C-style comments or multiline options.
It creates a hash strucure based on a given config file, and it is also
possible to save the config back to disk(i.e. after something has
changed).

The module is since several months in use for some customer projects
(production environments), but not yet published/discussed anywhere.

It is named Conf.pm, I did not put it into a special namespace 'cause I
didn't find one which fits it's purpose.
