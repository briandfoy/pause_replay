Dear PAUSE Admins,

Can you give me co-maint for Crypt::OpenPGP please? This was written by Ben=
jamin
Trott (https://metacpan.org/author/BTROTT), and last released in Dec 08, 20=
10.

I've cloned the github repo and have fixed a bug preventing the module to be
build on 5.17.6+ perls (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D81=
442). If
I get co-maint, I'll release my fixed version and will work on resolving ot=
her
issues.

I've emailed Ben on October 24, but haven't had any reply (my letter is bel=
ow).
I've cc'd him on this email.

My PAUSE ID is SROMANOV.

Thank you,

Sergey

  [CPAN] Crypt::OpenPGP co-maint


  Hello Ben,

  I want to suggest my help with releasing a new version of your Crypt::Ope=
nPGP
  CPAN module.

  It has around 30 issue now (counting both rt.cpan.org & GitHub), but the
  saddest thing is that the tests cannot be passed on the most recent stable
  Perl (see https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D81442 for deta=
ils).

  I've prepared a fix for this particularly critical bug
  (https://github.com/btrott/Crypt-OpenPGP/pull/11) and I'm willing to do a
  release. Could you add me as a co-maintainer for this module so I could m=
ake
  an authorized CPAN release?

  I have an intention to improve the module further (at the very least - to=
 try
  to resolve current issues). Thus, I would gladly adopt the module (i.e.
  become prime maintainer), of course only if you are OK with it.

  Regards,

  Sergey
