Subject: Module submission HTTP::HeaderParser::XS

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::HeaderParser::XS
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: HTTP header parser written in XS (C++)
  userid:      MARKSMITH (Mark Smith)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Perlbal mailing list in the past (lists.danga.com/perlbal), but
    probably not much going forward given that this version is generic
    and not Perlbal-centric.

  similar:
    Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders - this module is just for Perlbal though,
    and I have generalized the functionality into a generic header
    parser.

  rationale:

    As suggested by Andy Grundman, it could be useful to some to have a
    generic HTTP header parser with the low level parsing implemented in
    C++ (XS) for speed. I had previously written
    Perlbal::XS::HTTPHeaders which does this but only for Perlbal.

    With Andy's help this module has been modified to be generic and
    hopefully useful in a variety of settings, not just in Perlbal. The
    new name is generic and specificly states what the module does -
    HTTP header parsing in XS.

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::HeaderParser::
::XS              RdpOp HTTP header parser written in XS (C++)       MARKSMITH
