Hi,

Apologies for not replying directly, I only just realised I needed to
explicitly setup my cpan mail alias.


brian d foy : What's UTV?

UTV started out as a TV station but they are now also an isp
and telephone company.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Television_plc


brian d foy : Is your module really similar to any of 
these commerce modules? It looks like the UTV is just a 
television station.

As stated above UTV are also now an ISP. The modules are similar
in that they provide access to a service available via
a website but not directly linked to the web.

Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB allows you to retrieve your bank account balance
and statement. Business::UTV allows you to retrieve you current
monthly broadband usage and most recent bills total and telephone call
details. Both modules do so by interacting with a website on the users
behalf using LWP or WWW::Mechanize.


brian d foy : Most of them are in WWW::, actually. The ones you see in Business:: or
Finance:: tend to use a special API.

In Business:: modules that interact with the outside world seem split about 25 : 75 
between lwp + html parsing and something slightly higher level.

In WWW:: many of the modules that interact with web sites seem tightly linked into
the websites they access eg posting comments , searching websites ,
searching the web in general. Are there any modules for retrieving
account information such as your most recent bill or telephone call
details?


Adam Kennedy : If in Business:: in general we find most of these belong
a country-specific sub-namespace like Business::FR:: or Business::US::

Which country would you recommend? They operate in Ireland (where I am)
and Northern Ireland but I do not think they target the rest of the UK.



Thanks
Peter
