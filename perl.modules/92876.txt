Request to register new user

fullname: James Clark
  userid: NEKO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: lazycat.com.au
     why:

    I've written a few pet modules for myself, but now I find myself
    writing a more general-purpose library for manipulating data files
    for the GPlates project and it occurs to me that it would be nice to
    put them up on CPAN properly for others to use.

    I still have a bit more research to do to jump from 'pet toy
    module' to 'proper publicly available module with tests and
    everything', but getting a PAUSE account will obviously be
    necessary. Thanks.
