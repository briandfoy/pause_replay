It's getting worse every time I look at it. We already have

Geography::States (ABIGAIL/Geography_States-1.2.tgz)
Geography::USStates (D/DI/DIONALM/Geography-USStates-0.12.tar.gz)
Locale::US      (T/TB/TBONE/Date-Ordinal-2.0.tgz)
Locale::Country (NEILB/Locale-Codes-1.00.tar.gz)
Net::Country    (ULPFR/Logfile-0.202.tar.gz)

And by grepping through the module list, I find that we somehow
blessed Locale::Country by mentioning in the cross-standards-reference

ISO3166    Two letter codes for country identification   Locale::Country

Unless you have new evidence, I believe, that should do.
