The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Pastor
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Generate classes with XML bindings from XSD
  userid:      AULUSOY (Ayhan Ulusoy)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  rationale:

    XML::Pastor is a revolutionary way to handle XML in Perl.

    Up until now, CPAN modules for XML have been in two major flavors
    => parsers and the like (like XML::LibXML) or modules that help
    represent an XML file as Perl data structures (like XML::Simple).

    XML::Pastor is none of these. It will generate ('make' time or run
    time) Perl classes from one or more W3C XML schemas (XSD) that will
    result in Perl objects that have round-trip bindings with XML.

    The resulting Perl objects are even easier to use than XML::Simple.
    Yet they can be read and written to an XML file (or URL) without
    loss of any schema information. Ease of use matched with
    considerable W3C schema compatibility (even validation). Once the
    code is generated, you don't need the schema any more.

    If you are familiar with Java XML Castor, you will find that
    XML::Pastor is very similar in functionality, but in many ways more
    flexible (like run-time code generation), although XML::Pastor is
    not as much schema compliant as Java's Castor --YET.

    This is a module that you will probably not forget once you have
    used it once. You have been warned.
