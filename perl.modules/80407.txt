Matt,

Please go ahead an cancel the application for Strut. You're right - it may
get confused with Java Struts.
Web::Simple is awesome, however I wanted to build something with a
simplified router, similar to Rails. I also plan to include a simple
templates engine, configuration and logging. All based of existing trusted
CPAN modules.

Cheers,
Stephen
