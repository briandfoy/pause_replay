I think a module which has common color names would be useful. The 
initial version would return RGB codes for a given name. There's already 
some duplication of this in various packages... but I see no reason for a 
module or script to require Tk, VRML, ANSI etc, to be installed just 
because one wants to say 'black' instead of (0, 0, 0).

I think 'Gaphics::NamedColors' is a good name for the module.

Comments? Criticisms? Is there already such a module?
