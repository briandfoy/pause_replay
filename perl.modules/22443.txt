     why:

    I would contribute a module 'Class::Builder' (if I'm allowed to use
    this name), much likes a combination of `Class::Struct',
    `Class::Accessor' and `Class::MethodMaker'. The module supports:

    * Automated accessor method generation; Four types of accessor are
    supported: string, boolean, counter and object; * Default values
    assignment; * Implement of abstract methods; * Build-in data-type
    generation (like `struct')

    I learned a lot from Peter Seibel's `Class::MethodMaker', with a
    slightly different interface, little improvement of perfomance, and
    a self exported function `struct' behaves like `Class::Struct'.

    This is a part of `WMO Framework', a web application Framework I've
    used for several project, I would like to contribute other part of
    this framework to CPAN later (after I got enough time to insert pod
    into the source code).
