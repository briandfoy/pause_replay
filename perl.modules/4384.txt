Hello,

I would like to commit a new module, Finance::FoolQuote, which is
derived from Finance::YahooQuote by Dj Padzensky <djpadz@padz.net>. I
talked to Dj and he did not want to take over the module, so here's
the info you need.

my name: Tobias Vancura
my email: tvancura@altavista.net
my homepage: ---
my prefered userid: tvancura
contribution: a module that allows a user to get stock quotes from
  fool.com web site, very similar to what Finance::YahooQuote allows
  you to do.
development stage: works
support level: no support needed
language: documentation in English
Interface style: as in Finance:YahooQuote

The reason I wrote the module is that Yahoo took quite some time to
update its database when Inprise changed its name back to Borland,
thus renaming their ticker from INPR to BORL. Fool was much quicker
and seems to be mor up to date in general.

This is the first time I contribute to CPAN, so please forgive me for
all the mistakes I have made.

Cheers, Tobias Vancura
