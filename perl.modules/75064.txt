The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Template
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: An intuitive template system for CGI.
  userid:      DVENABLE (David Venable)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Template HTML::Template

  rationale:

    Hello.

    This module creates an intuitive environment to quickly create a
    template or series of templates for web applications -- in as few
    lines of code as possible. Unlike Template and HTML::Template, we
    are not trying to create the be-all end-all template system. This
    was built in-house to speed up development time of CGI scripts, and
    over time it has been a hit and we've maintained and added features
    as requested.

    After several colleagues suggested submitting it to CPAN I decided
    to go ahead and do it.

    The reason I suggest it be placed within the CGI namespace is
    because of the focus on easy and quick templates in CGI scripts and
    web applications, not necessarily to cover all aspects of HTML.
    Additionally, the module contains several CGI-specific functions.

    If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

    Thanks,

    David Venable
