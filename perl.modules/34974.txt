This goes back to April of this year.  Approximately 380 PAUSE
IDs have been requested since then, and we've not approved only
nine of them (which is low, since a lot slipped by when they
shouldn't have).  Three of these have other accounts they can use.
Four identified companies rather than individuals, one didn't
have a person attached to it, and one was the name of another
company (although unassociated with it).

I checked if some of these people sent in new requests.  The
six that didn't have another account were not seen again, so our
miss rate is a little over 2%.  We might be able to fix this if
we had a way to contact them.

Still, not to shabby on that side of the house. :)
