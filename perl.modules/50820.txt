Hi Steffen,

thank you for your mail.=20=20

You said, that you could not understand my namespace because the rationale =
was missing. Sorry for that.

Well, as you supposed, Win32::Exe and Win32::PerlExe::Env are NOT similar i=
n any way.

The name Win32::PerlExe::Env  reflects the following short story:

Win32 - no comment :-)
PerlExe - Handle Perl scripts packed as .exe Executables
Env - Get runtime environment of the script and the packer

The name PerlExe implies a NATIVE module to check packed Perl scripts in .e=
xe format. At the moment - just for the recent version -  the module suppor=
ts ActiveState PerlApp, PerlSvc and PerlTray packers. But the module is pre=
pared to evalute ANY other packed Perl .exe as well - this is commented int=
ernally.

Global differences between the modules are...

1) Win32::Exe mainly scans "normal" .exe files to get all the file structur=
es and internal file informations. But the .exe file does not run at all.

2) Win32::PerlExe::Env reads the enviroment of a running Perl script  which=
 was packed as an exeutable before and which may have embedded components. =
Furthermore the original packer environment will be read.

... and I cannot really see a relation between both modules - except the 'E=
xe' of course.

At CPAN I could not find a 'relation' between  any existing module an Win32=
::PerlExe::Env. In other respects I would have filled out the bit.

Hopefully you can understand the explanations...

Thomas
