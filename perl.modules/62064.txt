For what it's worth, another of my modules (Win32::Process::Info) does the same kind of thing: puts namespace Win32::Process::Info::DummyRoutine in the same file with Win32::Process::Info::NT, and declares namespace Win32::Process::Info::DummyRoutine in META.yml. Yet Win32::Process::Info::DummyRoutine is listed as mine, "first-come".

No, I'm not arguing, just providing an additional datum.

Certainly. I'd love for this to be a private namespace, but as far as I know there is no such thing in Perl 5. If there's a way to prevent namespaces from being emitted into META.yml I don't know it, and even if it could be done it may not be a good idea.

Fixed in next release (and the check is in the mail ...). Is this of enough interest to you that I should make a release to fix it? Should I let you know when I release, or will things come out right once the indexer sees a file to go with the namespace?

Should I also do something with Win32::Process::Info::DummyRoutine, or should I just ignore it since it is indexed correctly? It will take a bit to get this one straight, since I don't have an MSWin32 system at my disposal at the moment.
