The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Gitc
  DSLIP:       bdphg
  description: a git workflow management tool
  userid:      GSG (Grant Street Group)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    github

  similar:

  rationale:

    The App::Gitc name was chosen because this is a command line
    application. The name gitc, specifically, was chosen as an
    abbreviation for git changesets. Gitc should be listed in the module
    list, because it is a novel code review tool. It organizes source
    code changes into changesets, while still preserving division into
    individual commits. It also supports development in multiple stages,
    allowing users to promote changesets ahead to stages, such as 'test'
    and 'prod'. Gitc can be integrated with a number of issue ticketing
    systems, such as Eventum, Jira, and Github issues.

  enteredby:   GSG (Grant Street Group)
  enteredon:   Thu May  2 16:48:11 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

App::
::Gitc            bdphg a git workflow management tool               GSG
