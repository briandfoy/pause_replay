Subject: Module submission Mobile::WURFL
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mobile::WURFL
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Interface to WURFL data file
  userid:      VALDEZ (Valerio VALDEZ Paolini)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Mobile::UserAgent HTTP::MobileAgent

  rationale:

    The WURFL is an XML configuration file which contains information
    about capabilities and features of several wireless devices.

    WURFL is a project on Sourceforge: http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/

    Mobile::WURFL will provide a way to extract desired informations
    from a WURFL configuration file.

    1. there isn't a module on CPAN that uses WURFL data to list
    capabilities of mobile handsets;

    2. this module will use a list of known and verified capabilities,
    instead of trying to deduct them using euristics based on user agent
    strings provided by mobile handsets;

    3. code doesn't need to be updated when new phones are released,
    you only need to upgrade the WURFL data file.

    Thanks for your attention.

    Ciao, Valerio
