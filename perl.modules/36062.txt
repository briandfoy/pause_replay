Hi there,
	I'm writing a set of modules that can parse a series of files produced 
by Affymetrix machines. These are machines used in biological research, 
which (basically) analyse samples and produce a series of files. The 
modules are a series of modules for each type of file produced. The 
modules parse the files only, and do not do anything with them after that.

I was hoping you may be able to offer some advice on a namespace. I am 
thinking about:

Bio::Affymetrix:: - but many other Affymetrix system modules may be 
possible, not just parsing files. Also my modules don't do anything 
other than parsing.

Bio::Affymetrix::Files:: - bit long

File::Affymetrix:: -- doesn't seem to match with other modules that do 
similar things.

I think I'm going to go with Bio::Affymetrix::Files::. Have you any advice?

Thanks,
David
