hello! i would like to partake in the CPAN glory.
here are my details:

name:  peter forty
email: peter@peter.nyc.ny.us
home:  http://peter.nyc.ny.us/
preferred id: FORTY
planning to contribute: Apache::SimpleTemplate

description is pasted below. for more info, the pod can
be found at: http://peter.nyc.ny.us/simpletemplate/pod.html

  Apache::SimpleTemplate is *another* Template-with-embedded-Perl package
  for mod_perl. It allows you to embed blocks of Perl code into text
  documents, such as HTML files, and have this code executed upon HTTP
  request. It is meant to be a slim and basic alternative to existing
  packages (Apache::Embperl, Apache::ASP, ...), without any added
  syntax/tags/etc and with only the bare necessities of functionality.

please let me know if you need any more information.

thanks!
peter
