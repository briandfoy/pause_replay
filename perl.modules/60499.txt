Your name didn't mention JSON, it only said Serialize :)

Serialize to JSON, or any format, isn't that spectacular. It's just a
text format. That a logging package writes a particular text format
isn't exciting.

Could  Log4perl's PatternLayout could do JSON with the right
user-defined pattern? You can pretty much have any format that
you like.
