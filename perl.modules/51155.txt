Subject: Module submission Alien::scriptaculous

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Alien::scriptaculous
  DSLIP:       RdoOp
  description: find and install script.aculo.us
  userid:      GTERMARS (Graham TerMarsch)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Prototype

  rationale:

    Have chosen "Alien::scriptaculous" namespace as script.aculo.us is
    a set of JavaScript libraries, and they are in that sense "alien" to
    Perl. I've found on more than one occasion that I've wanted to make
    use of script.aculo.us from within my Perl-based web applications,
    and having this installed via an Alien package makes that easier.

    I am aware that HTML::Prototype bundles a copy of script.aculo.us
    in its own distribution. I felt that putting this into the Alien
    namespace was more appropriate, and also allowed for bundling of the
    entire script.aculo.us package (instead of just the JS libraries),
    including README, ChangeLog, and test suite (which is -really-
    useful to have on-hand as a set of examples).

The resulting entry would be:

Alien::
::scriptaculous   RdoOp find and install script.aculo.us             GTERMARS
