The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Deploy
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Standard-Perl
  userid:      RMICHAUD (Richard Michaud)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    I in the initial development phases of creating a series of modules
    under the Deploy root namespace. This namespace will be used for a
    series of packages and extensions that enable developers and
    implementors to deploy code and changes for testing, pilot and
    production environments.

    My thought process is to build a platform-independant deployment
    framework that will allow for consistency across all phases of
    development and environments with little or no coding involved. The
    tools will contain module to handle deployment of simple files,
    database changes, and hopefully backout procedures, along with other
    ideas any developers might think of.

    I've currently built a custom deployment framework for a company
    I'm working for, but it still requires a great deal of reptitive
    coding to handle things like database deployments or Windows NT
    service implementation.

    I will be utilizing a manifest-style mechanism where the individual
    steps for a deployment will be specified in a text format. The
    utility will then parse this file and "run" the deployment based
    upon the entries in the file.

The resulting entry would be:

Deploy            cdphp Standard-Perl                                RMICHAUD
