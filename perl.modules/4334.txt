description: updated version of "Device::SerialPort"
DSLI: bdp0


Bill Birthisel (BBIRTH) was maintaining this code, but has expressed to me
that he isn't interested in continuing.  I've made some significant
changes (and bugfixes) to this module, allowing it to work with more
operating systems.

My updated version (0.09) with the associated diff from 0.07 can be found
at: http://sendpage.cpoint.net/device-serialport
