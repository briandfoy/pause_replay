The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Metrics::CodeCounter
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: SLOC Counting for SE Metrics
  userid:      RAPTNOR (John Fraser)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Code counting is the first software engineering metrics tools that
    I'll be working on. I'll be updating this with a baseline comparison
    counter, and will be adding size estimating functions based on PSP
    work. My goal is to open this space up for other PSP, TSP, XP, and
    other metrics measurement tools.

    Others want to extend this tool for cyclomatic complexity counting.

    Seems like a metrics namespace would work well to collect these
    types of tools.

The resulting entry would be:

Metrics::
::CodeCounter     bdpfp SLOC Counting for SE Metrics                 RAPTNOR
