The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Search::EbayUK
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Adaptation Ebay Backend for the U.K.site
  userid:      NINJA (andy pritchard)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Adapted from WWW::Search::Ebay

  rationale:

    The Ebay.pm module by Martin Thurn exclusively searches the US
    (ebay.com) site. This is an adaptation to search the UK (ebay.co.uk)
    site. I've followed his naming convention and attributed as much of
    the hard work to him as possible.

    The only extra funcitionality is the "results->raw()" call, which
    is new to this backend, it merely serves up raw HTML. Which is only
    moderately useful, but I may change this in the future.

  enteredby:   NINJA (andy pritchard)
  enteredon:   Mon Feb 24 13:08:03 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Search::
::EbayUK          RdpOo Adaptation Ebay Backend for the U.K.site     NINJA
