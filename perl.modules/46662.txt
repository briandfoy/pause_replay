I see, what would you recommend for a module that gives a simplified 
interface to a fairly complex module?

I'd be happy to reregister with a more proper name, I chose "Easy" 
because it makes it much easier to do complex tasks that its base class 
is capable of, so I'm not sure what would be more concise and 
descriptive than "Easy" in this case.

Any ideas are much appreciated

Thanks
