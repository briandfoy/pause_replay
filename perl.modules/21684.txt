I didn't get any response from this, so I'm resending...

ORIGINALLY From muir (ARCHIVE)

To: modules@perl.org
Subject: updates for my module listings

I've taken a look at how my modules are listed...  

* *** Operating System Interfaces, Hardware Drivers
* 
* BSD::
* ::Ipfwgen          bdpf? Generate ipfw(8) filters                     

Delist BSD::Ipfwgen.  I's suffered age-related bitrot.

* Proc
* ::Forkfunc	   Rdpf? Simple lwall-style fork wrapper

Leave this as is.

* *** Networking, Device Control (modems) and InterProcess Communication
* 
* Net::
* ::Netmask	   RdpO? Understand and manipulate network blocks

Change DSLIP to "RdpOo"

* *** Data Types and Data Type Utilities (see also Database Interfaces)
* 
* Time::
* ::CTime            Rdpf? Format Times ala ctime(3) with many formats
* ::DaysInMonth      Rdpf? Returns the number of days in a month        
* ::JulianDay        Rdpf? Converts y/m/d into seconds                 
* ::ParseDate        Rdpf? Parses many forms of dates and times         
* ::Timezone         Rdpf? Figures out timezone offsets                 

Change DSLIP to "RdpOo"

* Object::
* ::Transaction      bdpO? Transactions on serialized HASH files       

Change DSLIP to "RdpOo".

This would be a better fit in "Data Type Marshaling (converting to/from strings) 
and Persistent Storage"

* Ref                RdpO? Print, compare, and copy perl structures

Delete this.  It's dead code at this point.

* *** Data Type Marshaling (converting to/from strings) and Persistent Storage
* 
* Marshal::
* ::Dispatch         cdpO? Convert arbitrary objects to/from strings    
* ::Packed           cdpO? Run-length coded version of Marshal module   
* ::Eval             cdpO? Undo serialization with eval                 

Delete these.  Dead code.

* *** File Names, File Systems and File Locking (see also File Handles)
* 
* File::
* ::Flock            Mdph? flock() wrapper.  Auto-create locks          
* ::Slurp            Mdpf? Read/write/append files quickly              
* ::BasicFlock       Rdpf? Simple flock() wrapper                

Change Slurp's DSLIP to "Mdpfo"

* *** String Processing, Language Text Processing, Parsing and
* 
* String::
* ::CRC              Rdcf? Cyclic redundency check generation       

Change DSLIP to "Rdcfo"

* *** Language text related modules
* 
* Text::
* ::Tabs             Sdpf? Expand and contract tabs ala expand(1)      
* ::Wrap             Sdpf? Wraps lines to make simple paragraphs      

Change DSLIPs to "Sdpfo"

* *** Option, Argument, Parameter and Configuration File Processing
* 
* Getopt::
* ::Tiny             adpr? Table of references interface, auto usage()

Change DSLIP to "Rdpra"

* *** World Wide Web, HTML, HTTP, CGI, MIME etc (see Text Processing)
* 
* CGI::
* ::Out              adpf? Buffer CGI output and report errors          

Change DSLIP to "bdpf?"

* *** Control Flow Utilities (callbacks and exceptions etc)
* 
* Callback           RdpO? Define easy to use function callback objects

Change DSLIP to "RdpOo"


Add:

Cisco::Reconfig  bdpOp Parse and generate Cisco configuration files

IO::Event	 bdpOp tied non-blocking filehandles with callbacks

Net::SMTP::Receive RdpOo Receive email by with SMTP


Also...

I'm currently working on a matched pair of object persistance modules.
One of them maps perl objects into relational databases.  This is 
halfway done.  It stores each attribute separately so it's not another
blob module.  Queries on the perl psudo-tables (one per class) will be
supported.

The other module maps relational database schemas into perl objects.
This one is not even designed yet.

I'm planning to release them togehter.  My working titles are

Object::Rectangular (maps objects to relational tables)
Rectangular::Object (maps relational tables to objects)

I'm open to suggestions for other names and I'm also looking for help
especially on Rectangular::Object.  

Anyone know how to untie a scalar from within a FETCH routine?

Thanks,

-Dave
