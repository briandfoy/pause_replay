Hi,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins, and I=E2=80=99m working on resolving=
 distributions where multiple people hold first-come permissions on packa=
ges that make up the distribution. One of these is the Algorithm-Diff dis=
tribution. It=E2=80=99s a bit complicated, so please bear with me.

MJD did the first 5 releases, then NEDKONZ did 6 releases, and then TYEMQ=
 did 3 releases.

Curiously, we=E2=80=99re now in the situation where ANDREWC has first-com=
e on Algorithm::Diff, and NEDKONZ and TYEMQ both have co-maint.

But ANDREWC has never done a release of Algorithm-Diff; he has Algorithm:=
:Diff::Apply, so I=E2=80=99m wondering Andrew, at some point did you incl=
ude Algorithm::Diff in one of your releases=3F

Algorithm::DiffOld was included in earlier releases of Algorithm-Diff, an=
d still appears in the CPAN Index, because NEDKONZ has old releases in hi=
s author directory. I think we can get rid of this =E2=80=94 see below.

Algorithm::Diff::=5Fimpl has first-come assigned to TYEMQ, and was includ=
ed in recent releases. But no co-maint.

Here=E2=80=99s what I suspect are the steps to clarify things:

=E2=80=A2 Delete the old releases from=C2=A0=C2=A0NEDKONZ=E2=80=99s autho=
r directory on PAUSE. I can do that for you Ned, if you=E2=80=99re happy =
with that=3F
=E2=80=A2 Once they=E2=80=99re gone, I=E2=80=99ll drop the first-come on =
Algorithm::DiffOld
=E2=80=A2 Transfer first-come on Algorithm::Diff from ANDREWC to TYEMQ.
=E2=80=A2 If NEDKONZ still wants co-maint on this distribution, then add =
co-maint for him to Algorithm::Diff::=5Fimpl
=E2=80=A2 I note as well that Algorithm::Diff could do with a bit of atte=
ntion. Tye: If you don=E2=80=99t have the time or inclination to maintain=
 it, would you be happy for me to try and find an appropriate maintainer=3F=
 There are quite a few CPAN distributions dependent on Algorithm-Diff, so=
 we=E2=80=99d be careful on who we=E2=80=99d consider appropriate.

How does the above sound=3F

Thanks,
Neil
