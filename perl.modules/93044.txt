     why:

    I am a working mathematician wanting to post new or just invented
    algorithms that appear in pure mathematical or related research
    pre-prints and write these up as Perl Modules (I currently write-up
    such algorithms in LISP) that may be of interest to the Perl
    community. Essentially, I take current research results into
    algorithms and translate such theoretical work into useful Perl
    modules for the benefit of the global programming community.
