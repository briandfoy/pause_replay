Subject: Proposed modules XML::Handler::EasyTree::(Generator|Searchable::Extended)
To: modules@perl.org

From: phreelance@yahoo.com (wren argetlahm)

Hello,
I'm new to adding things to CPAN but I was informed I
should send a mail here. I have two modules I'm
proposing to post. Both deal with the EasyTree
structures created by XML::Parser::EasyTree and
XML::Handler::Trees. I chose to go with the namespace
of the latter because the author of the two modules
informed me that it was the "more maintained" one.

The first, XML::Handler::EasyTree::Generator, is a
module for creating ET structures with an intrface
similar to CGI.pm.

The second,
XML::Handler::EasyTree::Searchable::Extended, is a
module for searching through ET structures. It has
greater (extended) ability to search compared to
XML::Handler::EasyTree::Searchable, and would be a
child class of that module's class (as well as
offering a non-child version if people don't want to
use ::Searchable for whatever reason, like that
they're using XML::Parser::EasyTree).

I dunno if I should mention anything else,
~wren
