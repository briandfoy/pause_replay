Subject: Module submission Data::Deep

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Deep
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: structures compare, travel, search, patch
  userid:      DAMO (Matthieu Damerose)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    List::Compare, Data::Compare, Array::Compare

  rationale:

    This the swiss army tool for perl complex data structure.

    The main feature is path management : For instance search on a
    expression path will return nodes path which match which expression.
    Comparison result is the list of modification from source to
    destination using path notation (see samples).

    The aim is to manipulate every kind of parsed datas from a given
    expanded structure of array, hash, ref, modules, ...

    This could be an internal part of a viewer made of a parser to
    perl, for everyday purpose, for free...

    I can't keep that only for me and myself ...

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
