Nono, it's OK to follow Damian. John Peacock, Graham Barr, and many
others have been working very hard to make that thing work that Damian
recommended. Should we burn his book just because things didn't work
the way he recommended at that time? No, really, we made it work and
it worked as far as I know until *you* came:)

Yes.

No, my deep recordatii say that it worked;)

What is new to me is not the qv notation but the META.yml file that
contains the following:

provides:
  Tie::DxHash:
    file: lib/Tie/DxHash.pm
    version: !!perl/hash:version
      qv: 1
      version:
        - 1
        - 0
        - 0

So here we have it spelled out: version is a blessed perl hash.

I'm not sure what PAUSE is missing or if your software did the right
thing. Most probably PAUSE needs an upgrade of YAML.pm or needs
YAML::Syck installed.

Paging "blessed" John "Version" Peacock.... What would you diagnose?

That was not needed in this case because PAUSE did not accept the
"HASH" word as a version. It stood at 0.93 and would have accepted 1.0
without a problem.
