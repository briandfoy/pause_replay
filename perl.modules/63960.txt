The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::SFTP
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Testing framework for Net::SFTP
  userid:      XSAWYERX (Sawyer X)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    i intend to put a post on it on my use.perl.org journal

  similar:

  rationale:

    While writing an in-house module, I had problems with Net::SFTP. I
    wasn't sure if it's Net::SFTP not being consistent or me failing to
    use it correctly. I figured that if I'd had a proper framework for
    testing it, I could see what the exact problem is. I could also use
    it to write an easy testing suite to use in modules, or complete
    in-house testing suites, as possible with other testing frameworks
    (Test::TT, Test::Weaken, Test::File, etc.)

    I figured if I'm already writing it, I might as well put it on CPAN
    for others to use.

    I'm already finishing the first version which has 100% of the
    methods that I wanted to put, and a few others also. So it's already
    very mature and operational, and provides a full testing suite for
    the module itself.

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::SFTP            MdpOp Testing framework for Net::SFTP              XSAWYERX
