Unicode::Normal is a pure Perl module (rather than a program like
charlint.pl) to do Unicode normalisation (compose, decompose, canonical
ordering, block identification, etc.) designed to integrate into 5.6 well.

I will upload in a couple of days. Since the interface is pretty clear as
are the requirements. This module can probably enter directly at the beta
level. Just some confusion in my mind over compatible composition (like,
which ones to exclude)
