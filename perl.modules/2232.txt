Nope. I coded first :)

I don't have arguments in favor or against this name. I came up with it 
because what the module does is counting how many IP addresses in a log 
file belong to a set of subnets. In order to fit it within the public 
namespace there is going to be some renaming... that's why I'm asking ;)


>Same goes for Tie::IP::Address.

Tie::IP::Address got this name because it's a Tie interface to 
IP::Address... I guess that if IP::Address needs to be renamed (as it 
probably should), Tie::... should follow suit. Please read below to see 
more proposals.

The modules I referred to deal specifically with representations of IP 
addresses. They're protocol independent.

Under 'Net' there is essentially stuff related to networking and actual 
implementations (protocols, clients, servers, tools, etc). While logically 
the modules I wrote about could fit in something like 'Net::IP', I'm not 
sure if this approach would make sense in the long run.

On the other hand, something like 'Net::Address::IP' might make more sense. 
The Tie interface could then be Tie::Net::Address::IP so it could all boil 
down to

         IP::Address             -->     Net::Address::IP
         Tie::IP::Address                -->     Tie::Net::Address::IP
         Net::Subnet::Count      -->     Net::Address::IP::Count

Please let me know what you think about this one, as I feel this makes more 
sense.

Regards.
