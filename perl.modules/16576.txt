Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am writing to request your comments on a module that fits into the 
category of sending Network packets in the SMB protocol (Microsoft file 
sharing protocol, the protocol used by Samba and Win NT/2000/XP/9x file 
servers).

The module is an XS interface to a small subset of the huge number of 
functions in the libsmbclient (Samba 2.2.x) library.

They meet my needs of 

. sending and receiving SMB packets for Network management applications

. providing a very modest but hopefully expandable alternative to 
smbclient (an application that is very hard to script and for which 
SMB::Filesystem is a noble attempt to wrap).

Name spaces like

Net::SMB (although it does NetBIOS also)
Net::Samba
Samba

are tentative choices.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely.

'...No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the
continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a
manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes
me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know
for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee...'
