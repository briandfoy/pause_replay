The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Blog::LiveJournal
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: Interface to LiveJournals' XMLRPC API
  userid:      SUNGO (sungo)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    #perl

  similar:
    LJ::Simple

  rationale:

    Blog::LiveJournal provides access to the XMLRPC API of LiveJournal.
    The namespace was chosen after general discussion with #perl. Blog
    was suggested as a top-level namespace in the thoughts that Blog and
    blogging related modules should live under one common tree.

    This module offers much the same functionality as LJ::Simple with a
    few differences. The API that Blog::LiveJournal uses is much cleaner
    and easier to understand, extend, etc etc. Blog::LiveJournal uses
    the XMLRPC interface to LiveJournal while LJ::Simple uses the HTTP
    interface. The major difference there is that LJ::Simple has to jump
    through a lot of hoops to organize and understand the data coming
    back from the server where the xml coming back to Blog::LiveJournal
    is already nicely organized.

The resulting entry would be:

Blog::
::LiveJournal     adpOb Interface to LiveJournals' XMLRPC API        SUNGO
