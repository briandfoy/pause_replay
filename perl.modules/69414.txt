The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Template::Plugin::YUI2::Loader
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: dependency management with YUI's loader util
  userid:      ALEXK (Alexander Kühne)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    YUI::Loader

  rationale:

    Using YUI2's client side loader utility has various benefits: -
    Reliable, sorted loading of dependencies. - Safe, efficient
    mechanism for adding new components to a page on which YUI may
    already be present. - Automatic use of rolled-up files. (see also
    http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuiloader/)

    The module suggested now aims to ease the use of YUI's loader
    utility by providing means to specify the YUI2 components to be
    loaded anywhere in a nested template structure.

    The attempts made so far to resolve YUI component dependencies
    (YUI::Loader) on the server side suffer from the drawback that a
    copy of the dependency catalogue has to be aligned with updates
    being made to it by the YUI2 development team as YUI2 evolves and
    new components are added or dependencies are reorganized.

The resulting entry would be:

Template::Plugin::YUI2::
