Hi Dominique,

this is the administrative mailing list for things relating to the CPAN 
(hence modules in the mailing list name). I think you should check out 
the beginners mailing list at beginners@perl.org. I am not subscribed, 
but I hear it's a very useful mailing list.

You should generally strive to use the latest stable release of Perl. 
Right now, that is Perl 5.14.2. What remains is which Windows 
distribution of Perl you want to install. There are many to choose from, 
but the most often recommended are Strawberry Perl[1] and ActivePerl[2]. 
The latter is published by ActiveState, whereas Strawberry Perl is 
purely a community effort. Both work great. If you ever wish to *buy* 
commercial support, ActivePerl will be a better choice.

Best regards,
Steffen
