I would like some suggestions for a name for a new module I am writing.  
When trying to create a debugger with a GUI, it took me a long time to 
figure out how the debugger works.  I decided to make it easer for the next 
guy and write a module that will allow a debugger interface to respond to 
events when certain debugger hooks are hit.  I call it EDDI, the 
Event-Driven Debugger Interface.  At first I thought I would use 
Devel::EDDI, but unlike other Devel::XXX modules, it's not a standalone 
debugger - EDDI is merely an interface between a debugger and the internal 
debugger hooks; the debugger author must provide a user interface if one is 
desired.  So I thought perhaps Debug::EDDI would be a good choice.

An EDDI object allows you to assign subs to certain debugger events 
(stopping at a breakpoint, loading a file, compiling a sub, and others) and 
also contains other helpful methods, such as assigning breakpoints or 
retrieving a list of all known subs.

I realize that EDDI is an acronym, which is discouraged in the hints given 
at http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html, but I couldn't think of 
anything else short enough to be portable.  Any thoughts?

It's not quite finished yet, but I thought I'd get the namespace issue out 
of the way so when it is done I can upload it to CPAN without any delay.  
For the same reason, I would also like to register a username on CPAN:

name: Sean Healy
email: jalopeura@hotmail.com
preferred userid: JALOPEURA
