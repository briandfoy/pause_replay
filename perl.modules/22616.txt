     why:

    I've worked on a little perl script which monitors the Postfix
    spool, looking for mailboxes above the half of a certain size limit
    and sending warnings and alerts at certain intervals to users about
    the mbox size, including to the administrative account, when any
    mbox is about to reach said size limit. My boss asked for it and i
    had to code it in a short time, so it isn't all that great looking,
    but it is working and is fully commented and with descriptive
    output.

    It's been working quite well for about a week now and i'd like to
    contribute and have other programmers have a hand on its development
    as well, since it is not my main project and i'll probably not have
    all that time to work on it anyway.

    Questions are welcome.
