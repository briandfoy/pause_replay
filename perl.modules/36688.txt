Have one distribution per topic: Software::Design::GUI::harmful
Use a Bundle:: (ie Bundle::Magazine::Software::Design::2004)
to define which articles (and real modules :) are in that edition.

But I wonder why you're not supporting the existing channels
such as http://www.theperlreview.com/, http://www.tpj.com/,
http://www.perlmonth.com/, http://use.perl.org/ and http://perl.com/

Also I don't think "packaged and presented so that its contents are
easily searched on CPAN" is a good reason in itself to use CPAN.
Wearing my cynical hat I might wonder if you're abusing CPAN in
order to achieve higher (search engine) visibility.

I don't see a need for another magazine. The existing ones would
benefit from your input and suffer a loss of contributions if another
channel is opened up. I'm sure one or more of the existing channels
would be happy to give you a regular column for sw-design.

Tim.
