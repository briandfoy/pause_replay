Hi Steve

I considered adopting Text::Balanced recently, but after looking at it, 
wrote Text::Balanced::Marpa as a replacement, since I didn't think it 
was worth spending any time on.

Let me know if you think my module, or its companion 
Text::Delimited::Marpa, do not meet your requirements, and I'll give you 
co-maint.
