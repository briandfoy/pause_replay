The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Domain::Register::TK
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to TK Partner API
  userid:      DOTTK (Dot TK plc)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup

  similar:
    Net::UKDomain::Nominet::Automaton does similar tasks, with an
    unrelated interface, and a different target registry.

  rationale:

    Domain::Register::TK provides a mechanism for Dot TK Partners to
    register, manipulate, and transfer paid internet Domain names using
    a published API, without needing to know the details of that API.

    The namespace and inteface have been designed as they are in the
    hope that other registries might extend parallel modules for
    accessing other registries.

    Dot TK Ltd operates the domain registry for Tokelau, and as such
    manages the domain name space ending in .TK

  enteredby:   DOTTK (Dot TK plc)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 27 11:24:21 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Domain::Register::
::TK              RdpOp Interface to TK Partner API                  DOTTK
