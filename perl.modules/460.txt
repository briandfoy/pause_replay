In the sense that Robinson Crusoe owned his island, yes:-)

Seriously, this is becoming a FAQ and I will include this in the
module list which I wrote a few days ago (improvements welcome):

  We are not the Internic for perl namespaces, we do not sell
  namespaces, we cannot establish property rights. What we try to do
  is to minimize namespace clashes, and maximize usablility by setting
  up a catalogue and influencing the namespace development a little
  bit streamlined (as far as Perl People can be streamlined:-). We
  cannot guarantee to you that somebody else uses, say, the Foo::Bar
  namespace.

  Actually there are several levels of protection for your namespaces:
  the most important is the module list which actually lists and
  proclaims your namespace. The second is the first-come-first-serve
  advantage for the one who uploads a module for the first time: that
  one gets indexed, but not the module of the second one who tries to
  use the same namespace (warnings should be emitted, but do not work
  well yet). And the third level is the common sense we try to
  establish on CPAN that should prevent abuse.

Offhand I'd suggest yes.
