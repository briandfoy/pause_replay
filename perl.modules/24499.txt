If you can create one without such a large gid then that would work. 
But we need to solve this better.

So its possible that others will suffer the same problem. Although only 
your uploads seem to be having this problem at the moment. Thats not to 
say others will not in future.

I will probably need to patch GNU tar to ignore extracted uid and gid 
when not running as root. There is no reason to check them as they will 
not be used anyway.

No, the feedback form on the search site is
