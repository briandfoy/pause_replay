Cleaning up DBIx::Tables and DBIx::CGITables is quite a bit tougher job
than predicted - first of all I have to get rid of all DBMS dependencies.
I'll also check out DBIx::Recordset more thoroughly - maybe it can replace
DBIx::Tables.

I was just to write a simple script for copying DB content from one DB to
another when I got the idea that it might be done in a module.  I hope to
gain experience as a CPAN module author by starting from scratch with a
quite simple module... 

Name		DSLI	Description				     Info
---------	----	-------------------------------------------- -----
DBIx::
  ::Copy	adpO	Copy from one DB to another                  TOBIX

Currently it handles only data, but future versions might handle dd as
well.  Unless somebody protest, I will upload this to PAUSE as 
DBIx-Copy-0.0.0_1.tar.gz soon :)
