Subject: Module submission XML::Beautify
To: modules@perl.org, tbolioli@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Beautify
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Beautifies output from XML::Writer et al;
  userid:      TBOLIOLI (Thomas Bolioli)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    Are None

  rationale:

    Beautifies (formats) the output from XML::Writer, since that
    outputs one long line of XML, and any other XML document that needs
    to be formatted to be human readable. This helps debug XML/Data
    problems. This is unique as nothing on CPAN does such as thing for
    any SGML that I was able to find. PS: This relies on another module
    I just applied for a namespace on. That is Log::AndError. Any chance
    you can push that through at the same time if it hasn't already been
    done. Tom

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Beautify        adpOp Beautifies output from XML::Writer et al;    TBOLIOLI
