I currently have those modules at PAUSE which I would like to have
officially registered:

DBIx::
::CGITables    adpO  Easy DB access from a CGI                    TOBIX

This one is combining the power of Gerard Richters DBIx::Recordset and
Sam Tregars HTML::Template.  I have a positive dialogue with both of them.
It's beeing used locally in a production-ready project, but not yet
deployed.  I haven't written test scripts yet, but there is some examples
attached to it.  It will still need quite some work, though, before it
will fulfill it's purpose.

::Copy         adpO  Copying databases                            TOBIX

This one is for copying databases using the DBI interface.  It's also
missing quite a lot of the planned functionallity, which includes
mirroring - it's ment to be a handy tool for temporary mirrors, like when
migrating from one DB to another or one system to another.

I've made a system subclassing this one for migrating from the Request
Tracker 1.0 to Request Tracker 2.0.  It does work, but it will obviously 
need a lot of brushing as RT 2.0 - including the database design - is work
in progress.

CGI::
ClientError    bdpf  Sends error messages to a web client         TOBIX

This one is currently needed by DBIx::CGITables.  I don't know if it's
useful at all.  It just prints an error message.
