Subject: module name for load testing harness?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: mike@blakeley.com (Michael Blakeley)

I'm thinking about cleaning up Deluge <http://deluge.sf.net/> for 
inclusion in PAUSE/CPAN. Deluge is a recording proxy server and load 
testing harness that uses Perl and LWP to create user scenarios and 
then uses those scenarios to perform load testing.

There's an existing module called HTTP::WebTest, but it's oriented 
toward functional testing and web site coverage. The author and I 
agreed that these are essentially different tasks, and should remain 
so.

Two questions, then:

a) Should Deluge change its base name? LoadTest might be clearer, for 
example. I'd like to keep the original name, since I didn't name the 
project myself, but if it's clear that the existing name is too 
confusing, I'll try to convince the original developer.

b) What area should Deluge go under? I've thought of Benchmark::, 
HTTP::, LWP::, Net::, Perf::, Test::, and Server:: - others?

Benchmark tends to hold timing-oriented measurement modules, while 
Deluge is a multi-client test harness. HTTP may be a little too 
restrictive, as Deluge already supports HTTP and HTTPS, and can 
support all the LWP protocols, since it's built on LWP.

So why not put it under LWP? That seems implementation-oriented to 
me, which seems like a bad classification for a test tool. Net might 
be too broad, and it's already a very big category.

Perf seems promising, but the category description seems oriented at 
developer tools, rather than capacity planning tools. Test seems 
oriented to QA-style tests. As for Server - well, Deluge isn't a 
server: it's a tool for load-testing servers.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.
