The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::ScratchLive
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Read/Write ScratchLive crate files
  userid:      CAPOEIRAB (Chase Whitener)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    EFNet #perl #perlhelp

  similar:

  rationale:

    There is a DJ application called "ScratchLive". This application
    does some crate (basically playlists) creation but seriously lacks
    in editing features that can become a great pain in the butt when
    dealing with multiple thousands of files.

    An all-in-one Java-based tool by the name of ScratchTools has been
    created already, but it is not open source and thus cannot be added
    to.

    My goal is to provide base-level functionality for reading and
    writing these files to allow anyone and everyone to build their own
    tools for their management of crates in Perl.

    Audio:: may not be a good namespace for this. However, I cannot
    think of a better base namespace to put it in. I am willing to
    accept suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::
::ScratchLive     cdpOp Read/Write ScratchLive crate files           CAPOEIRAB
