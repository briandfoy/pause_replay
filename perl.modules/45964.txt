DON'T REPLY TO THIS MAIL, SEE BELOW!

I have received a mail (included below) where your address were given as a
sender, but which was trapped by my filter for spam, virus and other junk
mail. Spammers sometimes use other people's address as senders, so if the
mail is a spam, you did probably not send it. I send this auto-reply,
because my spamfilter is aggressive enough to bounce a few legit mails
too.

So if you did not send this mail, please accept my apology for clogging
up your mailbox.

If you did send me this mail, and it was not intended as spam, instructions
follow. Here are the reject reason(s) my spam filter found:

       Message body contains text: 'AfvbCKb', [Many consecutive consonants.].


Currenly my spam filter is running in save-mode, which means that I save
all suspected spam, and give it a quick glance, so I may see your mail
after all. But if you don't hear from me, or you want to make sure
that I see your mail, please follow the instructions below.
If you have a sincere reason to write to me, please use this unfiltered
address:

   forest@sommarskog.se

Note: if reject reasons includes excessive size or HTML encoding, I
very much appreciate if you correct this before mailing me again!

Whatever you do, DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MAIL, because it has a non-
working reply address. (This is because many spammers uses bogus
addresses, and I don't want the bounces.)

The rejected message is included below.

I'd expect to be able to connect from any computer, really.
Now's a good time to move it to Win32::* :)
