The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Proc::Command
  DSLIP:       Rdphb
  description: backtick that does not use the shell
  userid:      SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Proc::SafePipe

  rationale:

    Some Perls under Microsoft windows suffers disabilities over Unix
    Perls. One particular disability is a backtick without the console.
    Altough the Microsoft console, may be started without a window
    (start command with /b option or spawn program call), the Perl
    system command on windows usually creates a window. Creating a
    window causes immense user interface problem since it will randomly
    pop-up and take focus over the current window, erasing current
    entries into that window. Solutions such as "Proc::SafePipe" do not
    run on Perls for Window.

    This module provides an answer by using the "open" command with a
    pipe to provide a backtick without a console that will run under
    Perls on Microsoft Windows.

  enteredby:   SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul 15 01:08:52 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Proc::
::Command         Rdphb backtick that does not use the shell         SOFTDIA
