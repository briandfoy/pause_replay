The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::En::Tagger
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Part of speech tagger for English
  userid:      MACIEJ (Maciej Ceglowski)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Part of a toolkit for latent semantic indexing ( LSI ) to be
    introduced at the O'Reilly Bioinformatics Conference in February

  similar:
    None that I can find - there are some modules under Lingua and
    Lingua::En that deal with a specific subset of the funcionality (
    finding proper names, for example ), but no full POS tagger

  rationale:

    Being able to auto-tag English text with part of speech information
    is very helpful in building all kinds of natural language processing
    tools, and especially search engines ( where you want noun phrases,
    and little else ). There exist several tagging algorithms for
    English text, but none of them seem to be implemented in Perl ( at
    least not under an open source license, or on the CPAN ).

    I've been using a POS tagger for my own work on latent semantic
    indexing, and this seems like a good module to abstract out so that
    other CPAN users can benefit.

    For now the module is something of a homebrew - but we intend to
    extend support to standard algorithms like Brill's tagger and
    others, in future versions.

    I think the namespace is appropriate, since this is ipso facto
    specific to English, but I welcome other suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::En::
