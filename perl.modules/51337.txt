Johan,

Sorry to bug you.
We are currently making heavy use of XML::Mini.
I understand from my boss that he has tried to communicate with the
author of XML::Mini over a long period of time but has been ignored.
We need to alter XML::Mini for certain functionality (some of which is
to make it use my module) and because of the way it's written, it's a
nightmare to subclass.
I believe that XML::Mini has not altered since 2002 and my boss is
willing to take over responsibility for XML::Mini if necessary but we
are concerned that currently we have a version that is modified
specifically for us so, if a new version ever appeared, we would have to
retrofit changes.
Not ideal.
Do you have any suggestions for us?

Many thanks

Stuart.

I think it is very valuable. But since there's a certain overlap
between HTML::Entities and your module, it's probably worth the effort
to try to integrate your functionality in HTML::Entities.

In any case, please communicate with the HTML::Entities author.

Thanks,
        Johan
