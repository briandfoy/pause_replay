The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::CreateProcess
  DSLIP:       idcOp
  description: Creates a new Windows Process
  userid:      GLENSMALL (Glen Small)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    N/A

  similar:
    Win32::Job

  rationale:

    Win32 does not supor the fork() functionallity that UNIX has, and
    there have been a number of times that I've wanted to simply do what
    fork can do - that is create a child process and return the PID of
    said process.

    The intentionof this module is to do exactly that. Quickly and
    easily create a new process on windows, and also give you the
    ability to govern mor advanced attributes such as priority,
    windowing, owner, handles etc .....

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::CreateProcess   idcOp Creates a new Windows Process                GLENSMALL
