Hi,

My CPAN userID is wkeenan and I am able to login to the rt.cpan.org site.

However my account on cpan PAUSE has been set to nlogin.

I wanted to change the email address you have on file to be this one,  
as the one you have has gone, but I am unable todo so.    Hopefully  
being able to loginto rt.cpan.org proves i am wkeenan?

Can you help me please?

Thanks
Wayne
