Welcome Matt Auatin,

PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server, has a userid for you:

the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
in the PAUSE database.

This is what we have stored in the database now:

Please note that your email address is exposed in various listings and
database dumps. You can register with both a public and a secret email
