It won't be indexed by PAUSE (which is the most important part), but it
will nonetheless be "indexed" by Search CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/)
because it doesn't use the PAUSE index. For example, someone had uploaded
an old version of DBI on the CPAN. As he wasn't Tim Bunce, this version
wasn't indexed by PAUSE, but it was by Search CPAN:
  http://search.cpan.org/~hoymich/DBI-1.45-5.8.4/

The problem then is that many people (including myself) use Search CPAN as
their main site for reading the documentation and downloading tarballs, and
such situation is quite confusing.

Even now than Tim Bunce has uploaded a new version of DBI, Search CPAN
still shows the previous version in the "other releases" menu:
  http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI/

(And for the records, I asked the guy to remove his incorrect DBI tarball,
but he didn't seem to understand the situation he created and refused to
do so.)

Because everybody already have Acme::Code::FreedomFighter preloaded :)
