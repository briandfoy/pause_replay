Ah, but it's a lot more tricky than that.  Our recommended install path
is actually to get the Net-SNMP source and install it, as it installs
the perl SNMP module too.

And the reason that CPAN is intentionally old is that people have
complained (loudly) when the current SNMP module requires the most
current Net-SNMP libraries, which *aren't* on their system.  And because
the .xs file links against specific versions of the Net-SNMP library,
they are tightly coupled.

So in short, on most systems you should either:

1) install the default perl/SNMP/Net-SNMP bundles that come with the OS
2) build and install everything from the Net-SNMP source tarball that
   properly aligns the libraries and SNMP module.

At one point in the past we always had the SNMP module up to date on
CPAN, and we got endless complaints about people doing auto-updates but
couldn't for the SNMP module because of the versioning requirements.
They *wanted* us to leave the one in CPAN old so that it wouldn't ask
them to update.

In short: everything is a huge pain and it's not a winable situation.
Any option we had would make someone unhappy.

Maybe so, if we were going to ideally change the world.  But there is a
huge amount of existing code out there that uses the SNMP perl module
and thus unless the APIs were identical, all that existing code would
break.  So that's likely a non-starter.

You're welcome to contribute patches to the SNMP module through the
Net-SNMP tracker if you like.  We always welcome new help.

It sounds like you're wanting to rewrite an existing module.  IE, you're
looking for a name space to take and make your own.  Why not just create
a new module with a new name if you're intending to write something from sc=
ratch?
