Dear CPAN librarian(s),

I would like to register as a CPAN developer. My main wish currently is to
take over maintenance of the Newt.pm module. It was last updated in late
1998 and email sent to the author bounced, and his website is no longer
active. I hope to have other contributions in the future as well.

Name: Jon Jensen
email: cpan@swelter.net
preferred CPAN user ID: JONJ

Thank you,
Jon
