The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MRML
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Multimedia Retrieval Markup Language
  userid:      MUELLERW (Wolfgang Müller)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Namespace: modules@perl.org, CVS going to be at sourceforge, in
    Benchathlon project

  similar:
    ?

  rationale:

    MRML is a language developed for facilitating the communication
    between content-based image retrieval servers and clients.

    MRML will be used as communication layer in the Benchathlon
    content-based image retrieval benchmark. Such a benchmark is
    urgently needed in the community.

    The MRML namespace will provide modules for

    - building clients - building servers - gluing non-client/server
    code to an MRML server (which is particularly important, as we want
    to have theoretically-minded people with very rudimentary prototypes
    to participate)

    There was a bit of discussion in this list (modules@perl.org) where
    to put it, if to create a DTD namespace, or to put that into XML,
    however, there were well-founded doubts against this being the best
    idea.

    Content-based image (or other multimedia) retrieval systems do not
    work like SQL-based systems. They do similarity queries on
    automatically extracted representations of the multimedia data. => I
    do not think that putting that stuff into generic DB oriented
    namespaces is a good idea.

    Cheers, Wolfgang
