I think that there is a lot of room for confusion with your 
interface, and tat you can clear that up by following some
of the examples for the GUI Text widgets.

For instance, you use a method named goto() to jump to a particular
line.

   $obj->goto( $line )

I'd but "line" in the name so I could also have a "goto_char"
method.  Most of your other methods should do similar things.

Your insert method is odd.  It says that this inserts at the
top of the buffer, although without additional arguments, I'd
expect that to insert at the current position.

   $text->insert("top of the flops
