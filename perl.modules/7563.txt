It's a tough one.

On the one hand, it seems like Lingua:: is an obvious place to allow
non-English names.  

On the other hand, it would be handy if an English speaker could wander
into Lingua:: and easily find any number conversion modules.

Both kinds are found on CPAN.  For instance:

Lingua::FI::Hyphenate
Lingua::RU::Antimat (strips obscenity)
