The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       xDash
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Integration of applications using Jabber
  userid:      JWACH (Jerzy Wachowiak)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://xdash.jabberstudio.org
    http://www.jabberstudio.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi

  similar:
    MQSeries â similar concept and challenges addressed â>
    publish/subscribe integration of applications but using proprietary
    communication protocol. xDash is using Jabber/XMPP protocol and
    another approach to the development.

  rationale:

    xDash is a framework for publish/subscribe integration of
    applications. xDash is using Jabber/XMPP as communication protocol
    and implementing the concept of convergence between backend
    asynchronous messaging and instant messaging.

    xDash project (http://xdash.jabberstudio.org) exists already for
    some years and has been presented to the public several times (e.g.
    http://www.ccc.de/congress/2004/fahrplan/event/11.de.html). It was
    so far a set of scripts, which has been now refactored to a set of
    CPAN modules.

    xDash uses open communication protocol as the way of
    interoperability. It is not confined to Perl but on contrary,
    developers are encouraged to use the programming language which
    suits their needs best.

    The xDash Perl framework consists of three main modules:
    xDash::Sender, xDash::Receiver, xDash::Archivist and some other
    supporting modules. Modules are developed in the object orientated
    way. If you need to customize/extend functionality of the tree main
    modules, you have to provide your own base classes/modules for some
    tasks, which have to implement a fixed set of methods (driver
    pattern). Such tasks are: diverse spools for incoming jobs (like
    directory, RDBMS, crone like execution), logging (file, system,
    dumb,â¦), persistence layers for archiving messages. If you think,
    they can be reused; you are encouraged to make them public over CPAN
    in the xDash root namespace (xDash::Spool, xDash::Logger,
    xDash::Archive).

    The root level of namespace is required as there is no similar root
    namespace, which xDash would fit into. The Net:: namespace is one
    abstraction level below problems solved by xDash (or similar
    platforms like MQSeries).

The resulting entry would be:
