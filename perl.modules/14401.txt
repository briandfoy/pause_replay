The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tk::MinMaxScale
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Two Scale(s) to get a (min, max) values pair
  userid:      JPVIDAL (Jean-Pierre Vidal)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    ptk@lists.Stanford.EDU

  similar:
    none known

  rationale:

    Tk::MinMaxScale is a composite widget "using" two Scale, one for a
    minimum value, the other for a maximum value, intended to get a
    "min-max" range narrower than the "from-to" range of the two
    Scale(s). The namespace was discussed on ptk@lists.Stanford.EDU this
    month (october 2002): Tk::Scale::Interval was rejected because
    !ISA(Scale). Tk::Interval was rejected because "Interval" sounds
    like "time" and not "range of values". Tk::Range was rejected
    because the widget do not define a "range" of values, but the bounds
    of such a range. Tk::MinMaxScale was first suggested by Dominique
    Dumont, and approved by "Jack" who added "You know what you will be
    getting, just from the package name. i.e. A scale which handles
    minimums and maximums". Fortunately, MinMaxScale was the name I
    baptized first this module. Future : - do the same with two sliders
    in the same groove, instead of using two Scale(s). - add
    include/exclude properties, like [min, max], ]min, max], [min, max[,
    ]min, max[

The resulting entry would be:

Tk::
::MinMaxScale     cdpOp Two Scale(s) to get a (min, max) values pair JPVIDAL
