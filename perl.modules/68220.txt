The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::tkiv
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: An image viewer in Perl::Tk based on IrfanVi
  userid:      HMBRAND (H.Merijn Brand)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    C<iv> is a pure-perl application that was written to mimic the
    behavior of the image view and manipulation program C<irfanview>,
    which is available as freeware on Windows.

    Linux already offers many free image view and manipulation
    programs, but none gave me the key-driven approach that I liked in
    IrfanView, and most left traces of what was viewed in hidden files
    (thumbnail previews etc).

    C<iv> is not written to be a I<better> image viewer. It is written
    to prove such an application can be written in perl and still is
    fast and versatile enough to need my (own) needs.

    C<iv> is not aiming for a complete rewrite of IrfanView.

The resulting entry would be:

App::
