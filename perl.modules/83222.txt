Subject: Module submission Class::Core

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Core
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Classes with parameter types & error checks
  userid:      CODECHILD (David Helkowski)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, meetups

  similar:
    Perinci::Sub::Wrapper

  rationale:

    The module being created is intended to serve as a new base object
    system that will automate many of the core behaviors common in any
    class/object system.

    It will have: - Type checking on functions ( for better error
    checking and debugging ) - Deep logging ( so you can see exactly
    what went wrong when the system built on top of this breaks ) -
    Class dependency resolution ( it will serve as an object factory for
    your collection of objects built with the Class::Core ) - Multiple
    object states ( tiered constructors )

    I believe that the purpose is unique and distinct from existing
    modules, in that it attempts to create a safe error checked
    environment in which complex class systems can be created in perl,
    while still attempting to be a minimal wrapper, so that it doesn't
    interfere with developer's preferred coding styles.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
