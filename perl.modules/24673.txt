The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Excel::Template
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Template to create Excel files
  userid:      RKINYON (Rob Kinyon)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template PDF::Template

  rationale:

    I wanted to keep with the *::Template naming scheme. I am working
    on Graph::Template (based on the same class structure, but
    interfacing GD::Graph) and it will be ready for beta release by the
    end of 11/2003. I have also just taken over maintainership of
    PDF::Template and will be releasing the next version of that at the
    same time as Graph::Template-0.01

    Rationale: There are currently no templating modules going against
    Excel, especially not using HTML::Template's data structure. Using
    these modules has reduced my personal deployment and maintenance
    times by over 50%, in the relevant subsystems.

The resulting entry would be:

Excel::
::Template        bdpOp Template to create Excel files               RKINYON
