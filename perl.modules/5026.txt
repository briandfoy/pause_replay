Subject: New module: Devel::Cover

I have written a new module to perform code coverage on Perl code.

It is similar to Devel::Coverage, but implemented in an entirely
different way.  Devel::Coverage hooks into the debugger, but my module
has a plugable runops function to collect the data and uses B to map
that back to reality.

In this way I will be able to overcome some of the fundamental
limitiations with the debugger approach and provide more coverage
metrics.

It needs 5.6.1 or bleadperl.

The module has been announced on the perl-qa-metrics and perl-qa mailing
lists.

I think the name Devel::Cover might be appropriate.  It is a shame that
a certain amount of confusion will probably ensue, but I suppose CPAN
users are accustomed to that ....

I suggest the follow module listing:

Devel::Cover    adcf   Code coverage metrics for Perl    PJCJ

It's currently living on my homepage if anyone needs a peek.
