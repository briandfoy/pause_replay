Wow, that's a great idea.

perlmonth has a new look, but the articles are from 4 years ago. is that place
making a comeback or something?

I have supported those channels and intend to in the future... when I get some
spare time, which might not be for another 10 years.

Hmm, the idea of a magazine on CPAN just sort of sprung up in my head. I also
downloaded Randy Kobes' CPAN lite from sourceforge and assessed the possibility
of a separate CPAN website just for articles.

CPAN is a beast not unlike Perl. It is big, powerful, useful and can be used and
abused in a variety of ways based on who decides to get involved with it.
Personally I feel a magazine existing within CPAN is a tribute to how flexible
the architecture is.

1/ One of the magazines you mentioned above did give me a regular column.
2/ I really like the way that CPAN goes from general to specific when naming a
module. Most magazines publish articles with freeform titles. By strictly
following naming conventions, we develop a collection of writings on a
particular topic or CPAN module available in a single place.
