Hi,

I am running the Solaris 8 with Perl version 5.005_03 as comes with
Solaris 8. I have successfully insalled BerkeleyDB.3.2. But now when I
try to compile any package that requires the DB Support I get the
message that DB library not present or found, all the required DB
libraries and include files are in appropriate locations. I got the
messages like these:

Checking for installation of Berkely DB or GNU DB capability...
No DBM package was successfully found or installed at
/usr/perl5/5.00503/AnyDBM_File.pm line 14.

Where the AnyDBM_File.pm at line 14 says:
package AnyDBM_File;

use vars qw(@ISA);
@ISA = qw(NDBM_File DB_File GDBM_File SDBM_File ODBM_File) unless @ISA;

my $mod;
for $mod (@ISA) {
    if (eval "require $mod") {
        @ISA = ($mod);  # if we leave @ISA alone, warnings abound
        return 1;
    }
}

die "No DBM package was successfully found or installed";

I hope you would give me helpful advice about what's the problem.

Best Regards,

Sohail
