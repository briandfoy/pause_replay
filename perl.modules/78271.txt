The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DNS::Sinkhole
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A sinkholing DNS server
  userid:      RHARMAN (Richard G Harman Jr)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I couldn't find any existing DNS server implementations on CPAN
    that support whitelisting and blacklisting of zones redirected to a
    sinkhole DNS server, but there are plenty of modules to scaffold
    one.

    I've been developing a sinkhole server called 'greysink' on github
    at github.com/warewolf/greysink. After subclassing
    Net::DNS::Resolver::Programmable to extend it to support my
    requirements, I realized that it would be best to make this a series
    of modules w/ full tests.

  enteredby:   RHARMAN (Richard G Harman Jr)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov  4 01:11:05 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::DNS::
::Sinkhole        adpOp A sinkholing DNS server                      RHARMAN
