You're asking the same question I am, actually.  I think this module barely
warrants being worth the trouble, but I sort of dig little utilities like
this.  Really though, this module's only strength lies in its ability to let
you flexibly decide what the data fields are.  You use a regexp to parse out
the items and then an eval'd string to put them back together again.  This
lets you, for example, take a pipe delimited line of data and recombine it
into a multi-line record.  Such as this:
Jamie|jtillman|bigfoot.com
Name: Jamie
Usercode: jtillman
Domain: bigfoot.com

That sort of thing.  See the message I sent in response to John Porter's
questions for more info.

John P. mentioned the possibility of using IO::.  I hadn't thought of that
one.  Let me know if you think this new explanation improves your opinion of
the module's usefulness, and where you think it might fit if so.  Again, I
realize this might not be useful enough to warrant inclusion in CPAN, but
it's not in my nature to keep stuff to myself if there's a chance someone
else might benefit...
