Subject: Module submission Dataninja
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, jasonmay@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Dataninja
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: An extensible, DBIC-driven IRC Bot
  userid:      JASONMAY (Jason May)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:
    Bot::BasicBot, IRC::Bot

  rationale:

    I chose the Dataninja namespace, because it uses Bot::BasicBot, and
    IRC::Bot::Dataninja wouldn't work because I did not want to give the
    impression that I used the IRC::Bot module.

    I also did not want to put it in Bot::BasicBot because I did not
    want to give the impression that it is merely a component of B:BB.
    It is a fully functional bot that happens to use it.

    By putting it in the root namespace, I wanted to encourage other
    people to extend it.

  enteredby:   JASONMAY (Jason May)
  enteredon:   Wed May  6 23:55:10 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Dataninja         bnpOp An extensible, DBIC-driven IRC Bot           JASONMAY
