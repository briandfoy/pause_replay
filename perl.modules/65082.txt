   The ZooKeeper C client code talks to ZooKeeper using its
own custom binary request/response protocol delivered over TCP.
This is handled by a separate thread.  (It would be inadvisable,
I think, to try to talk to the server directly in Perl, in part
because the client must maintain a regular heartbeat with the server.)

   This module is a pure XS wrapper for that C client code and its
communications with ZooKeeper.

   So it's not a really really low-level implementation (on the level
of TCP or UDP), but it's not something where you communicate via, say,
human-readable HTTP requests either.  The protocol is specific
to ZooKeeper, I believe.  I haven't looked closely but I suspect
it's lower-level than, say, Net::Amazon::MechanicalTurk, which
seems to be a WS-based interface.

   Please just let me know if you think it should fall under
another category, though.  Thanks!

Chris.
