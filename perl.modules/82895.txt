I thought the main difference was that registered modules are more
discoverable on CPAN i.e. end up in
http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Data_and_Data_Types/Data rather than just
the search results. Maybe I missed the point?

Data::ByPath::RW just doesn't have the same ring to me. I think I'm
going to settle with Data::PathSimple because it works with my brain.

Ofcourse it depends on what you're doing, but I don't get the hate for
::Simple modules. I would rather be using XML::Simple rather than
XML::Parser and XML::SAX. I would rather use Filter::Simple rather than
Filter::Util::Call.

I guess in the end the name really doesn't matter, it's what the code
does that's priority. I just thought that by using Data::PathSimple,
people would actually find it and use it.
