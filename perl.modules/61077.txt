The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fennec
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: Fennec application framework
  userid:      EXODIST (Chad Granum)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    www.open-exodus.net, git://www.open-exodus.net/server/git/Fennec

  similar:

  rationale:

    Fennec is a framework currently under development. At the moment I
    am the sole author, however that could change.

    There is no meaning behind the name 'Fennec', it is the name of a
    long eared fox species.

    Fennec is an object oriented framework. It is inspired largely on
    the framework of the eleMentalClinic application
    (http://elementalclinic.org/) currently under development at
    OpenSourcery (www.opensourcery.org) which is also my employer.

    The eleMentalClinic framework is the greatest framework I have ever
    worked with, and has allowed EMC to become a killer app. However it
    was not initially created as a framework, it became one, and
    business logic is tightly integrated.

    I am creating Fennec to re-impliment the good parts of the EMC
    framework, and change parts I think should be done differently.

    The current source can be obtained at
    git://www.open-exodus.net/server/git/Fennec

    The framework is in the FennecFW sub directory. The FennecML sub
    directory is for a project I am going to write based on the
    framework, so please ignore it for now.

  enteredby:   EXODIST (Chad Granum)
  enteredon:   Tue Jul  1 04:00:09 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Fennec            cdpOg Fennec application framework                 EXODIST
