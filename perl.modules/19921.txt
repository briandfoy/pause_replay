Technically, this is true. But is this POD? Would you call this C:

   int foo(int bar) {
     _asm("...");
     _asm("...");
     _asm("...");
     _asm("...");
   }

The =begin, =end and =for directives as recognized by POD parsers[1]
are designed to add specific extensions to POD. However, when you only
use the extensions then POD reduces to the bare mechanism to embed
non-perl information in perl programs.

The 'danger zone' for Mark's idea is to use POD-like stuctures, which
may people trick into thinking they're dealing with POD while in fact
they're not. If running OODF through a POD processor produces anything
useful, people will think it _is_ POD.

Mark writes (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2003-03/msg00503.html):

Along the same lines, the embedded directives like B<>, I<> are wrong
(or at least dangerous) and should be replaced with more descriptive
directives. 

So, I think the bottom line is: either use 100% POD, or make a small
POD-compliant extension to POD, or do not try to POD at all.

If I were Mark, I would leave POD completely and go for something new.

Why not?

[1] I want to emphasize "as recognized by POD parsers", since perl
    itself does nothing with any directive.
