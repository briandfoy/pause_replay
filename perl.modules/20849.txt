     why:

    To start with, I have 4-5 modules that I've written over the years
    that, I feel, would greatly benefit the Perl community if they were
    submitted and used.

    CGI::AccountManager - A module designed to make user account
    management, through CGI, easy to do. CGI::ModManager - A module
    designed to modularize large application developement, mainly so
    that large, community developed, programs can be edited and
    contributed to easily. DATE::LocalDate - An alternative to the Data
    module, which simply returns additional (to localtime()), pertinant,
    information concerning the date. DB::FlatFile - An easy to use
    interface for manipulating text files like a database - also
    includes the ability to have distributed databases. RIT::SIS and
    RIT::SIS::Account - Modules used to interface with the student
    information system at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

    As you can see, I have at least something to contribute initially -
    not to mention the additional projects that I will work on as an
    active member of the Perl community.
