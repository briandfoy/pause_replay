The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Score
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Keep track of score in games
  userid:      COG (José Alves de Castro)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    Games are part of the Perl culture, whether people like it or not.

    Scoring is usually part of those games, whether players like it or
    not. Every time someone creates a new game, the problems regarding
    scoring have to be dealt with again. With this module, those
    problems are now solved:

    - You can create players, and assign them a default (or not) score;
    - You can define the scoring method (increasing or decreasing); -
    You can add or subtract points, assign the score directly, etc.; -
    You can define victory and defeat conditions; - You can assign code
    to what to do when a player wins or loses; - You can define what has
    priority when the player wins and loses at the same time; - You can
    define conditions that invalidate a new score and force the current
    one to remain active; - And much, much more.

    This is the wheel of games. Let no one reinvent it again! :-)
