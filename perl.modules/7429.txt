The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Weather::Underground
  DSLIP:       aupOp
  description: Retrieves latest weather from the internet
  userid:      MNAGUIB (Mina Naguib)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, efnet #perl

  similar:
    Geo::Weather

  rationale:

    It's quite simple. I needed to be able to retrieve the local
    temperature for a certain place in one of my reporting programs. I
    found that all perl modules dealing with Weather were to parse
    weather data from specific professional formats. None actually went
    out and got it.

    So I wrote Weather::Underground . It's name is directly related to
    the source where it gets the information from,
    http://www.weatherunderground.com . It's provides a simple, clean OO
    interface to easily retrieve temperature, humidity and overall
    conditions for a geographical place, and also supports
    multiple-match results.

  enteredby:   MNAGUIB (Mina Naguib)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep  6 14:27:36 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Weather::
::Underground     aupOp Retrieves latest weather from the internet   MNAGUIB
