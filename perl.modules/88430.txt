     why:

    Hello, My name is Anne Sipes. I am a Quality Control Analyst for
    cPanel, Inc. I have been chosen to participate in my company's
    Developer Training Program. I don't know yet what I will be able to
    contribute. However, I am currently reading Intermediate Perl.
    Chapter 1 recommends requesting a Pause Account. I am, of course,
    hopeful that I will be able to make contributions in the near
    future. Thank you very much for your time and for considering my
    request.
