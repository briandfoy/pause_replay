The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Video::ZVBI
  DSLIP:       bdcOg
  description: Interface to Zapping VBI decoder library
  userid:      TOMZO (Tom Zoerner)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://zapping.sourceforge.net/

  similar:
    Video::Capture::VBI

  rationale:

    The module supports (via the underlying ZVBI library) capturing,
    decoding, caching and rendering of a variety of data services
    transmitted via the analog video "vertical blanking interval" (VBI)
    and via DVB. Supported services include teletext, closed caption,
    WSS and plain data formats.

    This module completely overlaps and replaces the older
    Video-Capture-VBI module. As Video-ZVBI is a library interface and
    the other one contains actual code, there's no way to merge them. I
    believe it's still warranted to add a new VBI module, since libzvbi
    supports more and in particular newer platforms and drivers (e.g.
    V4l2, BSD, DVB) and has many more post-processing functions. The
    underlying library is actively maintained and constantly improved as
    part of the Zapping project (in contrary to the old VBI module which
    is in a stasis.) This approach has been ACK'ed by Marc Lehmann, the
    author of the old VBI module.

    The module should be placed below Video (and not below
    Video-Capture) firstly to keep names short and secondly because the
    module covers more than capturing. The module obviously belongs into
    the Video category as it's extracting data from video signals.

The resulting entry would be:

Video::
