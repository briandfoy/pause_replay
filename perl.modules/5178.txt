if a split is necesasary it would be better to have something like:

Audio::CD::TOC.pm (read the toc - array of MSFs)

and

NET::CDDB.pm (calculate the id, request the info)

the id is nothing else, but the MSFs and a sum over the length of them.
the feature is to get the toc not to calculate the id :-)

but then again, is it usefull to split ...?
