Subject: Module submission SVN::Simple::Client

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SVN::Simple::Client
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Simplified interface to the Subversion API
  userid:      MJGARDNER (Mark Gardner)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    #moose IRC channel on irc.perl.org

  similar:
    SVN::Client SVN::Simple Moose

  rationale:

    The Perl bindings to the Subversion API are often difficult to use
    and inconsistent, and it's difficult to subclass them. I'm working
    on a Moose-based class for the common Subversion client operations
    (well, common to me anyway): ls, checkout, commit, copy, diff, as
    well as a reasonable default authentication handler.

    There's already an SVN-Simple distribution, but it only (partially)
    implemented a delta editor interface for commits
    (SVN::Simple::Edit), and aside from an update to support Subversion
    1.6 in December 2009 it hasn't seen significant development since
    2004. Using SVN-Simple-Client for my distribution should help
    differentiate it enough.

The resulting entry would be:

SVN::Simple::
::Client          idpOp Simplified interface to the Subversion API   MJGARDNER
