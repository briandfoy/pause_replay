Salam,

my name is Riza Purwo Nugroho <rizapn@ratelindo.co.id>, 29 years old (born 1971), man, from Jakarta - Indonesia. My personal web site is http://www.geocities.rizapn. I want to joint with CPAN (PAUSE), and prefer to use rizapn as my ID.

I have some perl script, and I want to submit some of theme, because I think it will help anybody else using and learning Perl. My first script which I want to upload is GIFcounter. This script is used to display GIF image as a counter in the web. Also, I want to upload some others perl script after that.

Thank you,
Salam,
Riza Purwo Nugroho
