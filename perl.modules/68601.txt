Hi Philip,

I'm sorry, but modules@perl.org is an administrative list. There's few 
people reading this and we're all overworked. What you probably wanted 
is writing to module-authors@perl.org or a similar mailing list 
dedicated to the exchange between module authors. You may also get lucky 
on IRC. For example on freenode's #perl channel.

I have done the same thing in the past, but not with prototyped 
functions (or constants, which are essentially prototyped functions). 
I'm not sure what causes your problems exactly.


Best regards,
Steffen
