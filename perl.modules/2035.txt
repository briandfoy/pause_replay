I apologize. As Graham says, that was the information I based my
decision on. The decision was much less severe than you seem to
believe because Graham and others have admin privileges, they can
change this field in the database (as could have done Mark, too). So
to make a really rude decision, it takes more than one rude person.
That being said, I'll certainly be more cautious again in the future.

Thank you, Graham. Thank you, Jay, I'm happy that Graham acted as
quickly as he did while I was sleeping.
