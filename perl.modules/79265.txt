Hello, Mangesh.

Thank you for your interest in a PAUSE ID.  I applaud your interest in
learning about Perl.  [By the way, the language is "Perl" and the
binary is "perl" and no one really says "PERL" anymore.]

You don't need a PAUSE ID to learn Perl or participate in the
community.  PAUSE ID's are intended for people who are ready to
contribute something to the world-wide CPAN library.

Let me suggest you start learning Perl first and then later we'd love
to see you contributing to CPAN and you can reapply for a PAUSE ID at
that time.

If you're looking for general information about Perl, perl.org is a
great place to start.  For books, I highly recommend "Learning Perl"
(if you're new to programming) or "Modern Perl" (if you already know
other programming languages).  The latter will have a free PDF version
available later this month:
http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/index.html

If you're looking for a good community to ask questions as you go,
perlmonks.org is a great site dedicated to Perl and stackoverflow.com
is a more general community but has a fair number of Perl
participants.

Welcome to Perl!

David Golden, PAUSE Admin for IDs
