There's also Lingua::Ident, for what it's worth.

I'm happy to work together on the One True Identifier; my reason for=20
uploading the module was not to claim the namespace, but just to be=20
able to point other people at the code.    I I would be happy to send=20
patches to Jose for Lingua::Identify (my sense is the biggest=20
difference in our projects is that I do a lot of Unicode wrangling),=20
but I have not had time yet to study his module well enough to be of=20
much help.

Knowing that Lingua::Ident and Lingua::Identify already existed, I=20
purposely didn't submit a namespace request to the modules list.

Again, I have no intention for asking for an official namespace - what=20=

is the proper convention to follow for code you want to make available=20=

in this way?  Should I not offer it on my CPAN directory, but on my own=20=

site?      I want to use a sane name, but of course I don't want to=20
step on anybody's toes.

Best regards,
