    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Modules related to home automation. Mostly "device drivers" meaning
    PERL interfaces to hardware or software useful in the home
    automation space.

    Please note that I applied for a PAUSE ID about a 1&1/2 weeks ago.
    I mention this because I have received no repsonse, and sometimes
    people mistake my e-mail for "earthlink"; it is "earthling" - the
    last character of the domain is a "g". Also, "danal@earthling.net"
    is an iName forwarding service... while normally very reliable, if
    it is causing an issue contacting me, please use "danal@coserv.net"
    as an alternative.

    Thanks,

    Danal
