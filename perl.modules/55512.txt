The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Variable::Magic
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: Associate magic to variables from Perl
  userid:      VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    You can contact me on #perl @ FreeNode (Prof_Vince)

  similar:
    Not that I know of

  rationale:

    This module lets you add magic to any variable from Perl. Magic
    callbacks are specified as plain Perl subroutines. You can also hook
    extra private data to each magic variable and use this data in the
    callbacks.

    I first thought of Perl::Magic, but it's more vague and I didn't
    like the idea of putting it in the Perl namespace. Since the module
    can apply to scalars, arrays and hashes, the corresponding root
    namespaces weren't pertinent. Variable seems reasonable to me.

  enteredby:   VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  enteredon:   Wed Jul 25 16:31:06 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Variable::
::Magic           bdcfp Associate magic to variables from Perl       VPIT
