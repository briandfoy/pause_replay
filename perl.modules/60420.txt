The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bluepay::Bluepay20DailyReport
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: Bluepay 2.0 Daily Report interface
  userid:      CPKOIS (Christopher Kois)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Bluepay is a merchant acquirer
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquirer). There is also a payment
    gateway called BluePay 2.0 which has various interfaces that will
    allow a developer to post transactions, view reports, or set up
    client rebillings. This module will interface with the
    Bluepay20DailyReport interface, which allows a user to review their
    account transaction history for a user specified date range.

  enteredby:   CPKOIS (Christopher Kois)
  enteredon:   Fri May  9 18:19:49 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bluepay::
::Bluepay20DailyReport bdpfg Bluepay 2.0 Daily Report interface           CPKOIS
