hi adam, hi modules at perl.org.

my shift keys are broken. seriously. i am sorry.

bundle.. annoyed me quite a bit in the past. simply because the way they
work is severely underdocumented and in general badly understood.
furthermore, in some environments, it is hard to get cpan.pm or cpanplus
to work. this happened to me in case of a restrictive http and ftp proxy
which requires authorization. people think doing the

perl makefile.pl
make
make install

mantra with a bundle would just work. it would be really useful if that
was the case. i am, however, rather unsure about the effect of a new kind
of magic that works with a different top-level namespace. this would
probably make the confusion even worse.

if we really want this, what would you think about writing a module named
bunch or collection or whatever which implements the necessary magic and
which bunch..foo would inherit from or use in its makefile.

or we could add this to the existing bundles...

i am sorry that the mail is so hard on the eyes.
