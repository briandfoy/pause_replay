Hi List,

I have developed a tool to myself which I nicknamed "momo" for 
"monstruous monitor". It is basically a multithreaded program which can 
perform monitoring tasks such as checking CPU usage, memory usage, disk 
usage, ping times, processes, etc. and raise an alert (usually sending 
an email) and execute a predefined command when something goes wrong.

It can also be used as a (bad) cron replacement to perform things like 
rsync snapshot backups.

However I don't feel that "momo" is a very good name for CPAN. So, how 
would you call this? System::Monitor?

NB: You can see the current state of the project here:

http://ykoz.net/intl/momo/

Once I find a proper name I will clean it up and upload each module on 
CPAN separately.

Thanks for your help!

Cheers,
Jean-Michel.
