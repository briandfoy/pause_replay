The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AxKit::App::TABOO
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Object Oriented Publishing Framework w/AxKit
  userid:      KJETILK (Kjetil Kjernsmo)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    axkit-users@axkit.org

  similar:
    AxKit::XSP::Wiki, AxKit::XSP::Blog

  rationale:

    In some sense, many modules aim to do the same thing, being a
    publishing framework on the top of AxKit. I try to introduce an
    abstraction level that I have not found in any other modules, and
    hopefully this abstraction level may help me to use other people's
    code in my framework by subclassing it. The listed with similar
    functionality does nothing like what I do, but they are examples of
    other ways to achieve the same thing, and perhaps I can use them in
    the future. The choice of name is rather obvious, it is an
    application on the top of AxKit, and AxKit::App exists allready with
    AxKit::App::Gallery.
