Subject: Module submission Crypt::Skip32

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::Skip32
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: 32-bit block cipher based on Skipjack
  userid:      ESH (Eric Hammond)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Crypt::*

  rationale:

    Skip32 is a 80-bit key, 32-bit block cipher based on Skipjack. The
    Perl code for the algorithm is a direct translation from C to Perl
    of skip32.c by Greg Rose found here:
    http://www.qualcomm.com.au/PublicationsDocs/skip32.c

    The interface to Crypt::Skip32 follows the calling conventions used
    by other Crypt::* modules including Crypt::Skipjack,
    Crypt::Blowfish, Crypt::Square, Crypt::Twofish, Crypt::Khazad,
    Crypt::TEA, Crypt::GOST, Crypt::DES, Crypt::Rijndael,
    Crypt::Camellia, and IDEA.

    In theory, this naming convention and API could allow this module
    to be used with Crypt:CBC, though that is not the primary purpose of
    releasing it.

    Crypt::Skip32 differs from other Crypt::* algorithms in that it has
    a very small cipher block size (32-bits). This makes it useful in
    situations where other available encryption algorithms are
    cumbersome and generate overly long cipher text.

    The code for the Perl algorithm has already been put to use on
    several medium to high profile web sites, encrypting internal IDs
    for display in URLs, and decrypting upon page request.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::
::Skip32          adpOp 32-bit block cipher based on Skipjack        ESH
