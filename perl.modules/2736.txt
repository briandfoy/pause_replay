Hello.

I am an amateur guy with a website. I have set up a .cgi script (Web
Tracker) which uses SSI. Though the script is working fine, it seems
that the server doesn't recognize the SSI call from my pages, even
after I renamed them all .shtml. As I am ignorant re: Perl and
servers, I am looking for help.

This is the latest from my tech...

"I made sure that the Apache server was configured to handle shtml
files.  There was a problem with it handling the SSI calls from your
directory, but that should be cleared up now.  However, I have found
another problem.  The chkpwd.pl script calls a perl module "html.pm"
at
the beginning of the script.  Since that module isn't installed on the
server, that would explain why the script would fail.  I searched the
CPAN directory (http://search.cpan.org/) for that module and it wasn't
listed there.  If that script requires a specially written module, you
can forward a copy of it to me and I can install it on the web
server."

I know of 2 sites using this script, and the instructions say it will
work on any SSI enabled server?????
If you understand all this and can offer any advise, I will be
extremely grateful.

If helpful: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix) (Red Hat/Linux) PHP/3.0.12
 -  Perl version 5.00503
