The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Handler
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple Object oriented Date Handling
  userid:      BBEAUSEJ (Benoit Beausejour)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org, EFnet #perl

  similar:
    Class::Date

  rationale:

    The module's original development name was Date::Object, wich
    didn't mean enough on what the module actually "does".

    Date::Handler seems to clarify it's purpose.

    The original module documentation is found at:
    http://bbeausej.people.hbesoftware.com/Object.html

    I am mainly looking for suggestions on the name, Date::Handler is
    the best I could think of. "Date" was also proposed, but I don't
    think this module has the stature to hold the whole namespace
    toplevel name.

    Mainly, the modules handles dates and timezone in an Object-
    Oriented interface, abstracting POSIX calls. It also uses operator
    overloading for operations on dates. It's goal is to be simple, and
    as abstracted as possible.

    Thanks in advance for your suggestions!
