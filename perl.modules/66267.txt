The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::Nationwide
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Interface to online banking with Nationwide
  userid:      TEHSI (Simon Dawson)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB Finance::Bank::AllianceAndLeicester
    Finance::Bank::Natwest Finance::Bank::HSBC Finance::Bank::Cahoot
    Finance::Bank::Barclays

  rationale:

    Finance::Bank has become the standard parent namespace for modules
    offering functionality of this kind. There is currently no
    Finance::Bank::Nationwide module.

  enteredby:   TEHSI (Simon Dawson)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun 11 08:17:44 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::
::Nationwide      idpfp Interface to online banking with Nationwide  TEHSI
