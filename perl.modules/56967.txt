Well, it's just me messing everything up and everyone telling me about
it, actually.

But, SPOON is back to how it was, meaning that I changed the name back
to what it was and replaced modules@perl.org with Andy's email address.

Nick's account is still pointing at modules@perl.org. If Andy wants to
change that he can. I haven't changed any passswords in any accounts.
If he doesn't have the password and wants to change it, any of the
PAUSE admins can update the account into.
