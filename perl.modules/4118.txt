Sounds like a good idea.

I think this is a slight oversimplification. People will apply to the
mailing list to register a module. That means that we (modulars) must
know what namespaces are championized, and who is their champion.
Would it be possible to have a user-mode "Register a Module" form,
that just sends the request to the mailing list, and --if
appropriate-- to the champion?
