The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::FileTools::BulkRename
  DSLIP:       adphg
  description: Bulk File Renamer - Based on 'rename'
  userid:      SWESTRUP (Stirling Westrup)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    rename prename File::rename App::perlmv

  rationale:

    App seemed an obvious top-level namespace as the BulkRename is a
    user application.

    I decided that having too many things all in the top level of App
    was probably a mistake, so I invented 'FileTools' as there didn't
    seem to be an appropriate existing namespace under App for
    file-manipulation tools, and as I have a few more applications I
    hope to have working that would fit in the App::FileTools namespace.
    That said, I'd happily change 'FileTools' to a more appropriate
    namespace if one were suggested.

    Finally, although the installed script is called 'brn' for brevity,
    it seemed unlikely that that name would be immediately obvious as to
    the application's use, so I chose BulkRename which is what brn
    stands for.

The resulting entry would be:

App::FileTools::
::BulkRename      adphg Bulk File Renamer - Based on 'rename'        SWESTRUP
