The main reason for this (I think) is that it makes it possible to do
   cpan autobundle
and have a nice bundle of all your installed software, which you can then 
install on another machine. The format of this autobunlde is a .pm with 
specially formatted pod.

It's severely limited in practical value though, for a number of reasons:
1. you *must* place the resulting Bundle_some_date.pm in a specific subdir of 
your .cpan cache
2. it'll blindly install/upgrade any modules that came with your version of 
perl, which, most of the time, breaks important stuff

I think the autobundle feature is the main argument for the magic.

I like the idea a lot, but I think the namespace has a lot of Computer Science 
connotations (think Lists, Arrays, Sets etc).

This would be especially awesome. The dependency tracking is what I like most 
about the cpan shell, and this makes it much more explicit, and gives you 
better control over it.

Bundle really is amazingly appropriate for this, and I find it hard to come up 
with a better suggestion. Package is obviously not a good idea. Some random 
brainwaves:
  - Module::Bundle
  - DistPack

Let's see... education.yahoo.com comes up with:

bundle (noun)

    1. A number of individuals making up or considered a unit: array, band, 
batch, bevy, body, bunch, clump, cluster, clutch, collection, group, knot, 
lot, party, set 2. See group

I guess Bunch is about the only one we can really consider, because the other 
ones are either silly or too CS related (altough Lot::Of::Stuff would be funny 
;). But I don't like it.
