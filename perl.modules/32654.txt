Dear Potential Speaker:

This is an invitation for you to attend two IPSI BgD multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary conferences, one in Venice, and one in Prague, as follows:

IPSI-2004 VENICE
Venice, Italy (arrival: 10.11.2004. departure: 14.11.2004.)
Deadlines: 15 June 2004 (abstract) + 1 August 2004 (full paper).

IPSI-2004 PRAGUE
Prague, Czeck Republic (arrival: 11.12.2004. departure: 14.12.2004.).
Deadlines: 15 July 2004 (abstract) + 1 September 2004 (full papers)

If you like to obtain more information on both conferences, please reply to this email. All IPSI BgD conferences are non-profit! They bring together the elite of the world science (so far, 7 times a Nobel Laureate was talking at the opening ceremony), and they take place in the leading hotels of the world.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Internet, Computer Science and Engineering, Management and Business Administration, Education, e-Medicine, Electrical Engineering, Bioengineering, Environment Protection, and e-Economy.

Sincerely Yours,

Prof. V. Milutinovic, Chairman
