I've got a couple of modules nearly ready for submission. One is a module
which given an isbn will return information on the book from amazon.co.uk.
I'm expanmding this to allow easy addition of other sites.

The other module is currently a module to provide details on a cpan
id, such as the name and email address. This comes after much wrestling
with CPAN.pm.

I've talked about the CPAN module with a couple of other members of
belfast.pm.

Thanks
Steve
