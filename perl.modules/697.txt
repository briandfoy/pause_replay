I was planning to  write a module to determine the readability of
English text. It would analyse a file or string and determine 

1. number of letters,
2. number of words, average word length and words per sentence
3. word frequency count
4. number of sentences
5. number of paragraphs, sentences per paragraph
6. readability indices like Fog &Flesch/Kincaide

The first 5 items are not specific to a spoken language, so I thought
a name like Text::Statistics could be used. But item 6 requires a syllable 
count (using Lingua::EN:Syllable). So now I am leaning more towards 
Lingua:EN::Readability. Any comments are appreciated
