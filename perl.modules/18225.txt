The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::LSNoHistory
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Least-squares regression w/o data history
  userid:      PLIAM (John Pliam)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.announce

  similar:
    Statistics::OLS, Statistics::Descriptive, Statistics::GaussHelmert,
    Statistics::Regression

  rationale:

    There is an inevitable trade-off between memory and roundoff
    resistance for software which computes classic/standard
    least-squares regression.

    In one extreme, one must make an initial pass over the data in
    order to compute the average, and then another pass, rescaling and
    computing squares which might otherwise have blown-up. With this
    approach, one must retain the entire data history, costing memory.
    (see Press et al ref in pod).

    In the other extreme, one must make intuitive guesses about the
    averages, updating preliminary statistics once for each data point.
    With this approach, one saves memory at the cost of increased risk
    of roundoff error.

    All existing CPAN modules for simple 2-dimensional least-squares
    fall in the first extreme, while this module falls in the second.
    Both have their uses...

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
::LSNoHistory     RdpOa Least-squares regression w/o data history    PLIAM
