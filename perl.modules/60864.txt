From: cdavaz@gmail.com ("Christopher Davaz")

I already sent this but no one responded so I'm trying again. I want
to upload two modules:

Class::Light - Provides cascading object initialization and
autovivified accessors and mutators

CEDict::Pinyin - Validates pinyin strings

I have been waiting for a couple weeks for the account "DAVAZ" to be
approved but still no one has approved it.

A long time ago I applied for a PAUSE account but unfortunately lost
it. It was "CDAVAZ", I don't have access to the email address I used
to make it and I lost the password however I didn't upload anything on
that account. As the account  has no files associated with it maybe it
can just be deleted?

Thanks.
