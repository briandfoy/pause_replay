Matt,

Thank you for taking your time and explain further. I now can gather a
couple things.

1. Util is deemed strongly undesirable as a top level namespace.
2. People -do- contribute under Util, but never have registered their
modules because Util is not sanctioned, and/or because they never want
to.

After perusing https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=3Dpause_namingmodu=
les
I realized that "Util" is basically just another "Local" if you look
past the semantics.

Therefore, I'd like to withdraw my requests to register my modules
under "Util", (If there's a way to do it on PAUSE, please let me know,
I will do it there.)

Also, I suppose I can just leave them the way they are, as I would
with any modules under Local, unless of course, there's another reason
I shouldn't even do that.

I'm new to contributing to CPAN and can't help making a few mistakes
(and learning from them) along the way. I have no intention, interest,
nor time to not "behave reasonably". I was simply asking about
something without realizing it was taboo. Lesson learned. :)

I respect the collective wisdom on what's appropriate and what isn't.
And I appreciate the effort you are making to keep things sane. It
must be like herding cats. :)

-Kan
