Hi Ashley,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving =
conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names case =
insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or more =
people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and now =
considered the same.

You have ownership of Qt::Base, which is on CPAN in PerlQt-1.04.tar.gz =
(released in 1997), and Germain (GGARAND) has ownership of Qt::base, =
which is on CPAN in PerlQt-3.008.tar.gz. To resolve this conflict, I =
would like to drop your ownership of the older Qt::Base, and delete all =
of the older releases of PerlQt from your author directory (there are a =
number of older releases of PerlQt appearing in the CPAN index, because =
various module names were changed across a number of releases. As a =
result someone could (theoretically) accidentally install the wrong =
version of PerlQt).

Are you happy for me to do this?

Cheers,
Neil
