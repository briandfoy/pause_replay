Subject: Data::Alias takeover request

I wish to take over maintenance of Data::Alias.  I have recently published
a substantial patch to update it for post-5.10 Perls, but the author
(XMATH) is unresponsive.

xmath has been noted as being unresponsive in recent months.  This
particularly affected Sub::Name, which was broken by a core change in
5.13.3.  Despite a trivial patch being available, xmath never released
a fixed version, and ultimately it was taken over by rafl (FLORA).

Data::Alias got broken by core changes in 5.11.0 and 5.11.2.  Until
recently there was no fix to make it work on 5.12.  I posted a fix to
<xmath@cpan.org> and <perl5-porters@perl.org> on 2010-10-12.  In that
message I offered to take over maintenance.

xmath has not replied to my message of 2010-10-12.  Given the prior
history, I don't think a long wait is required to establish that he's
long-term unresponsive.
