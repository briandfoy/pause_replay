Done.

What is the Ram book? Have you talked about this with the author of
Net::Ping? Have you tried to improve Net::Ping? Or do you believe,
Net::Ping is unfixable?

GoodPing is not good name for a module when there is already a similar
one that gives a lead. You can call it GoodPing for an evaluation
period though. During that you should find support for your module and
ask them for namespace advice.

Sorry, but this doesn't qualify your module very much. Without
studying your competitors how can you say, it works better?

c.l.p.m seems like a good place. And contact the author of Net::Ping.
