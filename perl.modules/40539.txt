Frequently Asked Questions:

Q:  While on the Web, why do I receive a pop-up window
asking me if I want to update the Macromedia Flash Player?

A:  You are receiving this message because you have Flash
Player installed on your system, and you have the auto-update
service turned "on". You can turn off the auto-update service
at any time by changing your auto-update setting.

With Macromedia Shockwave 8 Player you can change your
auto-update settings when viewing a Macromedia Shockwave
Player movie by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking
(Macintosh) and selecting "Properties."
