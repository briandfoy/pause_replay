The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Depends
  DSLIP:       adpfg
  description: Use dependencies to control program flow
  userid:      DJERIUS (Diab Jerius)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm actually not sure where to put this. This module provides
    make-like dependency tracking (with some of the flavor of cons).
    Other than miscellaneous, the best place to put it is in 'Control
    Flow Utilities'.

    As for a namespace, since it's a more general dependency solution,
    it doesn't belong under Make. It does more than just files, so
    File::Depends won't work. The best I could come up with is plain
    Depends.

    I've put the documentation up at

    http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~dj/Depends.html

    Thanks, Diab
