Quoting Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk:
:DBA always reads as "Database Administrator" to me.
:DBF is the dBase file format in my mind.
:DBR doesn't ring any bells but it's also not a great acronym.
:
:Why not use names with DBM or Dbm in it? E.g., DBMa ("DBM Access") etc.

Icks! DBMa:: is really ugly ;-)

Besides, I read it as "DB Management".

What about:

	VDBM	Virtual Database Module

The framework I'm building bears some analogy with VFS, the Virtual FS
layer, by providing a common interface to access data to hide as much
as possible whether it's local or remote.
