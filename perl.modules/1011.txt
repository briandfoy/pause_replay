Socket::PassAccessRights

Implements passing access rights (i.e. file descritors) over Unix
domain sockets as decribed in

   Richard Stevens: Unix Network Programming, Prentice Hall, 1990; chap. 6.10. 

This module supports both BSD 4.3 and BSD 4.4 style interface. 

DSLI:        adcf
DESCRIPTION: File descriptor passing over Unix domain sockets
CPAN-UID:    SAMPO
CHAPTER:     5, IPC
HOMEPAGE:    http://www.bacus.pt/Net_SSLeay/modules.html

I already uploaded Socket-PassAccessRights-0.03.tar.gz to PAUSE.

I'd also like to know what happened to my registration of SMIMEUtil
module. I do not see it in my PAUSE interface. Does this mean it got
rejected? If that's due to namespace pollution, I think it could be
renamed to Crypto::SMIMEUtil (although it contains MIME functionality
unrelated to crypto, I think we already have better MIME functionality
available in Perl, so from the perl point of view the new contribution
is in signing and encrypting those MIME blobs). Let me know.
