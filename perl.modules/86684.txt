Request to register new user

     why:

    Using perl (and CPAN) for around 5 years. Currently working on a
    flexible deep nomenclature module (Object::KeyMorpher but will be
    renamed and split to be extensible, getting advice from PrePan). I
    am using this module in Net::DRI (I am a contributor) and feel it
    would be appropriate to be in CPAN so that it can be included
    properly in the project. I also think that it might be useful for
    other projects using eg XML, or with inherently inconsistent naming
    conventions.

    I am also a DNS admin and will be working on DNS project soon;
    depending on what I find / develop I may well look to upload or
    contribute to DNS:: modules.

    Thanks!
