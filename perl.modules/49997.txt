Subject: Module submission Test::UseAllModules

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::UseAllModules
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: do use_ok() for all modules MANIFESTed
  userid:      ISHIGAKI (Kenichi Ishigaki)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::More

  rationale:

    I'm sick of writing 00_load.t (or something like that) that'll do
    use_ok() for every module I write. I'm sicker of updating 00_load.t
    when I add another file to the distro. This module reads MANIFEST to
    find modules to be tested and does use_ok() for each of them. Now
    all you have to do is updating MANIFEST. You don't have to modify
    the test any more (hopefully).

  enteredon:   Tue Jul 25 17:21:03 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::UseAllModules   bdpfp do use_ok() for all modules MANIFESTed       ISHIGAKI
