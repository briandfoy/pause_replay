Hi,

I've got a scipt (HttpSniffer) and a module (provisionally called
ProfileStartup) that I'd like to make available to CPAN, so I'm requesting a
PAUSE registration.

Heres the registration info required...

Name:
         Tim Meadowcroft
Email:
         (work) Tim_Meadowcroft@westlb.co.uk
         (home) tim@compansr.demon.co.uk
Homepage:
          http://www.compansr.demon.co.uk/

Preferred UserId:
          TIM-M or TIMM

Description of what you're planning to contribute
          HttpSniffer.pl - script for tracing, timing and
                           debugging HTTP conversations
          ProfileStartup.pm - Profile loading and importing of modules
                           (to be renamed - Devel::ProfStartup ?? LoadProf ?)

Description in module list format
    ProfileStartup: bdpn - Profile loading and importing of modules
    - Has been alpha tested and revised with a couple of users (version 0.4)
    - All maintenance by myself
    - perl only
    - no interface (include on the command line "-mProfileStartup")

Description of script
 From the POD for HttpSniffer
   Program to listen in to HTTP conversations.
   This acts as an HTTP tunnel, forwarding all HTTP requests it receives to
   the specified realhost, logging the header details of the conversation in
   each direction and showing timing details of the operation.
   This program comes from my attempts to use cookies from ASP scripts,
   and my frustration at not being able to see what headers were really being
   sent in each direction.

Discussed where:
   HttpSniffer was announced on Perl-Win32-Web mailing list (tho it is quite
platform independant) and has been discussed there a few times (by me, I admit).
It's been up on my web site and listed on www.perl.com for about a year, and has
found at least 30 people who've mailed me about it, running it on Win32, Solaris
and MacPerl at least.
Currently at rev 2.11
   ProfileStartup was discussed on Perl-Win32-Users mailing list initially with
Jan Dubois and a lot with Lennart Borgman who tried the alpha. It's been through
several revisions privately b/n the two of us since then.

Both the script and the module are available in raw form on my web site (see
above), but before publishing I'll look at the CPAN requirements and read up on
clpm.

Thanks

Tim
