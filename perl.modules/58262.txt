Subject: Module submission DBD::Multi
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBD::Multi
  DSLIP:       SdpOp
  description: DB Proxy with failover and load balancing.
  userid:      DWRIGHT (Daniel J. Wright)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl.dbi.dev

  similar:
    DBD::Multiplex, DBIx::HA

  rationale:

    DBD::Multi is a proxy that seamlessly allows you to query from
    multiple data sources with load balancing and failover. It is
    differentiated from similar modules on CPAN by the lengths that it
    goes to provide a seamless connection to a functional data source in
    an environment where servers are likely to disappear and reappear
    without warning.

    I wrote this code with Casey West about 4 years ago. It has been
    published on CPAN for the past two years. I am now requesting that
    the namespace be registered.

    The module is used in production at multiple locations and has
    received several compliments on it's functionality. I consider the
    code to be in a stable state. Although the project has some feature
    requests and things I'd like to add in the future, there are no
    outstanding bugs in the code, and the most recent version has a 100%
    pass rate with the cpan testers.

The resulting entry would be:

DBD::
::Multi           SdpOp DB Proxy with failover and load balancing.   DWRIGHT
