Ok, I'll take that one.

I also have another very minor thing ... where the "ideology" is more
important than the module itself; actually the pod is a lot longer than
the code itself :)

CGI::
::ClientError	bdpf	send error messages to the browser

From the POD:

SYNOPSIS
(...)
        &check_if_user_is_stupid() 
	    && CGI::ClientError::error("You are stupid!");


DESCRIPTION
       Errors might appear in a CGI.  If the script knows what is
       wrong, it should tell what is wrong - but I think it's
       important to separate between when it should tell the
       client, and when it should tell the webmaster.  The
       user/client shouldn't be get error messages that are
       irrelevant or meaningless or even possibly exploitable -
       as "out of disk", "out of memory", "core dumped", etc.
       Instead, the script should die, the error should be
       logged, and perhaps even sent by mail to the webmaster -
       perhaps even to his cellphone.  The user should get an
       500 and a clear, friendly message that the problem is at
       the server side and probably will be dealt with ("try
       again later, or mail webmaster").

       Anyway, sometimes the client is to blame for the error.
       He has typed in a text string in a number box, he claims
       beeing born in 2019-14-14, he has been typing in a long
       URL with illegal parameters, etc. Then the client should
       get an informative error message.  That's what this small
       module is for.

       Three variables might be set by the caller program,
       header, footer and handler. The header and footer is what
       to output before and after the error message. The default
       header is:
         Content-Type: text/html
         <H1>Error</h1>
         Here is an error message for you:<br>
         <i>

       The default footer is:
         </i><br>
         If something is unclear, feel free to contact the
         webmaster.


       The default handler is ... do nothing.

       Somebody has probably written scientific papers about how
       to be respectful and pedagogic when telling a user that he
       has done an error.  I think it is wise to be humble, don't
       expect too much - remember, the average web user of today
       is not a typical unix user.  I don't know.  I don't care.
