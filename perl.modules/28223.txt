The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       NCustom
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Transactional file editting & pkg management
  userid:      BHARB (Bane Harbinger)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    CPAN BnP App::Manager RPM PPM

  rationale:

    NCustom ======= Custom: from customisation functionality (file
    editting, package management, ..).

    N: represents the uniqueness of this approach. Aside from providing
    customisation functions, NCustom provides a configuration file that
    contains preset configuration data for several possible SOHO
    set-ups. The possible set-ups are indexed by "N". "N" being the
    number of separate servers the SOHO is able to dedicate to network
    infrastructure.

    Then if customisation scripts use "N", they help people with only
    one firewall/gateway/webserver/dnsserver host, as well as those with
    more machines.

    The inspiration for preset configurations came from IPCOP and K12.

    *end*
