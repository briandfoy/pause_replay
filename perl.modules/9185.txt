Hi all!

I need advice about where to put my PSID.pm module (in which namespace).
Currently, the module can be found here in a somewhat raw form:

http://lala.c64.org

I've never uploaded anything to CPAN before, and I don't want to do something
stupid, so I thought I'd rather ask. :) I've read the docs about how to upload
stuff to CPAN, and my only remaining problem is about the namespace.

In short, PSID is a class that handles (reads/writes/manipulates) PlaySID
files (Commodore-64 music files), commonly known as SID files. One SID fan
suggested the HVSC::PSID namespace (HVSC meaning "High Voltage SID Collection"
and can be found here: http://www.hvsc.c64.org ), but I'm not a fan of that,
since PSID is a file format, while HVSC is a SID archive that happens to
archive SID tunes as PSID files. I was also thinking about File::PSID, after
all, PSIDs are nothing else but binary files formatted in a special way, but
I don't know if that would be the best. Or maybe just leave it as top-level
PSID (which is what it is right now)?...

Advice is needed.

Thanks,
