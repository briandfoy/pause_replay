The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Grouper
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Aggregates data into structure for templates
  userid:      FERRANCE (David Ferrance)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Data::Reporter

  rationale:

    This is a module to transform row data, typically from DBI, into
    the type of nested arrayref/hashref structures taken by many of the
    templating systems. This may not seem like much, but if you want to
    create nested loops more than 2 levels deep, it is much better not
    to have to write that code from scratch every time. In addition,
    grouper provides aggregate statistics, similar to SQL "group by",
    except at every level of nesting.

    The only similar module I could find was Data::Reporter. D::R has
    similar on-break functionality, but seems intended more for text
    output. Grouper just transforms the data, albeit into a format that
    is often directly useful to a template module. Grouper was designed
    for HTML::Template and has been in production for over a year.

    I chose Data::Grouper due to the similarity between Data::Reporter,
    and because it made the most sense. My approach is unique in that
    D::G operates only on data, making no assuptions about data source
    or destination, thus helping a wider audience. I feel that the
    module would be a useful addition to the module list based on
    feedback I have recieved from other people who have had to do the
    same thing.

The resulting entry would be:
