Although branded modules can be ok, there is a strong preference for 
neutral, functional and obvious names if possible. If someone wants to 
do what this does what would they go looking for?

Something like IP::Anonymous seems like the most obvious from here.

You could do you shoutout and link to the original project from your SEE 
ALSO section.

Or even in the abstract, something like...

IP::Anonymous - Perl port of Crypto-PAn to provide anonymous IP addresses
