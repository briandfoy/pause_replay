The trick is to find a name that lets the user know what it does. I
don't think Text::RST is going to do that in Perl land.
Text::Restructured would, however.

In my own google search, Restructred text had only one hit under "rst"
onthe first set of results, and only because the URL contained
"rst.html". In the actual content, I did not find a use of "RST". This
leads me to think that even Pythoners wouldn't know what the module was
for given the name Text::RST.

RST:: as a top-level namespace is even more ambigious.
