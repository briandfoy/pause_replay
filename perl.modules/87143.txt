Hello brian,

Thanks for your review. With the word "strict" I was trying to reflect the 
fact that your regular core functions (time, localtime, gmtime, sleep, etc) 
are changing their normal behavior everywhere, along with the added/extended 
ones (timelocal, timegm, etc) to strictly make use of full year and 
microseconds.

I did like the name "Strict", but If you think I should chose a different 
word, I guess it could be Time::Complete or Time::Extended. Does that sound 
better?

Thanks for your time.

Francisco

This seems to me like an odd use of the word "strict". Is there another
word or name that might more closely describe this module?
