The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Xmldoom
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Object persistance framework.
  userid:      DSNOPEK (David Snopek)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Mailing list, GNU Arch repository

  similar:
    Jifty::DBI Object::Mediator Oryx DBIx::Objects SLOOPS

  rationale:

    A root level namespace was choosen mostly to match the Python API,
    of which this code is originally a port. The name itself is an
    acronym for XML Database Object-Oriented Model.

    It is my opinion that it should have a top-level namespace for
    these reasons:

    * I intend to port this to as many programming languages as
    possible, and match the interfaces as closely as possible.
    Currently, it is available for Python, Javascript, and Perl.

    * There are 22 *.pm's in Xmldoom, some of them 4 levels deep. Using
    a root namespace is simply easier on the programmers typing muscles.

The resulting entry would be:

Xmldoom           bdpOg Object persistance framework.                DSNOPEK
