     why:

    To whom it may concern,

    A perl interface for Voicent Gateway, a VoiceXML gateway for any PC
    with a voice modem. The interface contains functions to call any
    phone number and play a voice message. If the message is specified
    in text, it is converted to speech using text-to-speech engine.
    There is a free version of the gateway available for download.

    Source code and some document are available on
    http://www.voicent.com/devnet/docs/perlapi.htm. Would like to
    include the module under CPAN commercial interface category.

    Thank you very much support@voicent.com
