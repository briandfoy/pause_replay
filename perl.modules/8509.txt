The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Zompist::Cuezi
  DSLIP:       idpfb
  description: Inflect Cuezi nouns, verbs, and adjectives
  userid:      PNE (Philip Newton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lingua::Zompist::Cadhinor Lingua::Zompist::Verdurian

  rationale:

    See my submission for Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni (
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-08/msg00446.html
    ) for more details.

    Basically, a module to inflect nouns, verbs, and adjectives in the
    Cue^zi language, a fictional language created by Mark Rosenfelder.

    I've already got most of the code in a script and am planning on
    turning it into a stand-alone module as I have already done with
    L::Z::Verdurian and L::Z::Cadhinor.

    I'm proposing putting it into the same Lingua::Zompist namespace
    with the others since it's a "natural" language (well, at least as
    opposed to a programming language; at least as natural as Esperanto
    or Lojban) and comes from www.zompist.com (the "Zompist" bit was
    also suggested by Mark Rosenfelder, the inventor of the languages).

    Comments on the namespace are welcome, if you don't like
    Lingua::Zompist for some reason

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::Zompist::
::Cuezi           idpfb Inflect Cuezi nouns, verbs, and adjectives   PNE
