True, I have not uploaded any viable implementation yet, but
the module is indeed under active development. Its sister
module Net::SAML has been updated and I expect to move some
of the functionality from Net::SAML to Net::WSF once I figure
out an easy way to do this under SWIG. 

I do want to continue to reserve this namespace.
