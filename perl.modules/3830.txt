Oh my, if you have no idea what cfengine is, how much will the name
tell you?

Enough for what? To have a well founded standing in the perl
community, GPL is a bit short of the expectations. Most perl modules
on CPAN are optionally (for the user) under GPL *or* Artistic license.
CPAN currently has no restrictions to enforce that, but that's mostly
because 99% fit anyway.
