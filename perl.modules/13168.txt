Plans: DBIx::Abstract::Connection, a module to allow
general/abstract connection using DBI. Currently DBIx::Abstract
supports a specific way of connecting to DBI using DBD::mysql,
and other drivers can be used by passing in the DSN. The advantages
of my module include: 1) extensibility: easier to add support for
drivers, 2) modularity: factors out connection in case you don't
require full DBIx::Abstract functionality, 3) abstraction: ideally
you never need to use a driver-specific DSN, 4) emulation: I'm
trying to emulate useful features in case a driver/database doesn't
support it; for example, MySQL supports using ~/.my.cnf client
configuration PostgreSQL doesn't, so I would allow the user to
have such a configuration file for PostgreSQL, too. That way
you have an abstract way to centralize your client connection
parameters regardless of the database.
