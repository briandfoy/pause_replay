DSLI Description: 
Mail::Ezmlm   cdlO  Object methods for ezmlm mailing lists

I use the ezmlm mailing list manger (http://www.ezmlm.org) for Qmail, and
have written a perl based web administration interface to it. During the
writing of this interface, I discovered that I was doing the same sort of
thing over and over again, and thus decided that it might be a good idea to
develop a module that handles the basic mailing list administrative
functionality (list creation, subscription, unsubscription, etc).

A while back I discussed this matter on the ezmlm mailing list
(ezmlm@list.cr.yp.to), and there appeared to be a fair ammount of interest.
It appeared that there were quite a few people writing perl scripts for
ezmlm and all thought the idea of having the interface to the mailing list
provided by a module was a good one.

I am not sure about the Mail:: part, and would appreciate suggestions if
people can think of a better place to put it. At the moment that seems like
the best fit though ...
