Technically, no one has to approve any name.  However, it is normally a
Very Good Thing to talk to this list and to anyone with competing or
relating names.  Of course, that won't necessarily solve all problems; I
remember when I asked this list (before I was a member) about a name, and
later found out that earlier the same day someone suggested the exact same
name for his module, and no one picked up on it until months later.  :-)

Anyway, I don't know anything about RIPE and don't know if collaboration
with Dana is warranted or necessary.  There's no official protocol for it;
we trust that you all can work it out.
