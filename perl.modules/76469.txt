Mr. Foy,

Thank you for your reply.

I definitely wanted feedback from the list due to the naming guidelines.
However, I thought ::Lite might actually be applicable in this case. As I
mentioned earlier, my module keeps itself dependent on core Perl and offers
a more common set of geo coordinate functions. I thought this would possibly
be beneficial to others and I (unfortunately) am not aware of how I could
have done this to Geo::Calc directly due to its Moose dependency.

Please note that I am not trying to devalue Geo::Calc in any way, and that I
am open to other suggestions if you think that would be implied by using
::Lite in the module name.

However, if it is your opinion that the module's concept is simply not that
beneficial to CPAN and too redundant, I understand that and do not have a
problem withholding it.

Thanks again for your reply.

Rick Yakubowski
