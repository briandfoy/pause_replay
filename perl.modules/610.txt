Description:
File::Binary - A file for reading (and later writing) bits, signed bits and
bytes from a file in an object orientated way.

DLSI: cdpO - OO reading of bits and bytes from a file




I bought this up on CLPM but nobody (apart from a friend of mine) responded ...
I'm assuming (optimistically) that that was because nobody thought that it was
bad enough to warrant flaming me. Talked about it with a few of friends from a
couple of .pm groups (London and Bath). Original code had some code adapted from
some by Michal Wallace (http://www.sabren.com) and SWFparse
(http://homepages.tig.com.au/~dkl/swf/) but has been changed quite a lot by now.

Was written to be used by some Macromedia Flash/SWF manipulation modules I'm
writing.
