I have no idea what the proper procedure for this is.. but people 
recommended mailing the modules list.

The module Digest::SHA256 has various bugs and has been unmaintained for 
two years.  There is also some license dubiosity (README claims "same 
terms as Perl", other files claim LGPL).  It also doesn't adhere to the 
programming interface of a Digest:: module.

The author's email address bounces.

I've written a replacement for it, and I'm wondering if I should simply 
upload it or if there's some "adoption" procedure to be followed.  It's 
fully functional and tested on various systems.  It is backwards compatible 
with the current Digest::SHA256.

The almost-done version (docs aren't finished yet) is at:
 http://www.liacs.nl/~mavduin/Digest-SHA256-0.99_01.tar.gz

So, what should I do?
