This puzzles me, as when I approached Bernard, asking if he'd be
willing to let me take it over (as it was unmaintained for a couple of
years and had some important bugs reported in RT with no response for a
couple of years) his response was "Yes, I'm the author of this
module. We may consider transferring it to your responsibility. How do
you want to proceed?" - to me that was an agreement to hand over
mmaintainership.

That said - I'm perfectly happy to just act as a co-maintainer, and
will contact Berhard off-list to discuss that (in particular, which
repository should be considered the "official" one, as I could find no
public repository and thus started a new one on GitHub with the code as
it was at the point I thought I was taking it over).

I'd just like to make it clear that this was a mis-understanding, and
not an attempt to subvert control of someone else's module.

Cheers

Dave P
