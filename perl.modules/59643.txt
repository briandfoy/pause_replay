My advice is to worry about the registrations later, once everything
has settled. That way you save yourself the hassle of registering every
idea you have, and you create less work for us. Names are very
important, so don't rush to register them. This isn't the domain name
market with all sorts of squatters. :)

Realize that you don't have to register every namespace you use.
Register the main namespace in a distribution and don't worry about the
rest of the ones in there.

As far as re-registering, just submit a new registration, and go to the
old modules in PAUSE and set their lifecycle to "Can be deleted". :)
