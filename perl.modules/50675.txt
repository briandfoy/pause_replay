Hi,

I would like to assume maintenace of Devel::Timer.

Jay Hannah (CC-ed) has already raised this issue on
http://www.mail-archive.com/module-authors@perl.org/msg04318.html
Based on that it seems that Jason Moore, the original author cannot be
contacted.

I talked to Jay and we agreed that either one of us can ask for
maintainership of this module and we will help each other.

My PAUSEID:   SZABGAB

regards
   Gabor
