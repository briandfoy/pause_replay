The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Wiki::Store::Mediawiki
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Mediawiki Store for CGI::Wiki
  userid:      DPRICE (Derek Price)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Wiki::Store::*

  rationale:

    I had a perl front end for much of my web site, but was using a PHP
    Mediawiki wiki because I didn't really like any of the Perl Wiki's I
    came across. Unfortunately, this proved hard to maintain and the
    Mediawiki PHP scripts were exteremely slow on my web site. I started
    looking into converting my Mediawiki based wiki database into some
    format supported by some Perl wiki, but stumbled across CGI::Wiki
    and decided to write a CGI::Wiki::Store module capable of reading
    and writing to the Mediawiki database.

    The basic idea is that a CGI::Wiki wiki and the PHP Mediawiki could
    be accessing the database at the same time and would interoperate
    flawlessly.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Wiki::Store::
::Mediawiki       adpOp Mediawiki Store for CGI::Wiki                DPRICE
