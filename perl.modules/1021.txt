Dear module list maintainers:

I'd like to request a user-id for CPAN. Here's the requested information:

name: Andrew D. Allen
email: andrew_d_allen@hotmail.com
homepage: http://geocities.com/andrew_d_allen
preferred user-id: ALLEN
planning to contribute:

String::DiffLine   bdcf  line # & position of first diff

A short description has been posted to clpm, and the full module is 
available at http://geocities.com/andrew_d_allen/perl/DiffLine-0.01.tar.gz . 
I've also contributed Tk::TiedListbox that is part of the Tk-Contrib bundle 
on CPAN.

Thank you,

Andrew
