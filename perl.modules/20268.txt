And my module can be used for both.  (In fact, it might have some
problems if several encodings are mixed.  I'd better investigate...)

BTW, originally I called it Convert::Transliterate, but then I
discovered that name was already used. :-)

If it becomes Lingua::Transcribe, shouldn't your package then be
renamed to Lingua::Transcribe::FI for consistency's sake?

But my main reason for choosing the Convert namespace was the
existence of Convert::Translit.  Besides, one could envisage some
people using it for doing something entirely unrelated to natural
languages (in the Perl world, one never knows...).
