The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Data::Plasmid::Vector
  DSLIP:       bdpfa
  description: Provides access to plasmid vector data
  userid:      SLENK (Stephen G. Lenk)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    A plasmid used as a vector to accept and introduce DNA into a cell
    via transfection has its own characteristics (data). I use this data
    in Bio::MCPrimers to design PCR primer pairs for molecular cloning.
    MCPrimers is a generic solver. By isolating data access, a potential
    user can adapt their own favorite plasmid for use by MCPrimers
    without changing MCPrimers at all. It is also possile that other
    software that might want access to plasmid data could reuse these
    modules (so no need to put it under Bio::MCPrimers::whatever)
    Bio::Data:: was suggested by Kennedy yesterday (thank you)- I
    suggest using Bio::Data::Plasmid::Vector as not all plasmids are
    vectors (as per Dan Clemans at EMU) hence a subclassing. Basic
    interface will be: plasmid_vector (vector_name,
    reference_to_hash_of_data)

  enteredby:   SLENK (Stephen G. Lenk)
  enteredon:   Mon May 22 19:27:10 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::Data::Plasmid::
::Vector          bdpfa Provides access to plasmid vector data       SLENK
