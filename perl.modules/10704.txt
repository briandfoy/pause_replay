The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Authen::SessionID
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Managing SessionIDs for webuser sessions
  userid:      DOMINICN (Dominic Neumann)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module "SessionID.pm" or "Authen::SessionID" is a nice module
    for all programmers who want to develope user areas where the user
    has to login and then has the chance to do anything specific. there
    are many solutions available for the problem of authenticating a
    user. Many services use cookies or http-authentication which both
    are features of specific browsers respectively the options the user
    set in his browser. The SessionID module takes another, not
    browser-related way: by logging in the user gets a unique sessionid
    which does not contain his username neither his password. the
    sessionid module creates an entry in a small database which contains
    the username, the sessionid, the current time and the minutes after
    which the user has to be logged out if his is inactive. every script
    that is within the logged-in-area can extract the username off the
    sessionid by using a function of the SessionID module. The database
    entry is deleted if the user logs out.

  enteredby:   DOMINICN (Dominic Neumann)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 19 12:35:01 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Authen::
::SessionID       RdpOp Managing SessionIDs for webuser sessions     DOMINICN
