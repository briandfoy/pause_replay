James,

Thank you for filling in the missing pieces and providing an obituary
link.  I've transitioned JAITKEN to PAUSE custodial status and transferred
his modules to the ADOPTME account.

PAUSE maintainers will transfer ownership of those modules to anyone who
volunteers to take over.

Regards,
David
