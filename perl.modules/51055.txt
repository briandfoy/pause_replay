The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Generate
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: generate high customizable synthetic data
  userid:      DACONTI (Davide Conti)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module generates various types of synthetic data by parsing
    user intructions. These instructions have to respect precise syntax
    rules which can be considered as a kind of mini "data generation
    language" .

    This language has been designed to be a flexible and powerful way
    to control the production of synthetic data. In addition, to be most
    comfortable for users, syntax rules depend on the assigned datatype.

    So far as known, is this approach quite unique. To have some
    quality, I made a big effort to control the cardinality of data
    produced, and to give a good error handling when user statements are
    contradictory.

    I chose the namespace Data::Generate because it describes at best
    the main functional aspect of the module.

  enteredby:   DACONTI (Davide Conti)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep 26 20:32:51 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Generate        bdpOp generate high customizable synthetic data    DACONTI
