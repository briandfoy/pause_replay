The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CDS::KFF
  DSLIP:       adpOd
  description: Supports creation of KFF files.
  userid:      EZARKO (Eric A. Zarko)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Currently customers of CDS Global may use an Excel spreadsheet
    which is capable of exporting a fixed comma-separated-values format
    file which they then upload via secure-ftp. Customers who do not
    wish to use this spreadsheet must write their own software from
    scratch based on this spreadsheet.

    This module will provide an OO interface that can be used to create
    (and edit?) these files while enforcing the same validation rules
    and caveats that are currently in place in the Excel spreadsheet. As
    it is proprietary to the business of CDS and only really of use to
    our customers I think that the top-level CDS namespace is
    appropriate.

    Example code for automating the secure-ftp upload using other
    freely available CPAN modules will be included in the documentation,
    but these modules will not be prerequisites. At most one of the CSV
    modules will be.

The resulting entry would be:

CDS::
::KFF             adpOd Supports creation of KFF files.              EZARKO
