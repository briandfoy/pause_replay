The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Runner::Init
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Several modules to run bash commands
  userid:      JILLROWE (Jillian Rowe)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jerowe/module-runner-init

  similar:
    IPC::Run, IPC::Open3

  rationale:

    This is a bundle of 3 modules that allow for running arbitrary bash
    commands with logging of STDOUT/STDERR.

    I found myself writing the same sort of scripts over and over
    again. I wanted to be able to run 'embarrassingly parallel' jobs
    using either threads or processes with comprehensive logging, and
    when my work moved over to the SLURM queue I wanted to be able to
    run arbitrary bash commands with some job flow, mainly, wait until
    all jobs are finished or pass to a newnode.

    The Runner::Slurm module is dependent on Runner::MCE or
    Runner::Threads and Runner::Init, but Runner::MCE/Threads is not
    dependent on Runner::Slurm.

The resulting entry would be:

Runner::
