description of my bundle:

I am writing a perl bundle which parses and archives tropical storm
advisories (for an example see any file at
ftp://metlab1.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/WTNT3/).  

The parser and advisory entities are not unlike the parser and entity
objects of the MIME::Tools bundle.  The Data and Main objects take care of
storing each advisory for a given storm and keeping track of every storm
respectively.


description in module list format:

Geo::Storm_Tracker  Bundle which stores and retrieves information from
tropical storm advisories.
::Main	bnpO Master object. Tracks all Data objects.
::Data	bnpO Storm object containing advisories.
::Advisory	bnpO Weather Advisory object.
::Parser	bnpO Dissects a plain text advisory.


discussion:

I was unable to find anything on CPAN which currently deals with these
advisories.  The closest modules seem to be Geo::METAR and Geo::WeatherNOAA.
This leads me to believe that my modules should be Geo::Storm_Tracker::bla
(where bla=Main, Data, Parser, and Advisory) and be the Storm-Tracker
bundle.  The data structures avoid the need for a real database by being
insert and query only.  This should provide a larger user base.  I have been
very careful to keep each instance of an object from interfering with others
of the same type.

Dr. Paul Ruscher at the meteorology department of Florida University has
been extremely helpful in enabling me to decipher the naming conventions
being used by NOAA.  Furthermore Dr. Ruscher's group will need a similar
functionality in the near future, and has offered to take over future
development and maintenance of my work once released.  There is likely a
strong support for a bundle like mine within the meteorological circles,
although I don't really know since I am not in those circles.  Dr. Ruscher
sure seems more excited than I expected.  His contact information is:
Dr. Paul Ruscher
Dept. of Meteorology B161

Tallahassee, FL 32306-3034
Telephone: (904) 644-2752
FAX:       (904) 644-9642
Internet: ruscher@met.fsu.edu

I have built the modules using h2xs and mucked with the file structure and
Makefile.PL until it works similar to that of the MIME::Tools distribution.
Everything should install in the usual way
(prompt>perl Makefile.PL;make;make test;make) and is fully documented in pod
format.

Thank you for your time and consideration in reviewing my request for
registration with and submission to CPAN.
