   This module may not be used for the purposes of sending
   unsolicited email (ie. spamming) in any way, shape or form
   or for the purposes of generating lists for commercial
   sale without explicit permission from the author.

   For everyone else this module is free software; you may
   redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as
   Perl itself.

I'm not sure it's enforceable, but IANAL. It's almost like you are
trying to attach the license to the email addresses themselves -- or, in
the more general sense, trying to license the data your program
produces. Similar to the "viral" argument with the GPL.

At any rate, you'd have to prove that someone got the email addresses
using your program and not from some other source. And what if, for
example, I just use your program to harvest emails and turn around and
sell the lists to spammers? *I* wouldn't be spamming, someone else
downstream would be.

Food for thought -- I don't have a tidy solution, unfortunately.
