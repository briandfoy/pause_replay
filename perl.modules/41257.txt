The idea of a Media namespace seems like a good one to me.

It would make sense to have a namespace to collect together non-specific 
media-related packages.

Use of a top level namespace is generally done when you are dealing with 
the specifics. For example, MP3::Recoder (to invent a module). It deals 
specifically with, and only with, MP3s and thus the use of a 
format/protocol specific namespace is not unjustified.

But in your case I think you are right, and a Media:: namespace for more 
generic things like "podcasting" would be a good idea.

In short, I like it.
