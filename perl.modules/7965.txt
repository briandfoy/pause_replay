Dear Sirs,

My name is Joseph F. Ryan.  I would like to have an account on CPAN so =
that I would can publish my two modules, CGI::BuildForm and =
Tie::HashTree (proposed names).  You can view them at =
http://jryan.perlmonk.org/ .

My information:
Name: Joseph F. Ryan
Email: ryan.311@osu.edu
Homepage: http://jryan.perlmonk.org
Preferred ID: jryan
Short Description(s):

CGI::BuildForm is an OO interface to building HTML forms, but also =
allows the user to rebuild forms (built with or without the module) with =
the attributes they had before the transmission (form elements that were =
built without the module default to the "hidden" element type).  For a =
full description, read the pod at http://jryan.perlmonk.org/BuildForm.pm

Tie::HashTree allows the user to create a "tree" data type out of a new =
or existing hash.  Methods are provided to allow for crawling through =
the tree, and a method to dump the tree for use in debugging is provided =
as well.  For a full description, read the pod at =
http://jryan.perlmonk.org/HashTree.pm

Finally, I am currently working on a file sharing server that I would =
like to put in the scripts section of CPAN.  It is still in the =
debugging phase, so it has not been posted to my website (the reason: =
who wants buggy code?).  However, if you would like to see the code, I =
would be happy to provide it.

Sincerely,

Joseph F. Ryan
