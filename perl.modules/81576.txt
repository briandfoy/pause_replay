Thanks for the tip. I apologise if my language sounded aggressive (or abusive)
- I am not a native English speaker. Add to that, that I've been frustrated
with trying to mirror a MediaWiki page (and failing) and so recalling this
module, and you'll see why I may have sounded harsh.

Anyway, that was not my intenion, so I apologise again.

Regards,

P.S: for people who were not sure what a bit bucket is, see:
