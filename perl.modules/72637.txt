The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Video::CPL
  DSLIP:       adpho
  description: Create interactive video
  userid:      CSR (Carl Rosenberg)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namechoice was the subject of a preliminary registration at the end
    of July. Video::CPL was chosen based on comments of the reviewer.

    The choices were CPL, since it supports the Coincident Programming
    Language, or Video::CPL. Video::CPL avoids rootlevel namespace, and
    gives code maintainers some idea of what the function is.

    Video::CPL provides a way for Perl users to add video experiences
    to their webpages with a few lines of Perl code. It can be used as a
    dirt-simple video player, or to create complex linked and annotated
    videos on a users web page.

    Video::FFmpeg is a lower-level utility that many Video::CPL users
    are expected to use. Hence the suggested category of
    Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps where Video::FFmpeg resides.

The resulting entry would be:

Video::
::CPL             adpho Create interactive video                     CSR
