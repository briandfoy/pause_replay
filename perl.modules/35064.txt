Subject: Module submission Date::Namedays::Simple
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Namedays::Simple
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Very lightweight data/nameday mapping
  userid:      FAGZAL (Csongor Fagyal)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    CPAN

  similar:
    Date::Event::Nameday

  rationale:

    Talked about this module to the author of Date::Event::Nameday,
    which does something similar. I find his module is too complex for
    the most often used basic functionality - that is, to get the names
    (namedays) for a given date. Also, his module cannot handle multiple
    names for a day, which is a big problem for example in Hungary,
    where more names are associated to one day. Leap years behave
    interestingly in Hungary when it comes to namedays, too.

    Date::Namedays::Simple is an abstract class for handling namedays.
    The first package will also contain
    Date::Namedays::Simple::Hungarian. (Probably Date::Event::Nameday
    will use this module later, too.) I hope I can find local
    maintainers for different countries - I will only write and
    regularly update the base class and the Hungarian extension.

    I think this module belongs to just under Date::, rather than
    Date::Event. This package will (mostly) be used by portals/portal
    engines/websites to simply get the namedays for the actual day.
    However, it might rather belong to chapter 13 (Internationalization
    and Locale).

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Namedays::
