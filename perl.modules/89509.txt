Perhaps we're using the term "indexing" in a different sense.

If you visit: http://www.cpan.org/scripts/  then you'll see a number of scr=
ipt names like: 3Boxes.pl=2C  BIPserver_2.06.pl=2C etc. And you can click o=
n any of these and get the entire script displayed for subsequent download.

These script-name entries are automatically created (with links to actual s=
cript locations) during the PAUSE upload process.

And this has all worked well for years.  But if you click on  BIPclient_2.1=
0.pl you'll get a "Not Found" response .. because the actual script has bee=
n deleted (via PAUSE) and an updated version (BIBclient_2.11.pl) has been u=
ploaded (via PAUSE).

In a like vein=2C the DtDNS_1.03.pl script in my author directory was uploa=
ded via PAUSE=2C but doesn't appear at: http://www.cpan.org/scripts/=20

PAUSE has a "re-index" option to rectify such issues=2C but that hasn't wor=
ked for me.

I hope this all makes sense ..
