Quoting modules@perl.org:
: Dear CPAN contributor,
: 
: we, the PAUSE administrators, are trying to tidy up the CPAN Modules
: List and are looking at namespaces that have been registered without
: ever being uploaded to PAUSE.
: 
: You have registered the namespace
: 
: CGI::MxWidget
: 
: in the CPAN Modules List, but according to our databases, you have not
: uploaded any module with that name. This may be an error on our part,
: a problem with the PAUSE indexer, or you actually haven't uploaded an
: implementation.
: 
: In any case, we kindly ask you to contact us via the modules@perl.org
: mailing list so we can sort out the issue. This is particularly
: important if you think you are receiving this mail in error!

I've stopped developping in Perl, sadly, so I won't be needing this namespace.
This is also true with the other namespaces I had reserved and for which
I did not contribute anything.

Cheers,
Raphael
