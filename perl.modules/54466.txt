  > Hi,
  > Is there any documentation on how CPAN indexes an uploaded distribution?

The most important missing bit of documentation is this: there is a
PAUSE/CPAN indexer which produces the files (on CPAN)

  authors/00whois.html
  authors/00whois.xml
  authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
  modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
  modules/03modlist.data.gz

These are the ones CPAN{,PLUS}.pm are using to make their download
decisions.

And there is search.cpan.org which has its own indexer which has to
satisfy other demands. The latter is based on the former but it is
being changed more often because of the specific needs search.cpan.org
has.

The PAUSE/CPAN indexer is maintained here, at modules@perl.org. The
search.cpan.org index is maintained over there, at
http://search.cpan.org/feedback

Your questions all seem to be related to search.cpan.org, so we cannot
answer them. Please visit the feedback page above.

Thanks for bringing this up, I'm going to document this now in
modules/04pause.html

Regards,
