We're working on a project that is basically a preprocessor for
embperl pages (*), which can be divided into three parts (at least):

- the preprocessor itself
- the libraries used by the preprocessor
- the database structure abstraction layer

the database structure abstraction layer is _possibly_ useful as a
separate entity, while the libraries are very application-specific.

The natural thing to do it seems would be to leave it as we have it in
CVS, with the database structure abstraction layer as one package and
the preprocessor and associated libraries as another, with the latter
depending on the former. Unfortunately this leaves the preprocessor
and its libraries off in the scripts category, which (it seems) isn't
the best thing if you want lots of eyes on it.

Any suggestions?
