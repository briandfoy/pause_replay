Hi Neil,
Thanks for the excellent info, I do appreciate it!  :-)

I'm the new maintainer for the Apache::FileManager and
Apache2::FileManager distributions.
When viewing the PAUSE permissions for A::FM, I see 2 entries, myself
(WBRASWELL) and user PMC.  I am listed as the "first come" and PMC is
listed as "co-maint"; I am listed as "owner" for both entries.
On the A2::FM permissions, I also see 2 entries, myself and user
DAVVID.  I am listed as the "first come" while DAVVID is "modulelist".
 Unlike A::FM, I am listed as "owner" for only 1 entry, while DAVVID
is listed as "owner" for his A2::FM permission entry.
Can you please explain why DAVVID is listed as modulelist instead
co-maint?
And also, why am I listed as owner on both A::FM permission entries,
but only on 1 of the A2::FM entries?
If you look in 06perms.txt (the export from PAUSE which says what the
permissions are), youâ€™ll see that the entries for A2::FM are:
Apache2::FileManager,DAVVID,cApache2::FileManager,WBRASWELL,f
PAUSE showing DAVVID as modulelist is left-over from before we removed
the module-list permissions. You are the effective owner, as only
first-come and co-maint are considered now.
Once someone with PAUSE internals knowledge has the tuits, these parts
of the PAUSE UI will be updated to remove all the module-list perms
stuff.
Cheers,Neil
