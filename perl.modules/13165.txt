The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::Huffman
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: symbol table and de/encode text via huffman
  userid:      BIGJ (Janek Schleicher)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    What the module does should be clearly clear from the name of it,
    allthough I had been very suprised that there wasn't any module
    implementing it on CPAN. (Didn't I search right ?!)

    I also believe, that Algorithm::Huffman is the right namespace for
    it. I wouldn't like to put it under Compress::* as the algorithm
    could be used for compressing, but a similar result could also be
    achieved with Shannon-Fano-Algorithm (or ZIP or
    run-length-compressing or ...). Also the creation of a symbol code
    table isn't important (looked from the point of the user) for a
    compression tool, but it's a very important part of the Huffman
    algorithm.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::Huffman         idpOp symbol table and de/encode text via huffman  BIGJ
