Anything I didn't start and just comaint, anything small or which hasn't
had a release in 2 years, should be fine.

Anything big and/or important (Orlite, Aspect, etc) I'd like to keep an eye
on things during handover.

If you cc me when you do the hand off either way, I'll just respond if I
have objections. In they latter car advice ahead of time is appreciated but
not required. I don't want to hold up good works tooo much.

And if you could do the github conversions from svn so I stay in the commit
history, it would be appreciated.
