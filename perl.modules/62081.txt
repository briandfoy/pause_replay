Hi, all.  I recently heard of some interest in my Pod::DocBook module,
and was finally able to contact Alligator Descartes, who gave me
permission to take the namespace.  How do I go about removing the
"UNOFFICIAL RELEASE" brand so that I may continue development?

Thanks,
Nandu

Go wild! The original Pod::DocBook module existed purely to give
myself and Tim Bunce the ability to dump SGML that could be formatted
by O'Reilly's camera-ready software. If you can/have done a better job
of it, that's great!
Please feel free to pass this onto whoever you need to to get the
module ownership in CPAN assigned to yourself to continue development.
