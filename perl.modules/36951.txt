The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Teamspeak
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: OO Interface to the Voice-Server Teamspeak
  userid:      MALETIN (Martin von Oertzen)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://forum.goteamspeak.com/forumdisplay.php?f=51

  similar:

  rationale:

    Maybe this Interface can be put below Speech:: or Voice::. But the
    Interface is about administrate the Server (get the status,
    registrated users etc.). other Interfaces seems to have also their
    own Namespace and I think it's unlikly, that Teamspeak will collide
    to another module.

  enteredby:   MALETIN (Martin von Oertzen)
  enteredon:   Thu Dec  9 01:52:15 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Teamspeak         cdpOp OO Interface to the Voice-Server Teamspeak   MALETIN
