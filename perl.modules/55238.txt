I've submitted a patch to the parrot folks for this, but I'll explain
it here too in case anyone else comes along with the same problem.
(And, as I finished typing this, Bernhard tells me it's applied in
r19621).

The Parrot::Configure::Data module wants to create a method that uses
Data::Dumper to pretty-print some data. If Data::Dumper has Sortkeys(),
they want to use that, and not use it otherwise.

In the current code, they use a kludge to look at the version number
and later use the version number to decide what to do. This is broken
in many ways:

   * It failed on my box because I used a Perl that had a development
   version of Data::Dumper (so it has an _ in it), even though my DD
   has Sortkeys

   * A greater version number does not say anything about the interface.

   * On a grander scale, it breaks polymorphism. So what if it isn't DD
   as long as it acts like it is? Mock objects would have to futz with
   $Data::Dumper::VERSION too.

Now, there are a couple of ways to fix this so PAUSE and Makemaker
don't confuse themselves.

   * Don't access global variables! Use the method call syntax
   (Module->VERSION) if you can!

   * Don't use the version number at all. Check for the particular
   feature you want directly. In this case, I patched it by calling
   can() to check for the method I wanted:

      if( defined eval { Data::Dumper->can( 'Sortkeys' ) } )

This doesn't fix the situation in PAUSE though. When the next distro is
uploaded, everything should be fine and the indexer will be happy. It's
probably not worth it to fix the current distro by uploading under a
different name and repairing the pending upload because most people
probably work right out of the SVN sandbox.
