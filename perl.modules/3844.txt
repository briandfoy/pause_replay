From: starfire@zipcon.net ("Richard Anderson")

I am preparing a module for CPAN release.  There is a subdirectory tree
that should be copied recursively to /usr/local/etc when "make install"
is typed.  I assume that I should write a perl script that does the
copy, but I don't see anything in the ExtUtils::MakeMaker man page that
lets me indicate that this script should be run during "make install".
The PL_FILES attribute looks promising, but I don't think this does
what I need.

How can I do this?
