     why:

    I have several modules previosly developed for my own ussage that I
    would like to share, as some people might find them usefull.

    - An DB abstraction module, well soft off, more like SQL generator
    that also enables you to query the DB in as few lines as possible.

    - Web framework following the similar path as CGI::Application
