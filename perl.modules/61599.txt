The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mobile::Ads
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Interface to various mobile Ads sites
  userid:      TCHATZI (Thanos Chatziathanassiou)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Mobile Ads are helpful revenue generators for mobile
    (wap/XHTML-MP/CHTML) sites. Unfortunately, no standard interface to
    all those exists and no advertiser has such a dominant position that
    makes others irrelevant. Currently implemented: Admob
    (Mobile::Ads::AdMob_v1 & Mobile::Ads::AdMob_v2) Zestadz
    (Mobile::Ads::Zestadz) Decktrade (Mobile::Ads::Decktrade) MoJiva
    (Mobile::Ads::MoJiva) AdModa (Mobile::Ads::AdModa) AdultModa
    (Mobile::Ads::AdultModa) Buzzcity (Mobile::Ads::Buzzcity) Google
    AdSense for Mobile (Mobile::Ads::AdSense) Ads.gr
    (Mobile::Ads::Adsgr) GetMobile (Mobile::Ads::GetMobile)

    Most of these advertising agencies do not provide perl
    implementation code, and some do not even allow third party
    developed code to interoperate with them. I have already gone
    through this procedure and would like to spare others the trouble.
    Plus, I could really use some community guidance for this.

    PS. I see that you want this under chapter 15
    (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI), but it might (also) belong to
    chapter 24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
