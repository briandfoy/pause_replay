I'm planning to contribute an HTTP/1.1 Proxy which internally uses
select non-blocking socket.

These are the feature list:
- Proper persistent connection implementation for HTTP/1.1 clients.
- Uses only one process (low memory requirement).
- Capable of serving many clients in a time.
- Proxy authentication capability.
- IP/URI based client access list.
- IP/URI based server access list.
- Message's body can be search-and-replace/substitute (ex: strips all 4 letters word)
- "Fast passing", passes message to destination with little buffering.
- Decode chunked body for HTTP/1.0 clients.
- Properly handles error in TCP connection, and HTTP protocol syntax.
- Non-caching
- Capable of using intermediary Proxy.

These are the bugs:
- Memory leak when downloading large files (probably perl's fault).
- Blocking when connection to server (haven't been able to unblock connection establishment to server)

This Proxy has been tested for about 1 week, but hasn't been tested by
people other than myself. I hope people can download this from CPAN
and test this Proxy.
