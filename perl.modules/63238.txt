I've made one mistake few days ago, when I tried to discuss with Marc why
he realized some things this way and not that way. For example, he doesn't
check for errors in many places where I think error checking is must have.
Example: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=40906

His reaction was surprisingly aggressive, and he finally banned my email. :-/
It isn't clear for me why he react this way, but I've checked few threads
in mail lists, when other people try to debate something about his code,
and looks like his reaction was always more or less inadequate. He is smart
and wrote very good code, but looks like he doesn't ready to discuss his code.

Anyway, only way for me to ask him - send him email from another address,
which I consider abuse because he make it very clear what he doesn't wanna
receive emails from me.

I think there few ways to solve this situation:
- you can ask Marc yourself
- you can recommend another name for my modules (it doesn't really
  important for me to call them exactly this way or use EV:: name space -
  personally I prefer IO:: name space but not sure they fit there better
  than in EV:: name space)
- just register name space (quick review of Marc modules should give you
  idea it's unlikely Marc will want EV::Stream name space ever)
