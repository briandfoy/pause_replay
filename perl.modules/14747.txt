No need to panic. I remember the times when it was actually hard to
register namespace for the reasons you mentioned. But in my impression
things have brightened up very much in the last weeks thanks to brian d
foy who's doing a very accurate job. I am sure he'll see your mail and
pick up this issue immediately (or one of the other PAUSE admins).

As for refusal of name space registrations, this never happens quietly.
Usually unfortunate name space choices are sorted out in rather nice
discussions with suggestions made by the admins. I guess your mails just
slipped by unnoticed. Remember that registration is not an automatic
process. This is still done manually (I think).
