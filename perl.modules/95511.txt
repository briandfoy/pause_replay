Request to register new user

fullname: Sean O'Leary
  userid: OLEARY
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: https://github.com/soleary
     why:

    I've been a Perl programmer for close to 20 years and would like to
    get involved in giving back to a community that has given me so
    much.

    I work as a systems administrator and have a few scripts that I
    could be uploaded into the App:: hierarchy, but would like to
    contribute either though the Pull Request Challenge or by looking
    though the project's bug queues on my own. I've had some time to
    spend recently looking at various CPAN modules and their API designs
    and feel I could grow to contribute my own modules once I had some
    more experience and some time on PrePAN under my belt.
