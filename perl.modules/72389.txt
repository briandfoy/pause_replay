I messed up JONBJ's and RJBS's account info today.

I was updating JONBJ's account with his new email address so he could
reuse the password link, and somehow my account details got into his
account details. I thought that was kinda weird. I then looked at
RJBS's account (the first account that popped into my mind), and my
account details showed up in his.

I think I did something really boneheaded. If my previous message gets
to modules@, ignore it. Here's what I think I did (and maybe Andreas
can confirm with access_log details for 79.56.59.238).

I log into PAUSE, go to 'Select User/Action', and submit the form it
presents. This uses my account and 'Edit Account Info'  as the input.

Now, normally from there, I change the HIDDENNAME from BDFOY to
whatever account I want to change. I do it that way so I don't scroll
through all of the account in the select box.

However, I think I submitted my own 'Edit Account Info' form. I don't
remember that I did or why I would. Upon doing that, which is a GET
request, the URL in the location bar changes toward the end, but in my
limited display, I didn't see the changes because they were 'off
screen'.

I then did my usual bit of changing HIDDENNAME. Well, I was making a
GET request with all of my account info, but now applied to the other
account I'd chosen. Instead of getting the form with their current
info, I got their account with my info because I had just updated it
instead of merely displaying it.

So, it sucks to be me.
