description: IPv6 enabled functions such as gethostbyname2`
DSLI: adcf

discussion: I started out adding the IPv6 aware functions inet_pton and
inet_ntop to Socket.pm with the intention of submitting the additions to
the Socket.pm authors. However I have since added gethostbyname2 and I'm
working on other functions so I believe it is not appropriate to simply
add to Socket.pm and these functions should be in a module of their own. I
considered adding it to Net:: but I don't think this is entirely 
appropriate either given the type of module included in it.

I announced my intention for an IPv6 module in the 6ren mailing list and
have had 3 responses from people who would use it if it were available. I
believe there will be growing interest in IPv6 and perl should have IPv6
capabilities.
