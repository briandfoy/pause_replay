I have to admit I haven't been able to come up with another name to
succintly describe the module.  The unadorned name "GnuPG" is already
taken by another module (as described in my message); I simply attached
"::Interface" so that mine could be distinct, even though redundant.

Coming up with 'fun', 'unixy', or even 'original-yet-nondescriptive' names
doesn't seem to be a tradition on CPAN.  All modules seen to directly
describe their functionality.  This another reason I created the bland and
redundant name "GnuPG::Interface".

Referring to history, I haven't seen other situation on CPAN where two
modules, relying on another program, attempt to perform the same function.

There is some committal to the name GnuPG::Interface already, such as
project on SourceForge.net having been established, with an undetermined
number of people people already using the module, so renaming it is not a
matter I wish to be taken lightly.  I think that although the name is
redundant, it both describes the functionality and is unique.
