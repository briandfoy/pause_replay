     why:

    Initially, I have only one module to contribute,
    Acme::ManagementSpeak. It generates grammatically correct,
    managerial-sounding text that means absolutely nothing. It can
    output sentences, paragraphs, and whole documents with embedded
    structure. The goal is to easily provide filler or lorem ipsen
    content that has the potential to pass as real. This module does for
    geeks what lorem ipsen does for designers.
