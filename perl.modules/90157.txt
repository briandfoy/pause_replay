IO::Socket::SSL has changed its default verification mode and that's what's
requiring the fix.

I don't understand how you think the status of the privately run closed
source CPAN search system that's been superceded by metacpan has any relevance
whatsoever to the fact that you're sat on an important patch and have been
completely ignoring the ticket.

If it isn't abandonware, some actual activity so the dist installs would be
a better way of proving it than mere assertion is :)
