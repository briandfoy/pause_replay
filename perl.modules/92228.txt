Hi

Another year but the same bug.  Please see attached mail.  This is wrong 
as I am the original author of Mustache::Simple.

Please see http://search.cpan.org/~cms/Mustache-Simple/

It works on CPAN but does not work on meta::cpan as the latter relies on 
02packages.details.txt and this is not being correctly updated.

Please help

Cliff.
