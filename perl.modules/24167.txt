That reasoning fits Image::Thumbnail as it's dealing with any image.

But I think Image::Worldmap is a bad choice. Would have been better
under a Geo namespace.

Similarly Image::Schedule is more relevant to scheduling than images
and so a name in the Schedule:: namespace would be a better fit.

Also "Schedule::Image" is too general. Perhaps Schedule::TableImage
(assuming your module generates images of schedules in a tabular format).
