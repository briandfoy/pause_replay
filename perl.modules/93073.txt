Namespaces in PAUSE are case-insensitive, because some filesystems are case-insensitive.
However, it looks like the 06perms.txt file (and the underlying database) are organized in a case sensitive fashion, so it looks like the two modules are entirely separate, but they're not.

I'm cc-ing modules@perl.org as it looks like you'll need to get this sorted out at the PAUSE level.
