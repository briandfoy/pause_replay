Hi !

 I have written a small module that produces a javascript script in an
 HTML page. It mainly produce what's needed for a top bar with cascade
 menus. The idea comes from a nice page I have seen on the Net with
 such a top bar menu (http://www.sgi.com/products/). My module offer a
 perl interface for producing such top bar menu out of a perl
 description.

 I have not found anything related to javascript in the module
 list. It may be considered that the main aspect of my module is to
 produce complex javascript that no body wants to keystroke. As for
 now it just make it possible to produce top bar menu. But possibly it
 may offer other javascript enhanced code. So my first idea was to
 call it << Jegen >> standing for Javascript Enhanced GENerator.

 I known that it does not speak by itself. I find it a nice trade off
 between module << J >> and module << Javascript::Generator::TopBar >>
 name.

 Do you any alternatives to Jegen.
