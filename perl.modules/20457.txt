The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MPEG::Audio::Frame
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Weed MPEG Audio frames from file handles.
  userid:      NUFFIN (yuval kojman)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    MPEG:: This is the format, and an existing namespace Audio:: This
    only deals with MPEG audio Frame:: This only deals with the frame,
    not decoding or anything, and represents frames as objects.

    There is no such module, and it is a useful utility for mp3
    streaming daemons, batch processing, or whatever.

    This module may be implemented in the various MP3:: or MPEG::
    namespace modules, but those implementations are specific to the
    functionality of those modules. This is a general module, oriented
    at the encapsulating format of MPEG streams, and none other.

  enteredby:   NUFFIN (yuval kojman)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr 17 23:42:36 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MPEG::Audio::
::Frame           adpOp Weed MPEG Audio frames from file handles.    NUFFIN
