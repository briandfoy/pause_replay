Hi guys,

Apologies for the OT, but this is a wide audience, and I'm hopeful you
can help.
I'm desperately seeking Rob Brown (aka BBB on CPAN). We're in the final
stages of removing all code in Fedora which is solely licensed under the
old Artistic 1.0 license, and we need to talk to Rob about the
possibility of relicensing IO::Multiplex (a fair amount of useful things
end up depending on this, so we'd really like to avoid removing them if
possible).

Googling confirms that I'm not the only person who has had problems
getting a hold of him:
http://www.mail-archive.com/module-authors@perl.org/msg03436.html

CPAN shows that his last new release was in August of 2007
(http://search.cpan.org/~bbb/), but we've been emailing him since
September 2007 with no response.

If anyone knows how to get a hold of Rob, please, please let me know.
I've tried calling the number in the whois information for his website
(roobik.com), but it doesn't seem to go anywhere useful.

Thanks in advance,

Tom Callaway, Fedora
