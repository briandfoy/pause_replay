Subject: Module submission MooseX::Method
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, berle@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::Method
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Method declaration with parameters
  userid:      BERLE (Anders Nor Berle)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    #moose on magnet

  similar:
    Params::Validate

  rationale:

    MooseX::Method is made to work together with the Moose object
    framework to provide a way to declare methods with parameters. It's
    designed to be both elegant and flexible, and I have yet to really
    find another module that satisfies my need for this so I eventually
    just wrote one myself which takes adventage of the strengths and
    meta-mentality of Moose. I hope it will get accepted. :-)

  enteredby:   BERLE (Anders Nor Berle)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 25 00:25:06 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::
::Method          cdphp Method declaration with parameters           BERLE
