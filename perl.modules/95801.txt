Hi Neil,

Feel free to do whatever clean up is needed to resolve this conflict. Happy
to help, but I can't locate a "Main.pm" in any of the current Zoidberg
packages on CPAN, maybe I'm overlooking it?

I think this was a mistake on my side in the first place to place "Main"
outside of my "Zoidberg" namespace.

Regards,

Jaap
