From: LGoddard@VHN.NET (Lee Goddard)

I could log in last week, even though I kept being
sent to p11.com (manually adjusted GET URLs).
I changed my password, and now although I don't get 
sent to p11.com, I can't log in - unknown e-mail
address, too.  Same username and password as on the
Who's Who list.....

Any suggestions?  Pleeeeeeeeeease?
