Oh, I figured I needed to wait in uploading it to begin with until the
namespace was approved.  Guess I'm not quite clued about CPAN process.
Guess when I get a few moments, I'll finish up the docs and run it
through PAUSE.

Okay, will take a look at what's in the Filesys namespace.  Sounds more
reasonable than IO.  Was hoping to find something like the interface
