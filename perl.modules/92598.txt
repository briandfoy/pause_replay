To whom it may concern & CPAN Legal Team,

Nagios::Plugin package has been hijacked and purposely deprecated by a 
hostile member of your community in an attempt to deliberately cause 
harm to Nagios Enterprises business.

Additionally, Sven Nierlein, the hijacker, has taken it upon himself to 
not only deprecate the package in favor of his own package, he also has 
deliberately removed the original Copyright found in the correct version 
of the module, as seen here
http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/TONVOON/Nagios-Plugin-0.36/README

Copyright (C) 2006 by Nagios Plugin Development Team

See new Copyright:
http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/NIERLEIN/Nagios-Plugin-0.37/README

Nagios Plugin Development Team is run under the direction of Nagios 
Enterprises and has no affiliation with Mr. Nierlein, nor his newly 
created "Monitoring Plugin Development Team".

This is not the first time Mr. Nierlein and his associates have 
purposely tried to hijack our intellectual property, see the following 
from 1/24/2014:
http://nagios-plugins.org/uncomfortable-info-on-the-plugin-team-changes/

*Please revert the changes made to the **Nagios-Plugin-0.37 module ASAP*!

If we need to add an authorized user to control the package and 
approve/deny, I would be happy to do that and have submitted a request 
for a PAUSE account under the userid NAGIOS.

Thank you for your quick attention to this matter.
