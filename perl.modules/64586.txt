I would like a different name because I have seen more than
one web page saying things like "IPC::MM has a broken hash
function, and it's slower than s--- besides".

So my motivation for wanting the name IPC::MMA is similar to
the new electric car maker here in San Jose not wanting to
call his new product a Yugo.

Hope you understand,
Craig MacKenna
