The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CljPerl
  DSLIP:       adpho
  description: CljPerl is a Lisp implemented by pure Perl.
  userid:      WEHU (Wei Hu)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    https://github.com/wehu/CljPerl

  similar:
    Lisp

  rationale:

    CljPerl is a Lisp implemented by pure Perl. It borrows the idea
    from Clojure, which makes a seamless connection with Java packages.
    Like Java, Perl has huge number of CPAN packages. They are amazing
    resources. CljPerl is a bridge between Lisp and Perl. We can program
    in Lisp and make use of the great resources from CPAN. This is the
    key feature that CljPerl allow the data to be passed between Lisp
    and Perl including 'closure' for a seamless connection between them.

The resulting entry would be:

CljPerl           adpho CljPerl is a Lisp implemented by pure Perl.  WEHU
