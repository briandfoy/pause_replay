      My apologies;  that should really be "FTN"  (for Fidonet  
Technology Networks) rather than ""FTB".

      I will resubmit the module registration.

      I think "Fidonet" for the top level namespace is, although  
descriptive, too specific.  The "FTN" namespace already exists, is  
the standard acronym for "Fidonet Technology Networks", and refers to  
the software and procedures used not only for Fidonet but also other  
'networks' based on the same technology.
