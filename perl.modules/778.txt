I'm trying to figure out who the author respondible for Crypt::DES is.  This
module is very similar to the one found at www.cryptix.org in their perl
package--except it has some endianness issues.  I wanted to let the
author know so he could fix it.  As it stands, the Crypt::DES module on
CPAN is worthless for anyone with a big-endian system.  I spent an hour or
so today tracking down the problem and fixing it.  Thankfully Cryptix has
their code available and the module is VERY similar.

  Any sufficiently advanced bug is indistinguishable for a feature.
