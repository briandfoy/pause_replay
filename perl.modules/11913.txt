                                                    THE PRESIDENT/CEO

DEAR SIR,

                              REQUEST FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION/ASSISTANCE

MAY I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE TO OPEN THIS BUSINESS DISCUSSION BY A 

FORMAL LETTER OF THIS SORT.  IT IS PERTINENT THAT BUSINESS OF THIS 

MAGNITUDE SHOULD HAVE COMMENCED PROPERLY WITH A FORMAL MEETING OF YOU


AND US TO
ENABLE US KNOW OURSELVES, HAVE A FORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE


BUSINESS, DISCUSS AND ACQUAINT OURSELVES WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND


FUNCTIONS OF PARTIES CONCERNED, AND APPROPRIATE SHARES ACCORDINGLY. 


HOWEVER, FOR TIME FACTOR, CONFIDENTIALITY AND PERSONALITY OF PEOPLE 

INVOLVED HERE IN NIGERIA, WE CHOSE THIS APPROACH FOR THE REMITTANCE OF


FIFTEEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS(US$15.5M), PLEASE


BEAR WITH US FOR MAKING THE INITIAL CONTACT THROUGH E-MAIL.

WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET AND PLANNING OF THE


MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM THIS COMMITTEE IS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH 

CONTRACT APPRAISAL AND THE APPROVAL OF CONTRACTS IN ORDER OF PRIORITIES


AS REGARDS CAPITAL PROJECTS OF THE PAST MILITARY GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA


WITH OUR POSITIONS WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED FOR OURSELVES THE SUM


OF FIFTEEN
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS US$15.5M).  THE AMOUNT WAS


ACCUMULATED THROUGH UNDECLARED WINDFALL SALES OF CRUDE OIL DURING THE


GULF WAR.

HENCE TOGETHER WITH SOME OF THE TOP OFFICIALS OF THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL


PETROLEUM CORPORATION, THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL


BANK OF NIGERIA.  WE PLAN TO TRANSFER THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY FIFTEEN 

MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS (US$15.5M) INTO AN OVERSEAS


ACCOUNT BY AWARDING A NON EXISTING CONTRACT FROM MY MINISTRY (NNPC).
 

TO THIS EFFECT I DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU SIR, IS TO PROVIDE A VERY VITAL ACCOUNT IN WHICH


THE FUNDS WILL BE TRANSFERED.  MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE AGREED TO 

COMPENSATE THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT USED FOR THIS TRANSACTION WITH 30%


OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT REMITTED.  WE SHALL KEEP 60% AND REMAINING 10% 

RESERVED FOR TAXES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES.

IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT LAST TWO YEARS A SIMILAR TRANSACTION


WAS CARRIED OUT WITH ONE MR. PATRICE MILLER, THE PRESIDENT OF CRAINE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION AT  NEW YORK  WITH TELEPHONE NUMBER


(626) 722-1441  AND TELEX NUMBER 9731600.  AFTER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN


BOTH PARTNERS IN WHICH HE
WAS TO TAKE 20% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 80% FOR US.  WITH ALL


THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS SIGNED THE MONEY WAS DULY TRANSFERRED INTO HIS
ACOCUNT ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED ON OUR ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK, AND WE WERE


RELIABLY INFORMED THAT MR. PATRICE MILLER WAS NO LONGER ON THAT ADDRESS


WHILE HIS TELEPHONE AND TELEX NUMBERS HAVE BEEN REALLOCATED TO SOMEBODY


ELSE THAT IS HOW WE LOST US$8M TO MR. PATRICE MILLER.

THIS TIME AROUND WE NEED A MORE RELIABE AND TRUSTWORTHY PERSON, A 

REPUTABLE COMPANY TO DO BUSINESS WITH HENCE THIS LETTER TO YOU, SO, IF


YOU CAN
PROVE YOURSELF TO BE TRUSTED AND INTERESTED IN THIS DEAL THEN WE ARE


PREPARED TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.  WHAT WE WANT FROM YOU IS THE 

ASSURANCE
THAT YOU WILL LET US HAVE OUR SHARE IF THE INFLATED AMOUNT OF FIFTEEN


MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS (US$15.5M) IS TRANSFERRED


INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.  IF THIS PROPOSAL SATISFIES YOU, THEN REPLY TO THIS


MAIL URGENTLY SO THAT WE CAN NEGOTIATE THE MODALITIES INVOLVED.

PLEASE SIR, KINDLY TREAT AS VERY URGENT AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL, I


HONESTLY ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR URGENT REPLY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXPECTED 

CO-OPERATION AND GOD BLESS YOU. PLEASE REPLY ME ON THIS MY E-MAIL ADDRESS  tomsunday@consultant.com


YOURS TRULY

DR TOM SUNDAY
