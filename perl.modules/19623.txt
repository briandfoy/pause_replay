The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POEST::Server
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: POE Based SMTP Server with Plugin Support
  userid:      CWEST (Casey West)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://opensource.dyndns.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    POEST::Server is the highest-level class library that supports this
    application, called poest. The application was named poest because
    it is based on POE, and as a mail server acts as a traditional
    "post". That is, the "post" delivers mail, "poest" delivers email.
    As supporting libraries, POEST was the most logical choice.
    Alphabetically, it aligns well with POE, though does not fit under
    that namespace.

  enteredby:   CWEST (Casey West)
  enteredon:   Thu Mar 20 17:05:25 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POEST::
::Server          cdpOp POE Based SMTP Server with Plugin Support    CWEST
