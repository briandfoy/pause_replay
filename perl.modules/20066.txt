The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Merge
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: Merge configurations from various sources

  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)

  rationale:

    I've developed several complex applications. Some parts are
    configurable via configuration file. The parameters can also be
    defined by a script. In the application core I set the default
    configuration values. I need to merge this three sources of
    configuration to get the final configuration set before used in
    other parts of the application. I've used this mechanism internall.
    Now, it's just the time to release it to the public in hope that it
    can be useful to others.

    I've changed the name from something internal to Config::Merge, and
    I think this is an appopriate name. There's already a namesapce
    "Config::" for configuration parser. So Merge will fit just well. I
    believe this is the first module in CPAN for this purpose.

    I'm internally testing this module before releasing the first
    version (0.0.1, alpha stage). In the meantime, this is an excerpt
    from ABSTRACT:

    Config::Merge merges configuration from at most three sources. Your
    application may allow users to define configuration in a file, but
    you also have set predefined (default) configuration. At the end you
    want single configuration by merging them with a certain precedence.
    This module will do just that.

    Additionally, Config::Merge provides internal parser for convenient
    and historical reason, but allows users to provide external parser
    via CODE reference to suit their need.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Merge           cdpfp Merge configurations from various sources    HASANT
