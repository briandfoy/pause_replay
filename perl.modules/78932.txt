Throw into the mix it's been out there for a while and is being used, and
we have the makings and a great Christmas pudding. Now where's that recipe
book?

I'd be happy to rename it so long as the name captures it's role, which is,
to my mind, to do 99% of jobs that Text::CSV is used for. How about
Text::CSV::Easy? What I'd really like, however, is to pass ownership of it
to my new PAUSE ID "BABF" (which is in turn the real reason I wanted to
register the name).
