Hi all,

I have recently applied for a directory on CPAN and I'm all set to 
contribute my first module.  My userID is "SMART" (ironic, huh?).
I would like to use the namespace DBI::DBObject, because:

- the module builds on DBI.  It takes most of the SQL out - in fact you 
don't need to know SQL to use it.
- the module is an OO superclass providing common methods for things that 
live in a database, such as users (table 'user' would contain records of 
users).  Class=table and Instance=record.

Any reason I shouldn't use this namespace?  Given that the module is fully 
OO, the only place the namespace will crop in scripts that use() it will be 
in their @ISA or use base().

Cheers -

Steve Martina
