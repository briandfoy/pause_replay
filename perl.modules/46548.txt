Hmm - interestingly the whole discussion has tended towards how the
API communication works: client / server and IPC and all that. The
actual point behind the module is to provide a framework on which to
beild APIs, that can then be used either over a network or in one
process, calling the API methods locally. How the API is implemented
is hidden, and the user need only consider proceesing the data at
either end.

I'm going to rename the module to 'API::Framework' to reflect this.
Please let me know if this would be accepted as a registered name and
so whether I should reapply with it.

Apart from giving my module a place to live it would also provide a
place for all the API implementations that are cropping up to go, like
'Flikr::API' and 'EVDB::API' - they would become 'API::(Flickr|EVDB)'
(If the authors choose to move them that is).

Thanks for your input so far.

Cheers,
  Edmund.
