Subject: Module submission YATT

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       YATT
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Yet Another Template Toolkit
  userid:      HKOBA (KOBAYASI, Hiroaki)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/yatt-pm/

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    Here is Why ``Yet Another'' template engine is worth having for
    general public.

    [1] Perl already has many Template-Engine for Web apps. But IMHO,
    most of them are designed from Programmer's Perspective.

    In those engine, template itself cannot be the [Main/Toplevel] of
    the app. In contrast, in PHP, index.php is the [Main/Toplevel]. This
    simplicity greatly helps novice programmers to complete his/her job.
    YATT.pm will bring this into Perl's web development scene.

    [2] Technically, YATT.pm converts each template into perl's
    "package" so that you can define own subs. You can even define
    inheritance between templates.

    Syntax of YATT.pm template is similar to XML, but has some
    incompatible extension to achieve efficiency and code readability.

    It also supports multi-pass templating (templates, to generate
    templates, to generate...)

    Since YATT.pm is designed enough modular, you can define
    alternative translator other than Perl.

    [3] So, why not PHP? Because I love Perl;-) And still there are
    many Perl Lovers B-)

    YATT.pm will help you coding within Perl's fully robust coding
    style (use strict, taintcheck, mod_perl, fastcgi, and so on...)

The resulting entry would be:

YATT              cdpOp Yet Another Template Toolkit                 HKOBA
