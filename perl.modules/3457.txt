	It's negative in that I have to take previous time to update
	all my source code, documentation, and web site.

	And as I've already /clearly/ stated /many/ times, I am /not/
	taking my precious time to contrive a new name.  Why you
	haven't picked up on that simple fact already is beyond me.  If
	somebody /else/ wants to sit around for hours, days, or months
	trying to come up with a better name, /then/ he's free to
	suggest it to me.

	OK, I'll try to make it painfully clear: any further discussion
	on this is a mutual waste of time.  The only things I /might/
	consider and /good/ name suggestions.
