From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

Adam Kennedy has announced his intention to delete this distribution from
the CPAN rather than continue to maintain it.

As a production user of this distribution I would like to volunteer to take
over this distribution and act as the maintainer for it henceforth.
