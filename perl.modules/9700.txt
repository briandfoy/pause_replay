Chris,

   Sorry for not responding.

   Okay, I will.  I heareby request namespace

MacOSX

   for the use by modules that are platform-specific to MacOS X.

   As for the replies (or lack there of) from modules@perl.org, 0 reply 
for OK is pretty much like Unix commands.  But for administrative this 
is terribly wrong.  Simple autorespond like that of CPAN would be 
welcome.
   As for the namespace Mac::X, I object because this is confusing with X 
window.

   Mine does not have the same interface.  That's why I picked the 
different name space to begin with.  After XS (therefore C compiler) is 
imperative for make install MacOSX::File (though binary distribution is 
considered when it gets stable) something you can't expect of MacOS 9 
and below.
   Oh, that reminds me.  Is there a canonical way to upload BINARY 
version of the module?  I can make it so that Makefile.PL works like an 
installer rather than Makefile generator but is it the way?

   It would be nice, too but that requires more than my share of work.  
Resorting to reinventing a wheel is a pain enough.

   Yes, that's always the problem.  As for MacOSX::File, I was too lazy 
to use Finder to backup a hundred of thousand of files (vanilla MacOS X 
with Developer Kit well exceeds 100,000 files).  I was too impatient to 
wait for someone come of a module like this.  And I was too hubristic to 
wait for the verdict of modules@cpan.org.
   What other virtues do I need :)
