Subject: Module submission Time::Piece::Adaptive

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Piece::Adaptive
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OO Time Interface
  userid:      DPRICE (Derek Price)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Time::Piece

  rationale:

    Most of the bugs registered for Time::Piece have not been touched
    in several years. I also needed to make some changes to fit it into
    a program in a fully backwards compatible manner and was unable to
    elicit a response from the Time::Piece developers over several
    weeks.

    In addition to fixing some of the bugs present in Time::Piece, this
    also extends the functionality to allow setting of the stringify
    method. When dates are parsed, the stringify method is also
    automatically memorized.

  enteredby:   DPRICE (Derek Price)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug 22 02:19:01 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Time::Piece::
::Adaptive        adpOp OO Time Interface                            DPRICE
