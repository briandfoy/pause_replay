Sure, but Adam Kennedy has always advocated a collaborative approach to
this sort of thing and has long since had a policy of "anybody with a clue
willing to do cleanup work should be allowed to" - I've helped him build out
teams on that basis plenty of times, as have quite a few people who're active
in the community.

If it was somebody else's code, I'd agree that caution would be important,
but in this case I really don't foresee a problem.
