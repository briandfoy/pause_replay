Good morning,

I would like to get some feedback on namespace for two modules that I
would like to submit to CPAN: HTTP::TestEngine and HTTP::SessionConfig.

HTTP::TestEngine is a mod_perl handler which acts like a macro recorder,
writing details about each request during a user's http session to a
file on the filesystem.  There is a short cgi script included with
HTTP::TestEngine which that sets a cookie to maintain state.

HTTP::SesssionConfig takes the file written by HTTP::TestEngine and
formats it into a data structure suitable for use with
HTTP::Monkeywrench. (HTTP::Monkeywrench, which is already available on
CPAN, recreates an http session by reading a configuration file.  This
configuration file currently must be written by hand -- these two
modules automate the process so that a user can simply click their way
through a session that they would like to reproduce in the future.)  My
intent is that HTTP::SessionConfig will support other http test
harnesses such as HTTP::WebTest in the future.

So, I'd like to hear feedback on namespace, as well as packaging of the
cgi script mentioned in HTTP::TestEngine above.

If anyone would like to see the current version, it is available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/http-recorder/

Thanks for your help.
-Chris
