              a description of what you're planning to contribute 

I'm planning to contribute a module which breakes a text into sentences.
This is a different version from Text::Sentence already available, as it
uses a different algorithm, and also should be completely free with no
constraint (Text::Sentence can only be distributed with permission of
CRE, mine won't be...).

Language: Perl (pure Perl, no C...).
Development stage: Done. 
Support Level: I'll continue to improve the module, and also consider
user's suggestions if I get any.

I have other modules on the way, on different subjects.

              It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about
where you have discussed some or all parts of your contribution
publicly, and if there was at least a little bit of interest.

This module has been discussed within Siftology Inc. and it seems to be
working nicely.
