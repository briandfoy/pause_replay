The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Native
  DSLIP:       cdpfg
  description: Parsing in your native language, Perl
  userid:      GSLONDON (Greg London)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parse::Nibbler

  rationale:

    Parse::Nibbler was my first attempt at perl based parsing. It
    worked, but it was too clumsy to be useful.

    Parse::Native will use source code filtering and massive subroutine
    exporting to allow Grammars to be written in pure perl in a manner
    that is much more intuitive and much more elegant than
    Parse::Nibbler.

    I coded the fundamental sections to prove to myself that it would
    work.

    It does not parse yet, but the source code filtering interface has
    been defined and the Grammars now look a lot cleaner than they did
    in Parse::Nibbler.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
