     why:

    I'm a co-developer of Sidux: http://www.sidux.com and also of
    Kanotix: http://www.kanotix.com. However, I want the Perl modules I
    write for either of these distributions to be distro-agnostic, so
    others can use these modules as well. The first module i would like
    to contribute will be Config::Source, which can source any shell
    file thrown at it, including nested source files, and return a hash
    of shell variables that were set. With respect to the namespace:
    i'll have to contact the appropriate authors and/or consult you
    guys.
