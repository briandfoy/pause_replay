The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sphinx::Search
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Perl API client for Sphinx search engine
  userid:      JJSCHUTZ (Jon Schutz)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.sphinxsearch.com/forum/forum.html?id=1

  similar:

  rationale:

    The new root level namespace Sphinx is proposed. Sphinx::Search is
    a module specific to providing a Perl client API for the Sphinx
    search engine; one might expect to see modules in the future such as
    Sphinx::Indexer, Sphinx::Daemon etc.

    The new root level namespace is suggested because:

    a. The Search:: namespace tends to mostly include modules that
    provide general search algorithms, so Search::Sphinx would not be
    appropriate (though there are exceptions, such as Search::Xapian)

    b. WWW::Search, CGI::Search are also inappropriate, as Sphinx is
    not a WWW search engine, nor is the API restricted to CGI.

    c. The Sphinx::Search namespace is in line with similar modules,
    e.g. Yahoo::Search, Plucene::Search, Kwiki::Search,
    OpenGuides::Search.

    The are no other Sphinx APIs in CPAN. An older API exists (outside
    of CPAN), but is bound to the PHP API. Sphinx::Search will hold to
    the API but allow some Perl flexibilities and extra features.

The resulting entry would be:

Sphinx::
