Subject: Preferred namespace for Web/API modules?

Dear Modules list,

What's the preferred namespace for hooking into APIs of webservices?  I've
seen Net::Twitter, and WWW::Facebook, WWW::GitHub, and I could have sworn
that I saw another namespace that gets regularly used, but it seems to
escape me right now.

Potential contributions that you might see from me are ::FourSquare and
::BeeMinder, both of which use a REST API.

Many thanks,

	Paul
