Subject: advice about sumbitting bug fixes

 I'd like to sumbit a new version of crypt-rijndael-pp which fixes
a couple bugs.  This module seems to be abandoned by it's original
author.   

I've registered as a developer but I'm not sure what to do from here.

I've prepared what would be a distribution zip for the new version,
but I'm sure there must be some kind of testing/vetting process before
it can be accepted and distributed through cpan.

What do I do next?
