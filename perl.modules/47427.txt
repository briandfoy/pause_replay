Have you talked to the AttributeBased author, do you think they could 
more easily be merged or integrated together?

"provides functionality missing from" is the standout phrase there, 
providing a new alternative module would be less ideal than fixing the 
one we already have.

Of course, if they original one can't be improved and the differences 
can't be reconciled, then I'd be happy to approve this.

But it would be nice to know that the "nicer" options have been 
attempted first.
