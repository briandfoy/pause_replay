FROM THE DESK OF DR=2E FRANK RUMHI 

I am Dr=2EFrank Rumhi a member of the Presidential 
Payment Verification Committee =28PPVC=29 of the Federal 
Government Of Nigeria=2C West Africa and also a Director 
of Project Implementation with the Federal Ministry of 
Finance=28FMF=29=2E I am presently  carrying out 
routine verification of contractual claims on behalf 
of the Federal Ministry of Finance=28FMF=29 

I apologized for using this medium to reach you for a 
transaction=2Fbusiness of this magnitude=2C but this is 
due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on 
this medium=2E 
In unfolding this proposal=2C I want to count on you=2C as 
a respected and honest person to handle this 
transaction with sincerity=2C trust and confidentiality=2E 


I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation 
with you in the process of actualising our dreams 
described hereunder=2E For the benefit of all parties 
and hope you will keep it in confidence because of the 
nature of this transaction within the Ministry of 
Finance=28FMF=29=2C where I work as Director of Project 
Implementation=2E 

With the cooperation of four other top officials=2C we 
have in our possession overdue payment bills which we 
are presently verifying=2C to the tune of Twenty Six 
Million=2C Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars 
=28US$26=2C500=2C000=2E=29 which we want to transfer abroad with 
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign 
company=2Findividual to receive the said fund on our 
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to 
receive such funds=2E 

More so=2C we are handicapped in the circumstances=2C as 
the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to 
operate offshore account hence your importance in the 
whole transaction=2E 

This amount $26=2E5m represents the balance of the total 
contract value executed on behalf of the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Resources =28NNPC=29 by a foreign 
contracting firm=2C which we the officials over-invoiced 
deliberately in the course of our verification 
exercise=2E Though the actual contract cost have been 
paid to the original contractor=2C leaving the balance 
in the tune of the said amount which we have in 
principle gotten approval to remit by Key Tested 
Telegraphic Transfer =28K=2ET=2ET=29 to any foreign bank 
account you will provide by filing in an application 
through the Ministry of Finance for the transfer of 
Rights and Privileges to the contractual sum to 
you=2Fyour account=2E 

I have the authority of my partners involved to 
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the 
transaction=2C your share of the sum would  be 30% of the 
$26=2E5million=2C 60% for us and 10% for taxation and 
miscellaneous expenses=2E The business itself is 100% 
safe=2C on your part provided you treat it with utmost 
secrecy and confidentiality=2E 

Your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the 
successful execution of this transaction=2E 

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you 
would not disappoint me=2E Endeavor to contact me 
immediately by e-mail or by  fax to  +873 762 941 349   

should you be interested or not in this transaction=2E If 

not=2C it would enable me time to scout for another 

credible foreign partner of note to help carry on this 

transaction=2C as my time here in London has to 

sufficiently backed with reasons=2E 

I assure you that my partners and I are in a position 
to make the payment of this claim possible provided 
you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee 
that our share would be secured and please always 
remember to treat this matter with the utmost 
confidentiality=2C as any form of exposure would 
compromise our positions in this government=2C being 
active Government Civil Servants=2E 

Once again=2C remember time is of great essence in this 
transaction=2E 

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation=2E 

Yours faithfully=2C 

Dr=2E Frank Rumhi
