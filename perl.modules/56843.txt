Subject: Re: Old CPAN namespace registration for Tie::WarnGlobal

No error on your part, no problem with the PAUSE indexer.  
Tie::WarnGlobal is better named Devel::WarnGlobal, which I have  
uploaded. Devel::WarnGlobal is a fairly minor module, so I don't  
particularly think registering the namespace is important.

So, in short, delete Tie::WarnGlobal from the database with my  
blessings.
