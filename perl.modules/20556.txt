Ahhhh.

That doesn't work.  I only get this to fly me by the firewall proxy if it
has

    BEGIN {
       use LWP;
       package RequestAgent;
       @ISA = qw(LWP::UserAgent);
       ....
       sub new {
       
lwp-request does exactly the same.  If I rename it, say,
Finance::YahooQuote::RequestAgent, the code bombs because the new 'new'
routine is not found.

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here :-/
