Subject: Re: Old CPAN namespace registration for WWW::Webjay
Date: Mon, 17 Sep 2007 07:06:09 -0700
To: modules@perl.org
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.752.3)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: blinks@acm.org (Adam Blinkinsop)

It appears that I uploaded something with slightly different  
capitalization: http://search.cpan.org/~spaceman/WWW-Webjay-0.1_1/lib/ 
WWW/Webjay.pm

This is how the service capitalized itself, so I followed that  
convention.  Let me know if there's anything else you need.
