I've been developing a script that creates SYSV packages from CPAN
sources using CPANPLUS.  In the process, I've developed a few bits of
code that should be abstracted out into a seperate module so that
others (for example, alien <http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/>)
can use the code to create SYSV packages.

Related module namespaces I've found are: 

    Alien::Package        -- Convert between various package formats.
    Meta::Tool::Deb       -- Something to do with debian archives?
    RPM                   -- Perl wrapper for RPM API.
    Software::Packager    -- Abstract class for creating SYSV packages
                             RPMs, debs, etc.

I had thought of creating a SYSV:: namespace, but that seems a bit too
broad. Pkg::SYSV?  Ideas?

Mark.
