almost no competition in terms of innovation, value, and quality=2E Lack o=
f=20
competition may seem like a good thing, but it will make our job tougher!=20=

Without competition, it's harder to build up momentum because there is les=
s=20
sense of urgency and less fear of loss=2E Fortunately, it won't be long be=
fore=20
the copycat companies will begin showing up=2E I'm looking forward to that=
 time,=20

 are endless,=20
and the quality will blow you away=2E The ICON site is already up and acti=
ve so you=20

This is truly an exceptional product, but it's only the beginning! MDI wil=
l keep the=20
momentum rolling with ONGOING product implementations=2E Each product will=
=20
meet the same standards of unparalleled quality=2E

Perfect timing and unlimited mass market potential=2E

We are pumped up about rolling out ICONCommunicator because of its vast=20=

market=2E MDI has been privileged to work with people who know the VoIP=20=

industry inside out=2E They tested the consumer market, and the results fa=
