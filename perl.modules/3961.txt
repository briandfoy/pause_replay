I'd suggest you take a closer look at the modules documentation,
especialy w.r.t. how to package a module, and what the package should
contain. If your package is PDF::Report, then you are expected to
upload a kit file named PDF-Report-x.y.tar.gz (where x.y is the
version number of the package). This kit must contain all the files,
and a Makefile.PL to handle the installation of the package.

Looking at how other kits are packaged helps also.
