Just trying to understand your rational here.

Are you saying

1. There was something called Markdown
2. Someone make a Perl module for it
3. There's since been created a different-but-related thing called 
MultiMarkdown
4. You are making a matching module for it as well?

Is this is right, will approve.

Thanks for the clarification
