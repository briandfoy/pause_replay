I've written a program called makepmdist (which I'm planning to put in
CPAN, once I get a bit of feedback on it) that simplifies the task of
making a dist of a single module.  It's not meant to handle every kind of
module in CPAN.  It's just meant to the common case of a pure-Perl modules
that is the only module in its dist.  (For example, that describes about
half of the dists in my CPAN directory.)

Basically, you say "makepmdist Foo.pm" and it does some very minimal
sanity-checking on Foo.pm, then makes a temp directory in which it copies
Foo.pm, makes a Makefile.PL, a README, a MANIFEST, and a t/test.t.  Details
of the contents of the Makefile.PL and the t/test.t are controlled by
optional =for blocks in the Foo.pm file.  (It also does some nice things
like make sure that the Foo.pm that gets disted is in Unix newline format
and has a $VERSION; and it warns about any ridiculously long lines in the
file.)  Then it makes test, dist, clean, moves the resulting .tar.gz up and
out, and kills the temp dir -- unless there was a fatal error along the
way, at which point it would just abort and let you ponder the temp dir's
contents.

I wrote this someone at YAPC about two years ago said it'd be nice if
disting a module were a one-step process; and I liked that idea.  Well, it
almost is one-step now, if the module is simple enough (i.e., no XS, and is
the only module in the dist), and if you don't count the part about
actually submitting it to PAUSE, which would bring this to an aching TWO
steps.

I would appreciate if people would look at the program at its temporary
location, at
  http://members.spinn.net/~sburke/makepmdist_101.txt
and consider its docs, and test it out if you can, and let me know how it
works for you.

You probably have questions, and they are probably answered in the Pod
that's at the end of that program file.
