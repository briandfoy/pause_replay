The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Zompist::Barakhinei
  DSLIP:       adpfb
  description: Inflect Barakhinei nouns, verbs, adjectives
  userid:      PNE (Philip Newton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lingua::Zompist::Verdurian Lingua::Zompist::Cadhinor

  rationale:

    This is a module to inflect words in Mark Rosenfelder's conlang
    Barakhinei. Since it deals with a human language (even though it's
    an invented language), I put it under Lingua::. The second level,
    Lingua::Zompist::, was suggested by Mark in an email exchange.
    Zompist is his nickname, and the web site on which his fictional
    world and languages are documented is http://www.zompist.com/ .

    I've already put Lingua::Zompist::Verdurian,
    Lingua::Zompist::Kebreni, and Lingua::Zompist::Cadhinor on CPAN.
    This is my fourth Lingua::Zompist:: module. It would be nice to see
    them on the module list so that people interested in Mark
    Rosenfelder's languages can find them more easily.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::Zompist::
::Barakhinei      adpfb Inflect Barakhinei nouns, verbs, adjectives  PNE
