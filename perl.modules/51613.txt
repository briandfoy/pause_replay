Hi,

We have some modules in CPAN for bioperl, eg. BIRNEY/bioperl-1.4.tar.gz.
For the future we would like to have better $VERSION strings than our 
current '1.4'. We're not quite sure the best way to do this. We need 3 
part version numbers, and a way to denote a developer-only release (that 
won't automatically be downloaded as the latest version).

For example, the next release will be called 1.5.2 and is a developer 
release. After that there will be 1.6.0 which we want to be downloaded 
automatically by people instead of 1.4. To further complicate matters, 
we also want release candidates to be available on CPAN (to test that 
CPAN will be happy with the final release, as well as make it easier for 
people to try the candidate). So there might be 1.6.0 RC1 before the 
final release of 1.6.0

We are currently considering:

$VERSION = 1.52_01; # RC1 of developer 1.5.2
$VERSION = 1.52_10; # final release of developer 1.5.2
$VERSION = 1.60_01; # RC1 of 1.6.0
$VERSION = 1.6010;  # final release of 1.6.0

OR

$VERSION = 1.005002_001; # RC1 of developer 1.5.2
$VERSION = 1.005002_100; # final release of developer 1.5.2
$VERSION = 1.006000_001; # RC1 of 1.6.0
$VERSION = 1.006000100;  # final release of 1.6.0
OR
$VERSION = 1.006000;     # final release of 1.6.0

Any thoughts as to what would be most appropriate?


Thank you,
Sendu.
