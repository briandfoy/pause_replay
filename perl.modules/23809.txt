     why:

    A set of modules:

    1) A module that generates HTML Menus. Why another one? two main
    reasons: first, I thing the design of my module makes it very
    flexible yet still easy to use (with others - select one...). Second
    - it is i18n aware to the bare bones. Besides - TIMTOWTDI. And
    unlike some, I've given a lot of time to documentiong properly.

    2) Its parent class - a thin N-ary tree that does little but does
    it well, and supplies the feature of unique numbers for each node
    and for each tree.

    3) A derivative of #2 - a module that reads and keeps updated a DB
    table containing information of such a tree.
