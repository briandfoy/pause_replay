The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FLDBM
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: FLDBM is a textfile database storage system.
  userid:      MJFLICK (Michael J. Flickinger)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    A mailing list will be setup.

  similar:
    BerkeleyDB

  rationale:

    As far as I know, there is no other textfile database management
    system. FLDBM provides a new method of storing information in a
    database format. Nothing else I have ever seen does something in
    this manor. FLDBM requires only one module file to work, and it's
    fast and light on a systems resources.

    FLDBM can be used on any system with perl, unlike
    BerkeleyDB/DB_File, FLDBM does not require anything else for it to
    work. DB_File and BerkeleyDB can seem a tad confusing to a lot of
    folks, that's why FLDBM is also easy to use and simple to
    understand.

    I truly feel FLDBM could have a great future if it is given the
    chance to develop.

The resulting entry would be:

FLDBM             adpfp FLDBM is a textfile database storage system. MJFLICK
