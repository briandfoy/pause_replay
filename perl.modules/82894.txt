Maybe Data::ByPath::RW or something? The read/write-ness is something people
are going to care about.

You're welcome to upload it under that name without registration, you know.

I don't tend to register my own modules these days; I regard the registration
process more as a useful feedback cycle on naming than anything else.

I'm also starting to think that the reasons why many ::Simple modules are
actively hated by experienced perl programmers may not apply from your
point of view - or more accurately, that I'll probably hate your module for
the same reasons ... but that the people who won't will search for ::Simple
modules for a different set of reasons.

So the name might be ok after all.
