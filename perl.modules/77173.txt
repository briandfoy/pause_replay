Hi Geoff,<br>
<br>
I found Text::VimColor on CPAN (<a href=3D"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text=
-VimColor/" target=3D"_blank">http://search.cpan.org/dist/<u></u>Text-VimCo=
lor/</a>)<br>
and realized that it was something I had been thinking about for a while.<b=
r>
I was surprised that the included script (text-vimcolor) didn&#39;t have a<=
br>
terminal output format.<br>
I whipped up a vimcat script that does it in about 4 lines of code<br>
(plus a few extra lines for a hash translation and some use statements).<br=
>
<br>
I could release a separate App::vimcat dist,<br>
but it seems like a terminal output format would be a good addition to<br>
the main module.<br>
However when I saw that it was last updated in 2006 and the bugs on RT<br>
were years old as well,<br>
I thought perhaps email was the best chance to reach you.<br>
<br>
Would you accept a patch for adding Term::ASNIColor output as a<br>
Text::VimColor option?<br>
I see that you haven&#39;t released on CPAN in many years...<br>
If you&#39;re no longer interested in maintaining it would you be willing t=
o<br>
make me a co-maintainer so I may release a new version?<br>
I would be willing to work on the current bugs on CPAN RT as well.<br>
Or would you prefer that I release something separate?<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your time (and your work on Text::VimColor).<br>
