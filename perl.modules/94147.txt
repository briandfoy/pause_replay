Thanks for sharing your work with the world.

Rather than Stateful::Tailer, a better name for the module on CPAN might =
be File::Tail::Stateful, or something like that.
People would be more likely to come across your module when they search =
for =E2=80=9CFail::Tail=E2=80=9D on MetaCPAN, for example.
There are a number of modules already in the File::Tail:: namespace, but =
none in the Stateful namespace.=20

Before releasing anything to CPAN, you could also describe your module =
and proposed name on prepan.org <http://prepan.org/>, which is a place =
for discussing module ideas to get feedback before releasing them.

Cheers,
Neil
