The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class:Aggregate
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Base class aggregating several OO aspects
  userid:      CORLISS (Arthur Corliss)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    mailinglists

  similar:
    Class::Accessor, Class::Container, POE, etc.

  rationale:

    Okay, this is the last time I'm going to bother you with this
    request, I just haven't heard a response to my last rationale(s).

    I'm choosing the name Class::Aggregate since this module aggregates
    three class aspects, in contrast to most of the Class::* modules,
    which concentrate on specific traits. This module provides
    facilities for property accessors, containers, and rudimentary
    events.

    The reason why this exists as a separate module/code base is that
    it chooses a different method of implementation than the existing
    modules, and its feature focus is also different as well.

    Syntactically, this module is meant to be used strictly as an
    ancestor of a custom subclass. Properties are defined as an array of
    write and read accessor method references, or a single unifed
    accessor method (a generic accessor that can serve in any of these
    capacities is provided as part of the class). The container property
    is implemented with a focus on controlled destruction of contained
    objects, rather than on a consistent interface.

    The event system is based on psuedo boolean properties combined
    into a state flag register. All accesses/modifications of a flag can
    trigger execution of an optional associated event handler. This
    system is much smaller and simpler to implement than POE, and,
    accordingly, the dependencies are much smaller (read: nothing
    outside of core Perl), as are the capabilities (using POE for what
    this class intends is much akin to using a twenty pound sledge where
    I only need a sixteen ounce ballpeen).

    For these reasons, I hope to persuade you that this module deserves
    a place on CPAN. Adding it to CPAN would also increase my code
    reuse, since my other OO CPAN modules will be making use of this
    code in the near future, and I'm hoping I won't have to include this
    module within the namespace of each of those modules.
