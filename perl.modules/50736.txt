Subject: Module submission Net::WSF

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::WSF
  DSLIP:       cdcfo
  description: Web Services Framework ID-WSF 2.0, 1.1, etc.
  userid:      SAMPO (Sampo Kellomaki)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::SAML

  rationale:

    Net::SAML provides SSO and Assertion support, the latter being
    fundamental Identity Management building block. Net::WSF complements
    Net::SAML by providing several Web Services frameworks, such as
    Liberty Alliance ID-WSF 2.0 and 1.1. Support for WS-Trust is likely,
    too. The framework can also be used to implement Web Services in
    nonidentity mode.

    Some anticipated subnamespaces

    Net::WSF::WSC Net::WSF::WSP Net::WSF::Discovery

    This effort is part of zxid.org and has fairly large scope, ranging
    all sorts of IdM modules.

    --Sampo

  enteredby:   SAMPO (Sampo Kellomaki)
  enteredon:   Wed Sep  6 02:52:05 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::WSF             cdcfo Web Services Framework ID-WSF 2.0, 1.1, etc. SAMPO
