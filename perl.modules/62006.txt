The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::PWP
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: An OO interface to Wikipedia and MediaWiki.
  userid:      DCOLLINS (Dan Collins)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Public SVN at google code, chatrooms related to Wikipedia, Wikipedia
    itself

  similar:
    MediaWiki MediaWiki::API CMS::MediaWiki WWW::Wikipedia

  rationale:

    MediaWiki::API is used as a dependency here because it is not
    sufficiently refined for direct use. MediaWiki was developed
    independently of this module and the interfaces are rather
    different. CMS::MediaWiki is not nearly as useful as this module, as
    it is only able to read and edit, not read categories, block,
    delete, etc. WWW::Wikipedia does not appear to have any ability to
    edit at all.

    This module has been developed independently of CPAN for at least
    18 months (based on a search of my email archives) as
    Perlwikipedia.pm. I took over maintenance from the original dev last
    december. My rationale for me making this request instead of one of
    the other devs is that svn blame says I have the majority of the
    code of the main module. My rationale for the namespace of WWW::PWP
    is that WWW::Wikipedia is also in the WWW namespace. The MediaWiki::
    namespace seems to be too specific, and would make this module too
    easily considered to be 'part of' MediaWiki and MediaWiki::API.

    I have not uploaded it yet pending approval of the "WWW::PWP"
    namespace, as I will need to rename the module and modify the tests,
    readme, etc.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::PWP             RdpOg An OO interface to Wikipedia and MediaWiki.  DCOLLINS
