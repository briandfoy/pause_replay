I have recently registered three name spaces. I *did* get the mail 
acknowledging that I had entered the requests, but I had no acknowledgments 
that the name spaces were reserved, nor that they were rejected.

My *problem* is that they still do not show up when I want to 'Edit module 
metadata', wich effectively locks me out from maintaining the modules. I 
guess I've done something wrong.

These modules are missing (Registration date, Msg. id)

Net::EMI::Common                  (Sat, 15 Feb 2003 20:29:06 +0100, 
msg00324)
SWIFT::Factory::Tag::Tag15        (Sat, 15 Feb 2003 12:43:27 +0100, 
msg00316)
SWIFT::Factory::ApplicationHeader (Sat, 15 Feb 2003 08:05:41 +0100, 
msg00312)

I *do* have four other modules showing up, it's just these three that are 
missing.

I can find back all my registration requests when I search for all my 
messages. (I searched for "schaffter" at 
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/ )

I cannot find back any "New module..." messages for these three modules.

Could someone please help me understand what I did wrong and what I need to 
rectify?

Best regards
Gustav SCHAFFTER
