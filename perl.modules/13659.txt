I would like to propose the creation of a new top-level category in CPAN for AIX specific modules. I am aware that the creation of new top-level categories is considered taboo. However, in my opinion it should be done, for consistency. BSD, BeOS, Linux, Solaris, etc. all have their own top-level catagory. And, there are already modules in CPAN that use this namespace (only one of which is my own). Given this, someone looking for AIX modules would naturally expect to find them under AIX.

This is that least the second time that I've made this request. I've received no response from anyone. A response is greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Chuck Ritter
