Subject: Module submission Parallel::Queue

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parallel::Queue
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Fork a queue N-way parallel
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parallel::Simple, Parallel::Forker, Parallel::ForkManager

  rationale:

    This runs a queue of subrefs (normally closures) N-way parallel via
    forks, returning the failed and incomplete jobs if any exit
    non-zero. Main difference with the others is that this interface is
    simpler (an integer and array of coderefs) and it returns the
    unfinished jobs in case the error can be handled by the caller
    (others just fail and leave completion bookkeeping to the caller).

    The module is also amenable to threads (work in progress) which
    none of the other modules seem interested in supporting.

  enteredby:   LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar  8 16:53:19 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Parallel::
::Queue           Rdpfp Fork a queue N-way parallel                  LEMBARK
