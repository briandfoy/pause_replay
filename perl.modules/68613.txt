The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cicero
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Signatia, Impatientio, Supurbia
  userid:      FRIEDO (Mike Friedman)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Pre-release announcements to be made on Perl Monks and the CGI-App
    and Moose lists in the coming weeks

  similar:
    None known

  rationale:

    Cicero is community forum web application based on
    CGI::Application, Moose, Template Toolkit, and DBIx::Class,
    distributed as a self-contained FastCGI application via PAR::Packer.

    The Cicero namespace will be used to house the main Cicero
    distribution, which provides the basic application framework, and
    numerous Cicero::Plugin::* modules, which provide the bulk of the
    system's functionality. There are currently seven plugin modules in
    active development with more planned. Cicero's web interface will be
    able to download and install plugins directly from CPAN.

    Other sub-namespaces may include:

    Cicero::DB (for alternative database engines; currently only MySQL
    is supported. The plans here are still fuzzy.)

    Cicero::Theme (for alternative template and CSS sets.)

    The project will be hosted on Google Code once it is open-sourced
    (any day now.)

  enteredby:   FRIEDO (Mike Friedman)
  enteredon:   Thu Nov 19 18:05:01 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Cicero            adpOp Signatia, Impatientio, Supurbia              FRIEDO
