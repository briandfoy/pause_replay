Hi modules@perl.org,

both for this and the related DBIx::MyParsePP, there hasn't been any 
reaction in the past two weeks. Does anybody disapprove?

I was going to suggest DBIx::MySQLParser or something along those lines 
(including "MySQL" in the module name), but then I saw that the same 
author already has DBIx::MyServer registered which is a "Server-side 
implementation of the MySQL network protocol". So I figure we could just 
approve the two parser namespaces as they stand.

What do you think?

Best regards,
Steffen
