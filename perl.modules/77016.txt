Hi People,

I make a big mistake !

I upload a source code of my work to cpan !

I try to delete the file in pause, but I don't find the better way to do that. I'm afraid because search.cpan.org doesnt index the file, but metacpan do that now. How can I fix that ?

Please, help me with this problem, it's very urgent, sorry.... 

Many thanks!
