The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::GenToc
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: generate table of contents for HTML docs
  userid:      RUBYKAT (Kathryn Andersen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    mailing lists

  similar:
    HTML::Toc

  rationale:

    I created HTML::GenToc to implement (and expand on) the
    functionality of Earl Hood's "htmltoc" script, and thus it has
    somewhat different features to the existing HTML::Toc module -- more
    flexible in some respects, and less flexible in others. Since it
    uses AppConfig as a base, it's easier to use for scripts, and since
    it (deliberately) uses HTML::SimpleParse instead of HTML::Parse as
    its parser, it's suitable for use on pseudo-HTML code (such as WML
    source, which is what I use it on myself). "GenToc" just stands for
    "Generate Table-Of-Contents" but if you can think of a better name
    for it so as not to confuse it with HTML::Toc, please do.

    (It is b for beta, because in the time since I applied for PAUSE
    membership, I have written it and put it on my web page, with the
    caveat that its name might change)

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::GenToc          bdpOg generate table of contents for HTML docs     RUBYKAT
