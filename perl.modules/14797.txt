hence the Reply-to: header. 

if modules@perl.org mail shows up in my mail, i usually file it for
later, and never see it again.  if i read it through the NNTP interface,
i'm reading it because i'm ready to take care of whatever i run into.
i have also found that when people emailed me, they did not include
modules@perl.org, so i became a single point of failure for some 
things.  if i missed their message in the many emails i get each day,
things didn't get done because no one realized the original poster
had addressed whatever concerns i raised.

it's just a way that i've found that works for me. :)
