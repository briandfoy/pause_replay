The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::FileUtil
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: File Spec, Test Directories, Module Loading
  userid:      SOFTDIA (Samson Monaco Tutankhamen)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    semi-private email

  similar:
    File::Spec

  rationale:

    File::Spec methods assume using the site operating system file
    spec. For initial distribution of tests and files, the file spec may
    (very likely) be from a outside OS. Many of these utilities use the
    File::Spec sub modules to convert incoming or outgoing File
    Specifications to that of other OS. Other routines handle portable
    issues as smart nl (as noted by Mr. Maischein, build-in Perl 5.6 and
    above) and test script t directory tree.

    These methods were in the proposed Test::TestUtil module. This
    registration request official withdraws the request to register
    module Test::TestUtil which is being broken up into modules with
    hopefully more descriptive name.

    This is an attempt to response favorably to Mr. Maischein request:

    that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of"Test::TestUtil"
    respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is descriptive of what
    the routines actually do or what the module implements.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::FileUtil        RdpOb File Spec, Test Directories, Module Loading  SOFTDIA
