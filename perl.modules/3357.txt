Dear ModulesMeisters,

I sent this message, requesting CPAN-author registration, just over
eight weeks ago, and I've not yet had a response.  The registration
instructions at http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#registering
say to allow a maximum of three weeks, and that one week is typical,
so I'm re-sending this.
