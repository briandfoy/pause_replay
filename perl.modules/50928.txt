Dear modules@cpan people,

I work at the Servicio Autonomo de Propiedad Intelectual, the Venezuelan
Patents and Intellectual Property Office. Since 2004 we've been using
open technologies in our organization. One of the stages of our
migration process is to use powerful, open and versatile programming
tools and techniques. Therefore we've been considering to use WebGUI in
a development stage in order to substitute our current PHP-based Web
Portal Applications.

We require to install and use DateTime::Cron::Simple, a CPAN module, in
order to deploy and test several applications. However, we're concerned
about the usage of a copyrighted-yet-unlicensed package such as the
aforementioned. Furthermore, this could be part of a show-stopper for us
since we're not only promoting the usage of open technologies but also
we're promoting participation in a free knowledge environment which is
lawful and respectful of the intellectual property rights.

We are fully aware, also, that the Modules group is not guilty of this
undesirable situation [1], however we would like to see
DateTime::Cron::Simple as a licensed module in the archive.

Thank you very much for your time and work,
Jose
