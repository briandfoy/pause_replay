That took longer than I thought it would. My conclusion after =
summarizing the change log is that it probably really ought to go on =
CPAN. But I give it only a 40% chance of surviving first pass against =
CPAN testers without issues to be addressed.

I belive I can upload a devel version without any special privs, right? =
I'd like to do so soon just to see how it looks after a week of testing. =
Any objections?
