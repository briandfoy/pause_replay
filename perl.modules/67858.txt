I think there are problems with the license. Specifically

BY SELECTING BELOW "YES I AGREE TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS", YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY
THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT, THAT YOU
ARE DULY AUTHORIZED TO DO SO AND THAT YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT YOUR
COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS:

1. You are not a citizen, national or resident of, or under the
control of the government of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
Sudan, Syria, Yugoslavia or any other country to which the United
States has prohibited export.

2. You will not export or re-export the Programs, directly or
indirectly, to the above mentioned countries nor to citizens, natonals
or residents of those countries

CPAN does not control you runs mirrors or who can download from any  
mirror
so there is potential for this code to be exported to any of the  
mentioned
countries.

> Do we have specific guidelines on this anywhere?

I do not think there is anything specifically written down anywhere.
