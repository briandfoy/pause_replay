Hi,

Quite a few years ago I got the CPAN id 'climber' created for something =
I never got round to uploading.

I now have something completely different I figured I try and put on =
CPAN instead so just tried to log in to my old account, but obviously I =
have no idea what the password I used was.

To make matters worse, I no longer have the mail address =
chris@ifdef.org, and can not get access to it.

Can you help?

Chris=
