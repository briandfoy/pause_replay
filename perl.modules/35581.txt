Hi Brian,

well .. I just changed the name to IOToolkit as for some feedback 
to the prior version called "logme" ...

Most logging modules are ment to help developers to debug their 
code. So you can Dump variables and get some more information 
about where your code fails.

My module is not a perl masterpiece. It is just a quick and easy 
replacement for "print" in your modules and it creates useful 
logfiles for human readers. I had a look on a couple of other 
modules and none of them were as easy-to-use as mine. For this 
purpose I feel, that my module is best :o)

Cheers,
Markus
