Subject: Module submission DBD::Chart
To: modules@perl.org, darnold@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@p11.speed-link.de ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBD::Chart
  DSLIP:       bdpha
  description: DBI driver to render graphs via SQL
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    dbi-users@perl.org, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    GD::Graph, DBD::Chart under DBI tree

  rationale:

    DBD::Chart already exists under the Database Interfaces DBD
    category, but several people have asked that it be listed under the
    Graphics tree, as it is really a charting/graphing module that
    happens to use DBI as its interface. Is it possible to have the same
    module mapped to multiple categories, or should I simply upload a
    README to the Graphics category pointing to the DBD tree ?

  enteredon:   Tue Jan  8 22:58:29 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBD::
::Chart           bdpha DBI driver to render graphs via SQL          DARNOLD
