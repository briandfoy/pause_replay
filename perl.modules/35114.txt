The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Solar::VSO
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Virtual Solar Observatory interfaces
  userid:      ONEIROS (Joe Hourcle)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    mailing lists (see virtualsolar.org for contact info), LWS and
    AAS/SPD meetings

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm working on a series of modules for the Virtual Solar
    Observatory project, so that there's an object-oriented perl
    interface for people to search the archives, and an inheritable to
    cut down the amount of work to add a new data provider to the
    project.

    I would like to place the modules into the namespace:

    Solar::VSO

    For those who might suggest 'Astro::VSO' -- astronomy and solar
    physics have significant differences in scope, and as a result,
    differing taxonomy and ontology; therefore, tools written for one
    field are rarely useful for the other, so it is preferable to
    maintain a level of seperation.

    [And solar physicists seem to have problems being classified with
    general astronomers, otherwise I'd have suggested Astro::Solar::VSO]

    Other modules that might fit into the Solar::* namespace include
    those that provide access to solar catalogs, related data
    transformations, or that interact with other related projects (such
    as EGSO or CoSEC).

The resulting entry would be:

Solar::
::VSO             adpOp Virtual Solar Observatory interfaces         ONEIROS
