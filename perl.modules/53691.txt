No.  Texinfo (http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) is a highly 
specialized dialect of TeX, and barely looks like TeX at all.  It bears 
no relation to LaTeX.  I think putting it in the TeX namespace would 
only confuse people.  Texinfo::Menus is not useful with ordinary TeX or 
LaTeX documents.

I'd accept TeX::Texinfo::Menus, but I don't see that the 3-level name 
adds any benefit.  I think people generally think of Texinfo as a 
language in itself rather than as a form of TeX.

Sorry I didn't respond earlier, but you didn't CC me, and I'm not 
subscribed to the list.  I just noticed your message.
