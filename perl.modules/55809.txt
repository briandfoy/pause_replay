The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bricklayer::Templater
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Simple, Flexible, Configurable Templating
  userid:      ZAPHAR (Jeremy Wall)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Bricklayer embodies the philosophy behind the templating engine.
    The engine is based on tags which form the building blocks of the
    engine. It also is the namespace for my forming application
    framework. Similar to the way Catalyst is the base namespace for the
    Catalyst framework. I would appreciate the opportunity to reserve
    this namespace for that purpose. It won't clash with any current
    namespaces as far as I can tell.

  enteredon:   Mon Aug 13 01:44:21 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bricklayer::
::Templater       RdpOa Simple, Flexible, Configurable Templating    ZAPHAR
