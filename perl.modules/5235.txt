The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fork::Queue
  DSLI:        bmpf
  description: limits number of concurrent forked processes
  userid:      SALVA (Salvador Fandiño García)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parallel::ForkManager

  rationale:

    This module enqueue processes so the name should have something to
    do with queues, and looking at CPAN it shows that there are several
    modules named <something>::Queue (Thread::Queue, VMS::Queue,
    MQSeries::Queue, etc.). The queued "objects" are processes, but I
    also want to show that the module is constructed around the fork
    (and related) function calls so I get with Fork::Queue.

    The uniqueness of this module is that it overloads fork, wait,
    waitpid, etc, function calls so that you can continue to use them as
    usual and the module will take care of not running too much
    processes at the same time. And already wrote scripts can be easily
    adapted, just including the module at the beginning.

The resulting entry would be:

Fork::
::Queue           bmpf limits number of concurrent forked processes SALVA
