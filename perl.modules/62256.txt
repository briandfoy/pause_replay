Greetings All--

For many years now I've nominally been the maintainer of the
Text::ParseWords module in the mainline Perl distribution.  But the
reality is that I haven't been paying attention to that code for a
long, long time.

Alexandr Ciornii (alexchorny@gmail.com, CPAN ID CHORNY) recently
contacted me and expressed interest in becoming the package maintainer.
Since he's already a member of the community and motivated to keep
the package up-to-date, I see no reason not to transfer maintenance
responsibilities to him.  Please consider this my official request
to transfer maintenance duties to him.

Thanks for your time and attention in this matter.  If you have any
questions, feel free to contact me at the email address below.

Cheers!
