     why:

    I want to upload a module that makes it easier to deal with IP
    addresses. Net::IPAddress does not appear to have IPv6 support, and
    seems limited in its allowed input and output formats.

    Please see http://code.google.com/p/perl-ipaddress-simple/ for the
    current work in progress, which will be more fully documented before
    uploading to CPAN.
