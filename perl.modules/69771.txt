     why:

    I wrote some Perl modules over the past few years and have ever
    since considered to release them as free software.

    After putting much time and effort into the development of the
    modules they are now as good as finished and I want to contribute
    them to CPAN in the hope that they will be useful to others too.

    Thank you.
