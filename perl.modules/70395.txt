Hi Brian and all,

thanks for the feedback.

First, you have a full documentation of this module here : http://search.cp=
an.org/~evi/User-AccountChecker-0.01/lib/User/AccountChecker.pm

This module is dedicated for Nix developers who want to check who is runnin=
g a script.
It checks system user accounts.
It's useful for shell scripting, for example, if you want a script to be ru=
nned as root or just by a specific user.

I hope that's help.

I'm new to perl and it's my first module, so any contributions and comments=
 are welcome.

best regards

Eric

That seems pretty vague. What sort of user accounts does it work with
and what sort of person would use this module? What would they use it
for?
