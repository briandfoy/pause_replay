Hello!

Tried to contact by e-mail (Gabor Egressy <gabor [AT] vmunix.com>) twice 
from 2006-10-22. Also tried to contact Matt Sanford.

This module has hanging bugs/patches in RT 3 years old. Is used by 6 
other modules. Version that is installing is from 1998.
I'm planning to do dist cleaning, resolve RT queue.
