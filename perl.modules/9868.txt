Hello,
	I am coding a suite of modules for parsing and manipulating various Unix system configuration
files. I had in an earlier mail asked for advice on the name to use. I had stated my
preference for the 'Nix' toplevel namespace, as I already have these modules in various state
of readiness with that name.
	Nix::Bind8
	Nix::Sendmail8
	Nix::Aliases
	Nix::PasswdGroup
However after browsing the archives, and having ascertained the general dislike for using up
toplevel names, I would like your advice on whether Unix::Conf would be more appropriate. It
also seems to be more reflective of what the suite of modules does.

Regards
Karthik Krishnamurthy
