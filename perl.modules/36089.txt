The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::ScheduledPath
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Find for scheduled paths in a directed graph
  userid:      RRWO (Robert Rothenberg)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    module-authors list, TBD

  similar:
    Unknown

  rationale:

    This module takes a directed graph where edges between vertices
    have start/end times and generates a list of possible paths from one
    vertex to another, using the schedule information.

    A non-theory description is that you can feed the module a list of
    bus or train stops and it will tell you how to get from point A to
    point B, including what transfers to take and which buses or trains.

    Algorithm::* seems to be the best namespace. Graph::* is not a good
    namespace because it implies something related to generating or
    processing graphics.

    I'm unsure of the technical theory terminology used to properly
    describe this algorithm. "ScheduledPath" seems appropriate, since it
    deals with paths in a directed graph.

    There is no DirectedGraph::* namespace, and
    Algorithm::DirectedGraph::Scheduled is too long.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
::ScheduledPath   cdpOp Find for scheduled paths in a directed graph RRWO
