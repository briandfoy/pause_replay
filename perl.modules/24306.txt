Howdy all,
    Having recently switched my X11 window manager from Enlightenment to
Sawfish, I looked for a perl module to let me control Sawfish from perl.  With
Enlightenment I've used the Eesh module, and in the far distant past I have
used the X11::Fvwm module, so I assumed that somebody would have published
something similar for Sawfish.  Since I was unable to find it, I cobbled one
together on my own, and would now like to share.

What I've called it so far has been X11::WM::Sawfish (which is a base class
for X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX and X11::WM::Sawfish::XProp, since there are
two ways to communicate with Sawfish).  Is this an appropriate namespace to
stake out?  The Eesh module doesn't seem to be in the module list, but it
uses a top level namespace, and the Fvwm module is just right under X11, which
I think might be a little too general.  I was hoping to blaze the path that
would encourage others to put modules relating to X11 window managers together
in X11:WM.  Is this overly presumptuous of me?  If not, should the "WM" be
expanded to "WindowManager"?

Please let me know if you have any comments.  If not, I'll attempt to register
the X11::WM::Sawfish namespace tomorrow.

 Thanks,
  -Craig
