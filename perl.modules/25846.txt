The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VirtualFS::ISO9660
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Emulates loop-mounted ISO image
  userid:      STEVIEO (Stephen Oberholtzer)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    comp.lang.misc.perl

  similar:
    FileSys::SmbClient

  rationale:

    VirtualFS::ISO9660 serves a (seemingly simple) purpose:

    Give it an .ISO file, and it creates an object that lets you do
    things like this:

    $o = new VirtualFS::ISO9660 ('cdimage.iso'); $o->opendir($dirh,
    '/'); print "listing root directory:\n"; print "$_\n" for
    $dirh->readdir();

    print "here is the translation table file:\n"; $o->open($fh, '<',
    '/TRANS.TBL'); print "$_\n" while <$fh>;

    I initially searched CPAN looking for any sort of functionality
    similar to this, and found nothing. I proposed this namespace on
    comp.lang.misc.perl, and there were a couple of suggestions for
    alternate root namespaces. One person suggested CD:: so there might
    be CD::Audio, CD::Joliet, etc. Another person suggested FileSys::.

    I chose the root namespace VirtualFS:: because it forges a
    filesystem (much like the Linux VFS) entirely in userspace. I
    decided against a root namespace relating to the medium type (e.g.
    CD::) because the underlying concept doesn't require any particular
    medium. For example, someone could produce VirtualFS::Ext2, or
    VirtualFS::Reiser, or VirtualFS::Minix, or some such thing if they
    wanted to. One might even be able to pull off a VirtualFS::HTTP or a
    VirtualFS::FTP.

    The FileSys:: suggestion made slightly more sense, so I ran a CPAN
    search for FileSys. One response that came back was
    FileSys::SmbClient, which does fit into my VirtualFS concept.
    However, FileSys::SmbClient actually seems out-of-place; while it
    emulates a filesystem, all the other FileSys:: modules actually
    concern metadata about a filesystem, not emulation of one. For
    example, FileSys::DiskFree, FileSys::DiskSpace, and FileSys::Df
    report filesystem freespace; FileSys::CygwinPaths does magic for the
    virtual paths (like /bin) that Cygwin has; FileSys::Ext2 is a
    chattr() wrapper; and FileSys::SmbClientParser is even further
    separated; it's just a Perl wrapper for an application (smbclient).

    Since, to me, overloading the meaning of a namespace isn't any
    better than using two different namespaces for the same concept, I
    decided it would probably be best to establish a new root namespace
    that other authors could use for faked filesystems.

    Is my reasoning acceptable?

The resulting entry would be:

VirtualFS::
