Subject: Module submission Apache::SiteControl

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::SiteControl
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Fine grained web app access control
  userid:      AWKAY (Anthony W. Kay)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Apache::AuthCookie Apache::Session

  rationale:

    This is an object-oriented extension of Apache::AuthCookie which
    also uses Apache::Session for information storage. It is primarily
    an expanded interface that allows for fine-grained control over web
    applications down to a page-segment level (i.e. same page,
    potentially different views for each user). For example, admin users
    might see controls, where regular users just see data.

    I did not put it under AuthCookie, because it is not just a strict
    extension of AuthCookie...only one of my "classes" is actually a
    subclass of AuthCookie, so AuthCookie is more a utility than the
    visible programmatic interface.

    The module is only really written to be useful with Apache, so I
    feel that putting it under the Apache namespace is appropriate.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::SiteControl     adpOg Fine grained web app access control          AWKAY
