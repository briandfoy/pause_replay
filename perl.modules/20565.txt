Sure. The "real" revision of the file is still different,
I only changed what the module reports to be its $VERSION.

OTOH, I think it's pretty legal that the revision for a
single file (C.pm) changes backwards (in case you decide
to go back to an older revision because some feature didn't
work as expected), while the distro version increments
(because other files changed).

Mmmmh, I don't really like the idea of deleting the old distros.
(BTW, I didn't like the idea of changing the versioning either... ;)
In fact, I'd have to delete all C::B::C distros ranging from
0.04 up to 0.12, as they contain a C.pm with a version > 0.13.

Wouldn't the "better" solution be to delete 0.13, and upload
it again as, say, 0.40, leaving the other distros untouched?
