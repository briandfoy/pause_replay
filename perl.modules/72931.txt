Subject: Module submission IP::RangeCompare

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IP::RangeCompare
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Ipv4 Range comparison tool
  userid:      AKALINUX (Michael Shipper)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Perl Forums

  similar:
    Net::Netmask, NetAddr::IP

  rationale:

    IPv4 Range manipulation module. This module was written from the
    ground up to handle IP Ranges.

    The only modules on cpan that have similar functionality deal
    strictly with CIDR bit boundaries. The idea behind IP::RangeCompare,
    is to be able to actually deal with ip space in a more fluid nature.

    0.0.0.0 - 0.0.0.4 Is not garbage in garbage out

    Even though the range spans 2 cidr boundaries, the IP Space can
    still be manipulated without converting the range to 2 cidr blocks.

    Since human made lists of IP-Ranges don't normally fit on bit
    boundaries, this module fills the function IP-Range VOID, that is
    missing from cpan

    I previously released this Module as Net::IPRangeCompare but did
    not get the name space allocated. So I'm re-releasing the module as
    IP::RangeCompare.

    Please let me know if the name space seems out of place.

The resulting entry would be:

IP::
::RangeCompare    Rdphp Ipv4 Range comparison tool                   AKALINUX
