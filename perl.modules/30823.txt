      <h2>The ESL.net Interview With Jane Boris</h2>
      <p> <em>In this edition of ESL.net Interview, we talk with Easy Writer=
 developer=20
        Jane Boris.</em></p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><strong>What was the inspiration for the Easy Wri=
ter=20
        program? </strong><br>
        The inspiration for the Easy Writer program was my students&#8217; o=
wn=20
        writing, and the energy that they had invested in its creation. Orig=
inally,=20
        I knew I wanted to develop a software application for writing, but I=
 didn&#8217;t=20
        have a an idea or concept that really drove me, that would excite me=
 and,=20
        potentially, its users. Then somebody asked me, &#8220;What &#8220;w=
orks&#8221;=20
        in your classroom?&#8221; What immediately came to mind was the inte=
raction=20
        between students when, having spent days and even weeks starting fro=
m=20
        a simple idea or topic to a fully developed essay, they were excited=
ly=20
        working in small groups, each one sharing his completed essay with t=
he=20
        others in the group. Any classroom writing teacher (or any individua=
l=20
        who has ever taken a writing course) can tell you how the writing pr=
ocess=20
        bonds students together. So that focus, that shared moment of satisf=
action=20
        and learning, was my starting point, and my inspiration. </p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><strong>How long was the development cycle of the=
 first=20
        version? </strong><br>
        From the time I drew out my ideas on paper to the first time Easy Wr=
iter=20
        was commercially available was slightly over four years. During that=
 period=20
        of development, my own students were using it in the computer lab, a=
nd=20
        I used their experience and feedback to help me further develop it f=
or=20
        others. </p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><strong>What was the biggest challenge? </strong>=
<br>
        There were different challenges at different stages of the software&=
#8217;s=20
        development. Given that before I committed to this project I had kno=
wn=20
        next to nothing about computers and even less about computer program=
ming,=20
        clearly the first big challenge was learning how to tell the compute=
r=20
        what to do. I would read a computer programming book and have no ide=
a=20
        what it was saying. That, in turn, brought the challenge of continui=
ng=20
        to problem-solve in the midst of great frustration. The upside of th=
is,=20
        though, was that it reminded me of the frustration felt by a person =
learning=20
        a new language &#8211; he knows that he has something to say, and he=
 knows=20
        what he wants to say, but he doesn&#8217;t know how to say it. In th=
ese=20
        moments of near despair, I used that feeling to help me develop a de=
eper=20
        appreciation for and sensitivity to the challenges our students face=
 in=20
        learning to communicate in a new language, and to help me to think o=
f=20
        ways to understand and simplify their task. The satisfaction when so=
mething=20
        actually worked the way I wanted it to would be the reward.</p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><strong>What academic model was this software bas=
ed on?</strong><br>
        The model of teaching that Easy Writer comes closest to is the Fluen=
cy=20
        First model. In Fluency First, the teacher identifies what grammatic=
al=20
        structure(s) the student needs help with, and prepares a lesson base=
d=20
        on that structure. You&#8217;ll notice that in Easy Writer, when a s=
tudent=20
        is working on an essay and wants additional help with a particular s=
tructure,=20
        he goes to the Grammar Help! page, clicks the error he is troubled b=
y,=20
        and receives a grammar lesson about that point, as if a teacher were=
 there=20
        to answer his question. When he wants, he can return to the essay he=
 was=20
        working on and continue from there. I like this model because it per=
sonalizes=20
        the teaching and the learning experience.</p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><strong>How is the companion book progressing? </=
strong><br>
        Currently, the cover is being designed, and then the book will be av=
ailable.=20
        Originally conceived as a companion workbook to the software, the Gr=
ammar=20
        Help! Student Handbook has happily developed into much more than tha=
t.=20
        It is, of course, a companion to the software. But one good thing le=
ads=20
        to another, and it will also be a wonderful student handbook and ref=
erence=20
        book in its own right, with grammar lessons and editing and writing =
exercises=20
        that can be used alone - without the software. Like Easy Writer, all=
 the=20
        sentences and paragraphs used as examples and in the exercises come =
from=20
        students&#8217; writing &#8211; mostly ESL but also native English-s=
peaking=20
        students requiring remediation. Like the software, there are numerou=
s=20
        skills covered - grammar, editing, writing, reading - and much to ke=
ep=20
        the student&#8217;s attention and involvement. </p>
      <p align=3D"justify"><strong>How often are new versions released?</str=
ong><br>
        Easy Writer is an ever-evolving work. Whenever we make an improvemen=
t=20
        to the software, the very next customer gets the benefit of that imp=
rovement.=20
        We do this because our primary interest is the user, the student. Ou=
r=20
        last major version, 3.0, was released in July 2002; it was the XP-co=
mpatible=20
        version and incorporated many new features and additions as well. We=
