of the system.</div><div><br></div><div>I propose to use the name 'Ginger' =
as the new root namespace to use. There is still a core component to it, bu=
t that is one piece of it, and is actually a core to it. The other componen=

a branding name is to be chosen, I would like it to be something somewhat u=
nique that does not coincide with other popular technology components or co=

stinct and unusual enough that it will not lead people to think of it as an=
ything other than what it is.</div><div><br></div><div>As for why I would c=
