I think those namespaces have the same problems as HTTP. The CGI bits
are below the application layer and don't really have anything to do
with what you are doing. Not only that, you don't even really need CGI
to do what you're doing. What if someone wanted to use mod_perl
instead?

I don't have a better name for you at the moment. Maybe one of the
other admins might be able to suggest something for use in web
applications at that level.
