I wrote a module called Text::Flowed that I would like to contribute.
It provides functions that deals with formatting data with
Content-Type 'text/plain; format=flowed' as described in RFC2646
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2646.txt). In a nutshell,
format=flowed text solves the problem in plain text files where it is
not known which lines can be considered a logical paragraph, and thus
flowed (wrapped and joined) as appropriate when displaying.
