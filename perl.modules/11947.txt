 Hi!
 I am Tsirkin Evgeny from jct(jerusalem college of technology).
 tsurkin@mail.jct.ac.il
 http://sukka.jct.ac.il/~tsurkin - the homepage currently under constr.
 The TSIRKIN is the best uid i can imagine
 
 Now to the bisuness:
 There two modues i am planning to upload 
 [1] A little module for perl/Tk which creates a NoteBook like 
 Frame .With another appiarence & some extra features.
 
 [2] A module for creating little biological databases.
 It's main function is to download DNA sequence data from NCBI site
 & parce .
 It does not replace the bioperl project,but it planned to be 
 usefull for anyone who does not want to learn all the bioperl
 details,just to download all the data he needs ,parce it,save 
 averything he needs in his own format.
 *It is independant & not connected/relaying on bioperl modules! *
 
 I also need advise for a name space: for the Tk module it would be 
 better to use Tk:: and for the second one Bio:: but those 
 are used for perl/Tk and bioperl.
 The Tk module also *have* to be named TK:: for proper work.
