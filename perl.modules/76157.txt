The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Spec
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: rSpec-like testing for Perl
  userid:      PHILIP (Philip Garrett)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    https://github.com/kingpong/perl-Test-Spec/

  similar:
    Test::Behaviour::Spec

  rationale:

    This module is an rSpec clone that includes Mocha-like support for
    mocks and stubs. The only other comparable module on CPAN is
    Test::Behaviour::Spec, which is not nearly as fully-featured and
    hasn't been updated in a couple of years.

  enteredby:   PHILIP (Philip Garrett)
  enteredon:   Thu May 19 20:31:10 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Spec            bdphp rSpec-like testing for Perl                  PHILIP
