From:Mrs Kate Adamu.



I greet you in the name of our Lord.I am a 43 years old hypertensive widow living presently in
Cotonou,Republique Du Benin. My late husband deposited the sum of $15.5m dollars in

a security company here in Cotonou which he WILLED to me and my children,but with a clause that before I can
have access to the funds I must formally present a manager/investor to whom the funds should be releaseed

to for onward investment purposes who will also manage  and invest the funds on my behalf.

I will furnish you with details upon your response.

Yours faithfully.

Kate Adamu(mrs)
