The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::Complete::Catalyst
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: installs all Catalyst modules
  userid:      SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I had registered, or at least I thought that I had registered the
    namespace before; however, it seems that it didn't go through. I'm
    resubmitting to correct the oversight.

  enteredby:   SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 22 13:43:18 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::Complete::
::Catalyst        adpnp installs all Catalyst modules                SKI
