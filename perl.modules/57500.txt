     why:

    I often write a variety of "infrastructure"/"platform" modules and
    various "utility" scripts.

    I frequently write Perl modules that follow the
    Publisher/Subscriber design pattern. I have also written a
    SingletonGenerator that can ber used to follow the Singleton design
    pattern.

    I would like to write and contribute versions of this Perl modules
    for a variety of reasons. Since I will contribute them on my own
    time and with my own dime (or with the consent of my current
    employer), I will be able to use these modules at future jobs
    without it having a negative legal consequences since they will be
    "from CPAN". This will also allow other Perl developers to use these
    modules. It will also give me source code to share with other Perl
    developers and get feedback.

    For the most part I am planning on contributing "PurePerl", meaning
    modules implemented in Perl without a C layer that is interfaced to
    Perl via XS.
