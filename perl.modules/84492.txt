Well whenever I look at jQuery::DataTables, I actually can't read anything, I don't know what language it's in but my browser can't seem to render any of it. However, I get the impression that my module is a lot more flexible. My module offers the ability to join multiple tables for the output (which isn't typically seen in any of the sample jQuery DataTables scripts on the jQuery DataTables website). Also, our modules our different in that It seems for jQuery::DataTables the user has to actually write the SQL query themselves, where as with my module you just specify which tables and columns you want. Either of these could be seen as a benefit or a negative depending on the user, so with perl's philosophy of "There's more than one way to do it", I think both modules would have a place on CPAN :)

Also, my module offers some other features the jQuery::DataTables module doesn't, like helping to format the output of certain columns with patterns, etc. Also, my module takes care of dealing with the jQuery DataTables options that the user chooses client side by taking those options and working them into the query (which can be a pretty messy process) and as I said before, it seems like you almost have to write at least part of the query yourself with the jQuery::DataTables module.
