G'day modules@perl.org,

As you may know, I've been doing a lot of work on autodie recently, which is 
a lexical version of Fatal.  It's working incredibly well, and while I've 
been uploading developer releases to the CPAN, I'm getting very close to the 
point where I'm going to declare it stable.

Now, autodie integrates itself into Fatal for the heavy lifting, and to make 
sure the two modules can interact sanely with each other.  So whenever I've 
been uploading my dev releases to the CPAN, I've been uploading my new 
Fatal.pm with them.  But Fatal is a core module.

This means CPAN shows the colourful "unauthorized release" message next to 
Fatal.pm in the dist view:

	http://search.cpan.org/dist/autodie

That's fine for the dev releases, but not so fine once things go stable. 
What's the procedure for making such releases authorized?  Do I need to get 
a signed note from a pumpking?

Cheerio,

	Paul
