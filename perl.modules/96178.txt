For simplicity's sake, I hereby repeat the body text of my initial email to
the PAUSE admins, which I sent shortly before I contacted Peter and initially
suggested it would be nice if he talked to us before doing anything drastic.

Subject: We may have a slight issue wrt ribasushi and DBIx::Class

When I originally transferred the first-come perms for DBIx::Class to
ribasushi, it was apropos of this discussion:

--- Log opened Thu Jun 10 14:31:36 2010
14:31 <ribasushi> idea:
14:32 <ribasushi> transfer dbic namespace ownership to me (please 
not half of cpan) - then I can grant out more pause perms and have 
rotational uploading
14:32 <ribasushi> currently just me and frew can do it
14:33 <ribasushi> also let me know when you're back fsvo back, so 
I can shape some of the "to be braindumped" things I wrote for 
later on gpw

18:06 <mst> hey
18:06 <ribasushi> yo
18:07 <mst> just waiting for pause
18:07 <mst> yeah, might as well give you the maint bits
18:07 <mst> I can always give myself them back if I ever need them 
;)
18:07 <ribasushi> precisely

which I believe was pretty unambiguously an administrative transfer to make
it easier for him to give out co-maint, rather than a transfer of authority.

However, his most recent email to the DBIC list, which can be read at:

http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/dbix-class/2016-September/012187.html

says:

> I have also firmly selected who will be getting the DBIx::Class 
> namespace first-come[2], the transfer of which will also happen 
> somewhere around the end of September. It was a hard choice, but I am 
> convinced that it is the best thing to do as far as end-users are 
> concerned, at least in the short term.

and having asked around, none of frew, ilmari or castaway, who along with
myself and ribasushi have formed the DBIC steering cabal for quite some
time, have heard anything at all about this, and so we have no idea who he
thinks he's going to transfer the permissions to or why.

While I consider it very much an option of last resort, given the
administrative only nature of the original transfer, I believe that
PAUSE level intervention should he attempt to transfer primary rights to
the codebase out of the project is probably going to be the least worst
outcome in order to ensure the project can achieve continuity after his
final departure.

This email is basically to ensure that everybody's aware of the situation,
and my concerns, and the true status of DBIx::Class' PAUSE permissions; it
is obviously my hope that none of this is going to have to become relevant,
but I figured given the current situation the sooner I notified the rest of
you the better.

Also, *buggereth*, I really hope he's going to be ok :(
