I always send the message to the current maintainers. I can - of course =
- dig again, if others than the recognized are FIRSTCOME.
Re-Do these days ;)

The reason to instantly add modules@ is the ADOPTME page from Neil. This =
page if full of political power - and modules@ should know about that ^^

For sure :)
One instantly reacted - but I did the mailing also to point to the page =
(especially Neil lists my DBD::AnyData - but it's not free for adoption, =
I need help - now I flagged that correctly).

With adopting I would be FIRSTCOME - and in that case I can go and fix.
I'm never interested in being Co-Maint (I expect alias is still reading =
modules@ ^^) - sorry Adam, you're not reliable enough in your =
communication (neither me :P - but my people have my phone number in =
case of serious doubt).
