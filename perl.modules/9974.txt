The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DNAT
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: DNAT Layered Packet Switching Load Balancer
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Roughly based on the concept of F5's BIG-IP® Accelerator, it is
    intended to perform psuedo layered packet switching for incoming
    requests. This is mainly for developmental purposes or testing
    functionality for applications designed for the BIG-IP®; however,
    it is much slower in execution. It does not handle over 1000
    hits/sec very well, (like the BIG-IP® does), because it is actually
    implemented like a proxy server. But my module is less expensive
    (free).

    This module can also make it easy to combine the power and speed of
    mod_perl handlers with the security of suExec for many users on one
    machine. (This used to be extremely difficult to utilize
    simultaneously.)

    It is perfect for redirecting HTTP requests to different pools of
    machines behind a firewall based on its URL via Destination Network
    Address Translation. The original source IP Address and Port is
    retained so Apache logging and CGI programs will still execute
    accurately.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
