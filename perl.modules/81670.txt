Hi Neil and Ed,

I'd like to get COMAINT for Inline::Ruby (see https://metacpan.org/release/=
Inline-Ruby ) and you are
listed as its maintainers. This module has not seen a release since 2002 an=
d currently
all tests fail on most platforms:

http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/I/Inline-Ruby.html#Inline-Ruby-0.02

I'd like to fix that and fix more bugs as I encounter them. Can you give me=
 a
co-maintainer status?

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish=20
