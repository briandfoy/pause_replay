Hello Brian,

Thanks for the reply and suggestions. Yes, both ideas look a bit like 
frameworks isn't?
Perhaps you are right in making up a fancy name like those as RoseDB, 
Catalist end the like. It will take some time to have the packages on 
the CPAN, I have to get an account, follow the actions on Pause, in 
short follow the directions from the pause document. Furthermore the 
code is still beta, anyways 'the game is on foot' as they say.

Thanks and a happy new year,
Marcel Timmerman.
