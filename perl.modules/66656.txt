Subject: Module submission Bio::Mitomaster

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Mitomaster
  DSLIP:       inpOp
  description: Bio-Mitomaster
  userid:      MBRANDON (Marty Brandon)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'd like to rename Bio::SSA to Bio::Mitomaster. I had hoped to
    create a general framework for working with small DNA sequences (SSA
    = small seq. analysis), but have had to scale back to working with
    mitochondrial sequences. Mitomaster is the name of the online tool
    that I have implemented for DNA analysis and the software powering
    it will be bundled here.

    Sorry to request a name change, but the scope of the project I had
    initially planned is not realizable.

    Sincerely, Marty Brandon

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
::Mitomaster      inpOp Bio-Mitomaster                               MBRANDON
