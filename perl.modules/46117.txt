Andreas,

=46irst of all, thank you for your quick response to my request.

That said, given the extra time to think, I fully=20
agree with your comments, and support the idea of=20
the new experimental page being taken down as was=20
suggested on it; I will certainly not use it=20
myself.  Kind of ironic in a way.

Separately, I strongly encourage that it be put=20
forth in the official CPAN how-tos for modules=20
that anyone starting new modules who doesn't want=20
to use the multi-dot format at least use=20
triple-digits per magnitude as Perl itself does.=20
Eg, the official specs should suggest that new=20
modules have a version of 0.001, and not suggest=20
0.01.  This way, should they ever switch formats,=20
it will be a cleaner move.
