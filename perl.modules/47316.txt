The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       LWP::Authen::Negotiate
  DSLIP:       ampfp
  description: HTTP Negotiate Authentication Scheme for LWP
  userid:      AGROLMS (Achim Grolms)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://perlgssapi.sourceforge.net/

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module provides the HTTP Negotiate Authentication Scheme as
    described in
    http://www.kerberosprotocols.org/index.php/Draft-brezak-spnego-http-03.txt
    to LWP. (Means your LWP becomes able to do transparent SSO to
    Webservers supporting GSSAPI (like Microsoft IIS or Apache with
    mod_auth_kerb))

    Only "LWP::Authen::Negotiate"

    is the only possible module name because LWP looks at exacly this
    location for plugins when HTTP-Server supports "Negotiate" schema

    A first message related to this namespace was sent to
    libwww@perl.org on 28 Jul 2005 13:58:10 +0200

    <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.libwww/;msgid=42E8C852.903030
    3[at]it.su.se>

    but he never got an answer from the LWP people.

    My own implementation is discussed in
    <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.libwww/6467> from Sat, 3 Dec
    2005 00:47:19 +0100

    but I never got an answer from the LWP people.

    Because it depends to module GSSAPI and not all People have a
    proper GSSAPI setup it is not a good idea to bundle it with the LWP
    distribution.

    Bute when need GSSAPI Athentivation can be added to LWP by just
    installing this plugin.

    We were asked by many people (e.g. users of SOAP::Lite will use
    it). to bring that to CPAN.

    So my question is - what to do?

    Thank you, Achim Grolms
