Hi Andreas

Could you please transfer ownership of DBIx::Tree to me,
rsavage@cpan.org. I'll take over maintenance of it, since I'd like to
use it in (the unreleased) App::Office::CMS, and it needs bug fixing.

A month ago I emailed the authors/maintainers, and have had only 1
reply, from Honza (Mach Jan, Ing. <machj@ders.cz>), on 2010-08-16, who
said:

"Hi there,

It's up to you. We are using old version of this module and don't need
change it."
