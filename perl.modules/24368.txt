The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Linux::ForkController
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: OO Parallel Process Management
  userid:      BLHOTSKY (Brad Lhotsky)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Parallel::ForkManager

  rationale:

    I plan on utilizing information contained in the /proc filesystem
    to allow the module to mediate the child processes based on
    constraints which may affect over all system performance. The goal
    of the module is to have a smart parent process that can stop
    forking processes when the machine comes under heavy load, either
    from the children, or other external programs. Additionally, it
    encapsulates the child program in a sub routine, making code look a
    little cleaner, and slightly more maintainable. As of right now, the
    code I have can only control the start of processes, eventually, I'd
    like to extend the module to be able to control children currently
    running, perhaps enabling the parent process to suspend or terminate
    children based on the health of the system.

The resulting entry would be:

Linux::
::ForkController  cdpOp OO Parallel Process Management               BLHOTSKY
