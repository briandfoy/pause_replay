Dear PAUSE admins,

TOKUHIROM has given me (DOLMEN) co-maint permissions on App::cpanoutdated.
Proof: https://twitter.com/omengue/status/724946706912141312
But the distribution is named cpan-outdated and I don't have perms on the
cpan::outdated namespace. So my release DOLMEN/cpan-outdated-0.30.tar.gz
has been rejected by the indexer.
TOKUHIROM only has co-maint on cpan::outdated.

I need the intervention of an admin to fix the issue:
- give first-come permission to TOKUHIROM on cpan::outdated
- give comaint permission to DOLMEN (myself) on cpan::outdated
- reindex DOLMEN/cpan-outdated-0.30.tar.gz

Thanks for your help,
Olivier Mengu=C3=A9 (DOLMEN)

The following report has been written by the PAUSE namespace indexer.
Please contact modules@perl.org if there are any open questions.

  User: DOLMEN (Olivier Mengue)
  Distribution file: cpan-outdated-0.30.tar.gz
  Number of files: 15
  *.pm files: 1
  README: cpan-outdated-0.30/README.md
  META-File: cpan-outdated-0.30/META.json
  META-Parser: Parse::CPAN::Meta 1.4414
  META-driven index: yes
  Timestamp of file: Tue May  3 23:32:09 2016 UTC
  Time of this run: Tue May  3 23:33:39 2016 UTC

This distribution name will only be indexed when uploaded by users with
permission for the package cpan::outdated. Either someone else has
ownership over that package name, or this is a brand new distribution
and that package name was neither listed in the 'provides' field in the
META file nor found inside the distribution's modules. Therefore, no
modules will be indexed.


Further details on the indexing attempt follow.

You appear to be missing a .pm file containing a package matching the
dist name (cpan::outdated). Adding this may solve your issue.

The following packages (grouped by status) have been found in the distro:
