The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Client::SMTP
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Asynchronous email sending with POE
  userid:      ULTRADM (George Nistorică)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    poe@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The name: POE::Component::Client::SMTP; the module is POE dependent
    (a session), is a POE component, serves as a Client (not Server) and
    uses the SMTP protocol.

    There isn't another module that acts as a POE aware client for the
    SMTP protocol (as far as I know).

    As far as discussed on the POE mailing list (poe@perl.org) no one
    object on registering this namespace.

  enteredby:   ULTRADM (George Nistorică)
  enteredon:   Wed May 25 12:04:24 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Client::
::SMTP            ampOp Asynchronous email sending with POE          ULTRADM
