The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Search::QueryParser
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: parses a fulltext query string

  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)

  similar:
    Lucene::QueryParser

  rationale:

    This module parses a query string into a data structure to be
    handled by external search engines. For examples of such engines,
    see File::Tabular and Search::Indexer.

    The query string can contain simple terms, "exact phrases", field
    names and comparison operators, '+/-' prefixes, parentheses, and
    boolean connectors.

    The parser can be parameterized by regular expressions for specific
    notions of "term", "field name" or "operator" ; see the new method.
    The parser has no support for lemmatization or other term
    transformations : these should be done externally, before passing
    the query data structure to the search engine.

    The data structure resulting from a parsed query is a tree of terms
    and operators, as described below in the parse method. The
    interpretation of the structure is up to the external search engine
    that will receive the parsed query ; the present module does not
    make any assumption about what it means to be "equal" or to
    "contain" a term.

The resulting entry would be:
