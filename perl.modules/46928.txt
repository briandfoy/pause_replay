Is it how the module operates determines in which root namespace it goes?
Are there any not-so-unofficial rules for the distribution of the 
modules into the root namespaces? In my opinion, the lack of such rules 
gives too much freedom to module-makers and thus it is a good incentive 
for cases like this (a Net:: module that should be a WWW:: one).

OK, I am inclined to agree Net::Akismet should be WWW::Akismet ;)

What now? Should I register WWW::Akismet, upload the module there and 
then delete Net::Akismet or there is an easier way the module to go home?

Nikolay.
