The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Shell::Source
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Run programs and inherit environment changes
  userid:      PJCJ (Paul Johnson)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl-beginners

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Here's something I've been running for years, but never quite got
    around to packaging up and submitting to CPAN. Someone asked a
    question on perl-beginners which I answered and received some
    interest in this module so I've finally done something with it.

    The purpose of the module is to run an arbitrary program, usually a
    shell script, and inherit the changed environment. In effect it
    allows you to source a shell script from within Perl.

    I'm not totally convinced about the name, since any program can be
    run, but I expect the majority of usage to be sourcing shell
    scripts. I would welcome naming suggestions though.

The resulting entry would be:

Shell::
::Source          bdpOp Run programs and inherit environment changes PJCJ
