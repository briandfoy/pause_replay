The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::Object
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Ordered list of objects
  userid:      MSHILTONJ (Steven Hilton)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Set::Object, Array, Class::MethdMaker

  rationale:

    List::Object - Ordered list of objects with array methods and
    iterator methods, enforces types of list members.

    List::Object was inspired by several other modules: Array for
    having an object-oriented interface to perl's array functions.
    Class::MethodMaker for its auto-generated methods that do that same
    thing with its object_list functionality (hence the name of this
    package), as well as the fact that it enforces the declared datatype
    on its members. And I like the generic Iterator interface for
    working with lists.

    In a nutshell, List::Object has three main features:

    * Object-oriented interface to perl's array methods

    * Implements the Iterator interface for the list

    * Enforces datatypes of list members

    Rough, working-state (with lots of typos) documentation of proposed
    module is temporarily located at:

    http://mshiltonj.com/projects/List-Object.html

  enteredby:   MSHILTONJ (Steven Hilton)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 22 12:49:42 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

List::
::Object          cdpOp Ordered list of objects                      MSHILTONJ
