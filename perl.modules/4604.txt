When I first registered as a developer I noted that I would be working on
modules that could be used for various instrument building calculations -
fret calculations, string gauge/diameter
calculations, just intonation, numerical calculations of flute impedences
and standing waves, length/bore calculations, note/frequecncy conversions
and wavelength/frequency conversions, as well as misc music/physics
calculations.

The name spaces I requested were:

Lutherie::
::FretCalc   cdpf  Calculate stringed instrument fret locations

Sound::
::Wavelength cdpf Frequency/Wavelength conversions

The question is, as most of these modules will be related, I wonder if I
should put them in one top level namespace? Lutherie is specific to stringed
instruments (plus, I'll be doing other Lutherie specific calculations
besides fret placement), so maybe MusicMaker::Lutherie, MusicMaker::FretCalc
or something of the sort would be better. In any case, none of the current
top level namespaces seem to fit these modules. I'd like to get my first
module up soon (currently Lutherie::FretCalc) and I'm open to suggestions
before doing so.

Thanks,

doug sparling
