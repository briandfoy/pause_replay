The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POOF
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO framwork that provides encapsulation.
  userid:      BMILLARES (Benny Millares)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    TBD

  similar:
    There are many OO framworks in CPAN, none are identical.

  rationale:

    This module attempts to give Perl a more formal OO implementation
    framework. Providing a distinction between class properties and
    methods with three levels of access (Public, Protected and Private).
    It also restricts method overriding in children classes to those
    properties or methods marked as "Virtual", in which case a child
    class can override the method but only from its own context. As far
    as the parent is concern the overridden method or property still
    behaves in the expected way from its perspective.

The resulting entry would be:

POOF              bdpOp OO framwork that provides encapsulation.     BMILLARES
