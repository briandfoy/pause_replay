From: chm@alum.mit.edu (Chris Marshall)

Based on feedback received on the module namespace and
my experience with reworking the existing PDL::Graphics::TriD
to use OpenGL rather than PDL::Graphics::OpenGL, I plan to
request the following:

(1) use namespace PDL::Graphics::POGL

(2) category 06-Data Type Utilities consistent with PDL
      NOTE: I originally requested 18-Images Pixmaps Bitmaps
      to go with the OpenGL (POGL) location but  the need
      for a full PDL::Graphics::TriD refactoring is better
      supported by the PDL::Graphics::POGL name.

I plan to formally confirm this request tomorrow.  Please
reply with any additional feedback or comments at this
time.  I will follow with a message on current TriD status.

Thanks,
Chris
