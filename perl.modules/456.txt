Good. So I withdraw my Whoops ;-) (I haven't looked carefully at
TeX::Hyphenate, I only saw the plain tex hyphenation tables being
duplicated)

Maybe I didn't express myself well enough, please let me retry:

If it is the case that a variety of modules exist (or ought to exist)
for task A, and task B is a complementary task to task A, then I would
expect that the module that does task B has an interface to plug in
any of the modules for task A.

In the above sentence I would replace A with "hyphenation" and B with
"wrapping text".

Does that not make sense for you? Note, that I'm not arguing about a
namespace but about a separation of tasks.
