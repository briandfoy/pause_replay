The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::EasyPDF
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: PDF creation with no runtime resources
  userid:      MELONMAN (Mark Howe)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    So far on Activestate PDK mailing list, maybe a mailing list later.

  similar:
    PDF::API2 and related modules

  rationale:

    It should go under PDF because it creates PDF.

    EasyPDF describes what it is supposed to do.

    It's an alternative to the much larger and more complex PDF::API2
    modules, which cause problems when used with Activestate's PerlApp
    because of the large number of runtime modules and resource files
    used. PDF::EasyPDF is one .pm file. It also makes quite compact
    files, probably in part because it uses the standard fonts, and the
    programming interface has a more postscriptish feel to it.

  enteredby:   MELONMAN (Mark Howe)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb 25 19:16:21 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

PDF::
::EasyPDF         adpOp PDF creation with no runtime resources       MELONMAN
