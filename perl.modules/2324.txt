Good morning,

I would like to register as a new author for the PAUSE server. Below is the
data requested by the faq on CPAN:

Name: Josiah Bryan

Email: jdb@wcoil.com

Homepage: http://www.josiah.countystart.com/

Prefered uid: JBRYAN

Desc:  My first release is a dbm-like database module with support for
multiple-tables and AutoLoad-like database loading for larger databases. I
have released it through comp.lang.perl.misc, message subject "ANNOUNCE:
database", message sent at 12:25 a.m. EST on 7/02/00.  Source in ZIP file
resides at my website under
http://www.josiah.countystart.com/modules/database/cgi-bin/rec.pl . (Yes, it
is a perl script for download tracking, which even uses the module id like
to release, 'database', to do the tracking with. :-)

DSLI:   adpr  - A dbm-like tie() pkg, has multiple tables

I have discussed the ideal of this module with my CIO and CEO at my work
place, as well as the file storage method used in this module. They
expressed interest in seeing the module released, and using it in house. I
just released the module onto comp.lang.perl.misc less than 43 minutes ago,
therefore I can't judge much of a response yet from that release.

Also, I saw the notes about the namespace....
I have named this module simply 'database', residing in the root of the
library tree, as it only uses one file (database.pm), with POD embeded.
Also, this provides for simpler and cleaner typing: tie(%db, 'database',
'file'). I initially tried to name it 'db',
yet I forgot, in my one-track mindset, that my Perl has the DB module for
debugging (at least my Activestate [Gasp!!] perl does).

If anyone at modules@perl.org dissaproves of this name for the module, I do
welcome any suggestions. Thankyou all very much for taking time to read this
message.
