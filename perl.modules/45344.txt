Oh, right. I didn't read EU::MM documentation about PREOP.

Just tested on Cygwin and this time it generated the warning. So I
moved the unlink() after WriteMakefile(): like this, WriteMakefile()
can see XSLoader.pm and is happy, and just after the file is unlinked
so that it's rebuilt. Just tried and it worked, so I'll stick with that.


Thanks again for your help
