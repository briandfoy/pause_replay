Subject: Adjusting permissions for Module::Pluggable::Fast

Hi Marcus,

I was looking at your Module::Pluggable::Fast module because someone
told me it wasn't in the PAUSE index. It seems you don't have
permissions for that module, and all previous versions not from you
have been removed. The only permissions now are for SRI as the
first-come and KRAIT as a comaintainer.

I've made you a comaintainer for now, but it this is wrong we can
always undo it.
