From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

Reini's uploaded a Coro that works on 5.22 bar %SIG handlers inside Coros.

Would he be entitled to adopt it if he wanted? If so, why? If not, why not?

I feel like "refuses to support the latest perl" is effectively a
renunciation of maintenance, but barring cpxxxan we don't have version-specific
cpans.

Note: I think in this case, in terms of how other people will see it, it's
probably not a good idea for such an adoption request to be made - but the
principle seems like something maybe we should try and work out.
