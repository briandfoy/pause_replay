The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tree::Interval
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl implementation of an interval tree
  userid:      GNB (Greg Banks)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a perl implementation of an interval tree for
    non-overlapping intervals, based on Tree::RedBlack by Benjamin
    Holzman <bholzman@earthlink.net>. An interval tree is a binary tree
    which remains "balanced" i.e. the longest length from root to a node
    is at most one more than the shortest such length. It is fairly
    efficient; no operation takes more than O(log(N)) time.

    There is an existing Set::IntervalTree, but it a) has additional
    complexity to deal with the more complex case of overlapping
    intervals, b) is an XS wrapper around a C++ class c) was severely
    broken when I tried it. This module is pure Perl, simpler, and by
    handling the simple case of non-overlapping intervals can be
    implemented as an easy extension of a working RedBlack tree module.

The resulting entry would be:

Tree::
