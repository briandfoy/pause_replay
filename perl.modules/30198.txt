The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Scraper::ISBN
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Search for book info by ISBN
  userid:      ASCHAMP (Andrew Schamp)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Business::ISBN

  rationale:

    This module (and associated modules, WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver and
    WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Record) searches the internet for book
    information (such as title, author, edition, etc.). This is usually
    a challenge because there are no databases which have information
    for all books. To solve this problem, a variety of drivers can be
    written to search specific sites (currently, the Library of Congress
    and ISBN.nu) for information. The main class handles the loading of
    the desired drivers, which each inherit from the driver class, and
    has a search method which methodically works through the drivers
    until a match is found. Then it returns a Record type, which is a
    simple data structure containing information about the book, that
    the book was found, and errors.

    These classes do no implement ISBN-specific functions like error
    checking or interpreting country codes, publisher codes, etc., which
    I believe are handled by Business::ISBN. There is also no formal
    structure or very standard set of information to retrieve, as each
    database may contain different fields for each book record. The idea
    is to try and get a reasonable subset that will be useful.

    The purpose behind this module is a textbook exchange website
    operated by a CS organization at Calvin College.
