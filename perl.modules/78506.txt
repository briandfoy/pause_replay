Hi Neil,

thank you for your work! I think it's very important.

Refer to the "PAUSE administrators" instead of modules@perl.org? A 
mailing list is a weird thing to carry authority. :)

Sadly, it does only because we work hard. If CPAN authors were proactive 
by explicitly endorsing the above, our task would be a lot easier.

Agreed.

I'm not surprised Andreas and I agree on this.

Well, ideally, I think, an author should be able to do either one (or 
both). Personally, I'm perfectly willing to hand responsibility to the 
PAUSE admins if I'm not reachable/whatever. I would not want to go 
through the effort of marking each of my 150 or so modules.

Not even require an email to the author? Really?

META.yml/json!

README is almost useless since it requires somebody to grovel through 
the distribution. It needs to be something that can be automated and 
displayed on some overview page -- like the distribution page for 
search.cpan.org (and metacpan), something akin to "View Permissions" in 
PAUSE.

This would be the place where you mark an author as endorser.

Yeees, keep in mind, though, that modules@perl.org is read & acted upon 
by only a handful of really rather busy people. More manual work for us 
is likely to lead to work being dropped.
