I've thrown together a module to interact with the Protein Data Bank (
http://www.pdb.org/ ), usually abbreviated PDB.

Currently I have some methods for retrieving various files from the
database, and I've also wrapped the PDB's web services SOAP interface (
http://www.rcsb.org/robohelp_f/webservices/pdbwebservice.html ). I hope to
build on this work and release a utility to mount the database as a file
system using FUSE, as well as modules to work with PDB format files, among
other things.

What's a good namespace for this work? To me, "use PDB;" seems intuitive, so
I thought I'd take "PDB" as the base of the namespace. Is there a better
place for this?

Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
