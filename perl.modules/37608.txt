    IO::Radioize - translate a string into the NATO phonetic alphabet

    The C module provides a way to translate from plain strings into
    the NATO phonetic alphabet. That is A is "alpha", B is "bravo", C is
    "charlie", etc. This provides a method of speaking alphanumeric
    strings over a radio with poor sound quality without being mistaken.

    In terms of practical applications to computers, it can be useful
    when printing random alphanumeric sequences, such as passwords,
    where a lowercase l, a number 1 and an capital letter I can be
    easily confused.
