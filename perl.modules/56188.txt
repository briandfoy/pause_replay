Hi modules@,

here is my updated plan for the module list cleaning (of unclaimed
registrations):

1) determine registered namespaces without upload (DONE)
2) prepare email template for notifying authors (DONE)
3) write script to auto-mail authors on the list (DONE)
4) remove registrations since June 1st 2007 from the list (Script is
running on modules@perl.org archives now, will finish within the hour.)

5) put list of namespaces and authors in some PAUSE-admin-editable place
(?:
  6) announce the process on use.perl.org
  7) wait a few days
)?
8) run mass-mailer
9) deal with the fallout and remove complaining authors from the list
10) wait until December (three months)
11) re-run the script that find the namespaces without uploads and
remove those registrations which have since been uploaded from the
deletion list
12) delete remaining unclaimed namespaces from the database.

All technical aspects except the PAUSE-admin-editable list are solved. I
expect to do that on the week-end.

brian: Do you think an announcement on use.perl makes sense?

Best regards,
Steffen
