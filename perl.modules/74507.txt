Typically we try to get the perl5-porters to agree to any all-lowercase
pragma name. I don't think it's a problem, but we feel it's a bit out
of our purview to approve these names. If no one on p5p complains, we'd
be happy to register it.

And, maybe they already have. Just point us to the right thread. :)
