yes, I remember that and read the emails. Your registration is valid and
will stay. I wouldn't have included it in the todo list at all, but it
was generated by a script. I'm removing it from the deletion list.

I doubt we can install any kind of mandatory control over top-level
namespaces. People would  hate us for it. CPAN is not ours after all, we
just try to look after it. :)

Best regards,
Steffen
