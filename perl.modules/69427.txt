Perl-Critic-1.105_01 is a dev release so pause does not index it, so =

modules that are inside it. thaljef released 1.092 which paused index, =
so s.c.o knows of the permissions for modules in that release. The =

released by thaljef so s.c.o has never seen permissions assigned to =
thaljef in the=20
