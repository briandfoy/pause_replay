The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Instapaper::Client
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Implementation of Client API for Instapaper
  userid:      DPMEYER (Darren Meyer)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    I could not find any module that appeared to support Instapaper
    (http://www.instapaper.com), nor its API specifically.

    It's a WWW-based module, thus WWW::*

    It implements the Instapaper API, thus WWW::Instapaper

    However, it only implements as a client for that API; someone
    (maybe even me), may wish to implement the API for use on the server
    side.

    Thus, my module is WWW::Instapaper::Client ; an implementation of
    the server could be WWW::Instapaper::Server ; and if there are other
    APIs in the future, it leaves the namespace open to that.

    For example, if the Instapaper folks set up a mirroring API, it
    might be WWW::Instapaper::Mirror.

    Therefore, it seems like WWW::Instapaper::Client is the clearest,
    most logical name for this module. This has been uploaded to PAUSE
    for additional review -- see
    https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/D/DP/DPMEYER/WWW-Instapaper-Client-0.9.tar.gz

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::Instapaper::
::Client          RdpOp Implementation of Client API for Instapaper  DPMEYER
