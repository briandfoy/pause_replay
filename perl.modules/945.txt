Okay, this is for modules@perl.org -- you guys were my primary
audience, but a didn't realize there was a cross-posting rule,
but it makes sense in retrospect.  Anyway:

Lately I've been putting the finishing touches on a set of modules that
retrieve historical stock quotes from various locations on the web.  I
have a number of questions and concerns.

It seems obvious that this is desirable functionality, but there are
some issues that are not completely within my control.

All of the freely available historical quote data I've seen so far is
only available in HTML. My modules allow for the specification of
several characteristics of each source in order to effectively and
reliably gather the requested data. (note that the modules do not
REQUIRE html sources, but so far that's all they source).

These modules necessarily rely on specific URLs and page layouts.  I
have done several things to minimize dependencies on page layout, so for
the most part when web sites alter their pages the quotes will still be
fetched (briefly, a couple of the tricks are context independent table
extraction and daisy chain failover from site to site).  But it is
always possible that something might change with the sources that will
break the information flow.  

Is this sort of reliability level acceptable for CPAN? I will of course
update the site-specific modules to the best of my ability, plus they
are always user-tunable.  And they will of course have a big fat
DISCLAIMER that indicates you'd better know some perl if you want to use
them for any mission critical activities.

The next issue is the names.  The ones I picked are big and fat, but
quite descriptive.  I'd like to know what you think (so far I've only
got two specific site instances):

   Finance::HistoricalQuotes
   Finance::HistoricalQuotes::MotleyFool
   Finance::HistoricalQuotes::FinancialWeb

The first is of course the base class, which is an LWP::UserAgent
derived creature.  The others are specific instances which tailor the
behavior based on the quirks of that data source.  In typical usage, you
would use the top level module, and if desired specify a failover order
for the subclasses.

(Failover can occur for a variety of reasons -- the site could be down,
or you could be requesting a symbol that no longer exists.  I've found
that the Motley Fool is very reliable, but does not provide quotes for
defunct ticker symbols.  FinancialWeb is slower, and a bit less
reliable, but does have defunct tickers...I am, of course, wide open to
suggestions on other reliable sources)

Any thoughts?
