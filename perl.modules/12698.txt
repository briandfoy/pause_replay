Hi,

I have been busy tidying up and documenting my first module for CPAN and
after a email from another author, noted that my first choice of name might
be a bit confusing, so I thought 'Devel::DebugPrint' might be better.

The module is a simple toolkit for handling debug files during development.
It's been a set library utilities I have been using since 1985 and have
finally gotten round to writing a Perl version. In brief it allows you to
send debug print statements from an module/script to a named (or default)
file.

The interfaces are:

debugSet - allows you to set various attributes, including the debug file,
via a hash ref.
debugClean - empty out the current debug file
debugStop & debugStart - suspend and restart debug printing
debugPrint - print a list of items to the debug file

There are several defaults, which enable the calling script/module to only
use debugPrint.

Is Devel::DebugPrint an appropriate name or do I need a rethink?

Barbie
