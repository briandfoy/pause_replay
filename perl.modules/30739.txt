This is to inform that we have found a license infringement concerning a
package distributed on your CPAN archive, called "Date-Jalali". Since
the author's address provided in the package footer
(http://www.anvari.org/bio) was unreachable to me, I could only use the
contact informations provided on your web site.

Your Perl code:
   http://search.cpan.org/src/AHMAD/Date-Jalali-0.01/Jalali.pm

Our original C code:
   http://www.farsiweb.info/jalali/jalali.c

The matter is that a package to which I hold joint copyright to, and
have released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL),
Version 2.1, is re-released on your web site under the Perl license. As
you can see from a comparison of the sources, this is clear that the
code is derived from our code, with *the removal of our copyright
statement* and *relicensing without permission*.

Although the author claims in the footer that only the algorithm was
taken, it is apparent from a comparison of the main Perl function with
the C function "gregorian_to_jalali" that it's just direct porting, and
the Perl module is clearly a derivative work of our LGPL-ed code.

I would appreciate if you tell me the right person to contact about the
license infringement.

Yours Faithfully,
