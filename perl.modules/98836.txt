Hi Moritz,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admins hat.

John Napiorkowski would like to get co-maint on Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA, so =
he can do a bug fix release (see below).

If you=E2=80=99re happy for him to have co-maint, I can give it to him =
on your behalf. Is that ok?

Cheers,
Neil

that he doesn't do Perl a lot anymore and had forgotten how to upload =

do that and offered to pair on it if he was stuck, but I never heard =
back (that was 2 weeks ago).  Its starting to look like this is not =
something the current maintainer wants to deal with or has time for.  =

issues arise in the future.

more than 10 years from what I can see).

update since my company uses it. My CPAN id is JJNAPIORK and I've got a =
pretty decent track record on CPAN of doing trustworthy releases.  My =
plan would be to release quickly a patched version of this, and also it =
looks like from the github pull request record that there's a number of =
outstanding patches that could be merged as well.  Also I will contact =
some of the people that send patches to this code and find out if they =
want comaint that way there's no longer a single point of failure on =
this.  So I'm requesting that I be granted first-come on this module.
