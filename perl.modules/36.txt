Why not just hack up the Perl core some more & make this work:

use Foo::*;

Everyone will be able to tell the difference between these:

use CGI;
use CGI::*;

And in time, someone will even come up with:

use qr/CGI::[AC].*::\*/;

		The WHOLE POINT of the module/pragma is to make
Really::Long::Namespaces::That::Programmers::Hate::To::Type *alot* easier to
use without cluttering up their program with FQPNs. IMHO, it only adds noise
to the code.

		I don't recommend (ab)using the module/pragma in the above
case. What exactly was your intent / reasoning for using the module in that
code example? What did you need my module to do for you that just 'use CGI'
didn't already do? I think the example is contrived, and therefore, the
problematic results are contrived. It's not a problem I need to fix. (I
address the module/directory both existing problem in another posting.)

		I think the heart of this issue that Tom brings up(although
the code example is bogus) is for accessing modules that either don't or
won't export useful symbols into the caller's namespace. Also, many times, I
*don't want* my namespace cluttered up by some other modules symbols. I just
want a shorthand notation that makes my code cleaner, not more cluttered.

		For a module that lets me pick and choose, I don't need
'import'. But when I've got 35 modules to import from some arbitrarily deep
namespace, 'import' makes my life much easier, and my code easier to read
and understand.

		I plan to take these topics (as they are constructive) and
incorporate them into the next revision of the documentation, if that makes
anyone feel better.
