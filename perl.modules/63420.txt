The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Util
  DSLIP:       Sdphp
  description: Easy, versatile, portable file handling
  userid:      TOMMY (Tommy Butler)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    File::Slurp

  rationale:

    File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to
    automate all kinds of common tasks on file / directories. It makes
    Perl I/O more easy for the Perl neophyte, and dramatically
    simplifies complex/multi-step I/O operations (take the automatic,
    intelligent file locking, for example).

    Its second goal is to do all this in the most portable manner
    possible so that users of this module wonât have to worry about
    whether their programs will work on other OSes and machines.

    This module has been on CPAN for over 5 years. It's probably mature
    enough for an official namespace assignment now. It is not for
    notoriety that its author seeks the official namespace, but is the
    hope that this module can make Perl I/O more "fun", more safe, less
    error prone, and less confusing for its users.
