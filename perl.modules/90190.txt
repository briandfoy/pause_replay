Subject: Module Adoption Request: ANDREWF's Template::* modules

Dear PAUSE Admins,

Following the sad loss of Andrew Ford (ANDREWF), one of his wishes was for
his OpenSource work to continue. At his funeral last week, many of his
colleagues throughout his working life, and even those from his Univesity
days, spoke of how he felt like a person of the world, and how he embrace
the idea of OpenSource being for the benefit of the world. As such, I'd
like to help continue that idea, and ensure some of his work continues to
recognise his contribution to Perl.

Providing no-one has already requested adoption of any of Andrew's
distributions, the following distributions specifically, are the ones I'd
like to update/fix and take on maintenance of:

* Template-Plugin-Digest-MD5
* Template-Plugin-Digest-SHA1
* Template-Plugin-Lingua-EN-Inflect
* Template-Plugin-MultiMarkdown

My PAUSE ID being 'BARBIE'.

Regards,
Barbie.
