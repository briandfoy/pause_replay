You can configure three things:

1 edit your publicly visible email address

2 edit your secret email address

3 select where DAVEOLA@cpan.org should forward to

Together the three options offer more obfuscation than I can imagine
anybody needs. Please explain your needs if I'm missing something.

Of course, which address you use to communicate on public channels
such as modules@perl.org has nothing to do with PAUSE.
