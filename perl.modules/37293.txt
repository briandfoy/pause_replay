     why:

    Well, I'v got module which can be add to Text::Bastardize. It was
    inspired by
    http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/Cmabrigde/.

    No, I'm going to port from C few lines of code to convert
    disbursement into number of bank notes and coins: for example: $123
    salary = 1 x $100; 1x$20; 1x$2; 1x$1 It is quite advisable to bill
    program to know how much and which kind od conins you shoud get from
    bank for employers (you can't get 500+4x100 $ for 3 person which any
    on them earn 300$)

    I's good enought?

    regards Lukasz
