Subject: Module submission Log::Fine

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Fine
  DSLIP:       cdpOb
  description: Yet another logging framework
  userid:      CFUHRMAN (Chris Fuhrman)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::Agent Log::Dispatch

  rationale:

    The goal behind Log::Fine is to provide fine-grained logging via
    one or more "handles" (I'm debating on whether to call these
    "channels" instead). Log::Fine is broken into 3 main components:

    1) Log::Fine::Logger

    This method is responsible for logging and dispatch. It provides
    the "log" method.

    2) Log::Fine::Handle

    A handle is an output channel. Currently supported are output to
    either STDERR or STDOUT, Files, Syslog, and Timestamped files. Note
    I'm debating on whether or not to call these "channels" instead of
    "handles"

    3) Formatter

    A formatter formats the output string. It's designed to be easily
    sub-classed for custom logging.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
