Hello,

I'm not much of a Perl programmer (I tell people I know 'combat Perl' :-),
but I'm interested in uploading a module that is an implementation of the
Crypto-PAn tool, details of which can be found here:

  <http://www.cc.gatech.edu/computing/Telecomm/cryptopan/>

In a nutshell, this module uses Crypt::Rijndael and Socket (for inet_ntoa,
though I could be convinced to force people to just interface with this
module using the address as integer and convert it back to an address
themselves) to anonymize IPv4 addresses, but retain consistent one-to-one
mapping from the original IP address to the anonymized one as well as
preserves the network prefix between the original addresses and anonymized
versions.

This is useful tool particularly for Internet data collection and network
researchers where some privacy of original addresseses in trace and log
data is required.

The base code from the above C++ implementation package is named
panonymizer.c so I thought I would same the module similarly.  My first
thought was it should be called Crypt::PAnonymizer or IP:PAnonymizer.
The capital 'A' simply follows the convention used in the original code,
but maybe it is inappropriate for CPAN modules?

I have some prototype code and now just need to turn it into a module,
which should be ready to upload in a a few days or at most a few weeks
once it's gone through some usability and correctness testing by some
of my colleagues.  I'm also verifying the licensing details with the
original Crypto-PAn author.

Please advise on an appropriate name.  Any additional comments are of
course welcome.  Thank you,

John
