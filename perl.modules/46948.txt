The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::PDAScraper
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Scrape PDA-friendly content from websites
  userid:      CODYP (John Horner)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    Having written various kludgey scripts to download PDA-friendly
    content from various websites, I decided to try and write a
    generalised solution which would

    * parse out the section of a news page which contains the links we
    want * munge those links into the URL for the print-friendly
    version, if possible

    * download those pages and make an index page for them

    The moving of the pages to your PDA is not part of the scope of the
    module: the open-source browser and "distiller", Plucker, from
    http://plkr.org/ is recommended. Just get it to read the index.html
    file with a depth of 1 from disk, using a URL like
    file:///path/to/index.html

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::PDAScraper      adphp Scrape PDA-friendly content from websites    CODYP
