PLANNED CONTRIBUTION:  A set of modules for creating latent semantic 
search engines in Perl.  This is an OO framework centered around the 
concept of a document collection, which takes care of indexing itself 
and presenting a web front-end for running search queries.  LSI search 
engines are quite clever in that they will return relevant results to a 
keyword query even though there may be no exact keyword match.   This 
family of modules is quite far along, and should take the pain out of 
creating, implementing and running one's own personal search engine.   
Also includes some SVG-based visualization tools.
