How about XML::MediaRSS? Media RSS is a particular thing, so hiding
that in various ways by not using the name makes it harder for people
to find.

If you aren't subclassing XML::RSS (and it looks like you aren't), I
don't like the name to look like you might be.

I might even get rid of the XML part of the name and just call it
MediaRSS or RSS::MediaRSS.
