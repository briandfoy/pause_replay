The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       REST::Lite
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: REST API framework LITE version
  userid:      MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Borrowed the name from SOAP::Lite, I suggest REST::Lite name for
    the work I am currently finalizing.

    I was looking for REST Framework without any overhead but found
    very little to my satisfaction. All that I came across came with
    lots of overhead. I was looking looking for a very lightweight REST
    framework which I can plug-n-play.

    I have a working framework (almost) which I would like to share
    with Perl Community.

    I am open to suggestions.

    Many Thanks.

    Best Regards, Mohammad S Anwar
