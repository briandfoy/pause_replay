 plz help.

I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. modules@perl.org is an alias
for a group of people who work with CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network: updating the module list, registering developers, and so on. It
is not a help desk.

You may be able to get more help at http://www.perlmonks.org/ , or by
consulting a professional. There are also mailing lists geared to Perl
beginners; have a look at the following URLs for two of them:
* http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=3Dbeginners
* http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=3Dperl-beginner
Those URLs give a short summary of each list and tell you how to
subscribe, if you wish to do so.

Cheers,
Philip
