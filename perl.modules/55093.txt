I have spent hours doing this for 0.4.12 but then chromatic did not
follow my instructions. Then I did it again for 0.4.13 and now Allison
has the instructions what needs to be done. It can't be done on CPAN
alone because it will hurt THALJEF.

No, we do not frown upon virtual users, we encourage them. PARROTRE is
the only solution but the users cannot simply redistribute modules
somebody else maintains actively.

I append my mail to Allison. I should have CC'd modules@, sorry about
that.
