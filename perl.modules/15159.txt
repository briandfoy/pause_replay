> a short description of what you're planning to contribute

attachable/detachable large (bounded by memory model, ie 2-4Gb) shared
memory map between processes, tied vars using this shared memory,
read/write locking on tied vars. conversion of shared memory to
read-only compacted forms. can find no equivalent in CPAN that does
exactly what this does.
