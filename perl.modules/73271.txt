     why:

    I have been coding Perl for about 10 years now and have developed a
    number of Perl Programs for my current job in the field of computer
    forensics. I am learning how to develop Perl Modules and am
    converting some of my code and would like at some point to be able
    to share it with others in my field and anyone else who might be
    interested.
