EU:M is upstream: blead and Florian Ragwitz is happy to take that - seems
like a simpler solution to me.

Same, or I can always take it - currently waiting to find out if Chorny
wants to write tests for EUMM's MYMETA bugs to go with his code or if I
should fix and test it before attempting an EUMM release.

Don't really mind except that I'd prefer rafl or I to you simply because
we already have the relevant core bits and the upstream: blead is relatively
sane for these dists.

Thoughts?
