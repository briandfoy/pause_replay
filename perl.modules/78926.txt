Subject: Module submission Neo4j
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Neo4j
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Perl client for the Neo4j graph database.
  userid:      NUBA (Nuba Rodrigues Princigalli)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    https://groups.google.com/group/neo4j, #neo4j on irc.freenode.net

  similar:
    Redis

  rationale:

    This is like Pedro Melo's Redis module [1] for the Redis key-value
    store [2]. In the (wildly) varied NoSQL camp, it is considered the
    de-facto graph database, and as of yet, any person who wants to use
    it has to roll his own client library. My goal with this is 1) share
    the code I've been using experimentally; 2) further the use of this
    graph database, which I've been following for a while; and 3)
    prepare the ground for releasing a catalyst model helper and a
    kiokudb backend.

    Thank you,

    Nuba
