Either of those sound okay,

If you are only testing the Graph objects, do you need to add methods?
I'm not sure what the rest of your module might do, but it sounds like
it might only need to look at the Graph object rather than be the Graph
object.  

You might try talking about your ideas on use.perl,
module-authors@perl.org, and so on to get other input. We're mostly
here to help upload and manage whatever you decide to make. :)

Good luck :)
