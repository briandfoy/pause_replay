I guess it comes down to whether you'd ever expect any other, unrelated 
modules under the "Doxygen" top level namespace. From your description, 
I gather that's a possibility, so I tend to agree with your reasoning.

Maybe it would even make sense to do "Doxygen::Filter" and then 
"Doxygen::Filter::Perl", "Doxygen::Filter::SQL", etc. But that's up to you.

Cheers,
Steffen
