     why:

    I'm trying to move from Ruby to Perl because I feel the community
    is more friendly.

    The first thing that I'm going to contribute is a library for
    organizing (and keeping track of) your electronics parts orders from
    various distributors, which is great for people like me that are
    into electronics and often have a bunch of parts bought from various
    places and you need to know what you have in "stock".
