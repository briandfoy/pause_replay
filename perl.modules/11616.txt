The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::TextToHTML
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: a text to HTML converter
  userid:      RUBYKAT (Kathryn Andersen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::FromText

  rationale:

    HTML::TextToHTML is a port of Seth Golub's txt2html script to a
    module (initially, with extensions later). The interface is intended
    to be as close to the script's as possible, implementing all
    features (and supporting the "links dictionary" as used by txt2html
    also). Thus its feature-set (and interface) is incompatible with
    that of HTML::FromText, the only existing module I could find with
    any kind of similar functionality. I have attempted to contact the
    author of HTML::FromText, but his email address bounced, and
    considering that his last update of the module was in 1999, I
    suspect it is an orphaned module. (I have also contacted Seth Golub,
    and he is quite happy that I do the port).

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::TextToHTML      cdpOp a text to HTML converter                     RUBYKAT
