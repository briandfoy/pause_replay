well, great, You sent me an idea:

I've changed the code to defaultly export both class methods &err and &iserr
so that now there is as short as possible construct:

        sub mySub {
          ...
          return err 'some error message' if somethingWrong();
	  ...
        }

        $myVar = mySub();
        handleErrorProbablyDieWith($myVar) if iserr $myVar;
        ... continue with non-error $myVar

isn't it nice?

do somebody have any suggestion how should be this module named to
properly match its intended purpose, having in mind, that it
could be used not only for error ahdnling/reporting. Is the name 'Result'
with capitalized 'R' ok?
