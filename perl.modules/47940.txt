The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RRDutil
  DSLIP:       MdpOb
  description: A host monitoring utility based on rrdtool
  userid:      MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    http://www.tnpi.biz/support/forums/

  similar:
    statsview

  rationale:

    The namespace is chosen because that's the name of the package.

    I wrote this package in 2003 because there simply wasn't anything
    like it. Cacti was way too big, MRTG was too inflexible, and I could
    find a simple, easy to install and configure host monitoring
    utility. So I wrote rrdutil.

    I've browsed and searched the name space and because there really
    isn't anything else like it on CPAN, I couldn't find a nice place in
    the namespace to shoehorn it into.

  enteredby:   MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar 19 22:05:55 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RRDutil           MdpOb A host monitoring utility based on rrdtool   MSIMERSON
