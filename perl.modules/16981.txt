     why:

    I am requesting a PAUSE ID foremostly to maintain the CPAN module,
    Text::Morse, which is at the moment, not maintained by anyone
    because of the tragic passing away of it's creator, Ariel Brosh.

    In the future, I plan to use the PAUSE ID to make available via
    CPAN Perl modules of my own and also to maintain any unmaintained
    modules of interest.

    At the moment, I'm also in mature developement of a GPL'd Perl
    program that may benifit of the Bundle feature of CPAN, as it takes
    advantage of many CPAN modules.

    A little background: I'm currently an Art Student at the Rocky
    Mountain College of Art and Design. I've found Perl to be an
    excellent language for Net Art Projects, of which I've done a few
    of, examples that use Perl in some way:

    http://prolix.nu/haircut http://prolix.nu/help
    http://prolix.nu/strange

    Along with Net art projects, I've also used Perl in my paintings.
    This painting was actually painted from a report made in part by a
    Perl program:

    http://www.skazat.com/for_you/nicole512.jpg

    I know I could bring to the Perl community even MORE diversity.
    Since Perl is released under the Artistic License, it makes sense
    for an Artist to be a part of CPAN :) I've been using Perl for 3 1/2
    years now.

    Cheers,

    justin
