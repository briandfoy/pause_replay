The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Qmail::Control
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Reliable interface to Qmail's control files.
  userid:      TECH (Paul Prince)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    #pugglewump on irc.isomerica.net, but not much.

  similar:
    Sendmail::AccessDB

  rationale:

    Qmail:: would contain any modules relating primarily to Qmail's
    backend - Queue maintainence, configuration file modification, etc.

    Qmail::Control would contain any modules relating specifically to
    Qmail's control (configuration) files, usually found in
    /var/qmail/control.

    I have written two modules, Qmail::Control and
    Qmail::Control::Lock. They are part of a larger project I am working
    on, so features will be added as I can use them, or as they are
    requested. I do intend to make both robust and complete in short
    order.

    You can visit http://www.0x21.net/lib/ to see my work so far. They
    are POD documented, at the per-method level.

The resulting entry would be:

Qmail::
::Control         adpOp Reliable interface to Qmail's control files. TECH
