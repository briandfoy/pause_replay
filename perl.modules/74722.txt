Subject: MooseX-ChainedAccessors co-maint
To: modules@perl.org
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: carl@fireartist.com (Carl Franks)

I'm requesting co-maint rights for MooseX-ChainedAccessors, to allow
me (cfranks) to make a cpan release of code which the author (David
McLaughlin / mesadavey) has already accepted and committed but not
released to cpan.

Recent changes to the Moose module have broken MooseX-ChainedAccessors.
I refactored my HTML-FormFu distribution in September 2010 to use
Moose and MooseX-ChainedAccessors, but have been unable to release it
to cpan, due to the broken state of MooseX-ChainedAccessors.

Although there isn't much to the MooseX-ChainedAccessors code, I'm
loath to copy it and pollute cpan with another distribution that does
the same thing under a different name.

MooseX-ChainedAccessors provides a very basic functionality, so any
changes I make in future would be restricted to changes required if
and when Moose internals change.
I have no intention of changing any features or code styles.

The MooseX-ChainedAccessors code is on github [1].
