Hi.

I've written a module that does file configuration in the
same way that cfengine does it, in fact it was inspired directly
from cfengine.

We have been using it a while under the name 'cfe.pm' internally.
(Lower case, mostly because it isn't OO. Didn't feel right.)

However, modules probably should have capitals in front
so we recently renamed it to Cfe.pm.

Now, I would like to share the code and the following questions arise:

1.	Can I keep Cfe.pm?

2.	The code will be GPL, is that enough?
