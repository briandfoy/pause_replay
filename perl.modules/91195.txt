Looking in the permissions table, I see:

Acme::Tiny,DMUEY,c
Acme::Tiny,ETHER,f

I suspect that there was no first-come in the table for this module, due to
some sequence of events in the past or perhaps a db error on PAUSE's side
(I recall at the QAH earlier this year it was discovered that this was a
rare occurrence.) So, when I uploaded my dist, I was given first-come
permissions, as if the namespace was a virgin forest ripe for the taking.

I actually didn't realize until this email that you had had something in
that namespace already - apparently I'd never looked at the dist in a web
client and seen the history on it. Sorry about that!

I'm quite happy to give first-come back to you and let you do what you like
with the namespace. I had originally released as Tiny::Tiny and someone
took exception to the fact that I wasn't using Acme:: for an obviously joke
module. I have no special attachment to the dist :)

I'm cc'ing to the modules list in case the PAUSE admins might have an idea of
what happened here.
