The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::CUPS
  DSLIP:       adcfp
  description: Interface to the Common Unix Printing System
  userid:      DHAGEMAN (D. Hageman)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::LPR

  rationale:

    This is just an interface to the C API of CUPS. It has the basic
    functionality of printing and job control implemented. I may in the
    future expose the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) API of CUPS as
    well as the PPD functions. In theory, this module could allow for
    more "intelligent" printing for perl applications.

  enteredby:   DHAGEMAN (D. Hageman)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 24 03:24:52 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::CUPS            adcfp Interface to the Common Unix Printing System DHAGEMAN
