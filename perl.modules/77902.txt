There is something strange with CGI::Test namespace: I am its new
co-maintainer and I have uploaded a new version but it shows up as
unauthorized; there is an ancient release as well, made by first author
and it still shows up on search.cpan.org as legitimate.

Please look into the issue. My PAUSE login is TOKAREV.

Regards,
Alex.
