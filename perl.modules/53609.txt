I did look at your patch, but unfortunately I wanted to make changes that I 
never got around to.

The main thing I didn't like was that the functions mmc_init(), mmc_close(), 
mmc_lock(), mmc_unlock() copy code, rather than just factoring out the 
unix/win32 specific bits into separate functions. Eg I'd really rather see 
something like this:

---

int mmc_close(mmap_cache *cache) {
  int res;

  /* Shouldn't call if not init'ed */
  ASSERT(cache->fh);
  ASSERT(cache->mm_var);

  /* Shouldn't call if page still locked */
  ASSERT(cache->p_cur == -1);

  /* Unlock any locked page */
  if (cache->p_cur != -1) {
    mmc_unlock(cache);
  }

  /* Close file */
  if (cache->fh) {
    mmc_close_filehandle(cache);
  }

  /* Unmap memory */
  if (cache->mm_var) {
    mmc_unmap_memory(cache);
    if (res == -1) return -1;
  }

  free(cache);

  return 0;
}

---

And have specific versions of mmc_close_filehandle() and mmc_unmap_memory() 
for unix/win32. Ditto the other functions. Otherwise if any of the common 
logic needs changing in the future, it's a pain to have to modify two 
different files to keep them in sync.

Regarding _mmc_set_error(), the second parameter is a pain because of the 
errno vs GetLastError() thing. My recommendation would be to do something a 
bit hacky like make a magic value like:

#define USE_SYSTEM_ERROR -1

Be a magic value you can pass, and _mmc_set_error() will use 
errno/GetLastError() itself if that value is passed.

Thoughts? If you sent me a patch with these changes, I'd be happy to just 
apply it and release a new version.

Rob
