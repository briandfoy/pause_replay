Very welcome!

You may be interested in the appended patch. I recently sent it as a
suggestion to Lincoln Stein against GD. He didn't apply it and
preferred one of the other solutions. I like to send it to you because
it took me several iterations until I had it right.

Unfortunately GD-2.25 differed from XSLoader in that it wrote the
GD.pm from the Makefile.PL not from a separate *.PL file, but you get
the idea...

----excerpt from a recent email from me to LDS----

   You do not have to check a GD.pm into your repository, the tiny
   GD.pm is only existing in the tarball and before the execution of
   'Makefile.PL'

   This solution has the disadvantage of being a bit hard to debug if
   something goes wrong.

# This is a patch for GD-2.25 to update it to GD-2.25-new
#=20
# To apply this patch:
# STEP 1: Chdir to the source directory.
# STEP 2: Run the 'applypatch' program with this patch file as input.
#
# If you do not have 'applypatch', it is part of the 'makepatch' package
# that you can fetch from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network:
# http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/Johan_Vromans/makepatch-x.y.tar.gz
# In the above URL, 'x' should be 2 or higher.
#
# To apply this patch without the use of 'applypatch':
# STEP 1: Chdir to the source directory.
# If you have a decent Bourne-type shell:
# STEP 2: Run the shell with this file as input.
# If you don't have such a shell, you may need to manually create
# the files as shown below.
# STEP 3: Run the 'patch' program with this file as input.
#
# These are the commands needed to create/delete files/directories:
#
touch 'GD.pm'
chmod 0644 'GD.pm'
#
# This command terminates the shell and need not be executed manually.
exit
