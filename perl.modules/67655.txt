Dear co-admins,

I just lost the entire modules@ backlog of mail because thunderbird 
decided to break my nntp subscription. Curiously, it doesn't even want 
to re-download the messages before today if I unsubscribe and 
resubscribe. This is a problem for me specifically for dealing with the 
important requests to take over modules.

But let me use this as a trigger for a more general discussion. For a 
long time now, mostly brian and myself have been trying to handle the 
module registration requests. Lately, we have fallen behind by *a lot*. 
My general workload has increased and I find less and less time for the 
registrations.

Personally, I haven't kept doing the registrations because of the 
modules list but because the semi-official status is an incentive for 
newcomers to get advice from us on the namespace choice. Unfortunately, 
I feel that we can't currently provide ample support and this, in my 
opinion, makes the registration procedure worthless -- even harmful 
because newcomers get a bad first impression.

Somewhen, Andreas suggested having a sort of auto-registration for new 
uploads so that authors can fill in meta information (which would be 
important for a tentative future "orphaned" flag, for example). If I had 
a clue abuot PAUSE and hadn't had my hands full of registration and 
take-over work, I would have had a shot at something like that. I 
suppose everyone else is too busy with the day-to-day business to spend 
time to improve the workflow as well. This won't work going forward!

Therefore, spare time or none, I suggest we cooperate in discussion and 
implementation of a system that provides the authors with facilities to 
edit their modules' meta data, encourages discussion on module-authors@, 
directs administrative issues to modules@, and potentially, finally 
retires the modules list.  If we don't do this, module registrations 
will eventually run into nirvana and I don't think we can afford to 
greet newcomers in this way.

Best regards,
Steffen
