Hi All,

I'm putting together a set of Perl modules which do automated systems
administration.  This is a total rewrite and port to Perl of some of
the algorithms and conventions we described in the "Bootstrapping an
Infrastructure" paper at http://www.infrastructures.org, with new
stuff added.  I hope to see these modules become part of an industry
shift towards the term "Systems Administrator" meaning a piece of
software instead of a chained human.

Before I write much more code and documentation I want to lock down
the base name of the module tree.  

- I will not be the only developer; many others need to be able to
upload API-compliant related modules into the tree, similar to the way
DBI::* and DBD::* work now.  

- I want the name to use an existing well-known acronym so it is
recognizeable as systems administration related; abbreviations like
"SA::" don't sound to me like a good idea.

This gives us these two alternatives:

	Sys::Admin, with contributors uploading as Sys::Admin::Foo 
	- or -
	SysAdmin, with contributors uploading as SysAdmin::Foo

I think I'd prefer SysAdmin, but this would require creating a new
top-level CPAN tree.  For something this fundamental, that may be
justified.  Thoughts?  Preferences?  Third alternatives?

Steve
