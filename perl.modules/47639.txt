I think that my submition text was misleading. Yes, what is a new big
feature enables implementation of Radius proxies, but it isn't proxy
states addition per se. It is an ordered packet, as the name states. 
Proxy states field do exist in the Net::Radius::Packet, but it is a 
hash, with no order kept - in other words, it does not conform to RFC 
and can not be used for Radius proxies.  While with my additions, state 
of proxy field is kept in correct order of addition/removal - according 
to the RFC. Hence the name, PacketOrdered. I wouldn't mind extending the
namespace further, if you wish, so that this is called 
Net::Radius::Packet::Ordered. But ProxyStates is not true to the change, 
since proxy states existed in the original module. This module brings
order to packet states and is thus an ordered packet. Hope this clarifies.
