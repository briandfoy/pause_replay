I was misinformed about this -- as i understand it now,
it's just the long names of by-author that are going 
away?

Also, I will re-release SlideShow as WWW::SlideShow so
it fits into the top-level better.   Perhaps then it
will be more appropriate for listing in the modules
list and authors list.  I posted to this list on that
before but got now reply...
