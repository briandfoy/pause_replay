The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Starfish
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Yet another embedded Perl processor
  userid:      VLADO (Vlado Keselj)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Template Text::Templar Text:iPerl Parse::ePerl HTML::EP

  rationale:

    Text:: prefix should be obvious.

    Starfish: Perl code is embedded into a text, so the text is
    equivalent to a shellfish containing pearls. A starfish comes by and
    eats the shellfish... Unlike a natural starfish, this starfish is
    interested in pearls and does not normally touch most of the
    surrounding meat.

    Uniqueness of approach: There are similar modules. The idea is
    similar to php: Embed Perl code inside the text, execute it is some
    way, so that the output is interleaved with the text. This approach
    is unique because it is a small Perl module (not large, and no
    binaries), it works with any kind of textual file (text, programs,
    HTML, Makefiles), and the most important feature is that by default
    it updates the source file by updating the code outputs and the code
    remains in the file.

  enteredon:   Thu Dec 12 17:38:03 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::Starfish        adphp Yet another embedded Perl processor          VLADO
