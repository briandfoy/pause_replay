The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Unicode::Property::XS
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: Fast lookup for build-in Unicode Properties.
  userid:      MINDOS (鄭智中)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Unicode::UCD

  rationale:

    This module is a fast and compressed table lookup version for
    build-in Unicode properties in Perl regex. It is implemented in C
    codes with XS interface.

    This module implements most properties listed in the "Unicode
    Character Properties" section in L<perlunicode> by simple query
    functions. The usage is some how like C<$flag = IsL(ord($ucs_chr)>
    which is similar to C<$ucs_chr =~ /\p{L}/>. It also supports list
    arguments.

    The problem for lookup tables are size and the trade-off between
    space and size. I used an simple paging method along with some
    fine-tuning after observing that each properties for an codepage is
    mostly monotonic.

    For these about 170 Unicode properties, I wrote a generator to do
    the page-based compression and the code generation. After C<make>
    the resulting the .o binary file occupied about 1.3M disk space.

    I chose the Unicode::Property::XS for its name because of the
    functions it works for.

The resulting entry would be:

Unicode::Property::
::XS              Rdcfp Fast lookup for build-in Unicode Properties. MINDOS
