From: forrest@abstractfactory.org (Forrest Cahoon)

Hello!

I'd like to register for a PAUSE account.

My name is Forrest Cahoon.

My e-mail address is forrest@abstractfactory.org.

I have a website at http://www.abstractfactory.org/ (although
nothing's there yet).

My preferred user-ID on CPAN is FORREST.  If that's not available, I'd
like FCAHOON.

I have a couple of VMS perl modules you can currently find at 
http://vmsbox.cjb.net/~fcahoon/, and perl hooks into the Ghostscript
API at http://www.wiredaemons.com/forrest/Ghostscript.html that I
would like to make available through CPAN.

Thanks for your consideration.

Forrest Cahoon
