     why:

    I actally just started dealing with PERL, most often joining what
    ever groups I can when venturing into new ground that will be long
    term, I most humbly request a membership, which will probably be
    several months lurking as I learn PERL, then who knows what my
    current project will lead me into as far as modules, etc.
