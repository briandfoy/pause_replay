     why:

    The main thing I think it would be nice to get onto CPAN is my
    "script to update ppm repositories", which currently lives at
    perlmonks at

    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=456056

    This got a positive response, and has many suggestions and
    improvements by other monks, most of which I incorated into the
    top-level post, ie the original script.

    So, before I abandon it (since I'm mainly developing on unix now
    and don't use ppm that much) I'd like to polish this off and get
    this posted onto cpan.

    I would appreciate advice on what namespace to put this in, or
    whether there is a special "scripts" category or "ppm" category
    where this would best fit in. Thanks!
