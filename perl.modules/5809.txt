I am the author of XML::CSV, XML::Excel, XMLI.  My PAUSE user name is
(ISTERIN).
I would like to register XML::SAXDriver::CSV and XML::SAXDriver::Excel,
which will complement XML::CSV and XML::Excel modules and allow SAX
interface access to this data transformation from CSV to XML.  The SAX
stream can then be pipee straight into either XML::XPath's SAXBuilder or
XML::DOM's SAXBuilder, to build an XPath or DOM tree from a CSV file.  I
discussed these modules with the ActiveState's XML mailing list and also
Matt Sergeant who is in fact participating in writting this module.  Please
register these namespaces so that I can release.

Thanks in Advance.

Ilya Sterin
