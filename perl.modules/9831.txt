I would like to set have a PAUSE account setup for me  (Peter Tschipper) so that I can contribute my  MQ::  modules designed for setting up send/receive quueus and monitoring them...Thanks. 

Though I happen to know what MQ (usually) stands for, maybe try to
unroll the acronym a bit: MsgQ? PMsgQ? PerlMsgQ?  Remember, the module
name must be "selling".  "MQ" is rather, uh, condensed.

(somehwat unrelated to naming) How generic/pluggable you system is?
Could someone use it easily for, say, email delivery?

Currently it will deliver messages read from either a socket (messages can come with message length headers or be terminated by some sort of message separator i.e. a "\n") or from files that are dropped in a send folder.   The data can be written to files that are kept monthly,daily,hourly etc.  and works well with generating HTML reports on the fly from data that is coming in from various sources.  This system is designed for quickly setting up production monitoring of all kinds of systems and as I mentioned all messages are guaranteed a delivery with no duplicates being sent regardless of any system or network outages.
