The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Monitoring::WindowPing
  DSLIP:       adhfg
  description: Access to window status information
  userid:      RPLESSL (Roman Plessl)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    Trac at http://oss.oetiker.ch/optools

  similar:

  rationale:

    > reasoning about the namespace choice:

    Win32::Monitoring::WindowPing

    As it is a Win32 only perl module the first part of the namespace
    is Win32. The functionality of the module is to monitor Windows
    application and part of some further monitoring module (will follow
    in the further uploads), so the second part of the namespace has
    been choosen to monitoring. The WindowPing describes in one word the
    functions of this module.

    > uniqueness of your approach:

    Have not found any Perl module which does the same functionality
    with the option to monitor all running Windows applications at the
    same time.

    > why you believe this module should be listed:

    This module is the first of a series of Win32 monitoring perl
    modules, which may be usefull for other people and sysadmins
    monitoring and logging their Windows applications.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::Monitoring::
::WindowPing      adhfg Access to window status information          RPLESSL
