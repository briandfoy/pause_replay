The repo is hosted at: http://perldoxygen.sourceforge.net/ and the project
has been registered with CPAN.  From what I can tell, the other attempts at
doing this have all been abandoned and none of them were ever registered
with CPAN.  The one written by Bart, that Mark's was based on, I have taken
over by permission from the current author as he has no time to work on it
anymore.

My version represents all new code and I am working with lots of users that
have made custom changes and hacks to the various past attempts in an effort
to make something pretty solid.  I hope to get version 1 out in the next
month with support for some percentage of Doxygen syntax and POD syntax.
