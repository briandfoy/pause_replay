Uploading is not censored on PAUSE, indexing is. Rocco was the first
to occupy CDDB namespace and without human intervention, he remains
owner.

At some point I'd like to start censoring uploads as well, because it
helps to spot error conditions earlier in the game.

This can easily happen (but doesn't happen very often). On PAUSE, the
uploaded files share a common incoming directory and people can point
to the wrong one and. No serious problem.
