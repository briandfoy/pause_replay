Subject: Module submission Net::DHCPClient

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DHCPClient
  DSLI:        adpO
  description: Interface to DHCP as a client
  userid:      JWALGENB (Josh Walgenbach)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Advogato (www.advogato.org)

  similar:

  rationale:

    I believe that DHCPClient should go under the Net namespace for
    obvious reasons.

    The module uses Net::RawIP to generate DHCP packets that allow
    extensive control of the requests made to the server. It was written
    primarily to build a DHCP walker for Indiana University to search
    for rogue DHCP servers on subnets where they ought not be.

    I think that other organizations that are centralizing DHCP
    services would be interested in the sort of utility that DHCPClient
    provides for both maintaining the service and doing load testing
    against the servers.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::DHCPClient      adpO Interface to DHCP as a client                JWALGENB
