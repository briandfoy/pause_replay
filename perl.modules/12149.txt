Dear Sir,

I am  CHRISTOPHER KOLADE, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of
Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you.

On June 6, 1997, an American Oil  Consultant/
Contractor  with the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, Mr. Robert Noel made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million US Dollars only)
in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no
reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally
we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Robert Noel
died from an automobile crash. On further
investigation, I found out that he died without making
a "WILL", and all attempts to trace his next of kin
was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr.Robert Noel did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents, including his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$25,000,000.00 only is still sitting in my Bank and
the interest is being rolled over with the principal
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come
forward  to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at
the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will
revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government  if
nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to
act as the next of kin to Mr.Robert Noel so that the
fruits of this old man's labourwill not get into the
hands of some corrupt government
officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide
immediately your full names and address so that the
Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and
affidavits which will put you in place as the next of
kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorney for
drafting and notarization of the "WILL" and to obtain
the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer. A Bank Account in any part of the world
which you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next
of kin. The money will be paid into your Account for
us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for
you.

There is no risk at  all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately via the private
addresses below. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and relevant documents
that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and  be rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply .

Thanks and regards.

CHRISTOPHER KOLADE
