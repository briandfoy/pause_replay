lcse:
largest
common
string
exodist

I appended exodist when I was writing the module for a class project,
and when I saw lcss was taken twice I decided to keep it to distinguish
it, I would not be apposed to changing it if necessary though.

Does it need to be capitalized? I did not see any notification of that
as a convention. Once again I apologise if I missed it somewhere and am
willing to make a change.
