Request to register new user

fullname: John Ulvr
  userid: JULVR
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I have a module which I would like to publish to CPAN. (The module
    is called unifdef+, which is a more powerful version of unifdef.
    Unlike unifdef, it will simplify expressions it cannot completely
    resolve, allowing the user to remove traces of the defined/undefined
    macros from the preprocessed code).
