Andreas,

I made new version (from various reasons called 1.04) which includes 
Makefile.PL (and test.pl as well). It was produced by make dist in XML 
directory. I hope that's packed well.

XML::XMLClean bug was of course fixed.

Please, prove, if new version is OK..I can't still see it on CPAN module list.

Please, also consider including link to   
http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~ken/perl_modules.html
where is quite good descibed how to create standart Makefile.PL, MANIFEST and 
so on.. I cannot find similar instruction on CPAN, and I think they are quite 
usefull for beginners.

Thanks

Petr Kubanek
