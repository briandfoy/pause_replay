The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Language::Dashrep
  DSLIP:       Rdpfa
  description: Dashrep, a descriptive programming language
  userid:      FOBES (Richard Fobes)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Google group (not yet set up)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Dashrep is a versatile descriptive programming language that I
    developed over many years of use in many projects. It is described
    at www.Dashrep.org.

    I have repeatedly looked at other first-level CPAN names -- besides
    "Language" -- but Dashrep does not belong in those categories.

    Verbally I asked CPAN-developer Eric Wilhelm if "Language::Dashrep"
    would be a good name choice, and he said yes.

    Clarifications: Dashrep is a language in the same way that XML is a
    language. Both XML and Dashrep provide a simple syntax without also
    specifying what names (e.g. tag names in XML or hyphenated phrases
    in Dashrep) will be used. Also note that neither XML nor Dashrep is
    executable. Although Dashrep can be used instead of a template
    language, Dashrep has many other applications that are not
    template-like. Note that I've written two books using Dashrep, where
    the hyphenated phrases indicate paragraph/character formatting. I've
    also used Dashrep to generate JavaScript code (for execution by
    Adobe Illustrator), so it can generate executable code (unlike XML).

The resulting entry would be:

Language::
