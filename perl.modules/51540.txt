The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Spline
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Calculate geographic locations btw GPS fixes
  userid:      MRDVT (Michael R. Davis)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Spline

  rationale:

    Geo::Spline can generate a 2D spline to calculate geographic
    locations between GPS fixes based on data elements of Latitude,
    Longitude, and Velocity at both end of a GPS track.

    I could not find another module that had the capabilities that I
    needed. As the cubic spline math is quite trivial, I did not try to
    re-write Math::Spline to support my requirements.

    I plan to leverage this module in Net::GPSD.

  enteredby:   MRDVT (Michael R. Davis)
  enteredon:   Tue Oct 31 19:33:24 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::Spline          adpOp Calculate geographic locations btw GPS fixes MRDVT
