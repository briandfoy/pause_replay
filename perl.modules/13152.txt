well, I didn't really plan on the module being used in the real world. 
  if the syntax were introduced into perl core I'd use it, but the 
idea of source filters on a production module scares me a bit.

I genuinely think that something is awry with 'no LWP 6.0.0' in perl 
core.  However, as I have no C skills, I can't back up that assertion 
with a patch that fixes things.  thus, the only thing I can do to 
further things on p5p is to become a nuisance :)

well, serious in a toungue-in-cheed kind of way :)

in all honesty, I whipped up the module thinking maybe somebody would 
notice it and maybe get inspired in some way or another - there seem 
to be a few modules in Acme:: that have some interesting properties 
that could apply in the real world.

of course, I don't have to release it at all either.  I was merely 
trying to remove the splinter from my mind...
