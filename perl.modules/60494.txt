The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::RelaxNG::Compact::PXB
  DSLIP:       cdpOd
  description: XML RelaxNG DOM data binding to perl objects
  userid:      MPG (Maxim  Grigoriev)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    this is submission for the new namespace designed to have multiple
    modules targeted on binding XML or RelaxNG DOM obejcts to perl
    objects. The DOM objects are provided by LibXML parser and RelaxNG
    Compact schema represented as perl data structures is supoprted for
    now. The first choosen namespace for this module -
    XML::RelaxNG::Compact::PMON was not good enough since name PMON is
    already taken by some monitoring project . PXB - Perl XML Binding
    sounds like a better choice. The module I am submitting right now
    will be dedicated to RelaxNG Compact binding, so any other data
    binding module will have an opportunity to have unique name as well.

  enteredby:   MPG (Maxim  Grigoriev)
  enteredon:   Wed May 14 15:51:02 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

XML::RelaxNG::Compact::
::PXB             cdpOd XML RelaxNG DOM data binding to perl objects MPG
