Can I have the Pdf namespace for a Pdf creation module I have written.  =
I have tried to contact the current person who has it, and they have not =
updated their module in over 5 years, also, the module fails many tests =
and is very limited in its utility.  I have a new Pdf module that is has =
a lot of utility for the perl community and is very easy to use to =
produce reports in Pdf.  It has a very small syntax, supports several =
image types, all of the built-in Adobe fonts, supports embedding of =
TrueTypeFonts and supports Unicode.  I have tables built into the module =
and a host of other options all designed to make printing reports from =
perl a snap.  All of the drawing routines are available as well as the =
ability to place, rotate, scale, skew, flip, fill and change the color, =
linewidths, color of linewidths on a fonts and graphics. =20

I can provide samples of the output, scripts and source that I intend to =
place on CPAN.

Thanks,
