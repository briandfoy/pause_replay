Hello,

I have some pathes ready for Net::Mosso::CloudFiles 
<http://search.cpan.org/%7Elbrocard/Net-Mosso-CloudFiles-0.43/lib/Net/Mosso/CloudFiles.pm> 
but can't get the author to respond (ACME / Léon Brocard). The tickets 
at RT are being ignored, I've sent him a pull request on GitHub twice 
(http://github.com/Htbaa/net-mosso-cloudfiles), sent him a PM through 
Twitter and have mailed him. Between every attempt of contact was at 
least 1 to 2 weeks. I can't track back when I've sent my mail, which was 
sent last, but that was at least over 2 weeks ago. I've been trying to 
contact him from the 8th of May this year, but no luck in getting a 
response.

Could you help me with the next step, whichever that is?

Another option would be to fork the module and rename it to something 
like Webservice::Rackspace::CloudFiles (Or Net::, but Webservice seems 
more appropriate) since Mosso changed their name to Rackspace quite a 
while ago.

My  PAUSE ID is CKRAS
