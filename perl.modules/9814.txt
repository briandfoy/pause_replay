The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Tie
  DSLIP:       Mmprp
  description: ISO dates made easy
  userid:      FGLOCK (Flávio Soibelmann Glock)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    date-time, reefknot, and perl-beginners mailing lists

  similar:
    Date::Calc, Date::Manip, Class::Date

  rationale:

    Makes a hash of 'date and timezone' parts: tie my %date,
    'Date::Tie', year => 2001, month => 11, day => 9; $date{year}++;
    $date{month} += 12; # 2003-11-09

    It makes very powerful, complex, and fast functions available to
    the beginner user: timezone translation, weekly calendars, date
    offsets and many more are VERY easy.

    I've got very positive feedback on this module, from people in
    companies like Agilent, France Telecom, from users in perl-beginners
    mailing list, and also from the maintainers of related modules.

    There are no bugs pending, and the API is stable.

The resulting entry would be:

Date::
::Tie             Mmprp ISO dates made easy                          FGLOCK
