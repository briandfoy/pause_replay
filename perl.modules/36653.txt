It looks like an interesting idea, although I would execute the 
module bits differently.

You don't need to create modules and packages and all that other
good stuff.  You can just create the POD stuff and install that.

Also, don't use a namespance that begins with a digit.  I'm not
convinced that the date is important anyway:  Just install
Software::Design::Harmful_GUI.  You can use the distribution 
version as the edition.

Good luck :)
