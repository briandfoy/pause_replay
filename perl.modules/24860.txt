     why:

    Innovative OPAC Library (the kind which is a building with books in
    it) interaction package. Many public and academic libraries use this
    OPAC, basically rendering their catalog and patron account website
    architecture the same. So it makes sense to me to write a Perl
    module for interacting with this architecture, supplying methods to
    search the catalog, check for items coming due, automatically renew
    items, etc..

    I already have some of this written, but I can't debug it for
    libraries I don't have accounts with. I'm hoping that by making the
    source available in several locations I can find others interested
    in helping to debug for more of the hundreds of InnOPAC sites.

    Once it's done, it probably belongs under the Biblio:: namespace,
    I'll ask around and figure that out later.
