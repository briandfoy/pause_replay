The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graphics::ColorUtils
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Easy-to-use color space conversions and more
  userid:      JANERT (Philipp K. Janert)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Graphics::ColorObject Color::Object Graphics::ColorNames Color::Rgb

  rationale:

    This module will provide helper functions to manage color. It will
    be useful when generating graphics using modules such as GD, Tk, or
    when generating HTML/CSS.

    The module provides three sets of features: - Color space
    conversion (RGB to HSV, etc) - Color gradients (useful for data
    visualization) - Color lookup by name

    The design objectives were: - A simple and intuitive API, which has
    a small enough footprint that it can be used inline in calls to
    other functions. - Platform independence (do not assume X11) -
    Minimal dependencies

    The code and documentation are available here:
    http://www.beyondcode.org/projects/index.html

    A proposal for discussion of this module has been posted to
    comp.lang.perl.modules on Mon, Nov 13 2006.

    Module name and namespace: Inclusion in "Graphics" seems to be
    obvious. The actual module name is not ideal - I would prefer
    something more descriptive than "ColorUtils". However, since this
    module bundles a number of utilities for the management of color,
    the name seems to fit. I don't think a more restrictive name, such
    as "ColorConversions", would be a better choice, but I welcome
    suggestions.

    Related modules and existing work: - Graphics::ColorObject (and
    Color::Object) do color space conversions, but using a very
    different API, much less suitable for the intended usage of the
    proposed module. - Graphics::ColorNames and Color::Rgb do
    color-for-name lookup. (There is real redundancy with ColorNames and
    the current module - should it be dropped?.) - No module offers
    color gradients (to my knowledge).

The resulting entry would be:
