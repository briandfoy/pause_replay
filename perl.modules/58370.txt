Based on your description and rationale, it sounds like you aren't
working with comparisons (e.g. for sorting). If you aren't mainly
working with comparisons, there is probably a better name for your
module. If you are working with comparisons mainly, then maybe your
description should say that. :)

It sounds like an interesting module once it gets the name that best
describes it. :)
