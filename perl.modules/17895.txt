To whom it may concern,

I am new to internet business and marketing.  I was completely ignorant =
of my wrong doings with this email and am totally ashamed at the =
results.

It all started when I purchased what I thought was a bonafide email list =
from an internet company in China but they ripped me off for $240 and =
never sent me the email addresses.  So... I purchased a web crawler to =
harvest email addresses from the web for marketing.  I got this spam =
letter from an internet business aquaintance in Canada that I trusted =
and I wanted to test my new email software before doing a legitimate =
marketing campaign for kayrels.com.  I did not know I was spamming.  I =
did not know the letter was a hoax.  I honestly believed I would receive =
about $3,000,000 from Bill Gates and I would be the one in the news.  I =
have been known to do some moronish things sometimes but this really =
takes not just the cake but the whole bakery.  I beg you sirs and madams =
to please forgive my thoughtless deeds and to please remove this web =
page from the internet.  =
http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg16668.html I assure =
you that I cannot go through the pain and agony of another spamming =
course.  And I want kayrels.com to be a fine establishment without spot =
or blemish.  This will never happen again.  Yuk, yuk, yuk, three times.


Most sincerely,

David S. Irish for kayrels.com

P.S.  Please reply with an email so I can know your repsonse to my =
request.=
