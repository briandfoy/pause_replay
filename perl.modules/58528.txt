Modules


Yesterday I uploaded an new version, 0.2.1, of Date::Components.  Something
is wrong.  The latest version on CPAN has reverted to 0.0.2.  This may be
due to this 0.2.1 release being produced with an updated version of '
versio.pm' I recently installed.  I noticed that previous releases I
uploaded have a 'v' character preceding the version number in the uploaded
file, whereas it is now gone in the '0.2.1' version I just uploaded.


Regards,

David McAllister
