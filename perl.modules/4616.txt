Description: Astro::Cosmology - this is a package of routines that
  allow access to a library of C routines (see note below) that 
  calculates various cosmological functions of interest. The Perl
  interface offers an OO interface where a Astro::Cosmology object 
  can access the different functions and can also convert between 
  a limited set of units based on the preferences of the user.
DSLI: cdcO
Module description: A module to access various cosmological functions

Note: The package is based on a well-tested set of C routines that
have been written by David Hogg at IAS, before uploading the package I
have to have his acceptance. The C routines have been documented in an
electronically published article and are widely used in the field.
