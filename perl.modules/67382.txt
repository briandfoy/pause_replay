The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::CloseKeepAlive
  DSLIP:       cdpnp
  description: Optimizes KeepAlive feature in Apache2
  userid:      MACKENNA (Craig MacKenna)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    mod_perl mailing list, PerlMonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module is a mod_perl2 fixup handler for the Apache2 server. It
    allows the server to be configured for "KeepAlive On". An
    accompanying script builds a DB of the number of .jpg (or other)
    files each .htm(l) file calls out. Using this DB and cookies,
    CloseKeepAlive decides when to close a particular connection. Given
    modern browsers that can open 6 or 8 connections to download
    supporting files, the KeepAlive feture needs such a control to
    prevent lots of Apache children from hanging, waiting for the
    KeepAlive timeout.

The resulting entry would be:

Apache2::
