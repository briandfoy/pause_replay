It may be. However, unlike SpreadSheet::(Parse|Write)Excel, this
module actually needs Win32 and PowerPoint, so I chose Win32::
to avoid probable misunderstanding that non-Win32 users can parse
or compose .ppt file with this module.

Besides, this module actually uses Win32::OLE and has several entry
points to start Visual Basic-like object oriented operations,
though they are not documented now. Probably I'll provide several
accessors including (Win32::PowerPoint object)->active_slide in
the future, to control PowerPoint app/presentation/slide fully.
However, we are perl programmers and don't want to dive into
the VB world too deeply. So I limited functions and hid the OLE
stuffs in shortcut methods and waited for requests to decide what
I should add (or disclose) and what I should omit. 

# (OLE object)->Presentation->ActiveSlide->... would be ok if you
# know PowerPoint well, but that's VB, not perl.

So, if someone wants to do something other than converting with
this module, I'll add its shortcut method with pleasure. I wrote
this to convert some Spor[kx] slides (and actually some feeds)
into PowerPoint slides but they may not be the only way to use
this. With some codes, it can append something to existing PP
slides, or extract something from slides.

But if you still think appropriate, I'll change its namespace or
the description, maybe. In the end you know perl and CPAN better
than me.

Thanks.
