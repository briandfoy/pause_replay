Yes, if you login to PAUSE, then select Delete Files from the sidebar. =
You'll get a list of all your files, each with a checkbox against it. =
Tick the ones to delete then hit the Delete button at the bottom. This =
schedules them for deletion 72 hours from that point, and you get an =
email from PAUSE.

If they're releases of dists that have more recent releases on CPAN, =
then it's not a bad idea in any way.
As you say, they're on BackPAN anyway.

It can actually be a very good thing, in the case where later versions =
have changed module names. Ask me offline if you're interested, but I =
suspect that you're not :-)

Cheers,
Neil
