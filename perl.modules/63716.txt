The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  rationale:

    Replacement for make on large perl projects. Similar to rake in
    concept, but no need to install and learn Ruby. The goal is to have
    a similar sytax to make when defining tasks (or rules in make),
    while bringing in the power of being able to write your rules in
    perl.

    Some tasks are just simpler to write as shell commands. Doing this
    in PPBS is just as easy as in make. In fact, shell tasks are easier
    than with make since there is no need to put a tab before each
    command. As well all the commands in the rule run in the same shell
    session.

    The ppbuild script uses a .ppb file to build a project. This is
    similar to make and Makefiles. .ppb files are pure perl files. To
    define a task use the Task, Group, or File functions. Give a task a
    desription using the Describe function.

    The first argument to any Task creation function is the name of the
    task. The last argument is usually the code to run. All arguments in
    the middle should be names of tasks that need to run first.

    The code argument can be a string, or a perl sub. If the code is a
    sub it will be run when the task is run. If the code is a string it
    will be passed to the shell using system().

    Very similar to make, a task can be for creating a single file, a
    group of other tasks, a set of shell commands, or a perl function to
    run. Each task will only run once per use of ppbuild. If a file
    alreasy exists the a file task will not run again.
