And lots and lots of Thanks for that:!

So now I've looked closer and must admit that I see no reasonable way
to fix this on the side of the indexer. The problem is, in short, the
fact that the namespace is declared in your META.yml but is not
directly reachable by perl because you have the namespace (using
abbreviated names for better visibility) A:S:C:W in the file A/S/C.pm,
not in the file A:S:C:W.pm.

So if we allow A:S:C:W to be indexed, we cause every other tool to
fail because they won't be able to find the namespace on disk even
when A:S:C is installed.

I'd suggest you move A:S:C:W into its own file. Is this feasible?

It's probably worth it to get this straightened out now and into the
normal indexer database than to delegate the causa to hope:)
