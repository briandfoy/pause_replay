The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Sudoku::OO
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Object oriented Sudoku solver
  userid:      COPE (Michael Cope)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Games::Sudoku::Cell Games::Sudoku::Board

  rationale:

    Games::Sudoku::Cell and Games::Sudoku::Board (both part of
    Games-Sudoku) are object oriented modules but take a procedural
    approach to actual solving.

    My module takes an object oriented approach to solving,
    representing the column, row and square as derivatives of a base Set
    class, which encapsulates the solving rules. The Board class is also
    composed of cells (which know what set they are in) and is only
    responsible for loading and updating the cells and interacting with
    the users. The sets themselves do the solving.

    The hierarchy is as follows

    Cell.pm Board.pm Set.pm Set/Column.pm Set/Row.pm Set/Square.pm

    I thought of putting this directly in Games::Sudoku, but there is a
    namespace clash and the approaches are incompatible, so even
    renaming the conflicting modules wouldn't make too much sense.
    Games::Sudoku::OO separates the namespace, makes the difference in
    focus obvious and matches the pattern from Math::Random::OO
    WWW::Pixie::OO etc.

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Sudoku::
::OO              adpOp Object oriented Sudoku solver                COPE
