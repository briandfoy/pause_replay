Hello,

I'm looking for a namespace, and to register for CPAN uploads.

Description of contributions:
	A collection of modules for working with the SWISH search engine.
	SWISH is a commonly used open source indexing search engine, and 
       development of swish has been active lately.  Version 2.0 has just
       been released. 
       http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/

       Proposing the `SWISH' namespace.


Name           DSLI  Description                                  
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- 
SWISH          adpO  Interface to SWISH-E search engine
SWISH::Fork    amp0  Driver for the Forked version of SWISH-E
SWISH::Library imcO  Driver for the Library version of SWISH-E
SWISH::Server  imcO  Driver for the SWISH-E server
SWISH::Stemmer bmcf  Access to the SWISH-E stemming functions
SWISH::Results impO  Provides methods to SWISH-E search results

An overview of the SWISH module can be found at
http://www.hank.org/modules/SWISH.html

The purpose of the modules is to provide a consistent and safe way to
access the SWISH search engine, to allow continued addition of features,
and to provide new methods of accessing swish (e.g. C library, and Swish
Server).

These modules have been discussed on the SWISH mailing list, and the
dbi-dev and dbi-users mailing lists.  There was discussion if these modules
might fit
under the DBD tree, but it was the consensus of almost everybody that they
should not be under DBD for a number of obvious reasons.
