Subject: Module submission Net::Blacklist::Client

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Blacklist::Client
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Queries IP and domain blacklists in parallel
  userid:      DAN (Dan Thomas)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::RBLClient

  rationale:

    This is a reworking of Net::RBLClient to update it to support
    lookups in domain blacklists as well as traditional IP RBLs, to make
    the interface a little bit more usable (well, my idea of 'more
    usable', at any rate - the interface to Net::RBLClient seems a
    little bit confused to be). Also to update the list of default RBLs
    that is rather outdated with lots of old, dead lists removed and
    many new ones added.

    It's no longer just an RBL client, as that terms seems to be used
    to refer to IP based DNS blacklists, whereas domain blacklists are
    more commonly (and incorrectly, imho) referred to as URIBLs. So I
    thought I'd avoid confusion and use the term 'Blacklist' instead.

    It might be worth mentioning that I'm doing a lot of work with
    blacklists at the moment, and will probably have some more related
    things to go under the Net::Blacklist namespace in the future..

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Blacklist::
::Client          adpOp Queries IP and domain blacklists in parallel DAN
