Subject: PAUSE ID request (DMALONE; Declan Malone)
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")

Request to register new user

fullname: Declan Malone
  userid: DMALONE
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnetraid/
     why:

    (note: this is re-submit of original request which I made almost a
    month ago!)

    Math::FastGF2 Fast Galois Field calculations (already written)
    Math::FastGF2::Matrix Matrix operations (in v0.02 of above; mostly
    written) Crypt::IDA Implement Information Dispersal Algorithm or
    Reed-Solomon codes using Math::FastGF2 (IDA part written, RS needs
    some work) Crypt::IDA::ShareFile Implement file format for storing
    and distributing IDA slices

    All sources are available from the SVN repository at the website
    listed above. Apologies for the re-submit, but nothing appeared to
    be happening with the original submission, and I noticed a lot of
    the most recent account setups were requested after my request...
