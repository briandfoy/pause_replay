The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       KGS
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: The Kiseido Go Server protocol docs and mods
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module famaily does not provide entwork connectivity, but
    deals with the kiseido protocol and protocol objects, including
    representation of complex objects such as boards. It also contains
    documentation about the (reverse-engineered) protocol that is
    computer-readable.

    The reasons for choosing KGS over Net::KGS is that it's not
    strictly network-related and doesn't fit well into any category.

  enteredby:   MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  enteredon:   Fri Nov  7 03:19:29 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

KGS               RdpOg The Kiseido Go Server protocol docs and mods MLEHMANN
