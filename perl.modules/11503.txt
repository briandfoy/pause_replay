Dear ActivePerl user,

This is an automated response to your recent question about ActivePerl.

We receive a large volume of email about many aspects of ActivePerl.
An overwhelming number of the questions relate either to issues that
are already well-documented, or of the kind that may receive a faster
response if sent to a more appropriate forum.  In the hope that it may
be of help in addressing your question, allow us to point out some
further sources of information:

 * ActiveState provides precompiled binaries of many Perl extensions
   from CPAN, including Tk.  These can be readily installed using the
   PPM tool included with ActivePerl.  For example, to install Tk after
   installing ActivePerl, you would simply type "install Tk" at the
   PPM prompt:

     C:\> ppm
     PPM interactive shell (1.1.4) - type 'help' for available commands.
     PPM> install Tk

   Running "perldoc ppm.bat" at the command prompt will show you
   detailed information about PPM commands.

   Simplified summary information on PPM is available at:

     http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/docs/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html

 * A complete set of documentation is included with your copy of
   ActivePerl.  You can also browse the documentation online at:
