Hello Andreas,

You have probably heard about the Sys::Syslog security problem that
affects Webmin (and is also linked to a bug in Perl's sprintf()).
Andy Lester and Nicholas Clark asked me to upload the version I was
working on on the CPAN, but as it currently is a core module (and
it looked like it has always been), I guess it won't be indexed.
PAUSE says that it is owned by "P5P" and "perl" which I guess are
special accounts for core modules.

Hence this mail to ask you whether you could add me as a co-maintainer
so that the module is indexed.

Thanks in advance
