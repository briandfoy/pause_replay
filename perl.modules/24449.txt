The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::UP::Notify
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Sends Net Alerts to Cell Phone Web Browsers
  userid:      PTIMMINS (Paul Timmins)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::SMS Net::SMPP Net::SNPP

  rationale:

    The reason I chose Net::UP::Notify is that there are modules
    (Net::SMS, NET::SMPP, and NET::SNPP) that do similar things to what
    my module does under the Net namespace already. I chose UP because
    the original browser in the cellular phone was made by a company
    called "Unwired Planet", which has become "phone.com", and now
    "Openwave" through acquisitions. I would rather not use phone.com or
    Openwave because of trademark concerns and because Openwave still
    calls their SDK (which is binary and requires Windows or Solaris)
    the "UP SDK". Openwave already distributes a perl module via their
    SDK that allows you to send Net Alerts, but the caveat in their
    approach is that it runs in Windows only, and uses COM Automation of
    a DLL from ActivePerl. Since this is incredibly not portable, I
    reverse engineered the format and made a version that simply
    requires LWP::UserAgent. I intend to eventually fully support a
    portable version of the SDK under the Net::UP tree, but for now I
    just have Net::UP::Notify. I wish I could retain interface
    compatibility with their example code, but it's so broken and
    convoluted because of the DLL automation that it would be
    impossible.

    Anyway, that's the story. :-)
