The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       GD::Thumbnail
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Thumbnail maker for GD
  userid:      BURAK (Burak Gürsoy)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Image::Thumbnail, GD::Image::Thumbnail, Image::GD::Thumbnail
    Image::Magick::Thumbnail, Image::Magick::Thumbnail::Fixed

  rationale:

    This a thumbnail maker. Thumbnails are smaller versions of the
    original image/graphic/picture and are used for preview purposes,
    where bigger images can take a long time to load. They are also used
    in image galleries to preview a lot of images at a time.

    This module also has the capability to add information strips about
    the original image. Original image's size (in bytes) and resolution
    & mime type can be added to the thumbnail's upper and lower parts.
    This feature can be useful for web software (image galleries or
    forums).

    This is a Yet Another type of module. There are several other
    thumbnail modules on CPAN, but they simply don't have the features I
    need, so this module is written to increase the thumbnail population
    on CPAN.
