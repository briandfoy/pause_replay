The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::ReadPasswd
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Asking the user for a password (for Win32)
  userid:      KTAKATA (Ken Takata)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Term::ReadPassword Term::Getch

  rationale:

    I think Term::ReadPassword is a good module to ask the user for a
    password, but it doesn't work under Windows. Term::ReadPasswd must
    be a solution for Windows users.

    The function of Term::ReadPasswd is very similar to
    Term::ReadPassword. Therefore, the name is also similar.

  enteredby:   KTAKATA (Ken Takata)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 20 13:19:43 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::ReadPasswd      Rdpfp Asking the user for a password (for Win32)   KTAKATA
