Indeed, I didn't consider Algorithm before. I wouldn't feel perfectly at
home with Algorithm::, but neither do I with Convert.

If I think about usage, I don't think anybody using this FEC module would
ever be interested in the algorithm (and for an algorithm I'd expect more
configurability).

So.... right now I still tend more to Convert, but that's because it's
meerly a tool for me.

But Algorithm is tempting, especially if other modules are already
there. But they have a slgihtly different feeling.

I guess I'll stay with Convetr because it's good either way and I'm too
lazy to change it :)

I'll think about it and tell the list tomorrow or so.

I didn't write the bulk of the code, just the perl interface...
