What did the e-mail[s] that PAUSE sent back to you look like?  The 
leading 'v' in the filename should have no bearing on whether it gets 
indexed (and it isn't strictly version.pm, but rather whatever packaging 
system you are using that chooses the filename).

You can forward the file you tried to upload to me at jpeacock@cpan.org 
and I'll take a look at it...
