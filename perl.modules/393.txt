Module Description: 
More like a proposal, really. WML (wireless markup language) is a valid 
XML subset developed by the WAP (wireless application protocol) Forum,
http://www.wapforum.org . I am building a library of functions to be
accessed a svirtual methods that will produce valid WML text through
the use of named paramter attributes.

While I realize B. Holzman's XML::Generator module would do an excellent
job of this, by building a specific subset of functions I hope to create
a library that enforces the WML standards as developed by the WAP
Forum, and therefore gives a helping hand in validation. These would
be similar to the CGI form functions of L. Stein's CGI.pm.

I think an appropriate name might then be XML::WML. 

I have not discussed this publically, but plan to send a message to 
clpm today to do just that. Nevertheless, thoughts and comments 
are appreciated.
