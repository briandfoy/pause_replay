ATTENTION:
To protect users from new worms the attachment in the e-mail that
supposedly sent (see below) was replaced with a dummy file.
The e-mail itself was delivered to the recipient. IF YOU DID NOT SEND THIS
E-MAIL JUST DELETE THIS NOTIFICATION.
Most probably, your address was found by the worm on an infected computer
and one of the generated by this worm letters contains your address in the
"From" field.
If you did send the letter in question, please be aware that three major
classes of attachments are now blocked for security reasons.
1. ZIP attachments with the name less then eight characters.
2. Predefined set of attachment names that current worms use for
propagation (BASF users should consult
iwww.basf-corp.com/nti_computersecurity/av/sender_notice.shtml for the most
recent version of the list.)
3. Executable attachments.
Users should comply with the policy BC003: distribution of pirated
software, obscene or defamartory attachments is prohibited.
