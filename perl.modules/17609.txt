Thank you for stepping forward. I'm CC-ing this to Stephen, the
current maintainer and Schwern because I seem to recall that Schwern
sent Stephen patches. I also sent patches to Stephen which I cannot
find anymore. Maybe Stephen, if you still have them, could you send
the patches to Jos to integrate them?

I ask y'all if there are any objections to passing maintainership to
Jos. If there are no objections till Wednesday, I'll take the
necessary steps on PAUSE to allow Jos official uploading for
Archive::Tar.

Thanks again,
