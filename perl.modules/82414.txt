The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Facter
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: collect facts about operating system
  userid:      DOZZIE (Stanisław Klekot)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Sys::Info Pfacter

  rationale:

    The target users of Sys::Facter are sysadmins. Sys::Facter is
    intended to provide them an easy-to-use infrastructure for detecting
    various things (so called "facts"), like number of CPUs, amount of
    RAM, partitions and LVM devices, NFS exports, SSH public keys,
    occupied TCP/UDP ports and so on. Such data could be then collected
    in a centralized place e.g. for keeping an inventory, used for
    generating configuration files or to calculate server load for load
    balancers. Some pre-defined modules would be available, but the most
    important thing is that sysadmin could easily add his own "facts",
    as a single developer can't think of every possible variable to be
    detected.

    While Sys::Info does a quite goot work in detecting parameters, it
    can't easily be extended by user and hence it's not usable this way.
    On the other hand, it could be used as a backend for Sys::Facter
    plugins.

    A good way would be to use Pfacter module. It provides a sensible
    API for plugins that fits to above-mentioned usage. Unfortunately,
    Pfacter practically doesn't have a usable documentation and its API
    for building tools on top of it is horrible.

    Sys::Facter utilizes Pfacter plugin API, while providing easier API
    for tools and contains POD documentation for both interfaces.

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::Facter          RdpOp collect facts about operating system         DOZZIE
