The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Attributes
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: manipulate metadata on files
  userid:      JROCKWAY (Jonathan Rockway)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    has been: File::ExtAttr TODO list; will be: CPAN discussion forum?
    etc.?

  similar:
    File::Attribute (deprecated), File::ExtAttr (to be replaced with
    File::Attributes::Extended), OS2::ExtAttr (to be replaced with
    File::Attributes::OS2)

  rationale:

    File::Attributes is an attempt to create a generic (OS and platform
    independent) way of manipulating extended filesystem attributes.
    File::Attribute (I'm the author of that too) sort of did this, but
    it didn't use the best available method -- it just littered the
    filesystem with .file.<attribute> flat files.

    File::Attributes uses Module::Pluggable to automatically load the
    best File::Attributes::* backend for the platform. That means that
    if your FS supports extended attributes, File::Attributes::Extended
    will be used. If it doesn't, File::Attributes::Simple will be used.
    If you write a File::Attributes::* module, it will Just Work and
    everything will be happy. No need to rewrite applications using
    File::Attributes.

    So basically, this module and its namespace serves to unify the
    multiple implementations of filesystem attributes so that end-users
    can just use them in their applications and have them work
    everywhere. Cool :)

The resulting entry would be:
