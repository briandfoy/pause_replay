The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::MPD::Common
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: a bunch of common helper classes for mpd
  userid:      JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    discussed on module-authors, msgid:
    20070527074522.GJ5780@mongueurs.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    poe::component::client::mpd and audio::mpd offer basically the same
    functionality: an interface to music player daemon. the former is
    poe-aware, while the second is not.

    they both use a set of classes to represent the states of mpd.
    those classes are agnostic of the run core (poe-aware or not), and
    then have been duplicated in both modules.

    in order to reduce code duplication, i've released
    audio::mpd::common, which is to be prereq by both modules.

    audio-mpd-0.18.0 is already prereq-ing and use-ing those common
    classes.

    poco-client-mpd will soon too. (around release 0.7.0)

  enteredon:   Wed May 30 15:39:00 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::MPD::
::Common          bmpOp a bunch of common helper classes for mpd     JQUELIN
