The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Reporter::Transport::Outlook
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: MS Outlook as transport for Test::Reporter
  userid:      ARFREITAS (Alceu Rodrigues de Freitas Junior)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I did this development as a new transport method for reports with
    CPAN::Report during distributions testing.

    The module Test::Reporter::Transport::Outlook will offer support to
    send reports through Microsoft Outlook by using Win32::OLE
    indirectly (actually it uses Mail::Outlook for that).

    I would like to registry the namespace because for each transport
    type there will be a unique namespace (the last part of
    Test::Reporter::Transport namespace).

    Thanks in advance, Alceu
