I sent this in early February - but did'nt get a reply.

I have written a module I use for maintaining replica's of files and
file structures in different file systems. I'd like to submit this to
CPAN.  Under the module naming convention it would look like this I
think.


Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
File::Repl     cDpO  File and File structure replication utility  DROBERTS


The utility has been written for Win32 - but has no dependencies on that
architecture.  I 'd appreciate any guidance / suggestions you can give.

Thanks


Dave
