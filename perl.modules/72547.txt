  i've written a module i'd like to contribute as DateTime::BizHrs
i've requested pause id GMORTEN

the module calculates elapsed "business hours" (i.e. the overlap of an 
interval and working hours, not counting nights, weekends, holidays). this is 
a deceptively tricky problem.

we'd previously tried to work with 2 other modules with the same basic goal, 
DateTime::BusinessHours and Time::Business but they both have problems. my 1st 
instinct in both cases was to fix them and submit the fixes, but it turned out 
that in both cases the code was kind of a mess, so i started from scratch.

incidentally, the DateTime::BusinessHours module doesn't apparently install 
for *anyone*. cpan testers list 1 success and 401 failures. is there a process 
for evicting modules that don't work and aren't maintained?

i think DateTime:: is the right namespace because a) my module can take 
DateTime objects as input, and b) it uses DateTime under the hood. make sense?

any feedback appreciated.
thanks,
jay

the README for the new module:

*DateTime-BizHrs

DateTime::BizHrs is used to calculate elapsed "business time" from a
start and end date. Only the portions of the interval that overlap
business hours on working days are counted (i.e. after hours, weekends,
and holidays are not counted).

Example use case: calculating support ticket metrics

There are a couple other cpan modules that claim to perform these
functions. However, our module has some advantages:
- clean code, with DateTime under the hood
- flexible interface with user-specified holidays, work day, and work week
- it works, as shown by extensive test cases.
- it installs! another cpan module with same basic goal has 1 pass and
     401 fails from cpan testers. wtf?

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install
