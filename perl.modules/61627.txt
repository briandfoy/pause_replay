Great!

There's no perfect way to change a module name. Essentially, upload one
last distribution of the old name, mark it with big red letters in the
POD that it's deprecated in favour of the new module name. If you want
to be extra-careful, add the new module as a dependency to the newest
version of the old one, so people just have to s/^Cookie/CGI::Cookie/.

I'll register the new namespace for you.

Best regards,
Steffen
