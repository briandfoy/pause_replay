You wouldn't need a Bitcard but a PAUSE (pause.perl.org) account. I
couldn't find yours with a quick search. Please register for the Perl
Authors Upload SErver.

Now, before we can give co-maintainership on behalf of an author, it's
necessary that we understand how you tried to contact the original
author. Usually, we request that people try to reach them by multiple
means like searching the web for email addresses, using the RT request
tracker (though that might be moot in this case) and posting to
high-traffic sites which the author might frequent. Then wait an
appropriate amount of time (author might be on holidays). Of course, you
might have done this already and quite some time has passed since your
original request. Any progress?

Best regards,
Steffen

P.S.: When and if we go through the whole process of transferring the
module, please make sure you comply with the license of the module and
include mention of your changes in the documentation. See
