G'day Brian,

SCUBA::Table::NoDeco it is then.  The module already allows you to 
choose which table to use at object creation, so further breaking down 
shouldn't be necessary.  However I only have PADI and SSI tables sitting 
on my desk at the moment.

The currently working interface looks a little like the following (both 
metric and imperial friendly):

my $stn = SCUBA::Table::NoDeco->new(table => "SSI");

print $stn->max_time(feet => 40);		# 50 minutes max

$stn->dive(metres => 18, minutes => 20);

print "Group: ",$table->group,"\n";		# Group D

$table->surface(minutes => 120);

print "Group: ", $table->group,"\n";		# Group C
print $stn->max_time(feet => 40);		# 29 minutes max

Cheers,

	Paul
