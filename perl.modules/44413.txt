This module might be better named as Text::Textile::HTML, possibly 
Textile::HTML or, maybe even (more exotically and arguably wrongly) 
Text::ile::HTML

There is a very strong tendancy to always have HTML in the module name 
if it is going to be generating HTML, and almost always at the end. 
Witness Pod::HTML et al
