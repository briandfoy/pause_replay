I'm in the process of finalizing the first (and of course incomplete)
versions of two modules.  I have a pause account (bluefeet), but want to
double check with everyone that these namespaces are good for me to use =
for
these modules.

Geo::Distance
   This will provide some core routines for checking the distance from =
one
set of lon/lat to another.

Geo::Distance::DBI
   This will use Geo::Distance routines against a DBI connection to find =
the
closest locations to a set lon/lat.  Uses some preliminary simplistic
calculations to speed up search.

These two modules together will be able to provide the functionality of =
the
Geo::PostalCode module plus much more since it is much more generalized =
and
can handle any type of lon/lat data and correlate them.

This is my first time releasing modules and I am very very excited.  I'm
also looking forward to people criticisms/feedback/patches.  Also, I =
will be
putting together a site with pre-indexed mysql tables with zipcodes,
counties, states, countries, etc.  Sorry - for now the code will only be
reliable in north america, but thats something that will be worked on.

Any feedback appreciated.

Aran
