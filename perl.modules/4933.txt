Description of Contribution
===========================

General Description:  Client modules for Peep:  The Network Auralizer. 
Peep is a network monitoring tool that represents network information 
via audio output. Network diagnosis with Peep is made not only based on 
single network events, but the network as a whole "sounds normal."  Peep 
doesn't beep at you and it certainly doesn't play a sequence of beeps. 
Rather, Peep uses sounds from natural environments. Sounds are mapped to 
arbitrary network events and are mixed together to create an overall 
sound ambiance. Because the sounds used are taken from natural 
environments, the resulting ambiance is pleasing to listen to (and can 
be tweaked to your preferences). Peep is also meant to be played as 
background. Because humans are very adept at noticing changes quickly 
and subconsciously, network monitoring with Peep won't interfere with 
other work.

Public Discussion of Peep
=========================

The above module is based on the Peep network monitoring tool written by 
Michael Gilfix (I recently rewrote the clients as Perl modules), which 
was recently covered in USENIX's ;login magazine and was the winner of 
the LISA 2000 best paper award (for a copy of the paper, see the link at 
http://peep.sourceforge.net/intro.html).

There are other modules I would like to submit in the not-too-distant 
future, including sports and tournament scheduling modules and an 
application server, but this is enough for now ;-)

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards from Colorado,

-Me
