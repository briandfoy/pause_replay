Well, ok then, would "Mail::Courier::Filter" be acceptable?  At least, I
would like to keep the "Courier::Filter" part in shape, because
"courierfilter" is an established name for a mail filtering concept in the
Courier world, so "CourierMTA::Filter" or something like that definitely
is out of the question.

PS:  Not to argue, but what's a font filter?  And doesn't carrying
messages imply it has to do with mail? ;-)
