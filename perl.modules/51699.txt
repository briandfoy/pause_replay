No.

Correct.

As far as PAUSE is concerned there is one rule that says /\d_\d/ in
the filename meanes it is a developer version that shall not be
indexed. Other than that no rules except a tight limit of allowed
characters.

You are allowed to change the version number:)

Depends how serious the error is for you, your users, and other CPAN
users. If it is serious, re-upload, otherwise ignore and fix on the
next upgrade.

See, the comment explains that a META.yml is a workaround.

Quite often there is none.

Apparently your index file was not recent enough.

Looks like all is fine.

  > I think BIOPERLML remains the owner even after I upload?

Yes. By uploading you cannot become owner for namespaces that already
have owners. You only become owner for new namespaces.

You need to make BIOPERL owner of any namespaces it doesn't yet own
and then make the next uploader comaint, correct.

Congratulation, well done,
