As I mentioned before, Sys:: has a phalanx against it. And I
wholeheartedly agree that the world is crazy wrt naming libraries. We
do inherit quite a lot of insanity from the outside world. And we came
repeatedly to the conclusion that there is some merit in using the
namespace that comes from the outside world even if decipherable only
to old hats or very young hats for that matter:-)

If I search for 'memory process' on freshmeat, I find LibGTop as 18th
hit. That's bad. Much better 'memory usage total processes' returns
only LibGTop. In this case I'd blame the bad search engine at
freahmeat that finding the library is so difficult.
