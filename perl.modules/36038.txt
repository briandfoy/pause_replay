The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::Webjay
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Interface to Webjay.org API
  userid:      SPACEMAN (Adam Blinkinsop)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://Webjay.org/

  similar:
    None known.

  rationale:

    Changed from previous request: Net -> WWW, WebJay -> Webjay.

    I don't know why I capitalized the Jay... The site image looked
    like the J was capitalized, and so, yeah :)

    I saw the Amazon code in Net with another module to access a site,
    and thought that's where they went - but hey, cosmetic change to
    fit, and follow good suggestions.

    The module is a simple frontend for the Webjay API that was just
    published a little while ago, and will be undergoing some changes
    (both the module and the API, I'm sure) as time goes on.

  enteredby:   SPACEMAN (Adam Blinkinsop)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov  1 08:32:00 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::Webjay          adpOg Interface to Webjay.org API                  SPACEMAN
