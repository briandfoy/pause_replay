The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sendmail::M4::Utils
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: sendmail M4 macro 'hack' creation and test
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am a system administrator who has to manage sendmail, writing M4
    hacks for inclusion in the sendmail.mc file is tiresome and error
    prone, this module combines several utilities to simplify this
    process and enable automatic testing of created macros. It is
    intended that the stop_fake_MX hack being developed currently will
    also be released within the Sendmail::M4 directory. The revised code
    is being written so that it will be useable from command line
    scripts and CGI web scripts, although only the testing parts will be
    of use to web users, possibly wondering why their mail has been
    refused.

  enteredby:   CML (celmorlauren limited)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug  3 10:40:53 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sendmail::M4::
::Utils           cdphp sendmail M4 macro 'hack' creation and test   CML
