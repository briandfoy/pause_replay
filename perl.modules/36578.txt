I understand that since you have made uploads of G::T you probably have
a user base and everything, but my modest please would be to go three
levels and call it Graph::GD::Template.  "Graph" as such is woefully
imprecise, and does not really lead people into "GD", unless they
already know G::T does GDy things.

(In here "Excel" and "PDF" are much more indicative of their purpose.)
