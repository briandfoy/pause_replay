Whoa, I think you're a) reinventing the wheel, and b) probably giving
your wheel an inappropriate name anyway :)

Michael Schwern's currently working on Archive::Any (a wrapper around
Archive::Zip and friends, I believe) so you might want to talk to him.

Even if you do go ahead with your module, I'd suggest *not* putting it
in the Software:: namespace.  We don't have any such top-level namespace
at the moment, and this doesn't seem like an adequate reason to start
one.  Also, "Software" isn't the important thing about your module (hey,
*every* module is about software, in a sense); "Packaging" is the
important thing.  Now, it happens that we don't have a top-level
Package:: namespace anyway, but we do have Archive:: which serves the
same kind of purpose.  That's why I'm suggesting you go for
Archive::Something.

K.
