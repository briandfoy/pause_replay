The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::CableModem::SURFboard
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to Motorola SURFboard cable modems
  userid:      RUZAM (Scott Mazur)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    As far as I can tell there are currently no other modules that
    interface to cable modems. A cable modem (such as the Motorola
    SURFboard) is a unique device in that it contains a user accessible
    web interface. The Device::CableModem space feels very appropriate
    for such a device. In the large world of cable modems, I suspect
    there are many other manufactures, each with their own ideas of a
    web interface. Therefore it also feels appropriate to further
    defined the name space down to the planned name of
    Device::CableModem::SURFboard. I'm not aware yet of any Motorola
    cable modems outside of the SURFboard model that have a web
    interface, so I don't feel it's necessary to further divide the name
    into Device::CableModem::Motorola::SURFboard.

The resulting entry would be:

Device::CableModem::
::SURFboard       RdpOp Interface to Motorola SURFboard cable modems RUZAM
