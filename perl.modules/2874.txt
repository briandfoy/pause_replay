Yes, but we've not yet reached that finite point.

No one would ask you to remove it.  But it is the responsibility of anyone
uploading a package to CPAN to check to see if the name is in use.  You can
use http://search.cpan.org/ to quickly and easily check, or run it past
this mailing list.

This one is a special case, though.  Sean's (formerly Gisle's) distribution
uses a name that does not exist in the package itself.  I think that is a
mistake, too.  I'd rather the package were called HTML-TreeBuilder, since
that's the nae of the module.  Oh well.

Thanks,
