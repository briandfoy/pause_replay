The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Locate
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: cache multiple file searches done in paths
  userid:      DORNER (Thomas Dorner)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Find

  rationale:

    File::Locate is a Perl module to cache filenames and directories
    for multiple file searches so that your script only has to browse
    the appropriate directories once. To achive this, it mainly uses a
    hash containing filenames and their corresponding directories.

    I used this module for a script analyzing a big tree of source
    modules. After introducing this modul, the process of locating the
    scattered include files was notably faster than before. (The include
    statements of the modules didn't contain directory informations.)

    File::Find works the other way around, you must know before
    starting which files you are going to need.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
