Good morning! 

I've uploaded Tie-Discovery-1.00.tar.gz to my directory on CPAN (ID SIMON),
and I'd like it considered for inclusion in the modules list. It's a simple
module which provides a way of doing `discovery programming' finding out data
only when needed.

Suggested entry:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Discovery      Rdpr  Discover data by caching sub results         SIMON

By the way, is this the correct way to submit these requests, or is there a
better way?
