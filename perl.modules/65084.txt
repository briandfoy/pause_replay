The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Religion::Bible::Regex
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Regex library for Bible References
  userid:      HOLMLUND (Daniel Holmlund)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Religion::Bible::Reference

  rationale:

    I work at a publishing company and we've used these Perl classes to
    automate tagging Bible references in a variety of formats. The first
    part of this project is a Builder Object which constructs a series
    of regular expressions for parsing Bible references based on
    language, books, abbreviation and versification. The following parts
    are tools (taggers, reference checkers, etc ...) that are built
    using the regex builder. I know there are other groups who would
    benefit from using this code, and that is why I'm putting it on
    CPAN.

The resulting entry would be:

Religion::Bible::
::Regex           RdpOp Regex library for Bible References           HOLMLUND
