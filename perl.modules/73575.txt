It's awesome!  Thank you!

I'd still like to see a "delete" button added to the request detail
page (or a delete link added to the PAUSE request emails) so I can
kill the obvious spam without needing to load up that page.

Much lower priority: I'd also like to have a way to respond via email
to a person requesting an account in case it's not clear if they're
spam or not.  Right now, that seems like a complicated process since
we keep the email censored off the mailing list postings.
