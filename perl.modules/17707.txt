I just fixed it for you. What happened was that Damian still was
registered as the primary maintainer of Regexp::Common::Entry. I
deleted that record and ran the indexer again against 2.109. The
indexer then registered you as the maintainer.

The reason why you never received such reports before is that PAUSE
did not have them before yesterday. They are now there to shake
exactly such little bugs out of the index.
