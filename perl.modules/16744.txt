The first release of my distribution was posted to CPAN on Sunday night,
just prior to sending my original message to the modules list (as was
strongly recommended).  All of the documentation that I have written to
date is in the POD for the DBIx::Portable module.  It can be seen at
"http://search.cpan.org/author/DUNCAND/DBIx-Portable-0.01/Portable.pm".

I admit that the documentation has large gaps in it, but you should be
able to get a lot more information from that than just what is in the
"Description" that I reprinted, including some representative examples.
This is also a documentation-only release, so I wasn't going to implement
until I had a design that was thought out; you can't run it yet.

I was pushing myself for a Jan 5th (end of my winter vacation) first
upload no matter the progress, which would explain the gaps, as well as
the "c/pre-alpha" development status.  My next few releases, both due
before the end of January, should see the completion of the main
documentation and example code.  I may have a basic implementation by then
as well (enough to make the examples work).  Suffice it to say that there
will be significant but not paradigm-shifting changes in the mean-time.

If the current POD doesn't provide enough information then I will re-apply
for registering the module later, when there is more.  Until registration
is complete, I will continue to make uploads as DBIx-Portable, as a
temprary name, so to avoid adding more clutter (temporary names) on CPAN.

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
