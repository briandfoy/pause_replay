contribution:    I have created a nice little script, one of my first, =
that allows me to search for any book or item at Barnes and Noble. =
Several ideas came together in one script. This script allows me to find =
search for book titles on the fly. It also allows me to create a =
database of my books by barcode scanning their ISBN numbers. I have =
tried to make this script as robust as possible for my own uses. I use =
this script or a modification of it, every week, to find some tidbit of =
information from some web site.

I would be happy to contribute my little piece of code to the greater =
good.
