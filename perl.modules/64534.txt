Subject: Module submission Net::NAT::PMP

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::NAT::PMP
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Poke holes in a router's NAT
  userid:      DAVID (David Caldwell)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    In my quick search of CPAN I didn't see any modules that
    implemented the NAT-PMP protocol
    (http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cheshire-nat-pmp-03). I put it
    under Net:: since it's a network protocol. I called it NAT::PMP
    since it is commonly referred to as NAT-PMP and Net::NATPMP looked
    bad.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::NAT::
::PMP             adpOp Poke holes in a router's NAT                 DAVID
