The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ADT
  DSLIP:       cdhhp
  description: Abstract Data Type top level
  userid:      ABERGMAN (Arthur Bergman)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    IRC #poe

  similar:
    List::* Heap::*

  rationale:

    There is a need for a new set of data type modules on CPAN that
    allows abstract defined interfaces to data types with multiple
    implmentations.

    This comes from an attempt to remove the some Queue and Priority
    Queue code from POE, and making it possible to switch implmentations
    for different types of data.

    The current data type modules are spread out all over, they also
    lack a standard interface, and many are, frankly extremely poorly
    implemented.

    ADT stands for Adstract Data Types.

  enteredby:   ABERGMAN (Arthur Bergman)
  enteredon:   Thu May 16 09:17:52 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

ADT               cdhhp Abstract Data Type top level                 ABERGMAN
