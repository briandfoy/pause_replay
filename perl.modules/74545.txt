All of these modules seem like they could have sensible names.

If you want to dump them into a top level namespace, might I suggest
KAN:: please? Util:: is meaningless and I really don't want people to
see that as a precedent.

Please, *please* stop uploading into Util:: and let's talk about *good*
names for your code. I really want it on CPAN, but the current names are
really not a good idea.
