The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XPKG
  DSLIP:       ampfp
  description: Generic Package Management
  userid:      PMICHAUX (Peter Michaux)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc

  similar:

  rationale:

    The xpkg tools are designed as a generic package management system.
    It is similar to Perl's cpan, Debian's apt, and other
    project-specific package management tools. With the xpkg command
    line tool a user can manage several different package sets. Each
    package set may be for a different set of package repository
    sources, different languages, different versions of a language, etc.
    Developing project-specific package management tools is a large task
    and many projects which could benefit from such tools do not have
    them. xpkg is intended to fill this need.

    The XPKG module is analogous to the CPAN module. The CPAN namespace
    is not nested under some other root-level namespace so it seems
    package management doesn't have a root level namespace XPKG could
    nest. This is the reason for requesting a new XPKG root-level
    namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

XPKG              ampfp Generic Package Management                   PMICHAUX
