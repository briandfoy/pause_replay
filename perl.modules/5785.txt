Well, Gerald, sorry, but it does not really fit best into Net::,
because Net is a pretty generic term whereas HTTP is a pretty specific
term. And specific is better. It's a problem shared by Net:: and
Text:: namespace (on similar ground we generally tend to reject Sys::
namespace).

So if you could just take over HTTP::Dav that would be a better
alternative. If this is inconvenient, HTTP::Webdav looks better to me
than any choice in Net::
