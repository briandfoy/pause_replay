File::Compare is only mine for historical reasons - I did not write 
the original or maintain it in any reasonable sense. 
It is part of core perl these days.

As File::Compare is a core module putting experimental features in it
is probably not wise.  

Suggest you start a new module - or perhaps give one of the String::
modules you list some file behaviour?
