     why:

    I have just finished packaging a logging module which supports
    logging to console, file, sql database and to multicast via a custom
    multicast daemon.

    I am presently working on a module for working with the new VMWare
    Vix Perl API. This module will simplify performing bulk operations
    on a VMware host, such as suspending all guests which are in a
    specified power state.

    I have a number of libraries for managing tape and optical
    jukeboxes which I am hoping to package for CPAN.

    I have several DBI Data warehousing modules for Oracle which I
    would like to contribute when time permits.
