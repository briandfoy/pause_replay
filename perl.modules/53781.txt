Hello,

Pause ID: HACKER

Net::XMPP has not been updated in over two years and has bugs. I
received no response trying to contact author. I asked on the
jdev@jabber.org list and was told that the author was not maintaining
any of his projects at Jabberstudio.org, which is now closing.

Here is the change log for 1.02:
1.02
===
 - Fix bug in Stanza::_xpath_defined causing defined to pass when it shouldn't
   which broke GetTimeStamp and likely other things.
 - Added test get_time_stamp.t
 - Copied *X subs from Net::Jabber::Message to Net::XMPP::Message
 - added debugging in some Protocol subs that didn't have it, but not all
 - disabled CODE checking in Protocol-Callback subs to be POE compatable
   Should be put into registration, not on callback, but didn't do that yet
 - changed mytestlib.pl to output more concise test names
 - switched to Module::Build.

I've also included changes from a 1.01 versions that was on
Jabberstudio.org but were never uploaded to CPAN.

I have a module dependent on Net::XMPP to upload that crashes
sometimes without this bug fix in 1.02.

Thanks.
