     why:

    The primary project I had planned on contributing is described in
    the following. There is the possibility that I'll find other things
    to contribute in the future.

    Project Description:

    X11::GUITest is a GPL'd Perl package intended to facilitate the
    testing of GUI applications by means of user emulation. It can be
    used to test/interact with GUI applications which have been built
    upon the X toolkit or those built upon toolkits (i.e., GTK) that
    "wrap" X toolkit's functionality.

    Difference From Existing Solutions:

    Existing solutions such as xmacro or xautomation seem to be
    cumbersome to implement and maintain use of.

    Implementation:

    The Perl package (X11::GUITest) exports the necessary higher level
    functions to perform GUI interaction through user emulation. Example
    functions exported: SendKeys, FindWindowLike, WaitWindowLike,
    StartApp, RunApp, ClickMouse, IconifyWindow, UnIconifyWindow,
    RaiseWindow, IsWindowViewable, GetChildWindows, etc. There are
    currently about 10 more functions in addition to this...

    Inspiration:

    Inspiration for this project came from my development work on the
    GPL'd Win32::GUITest package.

    Libraries Used:

    Xlib, XTest

    Programming Language:

    Perl, C

    Operating System Support:

    I have developed the package under Linux without using any Linux
    specific technologies, so as the name of X11::GUITest implies(->
    X11), I'll be happy to help support and modify my package to work on
    any Operating System that provides a compatible X server, such as
    FreeBSD.

    Enhancements:

    I plan on maintaining enhancements to this package and welcome
    community involvement in doing so.

    Thank You,

    Dennis K. Paulsen
