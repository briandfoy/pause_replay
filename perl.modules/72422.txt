The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Git::HomeSync
  DSLIP:       cdpnp
  description: Sync your home directory with Git
  userid:      TSTANTON (Tommy Stanton)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    AnnArbor.pm, LosAngeles.pm, ThousandOaks.pm

  similar:

  rationale:

    A program provided by this distribution, "git-home-sync", is used
    to automate the git/system commands necessary to get a user's home
    directory to be synced with a git repository. This allows the user
    to track things like dot files, making them available on a brand new
    machine. For example, your ~/.vimrc and/or ~/.emacs will always be
    the same on all machines that you use.

    For more background information, see
    "20100430-Tommy_Stanton-Sync_Your_~_With_Git" at:
    http://tommystanton.com/presentations/

    Also, a good article on this idea is at:
    http://joey.kitenet.net/svnhome/

    Quotes from the article: "I don't care if it's a PC clone, or a
    Mac, or a S/390 virtual machine; if it's not set up the same as all
    the others, if I cannot concentrate on the important differences
    instead of being distracted by the unimportant differences, then I
    will be less productive."

    "I actually keep most of my home directory in git now. Go figure.
    :-) I have not updated the above svn.kitenet.net urls, since
    references to git ones would not fit very well in the article, but
    see git.kitenet.net for the git versions of everything."

The resulting entry would be:

App::Git::
::HomeSync        cdpnp Sync your home directory with Git            TSTANTON
