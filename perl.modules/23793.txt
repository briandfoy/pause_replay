Hello,

I'm a new CPAN contributor (BRADFITZ) and need help picking a name for a
module.

I'd like to upload the client library for memcached.  (which is in use by
LiveJournal, Slashdot, soon Wikipedia, and others...)

    http://www.danga.com/memcached/

Currently, I call the perl module "MemcachedClient", but I don't want nor
expect to keep that name.

Suggestions?

The people using this library have suggested:

   IPC::Memcached
   IPC::MemCached
   Cache::MemCached
   Cache::Memcached         (* my preference)

It doesn't feel like IPC, though.  No more than any other client/server app.

And it's not part of the Cache::Cache modules (though somebody could write
a Cache::Cache wrapper to use MemCached if they wanted that interface).
Yet... neither is Cache::Mmap.

Or, perhaps remove the "Client" and make it a new package in the Database
section a "Memcached"?

FreeBSD and Gentoo package it as a database, iirc.

Suggestions?  If I don't hear anything (noted in "04pause.html"), I'll
upload it as "Cache::Memcached", but I'd feel better with an ack, as I'm a
newbie here.

The module (without customary CPAN wrappings) is at:

   http://www.danga.com/memcached/dist/temp/MemCachedClient.pm

I need to remove the state inside the package, per the style guidelines.
Any other suggestions?


Thanks!

- Brad
