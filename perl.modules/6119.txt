The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::TraceMethods
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Module for tracing specific method calls
  userid:      CHROMATIC (chromatic)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=84134

  similar:
    Devel::TraceFuncs

  rationale:

    Devel::TraceMethods provides a simple mechanism to trace method
    calls within a package. Users can specify their own logging
    function. This does not require debugging hooks, has low overhead,
    and can affect as many or as few methods as desired. It also
    respects inheritance.

  enteredby:   CHROMATIC (chromatic)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun 13 22:34:21 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
::TraceMethods    bdpOp Module for tracing specific method calls     CHROMATIC
