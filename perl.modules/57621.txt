The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Editor::Easy
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Syntax highlighting editor
  userid:      GROMMIER (GROMMIER Sébastien)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Will people discuss about it ?

  similar:
    Maybe Text::Editor::Vip

  rationale:

    This module should be called like this :

    use Text::Editor::Easy; my $editor = Text::Editor::Easy->new();

    The interface of the module is very intuitive but is, already, very
    powerful. I use only "Editor" objects to create an Editor program. I
    can redirect events, create threads that will manage new methods for
    the Editor. I can access to the same "Editor" object concurrently
    from different threads with the same high level interface. Everybody
    will be able to create his own extension for syntax highlighting
    (perl is the very best for parsing text files). In short, this
    module could make the creation of any kind of multi-threaded
    graphical applications simple even though the graphical layer is not
    multi-threaded (Tk is definetely not at present!).

    That's why I think this module should be listed in the module list.

    In fact, I wasn't interested in writing an Editor in pure perl. I
    wanted (and still want) to write a generator of applications that
    could be modified dynamically, that is to say, during the time they
    are running. This is only possible with a few dynamic langages.
    Still, to make that seriously, you need to integrate an editor in
    your generated program. Open source programs that show you only the
    part you want to see and that allow you to modify it if this part
    doesn't do what you want. Maybe everything will have to be written
    again ... in perl ! Developpers are the most numerous (or most
    serious) users of all kinds of applications, but most applications
    are made as if all their users where stupid. I see that everyday in
    my work and in expensive softwares.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::Editor::
::Easy            cdpOp Syntax highlighting editor                   GROMMIER
