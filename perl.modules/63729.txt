PAUSE folks -

It's been several years since I logged into PAUSE and I no longer recall my=
 password and the email address associated with it has been out of commissi=
on for about as long. Can you please update Config::IniFiles to allow Shlom=
i Fish (cc'd here) permission as the maintainer.

Also, would you please update my PAUSE account (WADG) to use the gmail addr=
ess that I've cc'd here as well?

Thanks,

Jeremy Wadsack
