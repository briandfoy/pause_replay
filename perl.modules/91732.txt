The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::StockAccount
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: Analyze personal stock account transactions
  userid:      JREFIOR (John Everett Refior)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I posted about the namespace on perlmonks.org and prepan.org. At
    first I wasn't going to put it under Finance, but it was suggested
    that I should. I was also going to use the name
    PersonalStockAccount, but it was a little long and the were Personal
    seemed redundant. After considering responses, looking at different
    options, thinking about it, developing it, and writing documentation
    for it, I landed on Finance::StockAccount.

  enteredby:   JREFIOR (John Everett Refior)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov  5 12:45:14 2014 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::
::StockAccount    bdpO2 Analyze personal stock account transactions  JREFIOR
