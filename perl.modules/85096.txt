That's why I think we make the parallel to our process and criteria
for 'taking over'.  I.e. author not responsive.  If the author is
responsive, then PAUSE admins take no action.

The requesting party and a responsive author can discuss the situation
and see if the author voluntarily wants to make ADOPTME comaint, or
change the documentation to note the support status, or whatever else.

Making ADOPTME comaint would be different from an author transferring
*primary* to ADOPTME -- possibly more attractive -- because with
ADOPTME as comaint, the author maintains control but has a way to
indicate they can't keep up and want a new maintainer.
