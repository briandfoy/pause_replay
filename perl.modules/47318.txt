I'm afraid I still haven't heard back from Martien.  I sent him a  
follow-up note earlier this week, but I'm not particularly optimistic  
about hearing from him any time soon.

I went ahead and uploaded a new version of GD::Graph back in December  
(then another one more recently, with a couple more bug-fixes in it),  
which you can see here:

http://search.cpan.org/~bwarfield/GDGraph-1.4306/

(Oddly enough, it does show up if you search for GD::Graph in  
distributions, but not if you search in modules.  Clearly I don't  
fully understand the way the CPAN indexer works, but that's hardly  
surprising.)

So I guess this is when I ask to be added as a co-maintainer for the  
GD::Graph modules--assuming it still seems like a good idea, just let  
me know anything else I need to do, and when to do it, and I will.
