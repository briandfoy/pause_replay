I'm having trouble transferring control of Reddit::Client from me
(JEFFOBER) to EARTHTONE. I've made them co-maintainers, but they are
apparently still getting permissions errors when uploading new tarballs. I
would ideally like to wash my hands of it and make him the owner of the
namespace, but when I click on that in PAUSE, it just forwards me to the
main page displaying an explanation of each menu option. Any ideas on how I
can transfer ownership of a registered namespace?
