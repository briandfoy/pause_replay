The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::Exchange
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Interface to MS Exchange Server
  userid:      SMANROSS (Steven Manross)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:
    perl-win32-admin@listserv.activestate.com,
    perl-win32-users@listserv.activestate.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is a Win32 specific module, and is technically just a wrapper
    for some OLE calls that have been floating around the listservs
    mentioned above for years that have been modified, and added to. The
    intent is to harden a solution for anyone looking to perform these
    functions with Microsoft Exchange server in the future.

The resulting entry would be:

Win32::
::Exchange        adpOg Interface to MS Exchange Server              SMANROSS
