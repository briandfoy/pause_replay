Hi Chris & Ashley,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m working on resolving sit=
uations where there are split and/or missing indexing permissions on CPAN=
 distributions, and where there is conflict between two or more distribut=
ions. These came about historically for a number of reasons, including (1=
) packages were treated case insensitively, but we then realised that cau=
sed problems, and (2) when co-maints did releases, they=E2=80=99d get fir=
st-come on new packages, so you=E2=80=99d get split ownership, and if one=
 of the owners transferred, then it could become a mess.

Chris, you have both Qt and Qt4 on CPAN. Most of the permissions have bee=
n dropped on the packages in Qt, and the contents of the two distribution=
s are similar enough that I suspect Qt4 was meant as a successor to Qt=3F=
 If that=E2=80=99s true, it looks like we could delete your Qt release fr=
om your author directory, which will remove it from CPAN=3F There are som=
e packages in the index again the older release Qt4-0.60=5Fb1.tar.gz whic=
h have no indexing permissions. Deleting that release, and leaving just t=
he latest release, will clear up most if not all of the indexing permissi=
on issues on Qt.

Ashley, some parts of your early releases of =22Qt=22 are indexed, but it=
 looks like you then renamed your Qt distribution to be PerlQt, and PerlQ=
t was subsequently taken over by Germain Garand (GGARAND) =E2=80=94 is th=
at right=3F If so, then we could delete the early releases of Qt from you=
r directory, and probably the early releases of PerlQt, since they=E2=80=99=
ve been superseded by Germain=E2=80=99s releases.

Are you both ok with me scheduling deletion of your old releases please=3F=
 That will resolve some if not all of the problems. If I go ahead, you=E2=
=80=99d both get confirmation from PAUSE when I schedule the deletion, an=
d the deletion itself wouldn=E2=80=99t happen for 3 days (72 hours), so y=
ou have a chance to change your mind as well.

Thanks,
Neil
