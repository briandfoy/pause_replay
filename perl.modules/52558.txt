The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ensembl::Web::Record
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Manages user data in a database.
  userid:      MJW (Matt Wood)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.ensembl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Many web sites now encourage users to register and login to access
    more advanced features, and to customise a site to their needs.

    The EnsEMBL::Web::Record group of Perl modules is design to manage
    any arbitrary type of user created data in an SQL database. This
    module follows the Active Record design pattern, in that each new
    instantiated Record object represents a single row of a database.
    That object can be manipulated programatically, and any changes made
    can be stored in the database with a single record->save function
    call.

    Because arbitrary Perl data structures can be stored in this
    manner, EnsEMBL::Web::Record allows user preferences to be easily
    saved, and allows developers to implement new featurs quickly.

    This module was first used (and has been abstracted from) the
    Ensembl genome browser.
