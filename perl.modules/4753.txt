I find Getargs confusingly similar to Getopts, considering that we often
refer to 'command line arguments'.  Also, it doesn't actually return the
parameters the way Raphael's module does, it simply validates them, so
there's really no 'getting' happening at all. You're responsible for
assigning them to a hash or individual scalars or whatnot.
