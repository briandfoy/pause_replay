Dear Modules,

I feel many of the visitors to my web site 
http://www.NewJerseyHomeInspection.com may also be interested in the 
information your web site provides.

I would like to place a link to your site along with a description at: 
http://www.NewJerseyHomeInspection.com/Financial-Planning.htm and to 
get a link to my site from yours.  

My link pages are too new to have page rank. Since my home page is a 
PR4 the page rank of my link pages is sure to rise during the next 
update.

If you would like to swap links please reply to this email with your:
Title text:
URL:
and Description:

Should you have any other cross-promotion ideas, let me know.

During the next few weeks I will be dropping all the listings that are 
not providing me with back links so the number of links off each page 
will drop to a very small quantity.

I would appreciate if you placed a link back to my site:

Title: New Jersey Home Inspection NJ
URL to Link to: http://www.NewJerseyHomeInspection.com
Description: New Jersey Home Inspection Directory where you can find an 
inspector for the home you are planning to buy in New Jersey
