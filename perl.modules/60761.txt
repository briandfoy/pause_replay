Subject: Module submission MooseX::Struct
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::Struct
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Struct-like interface for Moose Objects
  userid:      JSOVERSON (Jarrod Overson)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    #moose on irc.perl.org

  similar:
    Class::Struct

  rationale:

    The module provides a pass-through to Moose's functions and
    primarily exists as a method of more elegantly defining the
    structure of Moose-based objects.

    The namespace was chosen because it has a similar interface to the
    core Class::Struct and, in most cases I have witnessed, could be
    used as a drop-in replacement (while, of course, providing a lot
    more functionality).

  enteredby:   JSOVERSON (Jarrod Overson)
  enteredon:   Sat Jun  7 01:20:25 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::
::Struct          Rdpfp Struct-like interface for Moose Objects      JSOVERSON
