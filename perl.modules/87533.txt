The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::TPP
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A simple perl interface to the TPP API
  userid:      MATTVINK (Matt Vink)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  similar:

  rationale:

    This simple module provides an object-oriented interface to use the
    web-based TPP (domain registrar) API with your TPP account for
    various domain functions, like registering & transferring domains.
    http://www.tppwholesale.com.au/api.php

    Many other CPAN modules use the Net::* namespace for network APIs,
    I hope it is acceptable to also use this same space. TPP is the name
    of the registrar, it is a unique name that should (hopefully) not be
    confused with other namespaces nor have any ambiguity.

    The module is simple itself, but it makes using the API clear with
    the method calls used - eg $tpp->register_domain() Further
    justification for this module being required is that TPP do not
    offer a 'test mode' for which to use if you are developing something
    to interface with their API. This module has been tested and has
    worked with live data and will give predictable outputs, saving
    other developers that trouble.

The resulting entry would be:
