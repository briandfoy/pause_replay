That's the funniest thing I've seen in weeks. Next thing we now is that 
Fcntl has been marked as being in the "i"dea stage for fifteen years ;)

On a more serious note, thanks, Zefram, for taking over and thanks, 
Jarkko for your long-time contributions. I hope this isn't the entirely 
last we see of you. If anything, I'll have a bottle of Talisker waiting 
if you ever come by south-west Germany.

Best regards,
Steffen
