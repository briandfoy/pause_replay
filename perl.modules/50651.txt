Hi All,
I am fairly new to Perl and CPAN. I have created  a module and want to 
package it for distribution.
First of all, my module is an extension to RobotRules.
It should be in WWW/RobotRules/ directory, but till now, I was 
developing it as an independent module.
I changed the path to the module wherever needed.

Can I know how to package it?
I am having trouble with
perl Malefile.PL. It says:
WARNING: Setting ABSTRACT via file 'lib/RobotDB.pm' failed
  at /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.8/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm line 615
Please replay to apatwa@uccs.edu
Thanks in advance,
Ankur
