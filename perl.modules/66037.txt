The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       StoredHash
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Minimalistic Hash/object DB Persister
  userid:      OHOLLMEN (Olli Hollmen)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::InsertHash

  rationale:

    StoredHash reflects few things - About any hash can be stored - All
    basic persisting ops are included by module (insert, load/select,
    update, delete) - Some ops for collections are provided (currently
    simple AoH, tree of objects in works, TODO: persist trees) -
    Database backend is (not necessarily) RDB (by DBI), but may be LDAP,
    ARS/Remedy (in future / in the works), fundametally any persistent
    storage

  enteredby:   OHOLLMEN (Olli Hollmen)
  enteredon:   Sat May 23 18:36:57 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

StoredHash        adpOp Minimalistic Hash/object DB Persister        OHOLLMEN
