The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Perljax
  DSLIP:       bdhOg
  description: Export perl methods to javascript for AJAX
  userid:      BCT (Brian C. Thomas)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://pjax.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    Perljax provides a unique mechanism to access server-side perl code
    asynchronously from javascript using the AJAX design. Perljax
    unburdens the user from having to write any javascript, except for
    having to associate an exported method with a document-defined event
    (such as onClick, onKeyUp, etc). Only in the more advanced
    implementations of an exported perl method would a user need to
    write any javascript. Perljax supports methods that return single
    results, or multiple results to the web page. No other projects that
    we know of are like Perljax for the following reasons: 1. Perljax is
    targeted specifically for perl development. 2. Perljax shields the
    user from having to write any javascript at all (unless they want
    to). 3. The URL for the HTTP GET request is automatically generated
    based on HTML layout and events, and the page is then dynamically
    updated. 4. Perljax is not part of a Content Management System, or
    some other larger project. The specific namespace we think fits best
    under "CGI::", since any use of Perljax will be in a perl CGI script
    (or from mod_perl).

The resulting entry would be:
