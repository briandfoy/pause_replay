Subject: Need to upload UUID.pm

From: joseph.nathan.hall@gmail.com ("Joseph N. Hall")

UUID.pm has been sitting on search.cpan.org for a long time but has
never been uploaded to PAUSE. The last time it was touched was Jan
2007 and before that the original author around 5 years earlier.
Neither author has been active on PAUSE/CPAN in recent history as far
as I can tell.

I'm not able to contact the owner of the UUID space (no email address)
but I want to get this thing there so that, among other things, we can
install this module with a regular CPAN shell rather than the oblique
process of downloading it from search.cpan.org and then doing a manual
install.

I uploaded UUID.pm ver 0.04 but it was rejected because of the
ownership issue. I need someone to fix this. UUID.pm already "owns"
the name in search.cpan.org so it's not as if it is shoving out
something else. And it is a reasonable choice for "UUID.pm" because
that's all it does ... generate UUIDs ... even though it is top-level.
In 2002 that was more acceptable than it is today, but it's already a
done deal.

Renaming the module is pointless, at least from my perspective,
because we have shipped software that "use(s) UUID" to external
customers.

Hope this works out.
