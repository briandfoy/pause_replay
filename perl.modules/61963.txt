Good day all,

I'm starting work on a module for a client and I've received permission to release the module to CPAN afterwards.  The tentative name is Business::AuthorizeNet::CIM, and I wanted to check if there is any reason to change.

The module will be a pure-Perl interface to the Authorize.Net CIM SOAP interface. CIM is the Customer Interface Manager API, i.e. the thing that stores customer profiles and associated credit card information on the Authorize.Net servers so that you don't have to store it locally.  This module will have a function that wraps each of the functions in the API as listed here: http://www.authorize.net/support/CIM_SOAP_guide.pdf ; there may also end up being some higher-level functions that combine the low-level stuff into higher-level chunks, but that's not determined yet.

I've already discussed it with Ivan Kohler, maintainer of the CPAN Business:OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet module, (http://search.cpan.org/~ivan/Business-OnlinePayment-AuthorizeNet-3.20/AuthorizeNet.pm) and he was the one that suggested calling it Business:AuthorizeNet::CIM.


Thanks for any advice,

--Dks
