One method is to create an near-empty Business::Bof module that acts as 
a "loader" for the other modules.

So you could do things like.

use Business::Bof;

Business::Bof::Server::Fw->something;

Then you can add the appropriate

=head1 NAME

Business::Bof - Module description


Another solution if you don't WANT to add a loader module, is to add it 
as a sort of documentation module only. Little to no code, and POD which 
describes the entire project.
