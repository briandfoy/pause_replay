The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fuzz
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Provides interface to create network fuzzers
  userid:      KSURI (Aleksey Surikov)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace clearly represents all the functionality of the
    module.

    Root namespace is required because a bunch of extensions to the
    module are planned to be added later.

    I think there are no modules on CPAN which provides similar
    functionality (I haven't found any), though fuzzing is a quite
    common technique to reveal weaknesses of your software.

  enteredby:   KSURI (Aleksey Surikov)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan 28 01:21:06 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Fuzz              RdpOp Provides interface to create network fuzzers KSURI
