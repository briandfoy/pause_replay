Request to register new user

     why:

    I actually had sent in a request just before for this but then I
    realized that A.) I used the wrong ID that I had been wanting, and
    B.) I misspelled my last name. Good job me!

    In any case. As I stated there, I've recently been creating a new
    distribution that I want to push to CPAN, and after having had this
    experience, I'd rather like to continue creating more modules and
    contributing to the community.
