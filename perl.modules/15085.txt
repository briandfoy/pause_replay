BUSINESS PROPOSAL

ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS:ssfawole@sify.com

Sir,
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward to you this proposal, we want a reliable and trustworthy person who could assist us to transfer the sum of US$20M (Twenty Million United States Dollars) only into his account.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by us under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the concerned ministries, the contract has been executed,Commissioned and the contractor been paid his actual cost for the contract. We are now left with the balance of US$20M as the over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our own use. But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate, or own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for an assistance. We
have agreed that you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum, 60% for us
while 10% for any expenses incurred on both side while transacting this business.

As you may rightly want to know I got your address world email encyclopedia Lagos. I am a top official with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). We the officials involved in this deal have put in many years of services to our ministries, we have been
exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss. This transaction
is very much free from all sorts of risks.
To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present an international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement,you should reply positively so that I can tell you details on how to proceed.

However,you may be required to sign the fund release authority at the Central Bank of Nigeria when all approvals are gotten or proceed to any of
the Central Bank offshore payment centre in overseas. Thereafter,three officials will come to your country for our share as we intend to go into profitable business venture in overseas. All these will only take us 10 working days to get the fund transfered into your Bank account right from
the day we commence.

NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited,
because we are still in Government service.
Let honest and trust be our watch words throughout this transaction.
Your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.

Best regards,

Mr Solomon Fawole.
