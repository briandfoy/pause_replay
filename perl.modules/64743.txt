Hi,

It would be handy and save time if the "Not submitting, maybe we have
a duplicate here" did show the name of the user on top.

Why? When the page displays, I see the list of clashes but I have to
browse it down first to look up the name of the user. I usually deal
with requests in a batchy manner, first clicking all of them in the
mail, then process them one by one with [Insert with soundex care] and
then finalize them one by one.

In the desired setup, when the page displays, I see the name of the
user directly. Then I browse down the list and if none matches, I'm at
the point where I can hit [Insert most definitely].

Also, it would be nice if a signal could be given if the (last) name,
email address or web site exactly matches an existing entry.

Maybe these changes are fairly trivial. They would be helpful.
