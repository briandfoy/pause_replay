The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::jxta
  DSLIP:       cdpOo
  description: Perl implementation of JXTA peer-to-peer
  userid:      NCOWHAM (Nyk Cowham)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    This is an official project of Sun's JXTA community
    http://www.jxta.org/

  similar:
    This is a binding to a new peer-to-peer protocol published by Sun
    Microsystems. As far as I know it is a unique perl project

  rationale:

    The JXTA protocols is a language and platform independent protocol
    for implementing peer-to-peer networking. JXTAperl is a Sun
    Microsystems approved project to implement the protocol in Perl. The
    reference implementation written by Sun is in Java and uses the
    net.jxta package/namespace and the proposal to use the Net::jxta
    namespace in Perl seems to be a logical mapping. However, if there
    are compelling reasons why this namespace should not be used an
    alternative can be implemented without any problems.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::jxta            cdpOo Perl implementation of JXTA peer-to-peer     NCOWHAM
