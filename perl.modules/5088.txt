Subject: PAUSE upload hanging?

Is anyone else having trouble with PAUSE upload right now?  I've been
trying for the last few days, and get either HTTP timeouts or
"Document contains no data" when I hit the 'Upload this file from my
disk' button.  In the case of ftp uploads, uploading to the ftp server
works fine, but then I get an HTTP timeout when I hit 'Upload the
checked file'.

There are quite a few tar.gz files collecting in /incoming on the FTP
server, but it does look like *some* are making it through --
http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/mod_perl/cpan-search?request=recent;age_request=7
shows a trickle of modified modules over the last several days, some
of which I saw hung up in /incoming for a day or two.  I haven't yet
figured out what's going on.

For reference, the distribution I'm trying to update is
IPC-Session-0.05.tar.gz -- there's a copy in /incoming right now.

Steve
