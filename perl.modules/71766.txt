Hopefully, JONBJ is out there somewhere, but I've not found him to offer
patches to Getopt::Easy.  At this point, I'm asking for help locating him;
I've never sought someone on the web before.

His web page advertised on CPAN is not found.

On May 25, 2010 I sent email to jon@icogitate.com --on June 17, 2010, to
jon@logicalpoetry.com.

Jon, if you have moved on; I would be willing to take on
the support of this module on CPAN.

Be well,
rir

Jon,

Thanks for Getopt::Easy; I think it is great.

Would you review patches?  I have added features without
impacting existing usage.  The changes:

[1] the keys into %O may be used as long options
( "--option", "--option=value" and "--option value"),

[2] after helpchars, helpwords may be added for use as
long options ( "l-list", "usage: usage_str", "Hh", "help", "SOS"),

[3] broke out POD display code to give_help(), to allow mocking
for testing,

[4] moved to Test::More (done_testing() is nice). Added tests;
added descriptions to tests.

This is about 60 lines of change; plus about the same
in testing.

Be well,
rir
