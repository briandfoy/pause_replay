The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Payroll::AU::PAYG
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Calculate Australian PAYG tax withholding.
  userid:      PJF (Paul Jamieson Fenwick)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Basis of talk at Melbourne.PM for the 13th August.

  similar:
    Payroll::US::FedIncome

  rationale:

    Payroll::AU::PAYG will provide the ability to calculate federal
    PAYG income tax for Australian residents. Given that Payroll::US::*
    provides similar functionality for US residents, the reasoning
    behind the name choice should be clear.

    The module is currently being developed for a demonstration at
    Melb.PM on how simple it can be to write Perl modules, as well as
    for the obvious purpose of calculating tax. I'm very happy for the
    module to be renamed prior to its release.

  enteredby:   PJF (Paul Jamieson Fenwick)
  enteredon:   Tue Aug 12 02:43:50 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Payroll::AU::
::PAYG            adpOp Calculate Australian PAYG tax withholding.   PJF
