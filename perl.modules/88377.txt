That's a really cool idea, but if you're trying to teach people modern
best practices, "don't bother registering, nobody actually gives a shit
about the module list anymore really except as a way to get feedback on
your module name" should be part of it.

... and as feedback: I think I might consider calling it InteractiveTutorial
or similar might be better, for the simple reason that App::LearnPerl sounds
superficially like it should be a client to learn.perl.org ... and this is
something completely different (and a very cool idea, btw!)
