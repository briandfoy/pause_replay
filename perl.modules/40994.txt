The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       subs::parallel
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: enables subs to seamlessly run in parallel
  userid:      NILSONSFJ (Nilson Santos F. Jr.)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    Brazilian PM mailing lists primarly, maybe Perl Monks

  similar:

  rationale:

    subs::parallel gives Perl programmers the ability to easily and
    conveniently create multi-threaded applications through parallel
    subroutines. Thus, the name: subs::parallel. All lowercase, because
    it's sort of a pragma, much like threads::shared.

    Multi-threaded applications in Perl are not that common nowadays.
    For some reason, people just don't seem to be very fond of it. I
    think this module should be listed in the module list because it can
    make coding threaded applications in Perl a lot easier, in fact,
    completely transparent. There are no other modules providing similar
    functionality besides threads itself, which is the base of this
    module and it's far from being a transparent interface. The hopes
    are that if it can gain some attention, people will begin coding
    more multi-threaded applications in Perl and providing good threads
    support is vital nowadays if Perl wants to grow in the non-web
    application development area. If Perl really wants to survive and
    grow, it will have to adapt to this new programming paradigm. This
    module aims to fill this existent gap without any efforts from the
    programmer.
