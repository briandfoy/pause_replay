Contribution: A JavaScript to Perl source code translator. Suggest that 
a new top-level module category named 'JavaScript' be created. The 
translator entry point will be in JavaScript::Parser. The idea is to 
automate (as much as possible) porting of apps written for Netscape's 
Server-Side JavaScript environment to Apache's mod_perl environment.

DSLI: D = i   I have not discussed this idea with anyone else yet
       S = d
       L = c   Portions of the JavaScript parser and lexer may be written
               in C. The code walker will be written in Perl.
       I = h   Estimate mostly object-oriented interface, but using 'h'
               to hedge my bets.
