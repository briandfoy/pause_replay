Obviously this iteration is not converging. I don't have your knowledge
of the CPAN hierarchy, I'm not able to guess your requirements, and I
really can't imagine more descriptive names than Term::Vtui or CGI::Auth.
Perhaps _you_ could suggest appropriate names for these two modules ?

You could bear in mind that there is already Authen:: and that Term::
is already part of User_Interfaces.  Look forward to hearing from you,
