I inherited the namespace from the initial author, Daniel T Hable,
and saw no good reason to change it. Recently mentioned the module
on the ActiveState Win32-users list, to no adverse comment.
Dan's script has been on Perl Monks for ten months now, and no-one
has commented on the namesapce (or much else).

It's a wizard and it uses Tk: Tk::Wizard seems an obvious choice.

It's not really an application, since it can't be directly applied,
only implemented.

Whether or not it's a widget, I don't really feel in a position
to say: I've only been Tk'ing for a week or so. I'd hoped that the
more publicity it got, the more feedback I'd get, and the more
it can fit the Perl/Tk model.

Do you (or anyone on the list) a suggestion for another namespace?

(I've just cc'd this to comp.lang.perl.tk - message ID
<e0d7abe8.0211251203.6ff0c5cb@posting.google.com> ).

Thanks,
