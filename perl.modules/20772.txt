Hi,

The Devel::SmallProf module by Ted Ashton (ASHTED) does not work
under perl 5.8.0 (the problem appears on rt.perl.org as reported 11
months ago).

I did a patch and sent it to the author but the e-mail address is
bouncing and I have been trying to find an alternative e-mail for him
without success. Instead, I found a message from David Oksner
(DOKSNER) asking for maintenance of another module by Ted because Ted
had told him that he was unable do it any longer.

I would like to get maintenance of this module transferred to me
(SALVA) to be able to upload the patched version myself.

Bye,

  - Salva.
