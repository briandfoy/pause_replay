Hi Friend, 

First things first...I wish I could have responded to each of your emails individually, but all week I have been swamped with tons of work which makes that pretty darn near impossible.

Looks to me like a lot of people saw my posting of the Hard Rock Casino in Vegas last week and were wondering if the deal went good. Well, instead of me just telling you what happened, I figured I'll let one of the subscribers on the list do just that. Saves me from doing all the talking for a change! 

So here ya go... 

****************************************************************

"I was in Vegas on April 29th and caught wind of the Hard Rock condo presales and they were going up 10 percent and being released to public May 1. I got 3 reservations for the flats before that release! Plus they all sold out in 2 weeks and all of their multi-million dollar bungalows are also sold out; some were bought by big name stars so I think this will continue to be one of the hottest condo projects in the world. Looking forward to hearing from you and feeling honored to have the VIP black card, it's better than the AMEX black card! It costs less and will make a whole lot more money for me!"

 - Anthony 
 

(My reply) "Great job Anthony...keep it up! I just heard that the average price of a condo on the flats was over 500k...so every one of you who picked up one when I posted it is looking at a nice profit of 50 k in one day off each unit. The best part is that happend without credit checks, pre approvals or even talking with a banker."

****************************************************************

You know, I love to hear stories like this from people who just took charge and ACTED on a great idea - they didn't just bellyache about how hard it could be, or sit around yapping about it. And that right there - ACTING on a great thing - is what separates the rich from the poor, the doers from the talkers. And Anthony - you are WELL on your way to the top, buddy!

So Friend...if you think fifty large (that's 50 grand) in profit is good...well, you ain't seen nothin' yet! Just you wait; I got another scorching hot deal that I'm posting on the VIP private site for all preconstruction club members...and let me tell ya, it will make those Hard Rock profits look like pocket change! 

Take charge at http://www.milliondollarrealestatedeals.com 

That's it for now, 


Lou 


P.S.  For all my current members of the Preconstruction Inner Circle, make sure to check the VIP private site by this Thursday May 19. You're first in line for what is going to be (in my humble opinion) the BEST deal of your life! For those of you who aren't yet members (what the heck are you waiting for?) you can get in on all the action at http://www.milliondollarrealestatedeals.com

But - you gotta hop to that pronto - we only have 78 spots left as of right now, and this email alone is heading out to over 300,000 people. So, you gotta move fast...like, right now! 

See you there!
