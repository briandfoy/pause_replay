First off, after checking the PHP MediaWiki project's online 
documentation, I would say "MediaWiki" is preferable to "Mediawiki" 
(note the CamelCase) in any of the suggested names.

Secondly, either of your suggestions would otherwise be fine with me.  I 
derived the module from Text::WikiFormat, which is why I originally 
chose the name, but it retains no dependencies on that module.  Also, as 
I have begun implementing some optional MediaWiki extensions, like the 
"<ref>" and "<references />" tags, I have been thinking about 
implementing a more configurable plugin-style architecture for enabling 
these extensions, similar to MediaWiki's plugin architecture, and the 
higher-level namespace would also be more convenient for storing plugin 
modules.

Finally, a top-level namespace would be a more convenient place to put 
my MediaWiki DB accessors (currently in 
Wiki::Toolkit::Store::Mediawiki).  Then MediaWiki::Database could 
provide an abstraction that is more specific to the MW DB format and 
W:T:S::Mediawiki could just convert the API and call the new accessors. 
  This would be a much cleaner design than the current W:T:S:Mediawiki, 
which mashes the API conversion together with SQL composition and DB calls.

The more I think about this idea, the more I like it.  Really, working 
in the W:T space has hampered me more than anything.  Since their 
default DB backend and formatter are nothing like MW's, I've had to 
reimplement 9/10 of what they had and add a bunch of other features that 
require bypassing their generic API entirely since MW is significantly 
more featureful.  Again, for anyone else using it, W:T:[FS]:MW could 
still be maintained as thin API converters over the modules in the new 
MediaWiki namespace, a significantly cleaner design.

Regards,

Derek
