The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Archive::Tar::Direct
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Streaming on-the-fly Tar archive manipulator
  userid:      KIMMORMH (Kimmo R. M. Hovi)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    #perl@EFNet #perl@IRCNet

  similar:
    Archive::Tar Archive::TarGzip

  rationale:

    For a plain tar manipulator (And in the future maybe bzlib, zlib
    tie'able), I believe Archive::Tar subspace is a no-brainer.

    As far as justification for existence of the module goes, there
    just were no "real" Tar modules in the module list to begin with.
    All the existing ones simply implemented (Slowly, and in some cases
    badly) only some features of GNU tar, whereas true manipulation of
    tar archives was missing.

    In doing enterprise document management systems (With perl,
    naturally), there arose a serious need for "diskless" tar, as I
    wanted to skip a two steps of 2+ gigabytes of disk writes in
    export/import/integration functionality, and just directly pipe that
    to the client.

The resulting entry would be:

Archive::Tar::
::Direct          adpfp Streaming on-the-fly Tar archive manipulator KIMMORMH
