     why:

    I'm currently writing a set of modules that facilitate the creation
    of modular scripts and daemons by providing an singleton class that
    registers modules and events and a base class for the modules. The
    modules will provide autoload of the program modules and dependency
    handling. Perhaps I will also write a module managing command line
    arguments.

    Another module provides some easy to use, basic functions to run a
    script as a daemon (detach, status, kill) on POSIX-style systems.
    However, I'm not shure whether this is something "new enough" - it's
    less functional but simpler to use as the modules I found on
    cpan.org. The same applies to a simple interface to GnuPG (a module
    which provides a function to crypt, decrypt and to verify and modify
    the passphrase, relies on GnuPG::interface). (The last two modules
    can be reviewed on http://technik.juz-kirchheim.de/en, the package
    names are still very suboptimal).
