     why:

    I've been working on some improvements to how we debug Perl. I
    looked at many different existing Devel modules but none of them
    produced the kind of output that I require for my project. I'm
    scheduled to speak at YAPC in June so I'd like to be able to put my
    code up on CPAN so that people can use what I've built.
