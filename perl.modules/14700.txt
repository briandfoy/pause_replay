that's fine, but the idea of modules is that the end programmer
doesn't have to know that.  they want to do the same logical
task no matter the language, so you give them the same interface
while you handle the heavy lfting for them.

sure it is.  you just need to have the right design. :)
the trick is to always make bits of the system as general as
possible which maximizes code reusability.  it is harder to
do once you already have something though.
