Ah, ok, I guess I reported the problem after having worked round the problem
by using the search facilities; so I must have found the wrong email address
to report the problem to:-)

Ok, starting again, guys, I found the above problem some days ago which can
be summarised as:

- in the dirlisting produced by URL http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Date/
  the only Date-Simple-* files present are version 1.0.3.  There's no reference
  to version 2.04 at all.  I appreciate that two different authors are/were
  involved in Date::Simple, but this seems broken to me..

cheers
