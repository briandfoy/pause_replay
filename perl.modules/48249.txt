Correct -- except that I would contend that one of the many ebook formats 
out there is HTML. In fact there's an Open Ebook standard which is really 
just a conformant HTML. By establishing an Ebook:: namespace, we might see 
other conversion tools added, e.g. to convert between different ebook 
formats. (I'm already thinking about text2tei and html2tei packages.)

You are correct that this module is simply converting text to HTML, but I 
guess that's the simple case, so it makes a sensible starting point for a 
future suite of tools.

Steve
