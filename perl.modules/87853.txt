This is not true, and with an experienced Perl developer and CPAN =
community
member you might get more and better perspectives.

You can:
1) separate SNMP out of net-snmp and manage requirements using =
Config::AutoConf
2) tell (via "exit(0)") explicitly when you cannot run smoke tests =
because of
   insufficient dependencies.
3) remove SNMP implementation from CPAN and replace it by a placeholder =
loading
    Lib::NetSNMP (your bundled one), if available or complain loudly =
when missing
4) follow my recommendation below
5..n)=20

Why? Because you think I don't know about keeping API stable during such
processes? It's perfect =85

1st releases will bundle Lib::NetSNMP, but recommend updated version
Later releases will step by step via adapter pattern allow other SNMP
distributions can be used. Even later ones unbundle SNMP and recommend
the most active developed SNMP distribution on CPAN (we're here 3-4 =
years
in future, just to have a feeling what "later" means). Much later, we
might start to depreciate API and provide better one =85

Evolving takes time - but that doesn't mean, it's impossible neither =
it's
a non-starter ;)

This is a separate thingie and shouldn't be mixed into discussion about =
SNMP
and Net-SNMP modules on CPAN. I mentioned that only, because initially =
the
tone was "you don't know enough about snmp".

To summarize: I'm not interested in contributing to net-snmp (the linux =
only
and partially bsd supporting, often crashing and memory leaking snmpd =
:P).
I'm interested in improving CPAN. If that would mean (when I had to =
maintain
an XS module for net-snmp's client libs) to contribute to net-snmp =
because of
fixes are required to improve CPAN (module stability), I would do.

See Alien::SVN or GraphViz how other projects manage language bindings =
without
strain CPAN ^^

Again: I'm offering help for CPAN and I think, this will include a lot =
of
help for the Perl5 binding to net-snmp, but primary goal for me is CPAN =
and Perl.
