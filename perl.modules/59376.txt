The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDL::Statistics::Misc
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Provides many statistical operations for PDL
  userid:      BATZ (Matt Spear)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Statistics::Distributions Statistics::TTest
    Statistics::PointEstimation Statistics::ChiSquare

  rationale:

    The above modules do not off all the functionality in this module,
    and none are designed to work with PDL. Also, no module on CPAN
    offers the bootstrap method which is very nice to have. PDL comes
    with many existing statistical functions, but is lacking confidence
    intervals and some important tests. The set of functions currently
    planned are (those that are similar to preexisting modules are
    marked with an *): ks_test Provides the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
    data ks_conf_int Provides confidence intervals for CDFs using
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov ks_prob The Kolmogorov probability conf_int*
    Provides the confidence interval assuming normal distribution
    diff_conf_int Provides the confidence interval of the difference of
    the data assuming the difference is normally distributed ad_test
    Provides the Anderson-Darling chi2_test* Provides the \chi^2 test
    anova The Analysis of Variance f_test Provides the F-test
    grubbs_test Provides the Grubbs test to identify outliers mle_gamma
    Provides the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for gamma parameters
    mle_beta Provides the MLE for beta mle_normal '' for normal mle_exp
    '' for exponential mle_pareto '' for Pareto mse Provides the mean
    squared error of two sets ecdf Provides an Empirical Cumulative
    Distribution Function as a PDL bootstrap Provides the statistical
    bootstrap algorithm bootstrap_diff '' but for computing the
    confidence interval for differences in the sets

    I might add more as this is developed but this is what is planned
    at the current time (basically, these are the functions that have
    been required for my research).

The resulting entry would be:

PDL::Statistics::
