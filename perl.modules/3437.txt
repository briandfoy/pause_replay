Hold on a minute -- I was not lying.

I tried collaborating with Mr. Hudes on Net::Whois, but we disagree on 
how solve the the problem of parsing non-standardized whois output. (He 
wishes to create an IETF draft and then assumes registrars/registries
will follow it. I assume the whois referral system will be in shambles for
many more months, if not years, and have designed around the problem of
non-standard whois output.)

I sent the request for a CPAN id prior to understanding that he was so 
downtrodden on allowing third party input on Net::Whois. I am sorry that I
didn't ammend my original id request to mention that I would not be
working directly within in the Net::Whois namespace before my request 
caused this confusion. 

My apologies.

<RANT>

It is my opinion that in half the time Mr. Hudes has spent
moaning about being patient and making inflamatory assumptions, most perl
coders could have rewritten Net::Whois many times over. (Go see the
current Net::Whois code for yourself...)

My yet unreleased referral-supporting version of Net::Whois,
now un-aptly named Net::ParseWhois, is available at
http://honestabe.net/Net-ParseWhois-0.53.tar.gz. I haven't uploaded the
module to CPAN because of the generally disparaging interaction with 
Mr. Hudes and the fact that having Net::Whois and Net::ParseWhois
makes no sense. My version maintains backwards compatability with
Net::Whois, extends it's functionality in a few places, and adds support
for gTLD registrars other than Netsol who are becoming more and more
popular.

I find it very interesting (and annoying) that Mr. Hudes now speaks of a
'team' and having other bug fixes and contributions waiting in the
pipe. He hasn't mentioned anything to me, nor offered to pass my code on
to any other parties who may have once showed interest in helping (or
vice-versa). He has generally represented himself as some almightly
'gatekeeper' and in doing so, has been condescending and abrasive. 

I just want to code ..

</RANT>

Again, sorry for the confusion and sorry this crap is now part of public
record. I would bet that others have had similar 'namespace'
difficuties - perhaps even with Mr. Hudes/Net::Whois  - and would very
much appreciate advice on how to proceed.

Thanks for your time,
Abraham Ingersoll
