The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graph::ModularDecomposition
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Modular decomposition of directed graphs
  userid:      AZS (András Salamon)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Graph

  rationale:

    This module adds new methods to Graph, using derivation from
    Graph::Directed. The main externally usable new method is
    modular_decomposition_EGMS, which returns the modular decomposition
    tree of a directed graph. This has not been implemented in perl
    before (to the best of my knowledge), and would be useful to people
    implementing graph algorithms. See the references in the
    documentation.

  enteredby:   AZS (András Salamon)
  enteredon:   Wed May 26 15:40:49 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Graph::
::ModularDecomposition adpOp Modular decomposition of directed graphs     AZS
