The publishing frequency of the modulelist itself is not
enabling/preventing editing of metadata on PAUSE. Authors can edit
metadata as soon as a namespace proposal is confirmed by an admin.

That said, there is indeed a painful delay in the production of the
modulelist. The software I have written to produce new module lists is
very broken and I'd need a whole lot of consecutive days to redesign
it so that the module list becomes as automatic as it should be. Tuit
shortage:-(
