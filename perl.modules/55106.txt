Sure, done. And you're right, this table has no web interface (yet).

Great!

Very nice!

You'll see it even though you are an admin. You'll see the separate
menu for maintainers of mailinglists (mlrepr, short for mailing list
representatives) -- it just works like our admin interface with less
options.

PAUSE looks into list2users.

The former.

I have to add an mlrepr to a project. From then on the thing works
quite well. If we need to add somebody to mlrepr often, we can make a
web interface for it.

But the users who are in list2users have their own login. It's a bit
like sudo. Makes sense?
