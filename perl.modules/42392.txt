The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Holidays::PT
  DSLIP:       Mdphp
  description: Determine Portuguese public holidays
  userid:      COG (José Alves de Castro)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Date::Holidays::UK, Date::Holidays::DE, Date::Holidays::NO,
    Date::Holidays::FR

  rationale:

    This is a module to determine public holidays in Portugal.

    It inherits from Date::Holidays, by Jonas B. Nielsen. There are
    already several other modules on CPAN with similar purpose for
    several countries.

    These modules play a very important role for Business tools where
    there's a necessity to distinguish working days from non-working
    days. Jonas is apparently working in a project that uses all these
    modules for an international paying system of some sort.

  enteredby:   COG (José Alves de Castro)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug  8 14:24:46 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Holidays::
::PT              Mdphp Determine Portuguese public holidays         COG
