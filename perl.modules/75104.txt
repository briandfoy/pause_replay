The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache2::Response::FileMerge
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Easily merge JavaScript and CSS
  userid:      WAZZUTEKE (Trevor Hall)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Blogs, internal company conversations

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's a mod_perl response handler, hence the choice of the
    namespace.

    This module's concept is to allow the dynamic merging of multiple
    JS and CSS files into a single file for delivery to the client's
    browser, thus reducing network overhead between the client and
    server in a standard web-browsing experience. By having the handler
    act as a response handler, coupled with the design of it overall, no
    changes are needed to the static code that may already exist; just a
    slight Apache configuration and adjustment to the file name in the
    HTML document.
