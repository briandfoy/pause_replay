The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Schedule::Depend
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Parallel execution with dependencies.
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    pmake

  rationale:

    This is a make-like utility. It allows jobs to wait for execution
    based on dependencies with other jobs. It also allows re-running the
    scheduled jobs with an option to skip previously completed ones.
    Unlike make the synatx is simpler, with the command expansion done
    via overloading an unalias method. This reduces the "makefile" to a
    simple list of aliases (e.g., foo = shell command) and dependencies
    (e.g., foo bar : bletch blort).

    There is also support for limiting the number of concurrent jobs,
    prioritizing the runnable jobs w/in the number allowed and adding a
    "cleanup" method called after job completion.

    The OO interface accepts a scalar for the queue (vs. an external
    Makefile) which simplifies automated generation of the queue.
    Combined with overloading of the unalis method this allows simple
    generation of queues that process jobs in fairly complex ways.

    This is more of a scheduler than "job controller" since its main
    purpose is simply to fork/exec the unaliased command string. A
    sufficiently robust overloading of the "runnable jobs" method could
    actually update the queue dynamically to account for new work
    arriving; a serious overload of the unalis method would be able to
    run sub-queues with dependencies.

The resulting entry would be:

Schedule::
::Depend          bdpOp Parallel execution with dependencies.        LEMBARK
