The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Oyster::VisualShell
  DSLIP:       idppg
  description: Oyster:: shell with option gui interface
  userid:      ICK (Ian Stanley)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/oystershell and has been submitted
    to comp.lang.perl.modules for discussion

  similar:
    limited functionality in Term::Shell and Term::Shellkit

  rationale:

    Choice of name space - as this module Term::Oyster::SimpleShell is
    intended to be the basis of a series of inherited shells. each with
    a different layering of abilities and properties

    so far i intend to extend Term::Oyster::SimpleShell to produce:

    * Term::Oyster::AdvShell - extended features, more difficult to
    employ yet provides a conceptually more complex shell environment.
    supporting features like 'enable' commands as per cisco router's
    shell, shell variable handling and a number of other features etc.

    * Term::Oyster::TkShell - adding support for a shell using the Tk
    Toolkit - including tk menus etc.

    * Term::Oyster::VisualShell - similar to the original/advanced
    shell but with the optional curses driven menu based environment

    In all shells command line parsing and editing are all handled
    invisibly inside the object. Default settings for the name of the
    shell the greetings and the prompts are included. Extra commands can
    easily be registered or removed [a feature not existing in the other
    shells] using the included methods. User functions will be called
    with the parameters and switches [gnu/unix styles supported]
    preparsed into an array and a hash respectively in order to ease the
    processing by the user function.

The resulting entry would be:

Term::Oyster::
::VisualShell     idppg Oyster:: shell with option gui interface     ICK
