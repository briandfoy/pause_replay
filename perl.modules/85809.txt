The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Framework::Core
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Modular application framework
  userid:      CODECHILD (David Helkowski)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Meetup ( baltimore perl mongers ), Chatrooms ( IRC and p2p AOL IM
    etc ), public wiki

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace Choice: I chose Framework::Core as the name due to
    Class::Core being used as the foundation for 'application modules'
    and 'application classes'. It is a framework, using Class::Core as
    the base. I chose Framework::Core instead of Framework::ClassCore so
    that the system can be thought of as a 'Core' Framework, the whole
    framework being this one piece, plus other modules under different
    namespaces. Note that any namespaces used will remain under
    Framework::Core. This framework does not provide any other modules
    such as Framework::[whatever]. It provides Framework::Core, as well
    as modules of the form Framework::Core::[x]::[y]...

    Uniqueness: The approach taken by Framework::Core is different from
    other frameworks available on Cpan, because it is setup to provide
    all of the base modules needed to create a nearly fully functional
    intranet/web application. It current provides web server ties ( to
    Mongrel2 ), cookie and session handling, concurrency support,
    request tracking and debugging ( showing a function call tree ), API
    provision and registration, routed request and static file serving,
    and permissions management, among other things.

The resulting entry would be:

Framework::
