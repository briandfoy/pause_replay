The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::GaloisField
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: arithmetic on finite fields
  userid:      MHASCH (Martin Becker)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Math::Polynomial Math::ModInt

  rationale:

    Galois fields aka finite fields are another domain where operations
    such as addition, multiplication, division etc. are well-defined,
    but are not already covered by a Perl extension. The module provides
    an object type representing elements of finite fields, with
    overloaded arithmetic operators and a couple of additional methods.
    It uses Math::Polynomial and Math::ModInt internally and in the API,
    as finite field elements can be represented as polynomials with
    coefficients in some prime integer residue class.

    The name Math::GaloisField is preferred over Math::FiniteField
    because GF(n) is the standard notation for the finite field of order
    n, and "Galois" makes a better search term than "finite", too.
    Math::Field::Galois, on the other hand, would not make much sense as
    other arithmetic fields already have completely different name
    spaces, such as Math::BigRat, Math::Complex etc.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
::GaloisField     adpOp arithmetic on finite fields                  MHASCH
