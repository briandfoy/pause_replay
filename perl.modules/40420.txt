Hi Brian,
I put the FulltextSearch:: prefix on in case any other free text search
engines were released, but I could rename the module to the root namespace
as CLucene. Please let me know which is preferable?
If I rewrite the module and re-upload using the name CLucene do I need to do
anything to delete FulltextSearch::CLucene from the index or will it go
automatically if I delete it from my files area?

Thanks, Peter

How about just CLucene?
