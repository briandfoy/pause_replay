I wrote a module called Netscape::Bookmarks and never listed it in the
modules list.  Then brian d foy came along and wrote another one, and
did list it.  I'm fine with that -- brian's got my wholehearted approval
to call his N::B the official one.

However, mine keeps showing up in odd places.  For instance, I just
received a report that although brian's shows up on search.cpan.org,
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Netscape::Bookmarks' installs my version.

I went to PAUSE to edit the module metadata, but N::B doesn't seem to be
listed there.  

What now?  Can you help me out?

(my PAUSE id is "SKUD" by the way)
