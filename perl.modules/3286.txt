Hello,

I've deleted Net::Domain from PAUSE a few months ago, but it was just brought to
my attention that it still exists at search.cpan.org.  I've changed the name of
my module to Net::DLookup to thwart the name conflict with another module of the
same name.  Is it possible to have it removed?

Regards,

Jasmine Merced
