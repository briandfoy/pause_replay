Hi,

I asked for a PAUSE id a while back, and apparently one
was set up for me:

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2001-01/msg00242.html

However, I never received the password, so I can't log in yet.

Can a new one be sent out please, either to here or my
registered address (bene@chiark.greenend.org.uk)

Thanks,

Ben
