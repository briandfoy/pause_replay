when i go to http://search.cpan.org/ and search for module "x500", i
find my modules only--strange.
maybe this has to do with the interesting fact that when one goes to your
CPAN page, http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=author&query=savage,
where your X500-DN is listed, and clicks on it,
http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=X500-DN, one gets to my module!
this happened as soon as my module got onto CPAN.

a reason for (2) could be that your module has an interface that mine
doesn't have and some people may have a need for it?

on my CPAN home page, http://www.timesink.de/perl/, people find a terse
comparison of our modules.
