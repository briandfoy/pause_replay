The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::SA
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Sanskrit Language Modules
  userid:      ASCHIG (Ashish Mahabal)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~aam/sanskrit

  similar:

  rationale:

    Currently there are no perl modules for the Sanskrit language.
    Lingua as root is apt as it is a natural (human) language. SA is the
    code to denote Sanskrit.

    The current functions allow (1) Sanskrit noun declinations: given a
    noun, case, number, person, the inflected form is returned. Both
    input and output is Roman which can be dealt with as desired, and
    (2) general transliteration from Roman to devanagari: This can take
    the inflected output and render it in unicode devanagari.

    The module is used at http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~aam/sanskrit
    where tests are developed to teach Sanskrit noun declinations.

    The module is wholly written in perl and has no dependancies.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
::SA              Rdpfp Sanskrit Language Modules                    ASCHIG
