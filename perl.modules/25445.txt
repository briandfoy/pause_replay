Hi,
I have a quick question. I have been working on a set of modules, and i
used the h2xs command create all the modules. say

h2xs -XA n Test;
h2xs -XA n Test::Text;
h2xs -XA n Test::Net;

etc.

and it automatically creates makefiles for each of these modules. I would
also be having a /t directory for each module, and a README file for each.

Is it better to have one makefile in the Test directory, or should i go
with the current set up i have, that is with makefiles,/t and README for
each module,

Thanks,
Pratheep.
