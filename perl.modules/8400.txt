ExtUtils::ModuleMaker isn't there yet.  it only has the most basic
functionality.

i've actually been thinking about this a lot since i've been hacking
on h2xs to make it template driven.  i would like it to use my own
stubs for my stuff, the client's stubs for their stuff and so on.

some things that i find myself constantly doing after h2xs but
before i start thinking about any real programming:

    * adding CVS keywords
    * removing any trace of @EXPORT
    * adding a standard set of pragmas
    * filling in bits of the POD, like AUTHOR and COPYRIGHT
    * adding additional POD sections
    * creating the t directory and adding a test
    * creating a lib directory
    * removing test.pl
    * updating MANIFEST for the above
    * updating Makefile.PL for the above

should i ever have enough free time i'd like to expand 
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker to handle all of that through templates.
the current stubs could be the defaults. and yes, i've already
emailed the author. :)
