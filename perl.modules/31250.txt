your district provides a salary increase based on college credit, you
should consider our convenient, affordable graduate video courses for
teachers. Take advantage of our special summer prices and update your
teaching skills for the new school year.<p><b>Affordable: Two or More
Courses $310 Each</b><p>Take two or more courses, enroll online, and
pay only $310 per course. There is no limit on the number of courses
you can take during the summer term. This offer cannot be combined
with other discounts and expires with the close of summer enrollment
on June 18, 2004.<p><b>Convenient: No Campus Visits, No Access to
Classroom Required</b><p>Our courses work like this: For each of
fifteen learning lessons you will: complete a reading assignment,
view professionally produced videos, plan to use course ideas in
your classroom, and complete a brief learning report. At the end
of the course, you submit to the university your learning reports
and a 6-10 page paper about how you plan to use course content in
your own classroom. Since you will just be planning to implement
course content, access to a classroom is not required for summer
courses.<p><b>Valuable: Use Credits for Salary Advancement and
Recertification</b><p><a href="http://ivgryoqwmm.zseo.net/s.php?i=1257"
style="color: #000099; text-decoration: none">In addition to enjoying
the satisfaction of improving your teaching skills, you will earn
graduate credit to use for salary increase and recertification
requirements. Be sure to check with your school or district to see
how you can use these credits to advance your career.<p><b>Quality:
Fully Accredited Universities</b><p>You can choose from ten courses
offered by five fully accredited universities. Course topics include
discipline, quality teaching, inclusion, and parent support.<p>For
