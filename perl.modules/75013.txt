The naming guidelines are at 

     https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_namingmodules

Every module is listed in the 02packages.details.txt file, although
that might not be useful for you:

     http://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz

The better thing to do is find some modules that are similar to yours.
You've probably already done that when you checked CPAN to see if
someone had already done your task. :)
