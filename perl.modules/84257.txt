No particular reason.  It didn't even occur to me that there was a "Games"
TLD until I noticed it. The one issue I noticed though is the fact there is
already a Games::Dice namespace.  If we moved my stuff to Games::RPG::*
that might avoid the namespace collision that is likely to occur.

Another issue that I can think of is the fact that I've already written
(and am doing pre-release cleanup for) a lot of code that looks for
RPG::Dice as a module.  Not to mention the fact that going from
RPG::Traveller to Games::RPG::Traveller is a very minor PITA. Not only does
the code need to be refactored but things such as

         my $parsec = new RPG::Traveller::Starmap::Parsec()
         becomes
         my $parsec = new Games::RPG::Traveller::Starmap::Parser();

which makes me wonder how many levels deep does the namespace need to go?

Sorry for the lack of response.  I have not even looked at my email (except
this account) for a while. I added this account to PAUSE for that reason.
