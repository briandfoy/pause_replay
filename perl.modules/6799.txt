The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Simple
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Simple API for XML (esp config files)
  userid:      GRANTM (Grant McLean)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-xml mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    This namespace registration request is a bit of housekeeping.

    The XML::Simple module has been on CPAN since October 1999 but I
    probably screwed up the namespace registration at the time, so it's
    not currently associated with my PAUSE ID.

    The original module name I chose was Getopt::XML because the module
    was designed for the purpose of parsing configuration data and
    option settings from an XML file.

    The discussion at the time concluded that the module had wider
    application and a more generic name would be appropriate.
    XML::Simple was the popular choice. It was felt however that the
    module should be classified under section 12 of the modules list
    since parsing config files is what it was designed for.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Simple          Rdphp Simple API for XML (esp config files)        GRANTM
