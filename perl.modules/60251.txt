The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Tail::Multi
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: stateful tail of a list of files with regex
  userid:      ATRIPPS (Arvind Tripathy)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    Mailinglists,newsgroups,CVS repository

  similar:
    File-Tail, File-Tail-App, MultiTail

  rationale:

    None of the existing modules tail multiple files and maintain their
    state simultaneously. Furthermore, the list of files is dynamic, so
    adding new or deleting previously read files updates the tail
    automatically. I've also improved the way the program sleeps between
    two reads.

  enteredby:   ATRIPPS (Arvind Tripathy)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 28 10:41:48 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Tail::
::Multi           Rdpfp stateful tail of a list of files with regex  ATRIPPS
