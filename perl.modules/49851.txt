     why:

    I have written an updated XS wrapper for the libmcrypt cryptography
    library. There is an older module (Mcrypt) on the CPAN already but
    it is lacking functionality I need, and I couldn't get in touch with
    its author (Theo Schlossnagle - JESUS) in a timely manner.

    It's called Crypt::Mcrypt. It has both a procedural mode (in a
    sub-module) which directly mirrors the C API, and an OO wrapper mode
    that's more Perlish.
