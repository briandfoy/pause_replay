Hi, I'd like to request PAUSE access.

        Name: Andrew Wood
       Email: andrew.wood@ivarch.com
    Homepage: http://www.ivarch.com/
     User ID: AWOOD

What I'm planning to contribute:

Term::VT102 emulates a VT102 terminal. Like the "expect" Tcl extension, this
module is intended primarily for use as a way of automating processes; for
instance, you can write a script which connects via telnet to a full-screen
service of some kind, uses this module to parse the output, and therefore
can tell what is currently "on the screen" and react accordingly. Expect
cannot really do this, as it is stream-oriented, rather than being able to
tell you, say, what's on the top row of the screen.

Proposed module details:

       Name: Term::VT102 (or whatever would be most appropriate)
      DSLIP: cdpOa
Description: Emulates a colour VT102 terminal in memory
       Info: AWOOD

Discussion about this module has not occurred in newsgroups but it has been
discussed informally on Monochrome BBS (http://www.mono.org/) which is the
reason this module is being written; I just thought other people might find
it useful for other things too.

- Andrew
