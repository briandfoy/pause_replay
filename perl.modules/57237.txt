App::* might be a good place for it. Check out some of the other things
in that namespace to see if it would fit. 

If the module is going to be generally useful when not run as a script,
then you might find the best name for the module and name the
distribution that.

In the end, CPAN.pm and friends can easily find modules no matter what
you name the distro. 

Good luck :)
