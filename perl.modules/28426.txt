Dear reviewers:
After some design considerations, I would like to withdraw my earlier 
request of adding a new name space called Text::PORE. I believe that 
Text is a proper name space for my module, which I'll name it PORE. 
Therefore, there is no need to create a Text::PORE name space. Thank you.
