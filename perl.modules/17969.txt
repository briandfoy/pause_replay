     why:

    Most notably, an alternate object model somewhat similar to
    Class::SelfMethods, Class::Object, Class::Classless, and
    Class::Prototyped but with an emphasis on slots as autonomous
    entities and objects as (essentially) simple message-forwarding
    "shells" around their slots. Inheritance will be on a per-slot basis
    (with a per-object option); objects will be organized in independent
    "worlds"; reflection will be used for object cloning, slot creation,
    etc.; a slot's data will be visible only to the slot, not to its
    object or to other slots.
