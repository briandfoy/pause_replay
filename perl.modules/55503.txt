Guys

I don't see this stopping any time soon.

He continues to release at a fairly consistent pace, still largely 
spurious broken or incorrect packages.

He's already walked over a ton of potentially useful bundle names.

He may not even know he is doing anything wrong, and he won't respond to 
email contacts.

Should we consider doing something like disabling his account to drive 
him to the list for an actual conversation? Can that actually be done?
