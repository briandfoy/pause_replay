It seems to me in the license holder uploads it to a site where he knows
it will be copied and read, there is an implicit license. But, common
sense like that doesn't work in the courtroom.

I think this means that this file can't be on CPAN without some
statement from the licensor, and since we're not about to start a file
of licences, that means it can't be on CPAN.
