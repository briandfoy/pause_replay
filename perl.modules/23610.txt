The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Term::Activity
  DSLIP:       RdpOb
  description: Term display of processing activity
  userid:      BENNIE (Phillip Pollard)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    current place of employment, email.

  similar:
    Term::Progressbar

  rationale:

    This module is designed to give visual indication in a terminal
    that processing is occuring with general statistics on the rate and
    total process occurred thus far.

    It is currently being used regularly. In my place of employment and
    is being given back.

    Term::Progressbar does a similar thing except it requires the
    knowledge of the full field of data for percentage style estimates
    of completition. This module is to only indicate that processing is
    continuing to occur and the rate of occurance.

    In many cases the amount of data we are processing makes
    pre-scanning the data for size rather pointless and
    Term::Progressbar is unsatisfactory. In some open-ended processes
    that occur on data that is till being generated or received, it is
    just not possible Thusly, Term::Activity.

  enteredby:   BENNIE (Phillip Pollard)
  enteredon:   Thu Sep 18 16:52:35 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Term::
::Activity        RdpOb Term display of processing activity          BENNIE
