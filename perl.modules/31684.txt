The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RPN
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: An extensible RPN calculator framework
  userid:      JSAILOR (Jonathan Sailor)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    mailto:jsailor-rpnlist@jesnetplus.com

  similar:
    Math::RPN Tk::Calculator::RPN::HP

  rationale:

    1. Why this module

    Math::RPN only provides RPN expression evalution, and the semantics
    of the evaluation are different from this module (and the HP RPN
    calculators on which this module was based). Namely, this module has
    a register.

    Tk::Calculator::RPN::HP, though very similar, is a Tk module, and
    essentially requires a GUI. RPN, on the other hand, provides by
    default only an IO-handle interface, and a simple interactive
    frontend, rpnc. However, it can be easily overridden; the
    command-line interface is only about 10 lines.

    2. Why this namespace

    Math::RPN is already in use, and Math:: is the only obvious place
    (after browsing the module-list)

    3. Current status

    After I get a chance to write a readme and some tests, I'll
    activate the mailing-list above and upload the module to PAUSE. It
    should be uploaded within the next week. It is already (AFAIK) fully
    functional.

The resulting entry would be:

RPN               adpOg An extensible RPN calculator framework       JSAILOR
