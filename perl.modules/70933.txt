Well, Test::Most is taken, and the others don't really identify what
you are doing.

It sounds like your major idea is to have table driven tests (which I
already do with basic Test::More stuff) that are breakable in the
debugger.

From your documentation, it looks what you really have is a
Test::Builder alternative. You might get a lot of good advice about
names and other things on the qa@perl.org list.
