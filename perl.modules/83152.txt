     why:

    I am currently developing a NSS interface to perl that is getting
    to a state where it actually might be interesting to other people.
    In difference to Crypt::NSS the module mainly concerns itself with
    giving access to certificate information and enable users to
    validate certificates using NSS logic - it does (at the moment) not
    aim to offer the ability to actually open SSL connections.

    Plus - crypt::nss did not really work for me :).

    The source is available at https://github.com/amannb/crypt-nss -
    and no, I do not aim to publish it in the NSS namespace; I have to
    get some more input what name to give the module (open for
    suggestions).

    That would be the main contribution at the moment.
