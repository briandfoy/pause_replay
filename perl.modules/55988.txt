Request to register new user

fullname: Christopher Humphries
  userid: CHUMP
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    Lots of stuff, yet right now probably extensions to current modules
    that are easier to use and more fine grained to a certain task.

    Such as monitoring a server for disk space and other things via
    Net::SSH::Perl, a WWW::Myspace comment spider module to see what's
    been posted recently from friends. Don't have a big plan right now,
    yet planning to post to CPAN useful stuff (I hope).

    Thanks!
