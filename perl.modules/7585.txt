I'm not certain about that. What is the primary concern? If it's a
namespace collision, WSDL isn't likely be a common term for any other
technology. If it's a namespace conservation issue, I'd prefer XML::WSDL
in order to disentangle the XML processor aspect from the transport aspect.

Template::PSP does the actual transformation from HTML-like template 
file to Perl code reference. Apache::PSP implements a handler() 
subroutine that calls Template::PSP on a provided file and executes the 
result.

There are many cases where Template::PSP would be used separately from 
Apache::PSP, e.g. CGI-mode or command-line processing. Follow-on modules 
and scripts for non-Apache Web servers are planned as well.
