Hi there,

Please go for it on this module. I'm happy for you to take it over. I'm
nearing the end of a 14 day, multi-city business trip and so I've been a
little busy this year. I don't feel like logging into PAUSE to twiddle the
bits, but I'm sure the admins will help and I'll buy them a few rounds for
their trouble at our next encounter. :-)

To answer your question about my persons I do have two PAUSE accounts, one
historical and one current. These are both my names. I am the same as
myself, too, so not to worry about tracking me down twice.

Cheers,
Casey
