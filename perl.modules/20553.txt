No, it's now more like

# zgrep Convert::Binary 02packages.details.txt.gz
Convert::Binary::C                 0.38  M/MH/MHX/Convert-Binary-C-0.12.tar.gz
Convert::Binary::C::Cached         0.13  M/MH/MHX/Convert-Binary-C-0.13.tar.gz

Authoritative is what the programmer writes in the module itself, not
what he decides to put into the filename of the distro. Give or take a
few tweaks. Since the very first days of CPAN we had distros with a
whole set of different version numbers.
