The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Convert::TimeUnits
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Unix units(1) style time conversions
  userid:      APEIRON (Christopher Nehren)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    None known.

  rationale:

    Some date manipulation functions and other uses for Perl return
    units of time as a raw number (the example which inspired me to
    write this module is the uptime() function of Sys::Load). This is
    fine if you're just going to dump the number somewhere, or base
    further calculations on it. But for formatting that number so that
    multiples of 60 seconds are converted to minutes, etc., nothing
    beats the power and flexibility of the units(1) program.
    Unfortunately, it has come to my attention that Windows systems and
    many Unix (e.g. many common Linux distributions) systems by default
    lack this program. Hence I wrote Convert::TimeUnits (I also didn't
    want to deal with `` or qx). Convert::TimeUnits the module fills
    this software gap for units of time. Convert::TimeUnits the name was
    chosen because at the very basic level, this module converts things.
    It converts units of time to their equivalent values as expressed by
    other units.

The resulting entry would be:

Convert::
::TimeUnits       bdphp Unix units(1) style time conversions         APEIRON
