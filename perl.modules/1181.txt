I'd like to officially register the following two modules:

Thesaurus

DSLI - RdpO

Create associations between related things

Thesaurus::File

DSLI - RdpO

Persitence via CSV files

Thesaurus::DBM

DSLI - RdpO

Persistence via DBM files

Thesaurus::DBI

DSLI - idpO

Persistence in a database via DBI


DSLI for all of these is MdpO (I say mature because other people are using
this and developing their own subclasses so what the heck).

Log::Dispatch

Log messages to multiple outputs

Log::Dispatch::Output

Base class for output objects

Log::Dispatch::File

Log output to file

Log::Dispatch::Handle

Log output to any IO::Handle

Log::Dispatch::Screen

Log output to STDOUT or STDERR

Log::Dispatch::Syslog

Log output to system log via syslog

Log::Dispatch::Email

Base class for logging to email

Log::Dispatch::Email::MIMELite

Send email via MIME::Lite module

Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSend

send email via Mail::Send module

Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSendmail

send email via Mail::Sendmail module


I don't know if I can claim the new top level space of Thesaurus (and can
live without it if you think my module isn't appropriate for that space)
but I think I have a reasonable claim to Log::Dispatch.  I'm expecting
someone else (Dominique Dumont) to be putting out a Log::Dispatch::Tk
suite soon, which has my permission (if such a thing is needed) to be put
in this namespace, should it be given to me.  I know she's talked to Nick
Ing-Simmons about this as well and I think he's ok with this too.


Thanks,

-Dave
