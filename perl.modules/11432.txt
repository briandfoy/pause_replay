Hello,

I have 2 problems with system utility.

1. If a process is started by system, then, when a process is killed, child
process still remains.
2. When output of the process is redirected to a file, file does not get
updated util process dies.

This problem is there on Linux and windows as well.

Can any body help me please?

Ex:-
1. when (perl a.pl - see a.pl below) is killed, tcpdump process, started by
a.pl still remains.
2. until (perl b.pl and tcpdump - see b.pl below) is killed, output file is
not updated.


a.pl
-----
#!/usr/bin/perl

system("tcpdump -i");

# ends;

b.pl
-----
#! /usr/bin/perl
system("tcpdump -i > output");

#ends;
