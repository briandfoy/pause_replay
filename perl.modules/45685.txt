Indeed. As Acme goes, it's not that interesting or clever. As
web services goes, it might qualify for a new section, such
as WWW::BandInfo or something :)

I'd certainly like to have something where I can have a watchlist
of things I'd like to see and then use a script to find out
when they'll be in the same town as me. :)
