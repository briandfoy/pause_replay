Curry is a simple module to curry functions like in Lisp. I saw this
functionality suggested in a RFC for perl6, and thought, what a bad
idea! This would be easy to do with existing functionality. I did that
and thougt I should share. Other things might follow.

The implementation is just about as basic as possible.

Being a bit of a Lisp fan, other Lisp-likes might follow. Still, I'm
sure that no one wants Lisp::Curry, etc.

My module bears no particular relation to any module I have been able to
find. Except perhaps CORE::map and CORE::grep? In fact I could imagine
Curry in the CORE, but that would require a smallish change in how to
pass argument 'holes' to the curry function.


I have not discussed this officially which I understand to be a potetial
problem, but I have used it myself for a while, and distributed it to a
couple of colleagues, and I think it is ready for release.

Hope that Curry is not conidered cutesy. And that I will be accepted for
the great honour...  (h., h. & nudge)
