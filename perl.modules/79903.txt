The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Column
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: I/O files separated with any delimiters
  userid:      NARAZAKA (N Narazaka)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    had asked module name in beginners@perl.org

  similar:
    Text::CSV

  rationale:

    This module is for input and output of "config" / "BBS log" files
    whose records are separated by some delimiters.

    I mean "config" / "BBS log" files as some tab/comma/etc separated
    (single delimiter) data or data such as '12. [This is the subject] :
    2012/02/07 : Article' ("multiple delimiters"), that is text data
    consisted of many records of some data columns.

    I wrote this module to unify methods to input and output these
    files (especially "multiple delimiters" data). This module will
    convert the data and raw array reference mutual. Text::CSV is
    similar but my purpose is to process multiple delimiters, so
    Text::CSV is not enough.

    I submitted this name for the present but I'm hesitating to decide
    the namespace of the module. I have thought that BBS:: seems to
    specialize purpose too much, Text:: seems not for modules for file
    IO and Config:: seems not for 2 dimension data list. If the proper
    namespace comes up, the name will be *::Column or *::Delimiters but
    I'm afraid that I may be confusing these words' meaningã€€because
    I'm not native speaker.

  enteredby:   NARAZAKA (N Narazaka)
  enteredon:   Mon Mar 12 09:29:37 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Column          bdpOp I/O files separated with any delimiters      NARAZAKA
