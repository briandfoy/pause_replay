The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URLToys
  DSLIP:       adpfb
  description: Find links in HTML, download them to files
  userid:      JDRAGO (Joe Drago)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://urltoys.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'd like to have this root level name in case it makes more sense
    in the future to have:

    use URLToys;

    instead of:

    use WWW::URLToys;

    (which is what I've already requested as the standard name)

    Since URLToys and urltoys.com are all the same entity, I figured
    it'd be good to reserve the namespace for it as well, since it will
    be a Perl module.

  enteredby:   JDRAGO (Joe Drago)
  enteredon:   Fri May  7 06:29:21 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

URLToys           adpfb Find links in HTML, download them to files   JDRAGO
