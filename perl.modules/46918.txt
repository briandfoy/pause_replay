Subject: Module submission Config::Generic
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Generic
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Configuration File Parsing and Validation
  userid:      NIKRATIO (Nikolaus Rath)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    No special places

  similar:
    Config::General

  rationale:

    I already submitted this module in 2003, but apparently something
    went wrong.. I neither received an approval nor a rejection. Anyway,
    here is it again.

    The namespace choice is probably obvious. There are already a lot
    of configration parser resisting in Config::.

    The configuration file format is almost exactly the same as the one
    of Config::General. However, there are several new features:

    Config::Generic works with specfiles that describe the
    configuration file format and performs an automatic validation of
    its input.

    Config::Generic supports hybrid access using tied hashes and an
    object orientated interface.

    Config::Generic supports retrieving the line number of a config
    option.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Generic         adphp Configuration File Parsing and Validation    NIKRATIO
