Hi Toby,

There is an outstanding issue with JSON::Path which includes a pull request=
 to fix https://github.com/tobyink/p5-json-path/pull/1

The issue is that JSON::Path only supports the dot operator for the jsonpat=
h specification, and doesn't allow use for the square bracket with quote me=
thod.

Dot notation: $.store.book[0].title
Bracket notation: $['store']['book'][0]['title']

Both are valid.

If you're defining the definitions yourself, you can avoid the unsupported =
functionality, but this is not ideal for an interoperable API.

Would you be able to accept the pull request and push out a new release?
If not, would you be able to issue me with co-maint, like with JSON::Schema=
 previously?


Cheers
Ben
