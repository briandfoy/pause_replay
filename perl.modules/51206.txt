Yeah sorry, I was having email issues, for some reason my responses 
weren't making it to the list.

I want LOCAL simply as an account that we can promise will NEVER have 
anything uploaded and never be taken by anyone else, so that it is free 
for use by a local user to do anything they want.

In my case, I want to do few things similar to CPAN::Mini::Inject, copy 
dist tarballs into the L/LO/LOCAL directory, generate a CHECKSUM file, 
then install those tarballs via the CPAN shell (with access to the 
recursion etc and CPAN deps auto-installed).

There's a few other things I want to do as well, but they are more 
tentative.

If someone wants to use LOCAL for the purposes of testing, and they 
clean up after themselves and their tests, that's fine with me. Use 
LOCAL if you wish.

That said, do we want to flesh out the roster of reserved accounts? 
PAUSE, LOCAL, ???TEST???
