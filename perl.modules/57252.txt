     why:

    I've been a perl developer for 8 years and have worked on many
    modules that I would consider cpan worthy. However, most of them do
    not have the documentation and test scripts created that I would
    require before submitting them.

    I do have one module for interfacing with the information on
    perldoc that I would like to add. But mostly I am registering so
    that I could help maintain current modules until such a time as I
    have a better plan for what I would like to contribute.
