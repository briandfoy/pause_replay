I'm not sure what you were doing, but it was possible.  I was teaching
classes about it.

That seems like it's outside the sccope of this module.  It certainly
doesn't fit in an HTML namespace.

this seems like something other than HTML::Object.  You have a lot
of stuff goiing on there that isn't HTML.

this may be one of the cases were you would want to choose a
fanciful name, like Simon chose Maypole, to describe your
module.
