Sorry about duplicate/repeat messages, but thought I'd CC
modules@perl.org for the record.

You've not released a new version of this for about 3 years. Would you
mind if I took it over and released an update including support for
some additional output formats (e.g. OpenDocument)? Or else I could
send you some patches?
