The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Module::Selector
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Selects the first/best module for a job
  userid:      OKROEGER (Odin Kröger)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Module::Selector helps to select modules and eases programming if
    you are faced with multiple modules doing the same job, where it
    helps to choose a module out of a list of modules, which is
    installed. It is even more helpful if those modules do not implement
    the same features, so you have to switch between them to get the job
    done (i.e. if you work with MP3s and wish to alter a encoded tag
    saved in ID3v2.4, this currently can only be done combining
    MP3::Mplib and MP3::Tag, as one lacks ID3v2.4 and the other lacks
    encoding support). I did not find any similar modules on CPAN. As
    soon as I find time I will rewrite my MP3 meta module (which
    combines MP3::Info, MP3::Mplib and MP3::Tag), which is based on this
    module, so that I can upload an example of how this module can be
    used. The name itself should be quite self-explainatory; I thought
    about naming it "Chooser" or "Switcher", but as I am not a native
    speaker of english I got no idea, which of those puts it best. I am
    open to suggestions.
