There are other modules with similar cryptic names.
Like LWP.

I assume CPAN isn't interested in non-free licenses.
(I wouldn't use a non-free module if there are alternatives.)

This module is copyrighted to the company I work for, but they
let me publish it under GPL.
The reason I ask is if GPL is enough or if you want the Artistic.
And other communities, like Debian, has hard demands on the license.

From your answer I guess that GPL will do.
