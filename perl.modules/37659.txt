Subject: Module submission Math::Business::SMA

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Business::SMA
  DSLIP:       MdpOg
  description: Perl extension for calculating simple moving
  userid:      JETTERO (Jettero Heller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Business::EMA

  rationale:

    I know of a half dozen people that actually use Math::Business::EMA
    and Math::Business::MACD. I'm just trying to add Math::Business::SMA
    and Math::Business::MACD.

    For some reason Math::Business::EMA was the only one ever added...

    The site where they were originally discussed has since vanished.

  enteredby:   JETTERO (Jettero Heller)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 13 20:42:14 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Business::
::SMA             MdpOg Perl extension for calculating simple moving JETTERO
