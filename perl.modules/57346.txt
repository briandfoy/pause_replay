::Base could work, but the confusion isn't likely to be an issue:  there *is*
no Config::Ini, and has not been since 2000.

What I am more interested in using it for is common documentation of the
default format.  I realize that Config/INI/Format.pod could be used, but I am
also thinking of it this way:  with a number of things under Config::INI::, it
seems logical that Config::INI exist for documentation and for some of the most
common code.

This will be even more obnoxious when (if?) Config::Ini expires in December and
someone else uses the namespace, meaning that the Config::INI stuff I've
uploaded now seems related to random-cpan-author's Config::ini.

That happened to me in the past.  I uploaded HTML::Widget::{Factory,Plugin} and
not HTML::Widget.  HTML::Widget got used a little while later, and I ended up
getting bug reports, and found it difficult to separate my product from the
unrelated HTML::Widget in people's minds.

While AppConfig is in some ways well known, I don't think confusion is likely
to result.  App::Config is the natural (I think) way to parse the spoken phrase
"Install App Config," and in writing it is clear.  I don't think AppConfig is
very well known outside the Big CPAN Echo Chamber.  I think its primary role,
these days, is to be a prereq of Template-Toolkit.

Meanwhile, App::Config fits in with App::Cmd, and App::Deploy (under
development but presented at PPW).  I could rename it App::Cfg or something, I
suppose, but that seems unnecessarily ugly to me.
