Hi -

I wrote some time ago requesting a namespace change for my module
Win32::Systeminfo. I believe it's listed only as SystemInfo, which is why I
can't find it on a normal search for "Win32". The namespace should really be
Win32::SystemInfo.

I've just released a new version, and would like for people to be able to
find it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

My PAUSE id is CJOHNSTON

Thanks in advance,
Chad Johnston
