The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Scalar::Properties
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: run-time properties on scalar variables
  userid:      MARCEL (Marcel Grunauer)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    london.pm and vienna.pm mailing lists, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Attribute::*

  rationale:

    Scalar::Properties attempts to make Perl more object-oriented by
    taking an idea from Ruby: Everything you manipulate is an object,
    and the results of those manipulations are objects themselves.

    'hello world'->length -1234->abs "oh my god, it's full of
    properties"->index('g')

    The first example asks a string to calculate its length. The second
    example asks a number to calculate its absolute value. And the third
    example asks a string to find the index of the letter 'g'.

    Using this module you can have run-time properties on initialized
    scalar variables and literal values. The word 'properties' is used
    in the Perl 6 sense: out-of-band data, little sticky notes that are
    attached to the value. While attributes (as in Perl 5's attribute
    pragma, and see the `Attribute::*' family of modules) are handled at
    compile-time, properties are handled at run-time.

The resulting entry would be:

Scalar::
::Properties      RdpOp run-time properties on scalar variables      MARCEL
