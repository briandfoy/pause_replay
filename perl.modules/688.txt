Hi-

I want to register myself as a developer so I can upload my work to CPAN.

Name: Paul Franceus
email: paul@raba.com
no homepage
userID: PFRANCEUS
Desc: Libraries that make the Platform Computing LSF (Load Sharing Facility)
API available from Perl.
DSLI: cdc0

I'd like to place this stuff at LSF::Base and LSF::Batch. I may use other
namespaces under LSF:: in the future, if that's alright.

I've discussed this with other LSF folk from TI, Monsanto, the US Navy, and
Platform computing corporation itself. All are very interested. TI and
Platform Computing are both going to help me maintain the code once it's
public.

Thanks.

Paul
