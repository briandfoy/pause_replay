Hi Frey,

In early September I emailed you:
> I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m emailing you because =
I=E2=80=99m working on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now =
considering package names case insensitively. This has left us with some =
situations where two or more people are owners of namespaces previously =
considered distinct, and now considered the same.
>=20
> Frey has ownership of MCrypt (last released in 2000), and Theo has =
ownership of Mcrypt (last released in 2007). These are now considered =
the same from a permissions perspective, resulting in a conflict, which =
wouldn=E2=80=99t let anyone release a new version.

Frey, are you happy to delete your MCrypt distribution from CPAN, and to =
drop your permissions on the MCrypt namespace?

If I don=E2=80=99t hear anything from you, I=E2=80=99ll drop your =
permissions on the namespace next week.

Cheers,
Neil
