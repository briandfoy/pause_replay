The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       BS2000::LMS
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: access BS2000 LMS libraries
  userid:      DORNER (Thomas Dorner)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perl-mvs (at) perl.org

  similar:
    Archive::Ar

  rationale:

    The BS2000 Library Management System allows a BS2000 users to put
    files together in libraries, a bit similar to the ar archive program
    on Unix machines. As native BS2000 only has a flat file system
    (Volume, User, Filename) this is heavily used. If you use the
    Unix-like Posix subsystem on BS2000 (which has a Unix file system as
    well) you can copy files to and from native BS2000 LMS libraries,
    but that's all, you can't even access the table of contents.
    Fortunately LMS has a C API and this is where this module comes in.
    It will allow a BS2000 user to access LMS libraries and their
    elements from native BS2000 and the Posix subsystem alike using a
    Perl script. At the moment only access to the table of contents and
    copying elements to and from libraries are implemented, but
    additional methods (like direct reading and writing) are planned for
    the future.

    As this module will only compile on BS2000 machines I think a new
    rootlevel namespace (like MVS:: and all the other machine specific
    namespaces) should be in order.
