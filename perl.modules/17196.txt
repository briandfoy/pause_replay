the first author to upload a new namespace effectively owns it, whether
or not they register it.  no one should be able to upload something over
your namespace.

you do not need anyone's permission to upload something to CPAN.  the
PAUSE admins are the ones who add things to the Modules List.  a lot
of the modules in CPAN are not in the Modules List (including yours),
and that is okay.
