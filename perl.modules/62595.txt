The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::Intelligence::MicroStrategy::CommandManager

  rationale:

    Business intelligence (BI) refers to a broad range of applications
    and technologies for gathering, storing, analyzing, and providing
    access to data to help make business decisions. BI is also described
    as a type of decision support system. MicroStrategy is a leading BI
    vendor. MicroStrategy is also the name of MicroStrategy's suite of
    BI tools. Here is a link to the company's website:
    http://www.microstrategy.com.

    MicroStrategy's Command Manager allows you to automate various
    administrative and application development tasks for the
    MicroStrategy platform. I created a module that provides a perl
    interface to MicroStrategy's Command Manager. I named the module
    Business::Intelligence::MicroStrategy::CommandManager.
