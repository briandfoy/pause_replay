  similar:
    Similar to Data::Pageset but mine is standalone do not need other
    modules

  rationale:

    Dear All,

    I am requesting the name space "Mewsoft" as I will be releasing
    some of our products as modules on CPAN, our products currently are
    auctions, classifieds, forums, PPC, and I have already some
    additional good modules that will be uploaded soon, so I'd like you
    to encourage me and reserve the name space "Mewsoft:*" for me.
    Please and Thank you, Much appreciated. Ahmed ELsheshtawy
