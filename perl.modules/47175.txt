Approved, but mate your implementation of sequences is so incredibly 
evil (and I mean that in a bad way) that I practically blanched...

They assume you are ONLY using sequences in a method identical to the 
way SQLite works. Sequences do a bunch of other things, and Postgres 
users are going to be using them.

You need to plaster some big "THIS DOESN'T WORK WITH ANYTHING BUT 
TRIVIAL ONE-PER-TABLE AUTO_INCREMENT-LIKE USAGE" all over the documentation.
