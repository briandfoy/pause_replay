I am working on some modules which use Storable to handle higher data
structures.  This is mainly for some neat IPC:

# CLIENT
   my $queue	= Storable::Queue->new("queue.file");
   $queue->push($reference_to_some_data);

# SERVER
   my $queue	= Storable::Queue->new("queue.file");
   my $data	= $queue->peek();
   my @data;

   if ( $$data = "FRED" ) {
        my @data	= $queue->pop_all();
   } else {
       $data		= $queue->pop();
   }

Anything "pushed" into the store file is kept in a queue/stack/whatever
format.  Thus, you can have multiple programs pushing and popping and the
data will come out in the right order.  Right now, I've called them
Storable::Queue, Storable::Stack, etc., but I've been wondering if that's
an appropriate place for them to go?
