Hello modules@perl.org,

any word on this?

I am able and willing to continue any necessary development and support  
for this and really need it added to my name space so I can continue  
some projects or otherwise have a different Name space recommended for  
use. (It manages redirecting IO back and forth so IO::Redirect seems  
appropriate)

Thanks for your consideration :)
