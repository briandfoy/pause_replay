     why:

    A distributed asynchronous job processing system called Helios.
    Written in Perl and heavily dependent on CPAN modules, I have been
    authorized to release it to the community. Having used free/open
    source software for so much over the years, I look forward to the
    opportunity to contribute positively to the Perl and CPAN community.
