Subject: Module submission constant::lexical

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       constant::lexical
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Pragma for making constants lexical
  userid:      SPROUT (Father Chrysostomos)
  chapterid:   27 (Pragma)
  communities:
    p5p

  similar:

  rationale:

    I cross-posted this to p5p, and only got one response. No one
    objected to it.

    In case someone else is reading this, here is my original
    rationale:

    You can use this for private constants that you don't want exposed
    as methods. These can also be used within an inner lexical scope, so
    two subroutines in the same package can have their own constants
    with no chance of name conflict.

  enteredby:   SPROUT (Father Chrysostomos)
  enteredon:   Wed Jul 30 01:20:49 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

constant::
::lexical         bdppp Pragma for making constants lexical          SPROUT
