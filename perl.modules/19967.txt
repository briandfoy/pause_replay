The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Perform
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Informix Perform character DB form emulator
  userid:      WEAV (Eric C. Weaver)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    performulator.sourceforge.net, freshmeat.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    DBIx seemed the place for something of this nature; Alzabo and its
    ilk are there.

    I know of no other implementation of a utility like this anywhere.
    Of course, I don't get out much.

  enteredby:   WEAV (Eric C. Weaver)
  enteredon:   Sat Mar 29 22:49:33 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Perform         bdphp Informix Perform character DB form emulator  WEAV
