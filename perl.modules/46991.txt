Well, one could say that this separation is a *design* decision. 

I think that Adam question should be read as: Is Tk::LineGraphDataset
a standalone module ? I.e. is it useful without Tk::LineGraph ?

If not, it looks like an implementation detail of Tk::LineGraph, so:
- you should really name it as Adam suggests (TK::LineGraph::Data or
  something)
- why adversite it at all by registering in the module list ?
