Greetings,

My CPAN user name is ANDREIN.

I have uploaded to CPAN several releases of the module
DBIx::XMLMessage, but for some reason I cannot see
them via "Edit Module Metadata" menu on the PAUSE..
Could you look into it, please? 

Also, the module has never made it down to

http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html

I am not sure if it has to happen automatically or
should I do something about it?

Thanks and regards,
- Andrei Nossov
