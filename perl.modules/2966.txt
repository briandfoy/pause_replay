Hello

I would like to register as a CPAN author, twice if possible.

I would like two different registrations because there are two different
copyright holders involved: Kasei is me personally; BlackStar is the UK's
largest video store and I am their Technical Guru.  We only sell on the Net, and
our entire system from web to warehouse is written in Perl.  If I leave,
BlackStar will want to continue releasing their code to CPAN.  BlackStar, along
with O'Reilly, were the main sponsors of the first YAPC::Europe where we
discussed releasing our code.

All of the modules below were discussed briefly at YAPC::Europe, mostly in the
pub or the pizza shop :-)

Here is the information you need:
