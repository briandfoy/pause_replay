     why:

    I do love Perl and I am activating at seoul.pm in Korea.

    I've been used the Perl since 2008 but I haven't never tried to
    contribute anything, that's really sad to me.

    Actually, I don't have any plan to contribute some modules yet.

    But, I'd like be the developer who can contribute some modules that
    will be useful to many ppl.

    Please approve that I have the PAUSE account.
