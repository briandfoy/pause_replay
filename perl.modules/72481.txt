The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parallel::Supervisor
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: manage a collection of jobs and their output
  userid:      KLYNC (Kevin Semande)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    irc.freenode.net #perl, www.26a.net

  similar:
    Supervisor, IPC::Run, Parallel::Simple, Proc::Launcher, POE

  rationale:

    Many modules provide functionality somewhat similar to
    Parallel::Supervisor, but none are quite like this. The goal is to
    provide a mechanism for managing a collection of jobs and monitoring
    their output, while remaining as un-complicated and as flexible as
    possible.

    This module can be integrated with Parallel::Jobs,
    Parallel::ForkManager, and probably other modules which provide some
    mechanism of forking, or by calling fork() itself.

    The Parallel::Supervisor object tracks the state of each job
    (prepared, running, or finished) and creates a pipe to connect the
    output of the worker to the parent for reading. For situations where
    this functionality is all that is required, it is much easier to
    implement than more complicated solutions such as the top-level
    Supervisor modules, or sophisticated frameworks such as POE. Worker
    processes do not need to be specifically designed for use in its
    context, and the module makes no assumptions about the logic or
    control flow, allowing the parent to respond to the output, or exit
    status of a job as required.

    Please see the inline pod at this url for a more detailed
    description:

The resulting entry would be:

Parallel::
