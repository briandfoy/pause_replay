The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Artemis
  DSLIP:       Mmphp
  description: Automated OS testing, also virtualized
  userid:      SCHWIGON (Steffen Schwigon)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)

  rationale:

    We consider to release (after careful cleanup) our framework for
    automated OS testing to CPAN.

    It consists of several modules to have a central control program
    which triggers machines to boot via network, so they are
    automatically installed, executing satellite modules, injecting
    toolchain into virtualized guest images (usually for Xen, KVM), a
    scheduler, some services to receive test results, a web application
    to view results, a DPath driven query interface, etc., etc.

    It's all "quite ok", "medium-modern" Perl -- DBIC, Catalyst, Moose,
    some MX::Declare, although maybe not the most bleading edge.

    We presented parts of it during German Perlworkshop and
    YAPC::Europe, both 2009:

    http://www.perl-workshop.de/talks/157/view
    http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/talk/1950

    We plan to release it "this year" -- "maybe". I know that bears
    some risk of a uselessly preallocated namespace but the last problem
    I want to have is someone already took the namespace during the next
    months which would be the fiasco for us where that namespace is
    omnipresent.

    All in all I think it's worth the top-level namespace due to it's a
    whole infrastructure in itself.

    Thanks and regards, Steffen
