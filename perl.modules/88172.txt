The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::ShortCut::BuildInstance
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: A shortcut to build Moose instances
  userid:      JANDREW (Jed Lund)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    https://github.com/jandrew/MooseX-ShortCut-BuildInstance

  similar:
    Moose::Meta::Class Moose::Util MooseX::ClassCompositor

  rationale:

    This class is used to create a Moose class or instance on the fly.
    There are two primary functions; build_class and build_instance. If
    you call build_instance the function will internally call
    build_class with the passed arguments. The purpose of this class is
    the ability to build a custom class instance in one step rather than
    stringing together a series of -> calls from object creation by
    Moose::Meta::Class and role addition calls from Moose::Util. Along
    the way it will handle most missing pieces of the class building
    puzzle as well as allowing for one role to require elements of a
    previous role without writing an additional loop. Each element here
    is available somewhere else but not all of them together. As a
    consequence this is a 'ShortCut' removing multiple steps to instance
    creation.
