Hello,

I attended HFB's session today at the Perl Conference on grokking CPAN
and was inspired to request a CPAN ID.  There are several projects
that I'm working on, most of them related to automated systems
administration.  At some point, I hope to upload a few general-purpose
modules from this project as well as some scripts that use them.

I'll be sure to read the proper FAQ's and other documents and follow
proper procedure to request a name space (or to be part of an
appropriate existing name space) before I start uploading.  Thanks for
your assistance.
