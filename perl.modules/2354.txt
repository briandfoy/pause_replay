Hi,

I have a need to make update and distribute what appears to be an orphaned 
module.  And I was hoping someone here could advise me on the correct 
way of doing this.

I have been trying to contact the original author to no avail.  And as you can 
see from the attached email from Matt Sisk at the time he was talking to 
Stacy Lacy they indicated that they were looking for someone to take over 
maintenance.

I am happy to register as maintainer of this module, but I am unsure what is 
the best way of getting this done.

Thanks

That was a while ago...I saw one response where he (she?) indicated that
they were willing to give it up for adoption, but I never heard anything
more.

Nope. You might try the modules mailing list and see if any of them have
any information (modules@perl.org).

I'm sure Stacy Lacy wouldn't mind, based on the response I got a couple
of years ago. As a general issue, I'm not sure what the procedure for
orphaned modules is...I would be curious to see a response from
modules@perl.org regarding that.

No problem, I can see how HTML::Element based trees can be a pain if you
just want to hit the ground running.

Take care,
Matt Sisk
