Hi

Firstly, address email to modules@perl.org. That way, the list they go 
to is read by PAUSE admins. I'm copying this email to that list.

You can follow the list here:

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/

As for the module, I don't have an exact answer, but here's what I would do:

1) Remove from CPAN all versions of the module, by logging in to 
pause.perl.org

2) Wait a few days, even a week if necessary, until (hopefully) CPAN is 
reindexed, and your modules have vanished.

3) That is, check the index before trying to upload any more versions.

4) Keep in mind you can never upload the same version twice. Since you 
use such tiny version # increments, jump bump the # when ready, and 
explain in your Changes file why you did that (i.e. no code changes).

5) Recently I and others have had problems with the upload, in that a 
valid download can come from metacpan but the copy (of the same version) 
downloaded from search.cpan.org is corrupt. I'm seriously beginning to 
suspect these things (my problem and yours) may be linked. I did 
re-upload a version but the same thing happened.

6) Keep the list informed of your steps and results.

Good luck!
