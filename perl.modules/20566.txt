I just installed 0.13 and see:

% perl -MConvert::Binary::C\ 999
Convert::Binary::C version 999 required--this is only version 0.13.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted.

It's not illegal but it's unnecessary burden on the user. While the
overhead for you is low to revert to a previous state and increment
the version number nonetheless.

But don't let us touch religious ground--it's a dont-do-that on CPAN.

CPAN is not meant as your backup medium. There is a backpan to serve
as that. BTW, the more users fill precious resources with old cruft
the sooner we will have to enforce a cleanup procedure.

I leave it up to you, but right now, while we talk, people do not get
your new version from CPAN:

cpan> m Convert::Binary::C                    
Module id = Convert::Binary::C
    CPAN_USERID  MHX (Marcus Holland-Moritz <mhx-cpan@gmx.net>)
    CPAN_VERSION 0.38
    CPAN_FILE    M/MH/MHX/Convert-Binary-C-0.12.tar.gz
    MANPAGE      Convert::Binary::C - Binary Data Conversion using C Types
    INST_FILE    /usr/local/perl-5.8.0/lib/site_perl/5.8.0/i686-linux-multi/Convert/Binary/C.pm
    INST_VERSION 0.13

I had to run

cpan> install MHX/Convert-Binary-C-0.13.tar.gz
