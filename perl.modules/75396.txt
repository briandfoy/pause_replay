brian is, of course, right, but since I just saw that the same process 
was followed in 2008 by Jan Dubois*, I see no reason to not go with 
granting co-maintenance quickly in this case.

Podmaster, in case you read this and object, please do note that this is 
a reversible action.

Best regards,
Steffen
