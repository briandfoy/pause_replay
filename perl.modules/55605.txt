The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTTP::ProxySelector::Persistent
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Select a proxy server from a local cache
  userid:      MTROWBRI (Michael Trowbridge)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTTP::ProxySelector

  rationale:

    While the basic purpose of this module is the same as
    HTTP::ProxySelector, HTTP::ProxySelector::Persistent is drastically
    redesigned to allow it to scale up much larger. The cache based
    approach also conserves the bandwidth of proxy list hosts.
    Persistent's mandatory proxy testing aims to increase the
    reliability to a level that's practical for businesses.

    This module is a fork of HTTP::ProxySelector v0.02 by Eyal Udassin.
    I think that subclassing my module as
    HTTP::ProxySelector::Persistent is a good way to identify its
    origin.

    The HTTP::ProxySelector::Persistent API is also backwards
    compatible with HTTP::ProxySelector.

    I attempted to contact Eyal Udassin, author of the parent
    namespace, but had my email returned undeliverable.

The resulting entry would be:

HTTP::ProxySelector::
::Persistent      adpOp Select a proxy server from a local cache     MTROWBRI
