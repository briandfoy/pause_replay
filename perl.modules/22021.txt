Hi,

last year, I've written a little Perl module and uploaded it to CPAN. I'v=
e=20
just got a bug report on it, so I've fixed the bug, made a new version (0=
=2E08)=20
and uploaded it to PAUSE (I've forgotten my password but got a new one=20
without any trouble).

I also decided to use the occasion and update the module metadata (to des=
cribe=20
it as stable - God knows it hasn't been changing much lately... :-) ). Bu=
t=20
PAUSE won't let me access the module's metadata - it claims that
> Sorry, there are no modules registered belonging to VBAR. Please note, =

So here goes. I don't really remember what I did to register the module, =
but=20
it's been accepted before and it really is still maintained - it just nee=
ds a=20
few users... How do I keep XML::DifferenceMarkup maximally accessible?
