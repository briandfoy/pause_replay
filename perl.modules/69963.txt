The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Any::Adapter::Term
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Log::Any adapter for color terminal logging
  userid:      PITCHLESS (Mark Pitchless)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    http://github.com/markpitchless/Log-Any-Adapter-Term/

  similar:
    Log::Dispatch::Screen

  rationale:

    Log::Any::Adapter::* namespace is the one recommend by the author
    (Jonathan Swartz) of Log::Any, which this module is just a plugin
    for.

    Considered Log::Any::Adapter::Screen but used Term as it seems a
    more specific name, screen could be some sort of graphics output.
    Also consistant with Term::ANSIColor, which it uses.

    Log::Any can currently log to the terminal via it's Log::Dispatch
    adapter. I wanted something lighter, with only terminal output in
    color. Good for building chatty command line tools. Also plan to add
    support for logging categories (as supplied by Log::Any) which
    Log::Dispatch does not support.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::Any::Adapter::
::Term            adpOp Log::Any adapter for color terminal logging  PITCHLESS
