The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Sofu
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Interface to "sofu" files
  userid:      MALUKU (Marc - Sebastian Lucksch)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Forum of http://sourceforge.net/projects/sofu/

  similar:
    Storable

  rationale:

    Please excuse my spelling/grammar cause I'm german.

    I didn't want to create a new root-namespace for a single module
    which exchanges data from and to files. So i looked up the
    modulelist and found the "Data" tree. There are modules like
    "Data::HTMLDumper" or "Data::Hexdumper" and I thought my module fits
    in here, because it can read and write perl complex data, consisting
    of hashes, arrays and scalars to files and reread them again. Plus
    it can pack/unpack these types of data to/from strings.

    Unlike "Storable" it writes "sofu" files, which can also be read by
    C/C++ and D programms.

  enteredby:   MALUKU (Marc - Sebastian Lucksch)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 22 11:08:05 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Sofu            bdpOo Interface to "sofu" files                    MALUKU
