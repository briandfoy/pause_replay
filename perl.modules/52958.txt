     why:

    An update to the Bloom::Filter module, which reduces computational
    complexity of insert and check operations to linear time, reduces
    memory footprint, significantly speeds up processing, and makes the
    module a realistic choice for real-world computing. I've contacted
    the module author for permission, registering while I wait for
    response.
