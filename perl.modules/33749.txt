The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PBL
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: The Phrasebook Language
  userid:      TAG (Scott McCoy)
  chapterid:    9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    irc://efnet/perl irc://magnet/perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    I really feel odd asking for a root namespace, however I am half
    convinced its appropriate. This module set implements a language for
    describing database interaction via code generation, which is
    optionally runtime evaluated or written to static modules. It
    enforces domain/range contracts to follow typing of SQL, and acts as
    a meta-set of SQL.

    Its an object oriented language, with classes, member data and
    member functions. The functions however are not in the typical sense
    of a function, as this is not a programming language exactly. For
    instance, each "function" (actually named a query, respectively) can
    have prepare and execute attributes but not multiple instances of
    them since they are attributes and not calls.

    It allows you to return complex datastructures rather than
    statement handles, or even propigated instances of another
    phrasebook object. I pasted a few examples on the freenode perl's
    pastebot ( http://sial.org/pbot/3604 http://sial.org/pbot/3605
    http://sial.org/pbot/3638 )

    My logic for asking for a root namespace is that this is really an
    entirely different module and I'm not really finding any namespace I
    can classify it under. Its an entirely unique amongst all current
    phrasebook approaches and quite unique in itself for a mediary
    language in general.

    Example of other things that have similar root namespaces: YAML POE
    Alzaboo Mason

    I think this deserves its own namespace far more than YAML does.
    I'm not all about namespace pollution though, so if you can suggest
    an alternative namespace that appropriately describes this module,
    (Not DBIx:: blah -> I think thats far from appropriate) I will
    gladly accept it.

    Things included in this distribution: - A command line interface
    compiler - A seperate parser for PBL-style languages - A package
    which exports constants for the parser - A Rule package which
    describes PBL itself - A DBI subclass for enforcing domain/range
    contracts in non production-optimized environments - A Title class
    for translating the PBL Parser output into Perl - A Core class for
    interacting with all of the above and interface to dynamic runtime
    translation/evaluation of PBL sources ... And likely more to come.

The resulting entry would be:

PBL               bdphp The Phrasebook Language                      TAG
