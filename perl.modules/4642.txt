My name: Rafael R. Sevilla
My email addresses: dido@pacific.net.ph, sevillar@ph.psi.net
My CPAN user ID (already registered): DIDO

I've created a new module named SHA256 which is to be an interface to
the new SHA256/384/512 algorithm developed by NIST as a counterpart to
AES (at present it only supports SHA256, but that will change as soon
as I fix the code for SHA384 and SHA512).  The interface for this is
essentially the same as that of the original SHA module (on which the
code is partly based), and defines these methods:

reset() - reset the hash
add(LIST) - add a list of strings to the hash
addfile(HANDLE) - adds the contents of a file to the hash
digest() - finalizes the digest, returning the digest value in binary
hexdigest() - same as above, except that it returns a hexadecimal
string representing the digest
hash($string) - convenience method - hashes a string by doing
add(string) then digest()
hexhash($string) - same as above except it uses hexdigest() instead of
digest()

I'll also add an additional method in the future:

settype(number) - which accepts 256, 384 or 512 and uses the
appropriate hash size.

DSLI for this modules:

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
SHA256         bdch  NIST SHA-256/512/384 message digest algo.    DIDO

They ought to wind up in category 14: Authentication, Security, and
Encryption.
