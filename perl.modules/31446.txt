     why:

    I'm going to upload three extensions to CGI::Session.

    CGI::Session::Serialize::DataDumper is just a copy of
    CGI::Session::Serialize::Default but with the actual name of the
    serializer (Data Dumper) so that module users can reference it by
    name instead of as "Default"

    CGI::Session::FlexMySQL is a derivation from CGI::Session::MySQL
    which allows module users to fully customize the MySQL connection
    including data tables and field names, as well as more precisely
    control when the database handle is disconnected.

    CGI::Session::BitBucket is a new creation to allow module users to
    test an application which uses CGI::Session but without having to
    set up any sort of data store at all. Basically it's so they can
    test it stateless for syntax etc. without a datastore and without
    having to comment out all the session code.

    BTW I added *@perl.org to my email whitelist but if your message to
    me is rejected anyway, please call +1 (408) 997-1153.
