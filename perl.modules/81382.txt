Hi all,

I would like to take over maintenance of Math::Cephes:

https://metacpan.org/release/Math-Cephes

My PAUSE ID is SHLOMIF and here is my author page -
https://metacpan.org/author/SHLOMIF . I have already adopted several
CPAN distributions including XML::LibXML, Error, Text::Format,
and XML::SemanticDiff .

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
