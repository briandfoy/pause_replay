The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::DBI::Test::TempDB
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Maintain a SQLite database for testing CDBI
  userid:      LAMECH (Dan Friedman)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    cdbi-talk@groups.kasei.com (the Class::DBI mailing list)

  similar:

  rationale:

    In testing, we generally want tests to create and destroy all their
    own data. When writing Class::DBI-based projects, it's helpful to
    have a test database in which to do this, so that we can (a) be sure
    we're not stepping on production data, and (b) be sure of exactly
    what data is in the test database at the beginning/end of each test.

    Class::DBI::Test::TempDB handles the creation and destruction of a
    temporary SQLite database on disk; it also allows you to point your
    Class::DBI classes at the test database. You can then get on with
    creating, testing and destroying test data simply by interacting
    with your Class::DBI classes.

    The name for this module was suggested to me by Tony Bowden on the
    Class::DBI mailing list.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::DBI::Test::
::TempDB          RdpOp Maintain a SQLite database for testing CDBI  LAMECH
