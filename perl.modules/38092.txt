I'm not really sure what it has to do with Business though. I didn't
think any of the existing namespaces really fit. It does SSN validation,
and I saw various *::Validate, which is where the name came from. There
is a Business::FR::SSN, which was released *after* my original module
(mine in Aug '03). I'd think that one should be SSN::Validate::FR or
SSN::FR.

So, I guess that's two countries :-) I just think it would be misplaced
in Business::. Doesn't seem to fit next to Business::OnlinePayment::*
and Business::Payroll type modules.

Cheers,
Kevin
