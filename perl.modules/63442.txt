I'd think both MacOSX:: and Mac:: would be entirely acceptable as top 
level namespaces. I'm not a Mac user, so I'm probably not the right 
person to give feedback on the rest of the name.

I hadn't heard of the term "buddy allocator", but given the explanation, 
File::BuddyAllocator would be fine. If the module would equally apply to 
in-memory data, you could use the Data:: prefix, but I think File:: 
would be better.

Cheers,
Steffen
