Subject: Module submission HTML::Object

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Object
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: HTML Document Object
  userid:      JAMESP (James A. Pattie)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://htmlobject.sf.net/

  similar:
    CGI

  rationale:

    This module started out as a private module for use in some apps
    and then was open sourced about 3 years ago under the name
    HTMLObject.

    We would like to get it included in CPAN and thus are looking to
    change the name to HTML::Object or an otherwise approved name that
    still implies what the module provides.

    This module provides the ability to define a complete HTML document
    that is sent to the browser via cgi. I created the HTMLObject module
    because the CGI module didn't allow us to create the document (in
    any order we wanted - cookies, javascript, head, body, etc.) and
    then decide to discard this document and create a different one,
    based upon conditions while processing the users request.

    Over time I have tried to implement many of the CGI like helpers so
    that someone could potentially migrate from using CGI to the
    HTMLObject and not feel too lost. It is not a drop-in replacement
    and most of the functionality has been implemented as we needed
    something for the projects we are creating.

    To see some of the projects that use the current HTMLObject
    implementation goto
    http://htmlobject.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?command=links&lang=en

    I have done a CPAN search and did not find any modules claiming the
    HTML::Object namespace directly and thus feel this is at least
    available. All the modules would be HTML::Object::X and do not
    actually derive from HTMLObject/HTML::Object.

    Thank you for your consideration.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::Object          MdpOp HTML Document Object                         JAMESP
