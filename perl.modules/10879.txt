The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cisco::IPPhone
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: interact with Cisco IP phones from the web
  userid:      DBADRAK (Don Badrak)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, dc@lists.pm.org

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    I've placed these in Cisco::, because that root namespace already
    exists. It's then under IPPhone, since it follows from the
    CiscoIPPhone part of the XML definition of the objects (IP phone XML
    objects are tagged as <CiscoIPPhone(name)>. This didn't conflict
    with the Cisco:: stuff already in existence.

    The rest of the object classes are under that, like:

    Cisco::IPPhone::Menu Cisco::IPPhone::Directory
    Cisco::IPPhone::DirectoryEntry

    etc.

    I've placed this in chapter 15 of the module list because these
    objects are used for interaction with the IP phone, through HTTP.
    So, these would be used in CGI programming (perl, mod_perl).

The resulting entry would be:

Cisco::
::IPPhone         bdpOp interact with Cisco IP phones from the web   DBADRAK
