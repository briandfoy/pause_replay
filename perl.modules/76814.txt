The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Resolver
  DSLIP:       Rmphp
  description: Full-featured nonblocking resolver.
  userid:      RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    POE's mailing list. irc.perl.org #poe

  similar:
    POE::Component::Client::DNS

  rationale:

    I cleared it with the owner of the POE and POE::Component
    namespaces. He's cool with it.

    POE::Component::Resolver fulfills a slightly different purpose than
    POE::Component::Client::DNS.

    The former performs nonblocking resolver actions, including...
    whatever the system resolver supports. It's the host(1) of
    nonblocking resolvers.

    The latter uses Net::DNS to access resolver records directly. It's
    more appropirate for DNS introspection. It's more like nslookup(1)
    or dig(1) in that regard.

  enteredby:   RCAPUTO (Rocco Caputo)
  enteredon:   Fri Jul 15 03:22:35 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::
::Resolver        Rmphp Full-featured nonblocking resolver.          RCAPUTO
