The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Paper::Specs
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Specifications for paper stock, labels, etc.
  userid:      JLAWRENC (Jay Lawrence)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Module authors mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is FNI - frequently needed information - and I thought writing
    this module would be a nice thing to do.

    This type of information does exist in some modules here and there
    that might need to know about paper sizes or print labels. As well,
    applications like OpenOffice and gLabels have their own private
    collections of this type of info.

    This module will provide an efficient and easy to use one-stop-shop
    for paper sizes, label layouts and other print media items that I
    haven't thought of. As well it provides internal unit-conversion and
    some label position functions to unload that burden from users code.

    I have a few forms in the module already but will flesh out using
    any public data that I can find ... once API is firmed up a bit
    more.

  enteredby:   JLAWRENC (Jay Lawrence)
  enteredon:   Wed May 14 03:36:21 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Paper::
::Specs           adpOp Specifications for paper stock, labels, etc. JLAWRENC
