The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::ValidOp
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Simple validation of CGI params & runmodes
  userid:      LEGLESS (Randall Hansen)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    A wiki at: http://sonofhans.net/cgi-validop/kwiki; if there's enough
    interest I'll setup a mailing list.

  similar:
    CGI::AppToolkit CGI::Application CGI::Application::RM
    Data::FormValidator CGI::Validate Params::Check CGI::Untaint
    CGI::ArgChecker String::Checker

  rationale:

    I have a longish page on the module's Wiki
    (http://sonofhans.net/cgi-validop/kwiki/index.cgi?SimilarModules)
    that reviews all of the afore-mentioned related modules in some
    detail. Trying to err on the side of not clogging the list with
    minutiae, I'll reproduce only my conclusions here:

    It seems to me that no existing modules combine CGI::ValidOp's best
    features:

    - Easy-to-learn and simple API. - Relation of parameters to
    run-modes/operations. - Minimal usage is easy and useful; complex
    usage is easy and powerful. - Robust set of validation criteria
    (e.g. max/min length, data type, required/optional, custom error
    messages). - Validation defaults settable on many levels to minimize
    repetition. - Extensible validation with coderefs or regexes. -
    Error messages on a per-parameter basis; also available globally.

    Other modules do similar parsing, and perhaps do it better. These
    are good candidates for subclassing or integration, but don't affect
    the namespace of CGI::ValidOp or its usefulness as a standalone
    module.

    The name itself -- ValidOp -- sounds good to me, but I'm open to
    suggestions.

    CGI::Validate is a good module, and I could perhaps instantiate it
    individually for each operation/runmode, but see the 'Challenges to
    integration' section. In a perfect world, CGI::ValidOp could perhaps
    be CGI::Validate::Op, but this would require many changes in scope
    and philosophy to both modules. I'll start a conversation with
    Byron, CGI::Validate's author, so we'll see how it goes.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
