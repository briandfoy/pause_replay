The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Hash
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: An object-orient wrapper for hashes.
  userid:      HANENKAMP (Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::Struct

  rationale:

    Essentially, I've just wrapped a hash in an object-orient
    interface. There is no type checking as can be found with
    Class::Struct or its relatives. I have also provided the option of
    using many of the hash function (like keys, each, etc.) and a
    selection of functions based on the hash tie interface (like fetch,
    clear, etc.) as explicit functions. I was a little surprised to find
    that no one had done such a thing before--perhaps I've done
    something redundant and haven't been able to find something that
    should be obvious.

    Anyway, Class::Hash seemed like the most obvious name for the
    module and seems to match up with the types of modules one would
    expect under Class::.

  enteredby:   HANENKAMP (Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 18 05:19:11 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Hash            adpOp An object-orient wrapper for hashes.         HANENKAMP
