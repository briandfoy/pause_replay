The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sport::Analytics::SimpleRanking
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Implements simple ranking system.
  userid:      DWMYERS (David Myers)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Perl Monks, my blog

  similar:
    none that I know of.

  rationale:

    This is a algorithm that's part of the sports analytics movement
    that's affecting how people look at sports data these days. In terms
    of a new root, is it necessary? The answer is, it certainly is not
    required, but it would make it far easier to reach its intended
    target audience. I'm not sure that the typical sports fan would be
    looking for analytics code under Statistics:: or Algorithm::. I
    stuck with this while posting queries about alternate names on Perl
    Monks without objections. That said, I am not wedded to any
    particular name.

  enteredby:   DWMYERS (David Myers)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 20 05:39:11 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sport::Analytics::
::SimpleRanking   bdpOp Implements simple ranking system.            DWMYERS
