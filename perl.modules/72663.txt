The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences::Vnomes
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Generalized Serial Test for randomness
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    home

  similar:
    nil

  rationale:

    From the POD:

    The Generalized Serial Test for I<v>-nomes (or I<v>-plets or
    I<v>-bits), also known as the I<psi-squared test>, Kendall-Smith, or
    Good's test, assesses the independence of successive elements of a
    list. More specifically, if a series is composed of I<k> states (its
    "alphabet-size," number of alternatives, etc.), the test is for the
    equiprobability of the I<k>^I<v>-nomes in the sequence, e.g., that
    there are equal numbers of the sub-sequences of the trinomes (or
    triplets or, given only two states, tribits) ABA, ABB, AAB, BAA,
    AAA, etc. in a series of length I<N> composed of the two states A
    and B. The test is not only suitable for binary output (unlike the
    Runs or Joins tests), and can involve a test of any length of
    sub-sequences less than the size of the series itself.

    This is not simply called "the serial test" for this is used to
    describe several different tests, including of the equal number of
    non-overlapping pairs, overlapping pairs, or larger sequences, by
    chi-square goodness-of-fit. The (default) emphasis in this module is
    on Good's test of backward differences of overlapping sequences.
