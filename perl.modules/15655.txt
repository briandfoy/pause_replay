The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cellular::Automata::Wolfram
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Implements Wolfram's 1-d Cellular Automata
  userid:      JMFREEMAN (James Freeman)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Boston.pm meetings

  similar:
    Math::ematica,Game::Life

  rationale:

    The choice of Cellular::Automata::Wolfram had several alternatives.
    The first was Wolfram, but that is too general given everything Dr.
    Wolfram has accomplished. CAW was another option, but it wouldn't be
    self-documenting.

    Math::Wolfram was another possiblity, but given how much non
    automata mathematics Wolfram has produced, it was too general again.
    Game::Life is close, but this is not a game and Game::Wolfram seemed
    unclear.

The resulting entry would be:

Cellular::Automata::
