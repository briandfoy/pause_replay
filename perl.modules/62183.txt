I have used several versions of Net::MySQL to download tables from MySQL.  It is very useful because the client OS is SCO OpenServer 5.0.7.  I once tried to build the MySQL client on this system but it was a disaster.  It seemed like there were many build environment problems.  (I'd love to use another OS but the client runs a proprietary turnkey application that has not been ported to Linux.)

Some time ago I installed 0.09 and it wouldn't even connect.  I worked through the problems and am now able to execute my query.  There were three problems:

1. The server was telling the client that it wanted the short version of the encrypted password (I'm guessing because the server was upgraded and passwords were not re-encrypted).   I added code to handle the response from the server and send a packet with the short version of the encrypted password.

2. The EOF packet at the end of the query was never matched because the server flags didn't match those in the comparison.  I changed it to look for the EOF marker only.

3. The EOF packet at the end of the header packets was 1 byte instead of 5 bytes.  I changed the code to look at the packet length so it should work regardless of the length of the packet.

Note: The server is 4.1.1 (the server is on a provider's server so I don't have any control over it).

Are you interested in incorporating the changes I made?  I thought others might be interested in them as well.  I'd be glad to look at other bugs too if that would be helpful.
