The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Checkpoint
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: In-line code benchmarking with HiRes
  userid:      ALEX (Alex J. Avriette)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org

  similar:
    Benchmark.pm

  rationale:

    I have already published a couple versions of this module, and am
    "registering" it so that the "RpdOp" will show up. The reason
    Checkpoint is different than Benchmark is that Checkpoint profiles
    very specific pieces of code, which the developer chooses with
    object creation. The Checkpoint software itself is very fast, even
    with design-by-contract architecture, uses Time::HiRes and thus is
    very precise, and is very code-thin (making it minimal impact).

    Checkpoint was developed by myself at a prior employer when we
    needed to determine how long certain individual "jobs" were taking
    across a vast network of machines of varying levels of performance.
    With this data, we were able to gain statistics not only about which
    machines were "slower" or "faster," but what they were slower and
    faster *at*, as well as pieces of code in particular that were
    taking up time.

    On piece of code we were very worried about was Params::Validate.
    We wanted to make sure that by turning on something that seemed so
    very heavy-handed we were not harming individual subroutines. To do
    this with Benchmark would have required an enormously bigger impact
    on the code we were testing, and would have brought into the fray
    functions we did not need.

    Checkpoint is a very thin and light way to benchmark things when
    the things you're doing are more important than the benchmarks
    you're collecting. It doesn't get in the way, and doesn't pretend to
    do anything else.

    That, and I like it a lot. Your sungo may vary.

The resulting entry would be:
