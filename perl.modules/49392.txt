The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::TT
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Terrestrial Time and its realisations

  rationale:

    Terrestrial Time (TT) is one of the modern rigorously correct time
    scales defined by the International Astronomical Union in the light
    of the general theory of relativity. It represents time on the
    Earth's surface, specifically at sea level. (Gravitational time
    dilation means that a clock at higher altitude ticks faster.)
    International Atomic Time (TAI) is steered, correcting for
    gravitational time dilation, to match the rate of TT. TAI is in turn
    the frequency standard behind UTC, the civil time standard. TT is
    thus of great theoretical importance in practical timekeeping on
    Earth.

    This module does two things. Firstly, and most simply, it provides
    a conversion between TT as a pure count of seconds and as a
    day-based date. There aren't really any days in TT, because it's
    independent of the Earth's rotation, but there is a convention for
    how to divide up the TT time line into nominal days. Regrettably
    this convention differs from the equivalent convention regarding
    TAI.

    Secondly, and more interestingly, this module provides a framework
    for the handling of various realisations of TT. Because TT is only
    theoretical, we can't use it directly. TAI is essentially an
    implementation of TT, using atomic clocks. There are other
    implementations of TT too, such as TT(BIPM05) which is based on more
    refined analysis of historical TAI data. It turns out that TT(TAI)
    is now about three quarters of a millisecond behind true TT, so
    moderately high precision applications need to know which version of
    TT they are using. This module provides an OO interface to
    conversion between different versions of TT, by interpolating
    between data points published by the BIPM (International Bureau of
    Weights and Measures).
