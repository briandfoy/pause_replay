About this Event
--------------------------
ITIL is more than a simple set of best practices guidelines to optimise a few service management processes. ITIL is a set of non-proprietary, comprehensive,
well-documented and fully integrated set of management procedures and best practices that optimises service management and IT/business alignment. With over 20,000
businesses, governments and non-profit organisations using it, ITIL is the most widely accepted process management framework in the world.

But has it worked? Many IT organisations suffer from poor perceptions of value and feel powerless to improve the situation. IT's top challenge right now is to build and
demonstrate value to the rest of the organisation - be that commerce, government or academia. How are CIO's and their Service Managers to leverage ITIL and ITSM to
meet that challenge head on and win?   

Several ACT and federal governments have started looking at how Service Management can help increase service levels and efficiency. This briefing illustrates the current
challenges for government and where ITIL fits into the IT-strategy.

Do not be content with prepared remarks alone. Go one-on-one with Gerard, asking the tough questions, eliciting the most revealing replies. Trends are confirmed. Illusions
shattered. News is broken. Live on the breakfast briefing stage.
