Hi Reini and Malcolm,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. I=E2=80=99m tidying up distributions=
 that have shared first-come ownership, since PAUSE tries now to not let =
this happen =E2=80=94 it maintains the permissions profile on the lead mo=
dule, regardless of who releases (in the past the releaser would get firs=
t-come on newly added modules).

The B-C distribution is one of these.

Reini (RURBAN) has first-come on most packages, including the lead module=
 B::C. =46or most of those modules, Malcolm (MICB) has co-maint. On just =
one of them =E2=80=94 B::C::InitSection =E2=80=94 the P5P user has co-mai=
nt.

Malcolm (MICB) has first-come on 6 of the packages, and on all of those R=
URBAN alone has co-maint.

There are also some packages appearing in the index against older release=
s of B-C, such as =22int=22 and =22double=22. Reini, if you could delete =
older releases of B-C, it would fix that problem.

Given that only RURBAN has ever released B-C, I=E2=80=99m guessing that M=
ICB=E2=80=99s permissions are left-over from when the distribution was sh=
ipped with Perl=3F

In that case, Malcolm are you happy for me to transfer your first-come pe=
rmissions to Reini, so he has full control over the distribution=3F

Thanks,
Neil
