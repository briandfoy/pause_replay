mysql> select * from grouptable WHERE user='JV';
+------+--------+
| user | ugroup |
+------+--------+
| JV   | admin  |
+------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> delete from grouptable WHERE user='JV';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)

Thanks for the reminder, I just now removed the admin bit on PAUSE, I
had missed to do that when I should have.

About the mail flow, please see wheather the mail headers give a hint
how to unsubscribe.

All the best wishes, Johan!
