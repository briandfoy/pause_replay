The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBI::Introspection
  DSLIP:       cdpOg
  description: OO Interface to database schema via DBI
  userid:      CLARKD (Damien Clark)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    gestalt-0.2.1 DBIx-Class SQL-DB

  rationale:

    gestalt provides metadata from the table and column layers, but not
    from the database layer, such that is returned by the get_info
    method of DBI. It is also part of a larger solution around data
    manipulation. It includes functionality to abstract querying
    databases.

    DBIx-Class is designed to allow simple upgrading of a database
    schema by creating SQL diff files.

    There are many others like those above that are designed for a
    specific purpose around DB metadata and part of a larger solution,
    rather than a generic and simple interface to a simple problem.

    The DBI::Introspection class is specifically designed to reproduce
    the functionality of the get_info, table_info, and column_info
    methods of DBI, in a more convenient manner. It includes classes
    that describe the database, tables/views etc, and columns. The
    classes are encapsulated using this hierarchy, and are queryable
    through the Class API. Future versions will include caching
    functionality.

    The major goal is to make its use simple, convenient (more so than
    the DBI methods themselves), reliable, portable (across DBDs) and
    straightforward without fanfare.

The resulting entry would be:

DBI::
