     why:

    Wrote a module that didn't already exist. It's called
    Finance::Bank::Wachovia and it provides easy access to your wachovia
    accounts from Perl. Clean OO interface:

    my $wachovia = Finance::Bank::Wachovia->new( ... ); my $account =
    $wachovia->account( $account_number ); print "Balance is: ",
    $account->available_balance, "\n"; print "Last transaction: ",
    $account->transactions->[-1]->description, "\n";

    Pretty much provides access to all info about an account, including
    transactions.

    I plan on uploading the module with turnkey program so users that
    want to check their accounts immediately from the command line can
    do so. Also, the included program provides a cool
    apple-keychain-like feature so you don't have to provide login
    information but once.

    The module uses WWW::Mechanize to obtain the data from wachovia's
    web interface but the user of the module doesn't really care about
    that.
