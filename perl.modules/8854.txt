Hi,

I would like to contribute a number of modules.  The first one is a playlist
manager that I self-titled MP3::Playlist ... it loads all of your .m3u
files, then lets you manipulate them like you would a real CD jukebox:
	$pl->next();
	$pl->prev();
	$pl->nextlist();
	$pl->prevlist();
It is also smart about wrapping from one list to the next; and it has
shuffle modes.  The purpose of this module is to give authors a tool for
building simple mp3 players.

I have other things I would like to contribute as well, including a bunch of
X10 modules written in POE.

Here are my particulars:
	Christopher Piggott
	chrisp@rochester.rr.com
	I don't have a home page for this purpose
	I prefer the cpan id CPIGGOTT
