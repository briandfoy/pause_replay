     why:

    I've written several Perl modules that I've passed among friends
    who've found them very useful. I'd like to take the next step and
    start publishing them to the entire Perl community.

    I'm hoping that doing this will help improve my Perl programming
    skills and give me a closer connection to the Perl community.
