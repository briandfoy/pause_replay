planned contributions: 

Mail::BlackWhiteList (part of a spam filter)

An interface to setproctitle().  (Unsurprisingly, I'd call it
Setproctitle or Sys::Setproctitle.)

Cowsay (when it gets rearchitected), maybe it will be called Acme::Cow?

Hoserchat (a chat system for those who think IM's and IRC and ICQ
are evil).  The modules are a toolkit, somewhat like Net::IRC.

NetHirc, a toolkit built on top of Net::IRC, with a somewhat
Nethackish flavor.

A few random things related to searching and scoring, about which
I should ask my employer.

Maybe stuff under Infobot::.
