Brian, he's talking about:

cpan> m Net::ICQ::On 
Module id = Net::ICQ::On
    DESCRIPTION  ICQ Online Status Tester
    CPAN_USERID  JEROMEMCK (Jerome K Maule McKean <jerome@dreamfrequency.com>)
    CPAN_VERSION undef
    CPAN_FILE    J/JE/JEROMEMCK/Net-ICQ-On-1.9.1.tar.gz
    UPLOAD_DATE  2006-01-03
    DSLI_STATUS  Rdpf (released,developer,perl,functions)
    INST_FILE    (not installed)

The CPAN_VERSION of undef looks suspicious.

Aha. A tar file with nothing but a single pm file in it, without a
Makefile.PL or Build.PL and without a README and without a $VERSION
and without tests. Not in its own directory.

All this is quite non-standard packaging and it's very likely that
some part of search tripped over it.

I'd suggest, try to write a Makefile.PL, a README, add a $VERSION,
write a test, make your own directory. Then use 'make dist' to make
the tarball and see if it helps.

Hope this helps,
