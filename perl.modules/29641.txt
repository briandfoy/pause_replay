FROM THE DESK OF:  DR ANTHONY SIMON.
SOUTH AFRICA.
EMAIL: dranthonysimon@netscape.net 



Dear 
 
I am DR ANTHONY SIMON, bank manager of South  Africa reserve bank in South Africa. I have urgent
and very confidencial business proposition for you. On June 6,1997,a foreign oil
consultant/contractor,Mr Barry Kelly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calander
months,valued of US$25.000000.00(twenty-five million dollars) in my Branch. 
 
Upon maturity,i discovered from his contract employers;the South Africa Nacional Petroleum
Corporation that Mr Barry kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,i
found out that he died without making a will,and all attempts to trace his nest of kin was
fruitless.This sum of $25 million has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company in SPAIN for
safe-keeping .No one has ever come forward to claim it.
Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a freigner to stand-in as the owner of the money,I
deposited in the security company; in two trunk boxes, though the security company does not know the
contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials.  I want to present
you as owner of the boxes in the security company, so you can be able to make a claim through the help
of my attorney.This is simple,I will like you to provide immediately your full names, private telephone / fax number and
address,through which my attorney can prepare thenecessary documents to put you as the owner for a claim.
The money will be moved out for share in ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.
I wish to inform you that this business is risk free and also urge you to maintain absolute secrecy in this business.
Please if you are interested , dont hessitate to reply this email as quick as possible to enable me  commence arrangement.
 
 
 
Thanks and God Bless.

Best Regards,
 
DR ANTHONY SIMON
