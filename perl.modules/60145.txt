I had some trouble using Net::MySQL and determined it was due to the old password being requested.  I created a modified version of the .pm file that I've been using for several months now (I had to make a couple of other changes too).  I tried contacting the author a couple of times back in September but haven't had any reply.  I'd be glad to send my changes to the author and even work on other bugs if s/he does not have the time to work on them.
