hi,

name: Tina Mueller
email: tinita@cpan.org

I recently realized that XML::Simple is too simple
for my needs as it doesn't differ between attributes
and elements if they are mixed.
I tried out XML::DOM, but this seems to be too limited
in some aspects and far too powerful in other aspects.
It also seems to be slow in accessing elements, and a parsed
tree is *very* big.
So I started to write my own module.
I gave it the name XML::SimpleObject
(http://www.tinita.de/projects/perl/modules/).
I wonder if there's already such a module, and if
not I would upload it.
I'm also glad about any suggestions about the
interface and implementation.

here's the abstract:

XML::SimpleObject - Simple Interface for converting between XML and Objects

This Module is a simple tool for converting XML into objects
and vice versa. It is far from complete as I'm actually no
expert in XML. It respects, however, the difference
between Elements and Attributes like in the DOM. XML::Simple
doesn't do that (at the moment), so that was actually the
reason for me to write this module.
It ignores values that contain only spaces ( \s ), and
currently it encodes only in ISO-8859-1.

regards, tina
