Please could I get a PAUSE ID, preferably PDCAWLEY, as I've got a
couple of 'pragmatic' type modules to do reasonably strict interface
polymorphism in Perl 5 that I'd like to share. Here's the modulelist
lines: 

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----

interface      bdph  Declares an interface, used with implements
implements     bdph  Declares a module implements and interface.

Essentially this is a perl 5 implementation of the functionality I
proposed for Perl6 is RFC 265, though without the syntactic changes 
I proposed. It implements the 'strict' version of the proposed
behaviour (You can get the runtime only checking by ignoring the
'implements' module and just doing C<use base 'InterfaceName'>)

It's currently horribly undocumented but hopefully there'll be some
stuff there when the PAUSE ID comes through.

Oh yes:
