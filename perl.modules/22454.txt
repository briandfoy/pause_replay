Hi all,

I would like to know your advice about the naming of a new "Open Office 
Document Connector", that is a Perl module set, to be released as an 
OpenOffice.org sub project. It provides an high-level API for processing of 
OpenOffice.org documents, relying on the Archive::Zip and XML::XPath CPAN 
modules.

In the late 2002, the basename of the project as been defined as "OODoc", and 
the current package names are OODoc, OODoc::File, OODoc::XPath, OODoc::Text 
and OODoc::Meta; other modules OODoc::Calc and OODoc::Styles could come in 
the future.

In the meantime, "OODoc" has been requested as a namespace for the "Object 
Oriented Documentation" project by Mark Overmeer (MARKOV Solutions). So I 
proposed to simply replace my "OODoc" by "OpenOffice::OODoc", in order to 
avoid any future clash with CPAN modules, without requiring an expensive 
rework for the users of my modules (they have just to move the OODoc 
installation directory into the OpenOffice one, and execute an antomatic text 
replacement in their source code).

There is an existing "OpenOffice::Parse::SXC" module, so the "OpenOffice" 
root is already defined, and my "OODoc" could logically take place as a 
subspace of "OpenOffice".

Is this approach correct?

Thank you in advance
