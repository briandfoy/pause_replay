It's not that XML::Simple is *only* for config files, rather 
that it is *designed* for config files.  

When I originally wrote the module I called it Getopt::XML.
This name was universally rejected and many people expressed
the view that it was useful for things other than config files.
After discussion and voting, the name XML::Simple was chosen
using a similar rationale to LWP::Simple - this module provides
a simple API for XML parsing, if you outgrow it, you'll need to
log at XML::Parser etc.  

While I'm perfectly happy for people to use the module for
general XML parsing, I do want it to be 'visible' to people
who want to read/write config files and haven't thought of
using XML.

I don't think changing the module name is viable, but perhaps
this might be a better description:

  Easy API to read/write XML (esp config files)

The small number of characters available for the description
in the long module list presents a challenge :-)

History shows that people looking for a simple XML parsing
module can find XML::Simple.  Listing it in chapter 12 will
allow the original intended audience to find it too.
