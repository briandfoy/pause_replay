Good morning,

Last week Cory added myself as a co-maintainer of Algorithm::SVM, nothing 
has shown up in my account.  Today Cory removed himself as a 
co-maintainer, hoping it would appear on mine.... nothing.  How can we 
actually transfer control?  I've uploaded a new version, but since I don't 
seem to be a maintainer (despite him making me one) I can't make it 
active.... help please?

Thanks.
