Steffen,

GeniusTrader is currently a well known product (www.geniustrader.org)  
in open source finance tools. If you look at the repo, it is actually  
using the GT namespace and has a huge submodule tree. I asked for  
Finance::GT since lots of users already have running scripts with the  
GT as top namespace which would only require to add Finance:: in the  
'use' statement. That felt quite logical.

You're right that it is also easy to replace GT by  
Finance::GeniusTrader but we are dealing with finance people which  
occasionally do some programming stuff... So I think they will  
understand the first option better. An alias would be a great thing  
here ;)

But it's true that we should not care about past, but look into  
future. GeniusTrader is new on cpan, so, go for Finance::GeniusTrader !

Thanks for your suggestion
