The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::SpiralSearch
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Function Optimization of Two Parameters
  userid:      MOSTAFAVI (Sean Mostafavi)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    Firstly, there seems to be a lack of optimization algorithms on
    CPAN. SpiralSearch is the first of many optimization modules I plan
    on contributing. Formal definitions of the spiral search algorithm
    are hard (if not impossible) to find. I've searched long and hard
    for an implementation of this algorithm in any language to no avail.
    The motivation for contributing this module stems from my fruitless
    search on implementations of the spiral search along with hopes that
    other developers will become exposed to this elegant algorithm so
    that they can use it in their projects.

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::
