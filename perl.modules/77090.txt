Subject: Module submission Test::Cucumber

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Cucumber
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Write test cases in plain English
  userid:      SARGIE (Peter Sergeant)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org

  similar:
    Test::Cukes, the now deleted Test::Cucumber before it

  rationale:

    Test::Cucumber implements the Cucumber testing methodology: see
    http://cukes.info/

    There was a former Test::Cucumber that no longer exists, and has
    virtually no footprint. If it was a faithful implementation of
    Cucumber, then these modules will be compatible.

  enteredby:   SARGIE (Peter Sergeant)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul 31 08:19:41 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Cucumber        bdpOp Write test cases in plain English            SARGIE
