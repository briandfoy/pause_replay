The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Toolbox
  DSLIP:       bdpfn
  description: Math and networking 'helper' functions
  userid:      DOCG (Jason Leane)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    IRC

  similar:
    (none_found)

  rationale:

    When I first started coding, I couldn't do a lot of things because
    I had to learn how to use a different module for each of them...
    also, some basic things were challenging (learning how to use
    sprintf for decimal-hex conversion). Inspired by a friend who's
    learning perl, I wrote these functions to let people accomplish more
    while still learning the language.i

  enteredby:   DOCG (Jason Leane)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 27 16:03:05 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Toolbox           bdpfn Math and networking 'helper' functions       DOCG
