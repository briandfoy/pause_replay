From: crawler.in@firstrain.com (Abhijeet Mahabal)

Hi,
I would like to start contributing to the perl community and hence this
request for an account to start uploading stuff.

My name is Abhijeet Mahabal, and I work for FirstRain, a web 2 wireless
and information discovery startup. I have been using perl for the last 5
years extensively. The areas in which I have done a lot of coding are:
	A) Tk Interfaces for various things including:
	1: To WordNet. There is a Tcl interface already available, but I like
to do things in perl.. Development stage. 
	2. To gnuchess. Xboard is an interface to this that already exists, but
it does not do all the things that gnuchess does. For instance, it
cannot tell you what the possible opening continuation are at a given
stage in the game, even though gnuchess is willing to tell you that...
Also, a perl program is easier for people to modify than Xboard C code
:)
Development stage, almost done.
	3. Well, this is not quite an interface. This is a utility to create
geometrical figures for scientific perposes. This is different from
something like xfig in that you can tell it things like: draw points at
positions A,B,C, draw the circle passing thru these 3 points, draw
medians, altitudes and so on. Development stage, almost done. I'll also
provide GIMP plugins for this, but I'd also like to have a standalone
thing...

	All of these are pure perl modules.
	
	B) Web related. Sadly, a lot of my work is related to the company and I
cannot contribute it, but there will be a lot of nuggets that I can
usefully contribute. My job is information retrieval, and I have coded a
lot of standard algorithms which I can contribute without my bosses
getting on my back. many of these would fall under Text::foo.

	My email address is amahabal@firstrain.com

	My preffered id is A-MAHABAL 

	I have discussed a lot of these modules (esp chess/geometry drawer/info
retrieval related) mostly with friends and there was a sufficient amount
of interest for me to want to go on with the coding :)

	I hope that is a sufficient description..

	Thanx much,
	Abhijeet
