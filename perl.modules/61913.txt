The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geometry::AffineTransform
  DSLIP:       RdpO2
  description: Map 2D coordinates to other 2D coordinates
  userid:      LIYANAGE (Marc Liyanage)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    AffineTransform is a class name and I picked it because similar
    classes in the Java and Cocoa frameworks use that name and I think
    it is what people who are looking for this kind of module would
    search for.

    I don't really have a preference for the leading namespace part, I
    picked Geometry because it already exists and seems appropriate.

  enteredby:   LIYANAGE (Marc Liyanage)
  enteredon:   Mon Aug 25 21:38:52 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Geometry::
::AffineTransform RdpO2 Map 2D coordinates to other 2D coordinates   LIYANAGE
