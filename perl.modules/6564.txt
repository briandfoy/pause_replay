The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::WordReturn
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Identifies & weights words and phrases
  userid:      GRISKEY (Mark Griskey)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, discussed with my Perl programmer colleagues

  similar:

  rationale:

    WordReturn provides a quick and easy way to retrieve a list of
    words or phrases in a document and returns the number of times each
    word or phrase appears within that document. The ability to weigh
    words based on their location in the document (or between specified
    XML/HTML tags).

    WordRetun was chosen as the namespace because the module does just
    that, returns words and phrases.

    This module is useful for search and "more like this" type of
    applications, such as Web based Usenet archives. It provides a quick
    and simple way to determine what the top words or phrases are in a
    document, or the least used. It is a useful way to post-process
    search results as well.

    This module was developed for, and is currently being used for
    linuxusenet.com's Linux Usenet archives and linuxhardware.net's
    search engine. It has proven to be useful, and I believe can be
    useful to others wishing to develop similiar applications.
