The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::Moose
  DSLIP:       cdpnp
  description: installs dependencies and installs Moose
  userid:      SKI (Kevin William Henwood)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    In response to a post on perlmonks.org, I wrote this bundle to
    handle the dependencies that were slipping through the cracks. This
    module is a full listing of all the necessary dependencies; also, I
    have a short version of around 20 lines that serves as the basis for
    this module if need be. I've manually tested each dependency, and
    I've tested this module on 6 different perls. I'm satisfied with the
    results.

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::
::Moose           cdpnp installs dependencies and installs Moose     SKI
