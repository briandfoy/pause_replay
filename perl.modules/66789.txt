the single-click registration link for this entry doesn't seem to work. 
I seem to remember that this is a known bug, but just to make sure, 
here's what I get:

Register a Module

ERROR: The submission was rejected due to the following:

The module name is missing.

The description is missing.

The userid [] is not known.

Nothing done. Please correct the form below and retry.

I'll register the module manually now.

Cheers,
Steffen
