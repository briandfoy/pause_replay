Hello everyone.  

I've been working on Perl::Critic
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic) for several
months now.  The project is still evolving rapidly,
but I think we're starting to hit a critical mass and
it might be time to register it.  I'd like to get your
blessing for the Perl::Critic namespace.  Since it is
a source code analyzer for Perl (the language), it
seems to fit into the Perl::* namespace in the same
way that Perl::Tidy does.  Some of my coworkers
preferred to call it a 'Coach' instead of 'Critic',
but hey, you can't please everyone.  At any rate, I'm
open to suggestions.  Thanks.

-Jeff
