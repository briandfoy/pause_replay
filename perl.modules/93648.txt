     why:

    I would like to contribute perl modules that my company is building
    to sure up our infrastructure. An example is a wrapper for the
    PagerDuty public API, of which there does not exist a public client
    (for Perl), specifically one that is environment agnostic (one
    contributed by nagios contributers is a little to specific for most
    needs).
