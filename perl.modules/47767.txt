The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hook::Filter
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: A runtime firewall for subroutine calls
  userid:      ERWAN (Erwan Lemonnier)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Log::Localized, Hook::WrapSub, Hook::LexWrap

  rationale:

    Hook::Filter is a runtime firewall for subroutine calls.

    Hook::Filter lets you hook some subroutines and define rules to
    specify when calls to those subroutines should be allowed or
    skipped. Those rules are very flexible and are eval-ed during
    runtime each time a call to one of the hooked subroutine is made.

    This has a number of applications, mostly in the area of logging
    policies and debugging via logs for large applications. See
    Log::Localized for some exemples (in a way, Hook::Filter is just a
    more mature and general version of Log::Localized).

    A rule is basically one line of perl code that evals to either true
    or false depending on the context (name of subrtoutine caller, value
    of its arguments, state of the stack, value of variables, etc.).
