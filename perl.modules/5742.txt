I enjoy having the module metadata editing...

How about having the selector-to-choose-which-package-to-edit show the
entire line that shows up in the module list?  That makes it easy to tell
what the status of everything is without looking at the module list.

(In my case I was changing the licensing ?'s so wanted to see what
ones needed updating.)
