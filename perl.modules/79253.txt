The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Diamond
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: A Dynamic Declarative Markup based language
  userid:      LOGICUS (Simon James Odell)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.perlnights.com

  similar:
    sort of similar to TT2... ish.

  rationale:

    I've been developing this system as aXML for some time however the
    name "aXML" is taken by a closed source company so a new name is in
    order.

    The system is a highly flexible dynamic declarative mark-up
    language for web development, which has been described as being
    somewhat lisp-ish.

    Hence the new moniker; "Diamond".

    If I can get this namespace I will start the work of renaming my
    modules and getting them ready for upload with full POD etc.

  enteredby:   LOGICUS (Simon James Odell)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 19 08:41:14 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Diamond           bdpfg A Dynamic Declarative Markup based language  LOGICUS
