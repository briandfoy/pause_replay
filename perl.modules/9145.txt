Description:

I would like to contribute a set of class wrappers that perlify
nmap (http://www.insecure.org/nmap), both the creation of scans
and the parsing of the results.  I have posted this idea to nmap-hackers
and I have received favorable feedback there.  Module structure is as
follows (I think I have done a pretty good job of using good OOD on
this one):

Nmap/Scanner/Backend/Normal.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Backend/Processor.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Backend/Results.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Factory/Normal.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util/BannerScanner.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util/FtpScanner.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util/OsGuesser.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util/PingScanner.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util/SmtpScanner.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util/WebScanner.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Backend.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Factory.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Host.pm
Nmap/Scanner/HostList.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Port.pm
Nmap/Scanner/PortList.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Protocol.pm
Nmap/Scanner/ProtocolList.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Scanner.pm
Nmap/Scanner/Util.pm

So the scanner returns objects / lists of objects and is all ready for
subclassing for interesting higher-level scanning utility modules like
those I have listed ... so I am hoping it will spur some 3rd party
development and interest! :)

Regards,
Max
