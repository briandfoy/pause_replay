I've developed a module that implements a macro processor for HTML pages.
It might be compared to ASP, except that the coding constructs it allows are
very limited (a-la C preprocessor), encouraging separation of code and
content while allowing some code-like stuff in HTML (content) pages.  The
module supports macro substitution, conditional evaluation, file
interpolation (like server-side include), and loop constructs, for
representing repeated blocks of markup.  It's designed to be used with DBI
and CGI.  We've built many projects using this code, it's robust and
well-tested.  I'd like to share.  We're using the internal name IF::Page; IF
comes from our company name Interactive Factory.  I think for public
consumption a more descriptive name is better.  I was thinking HTML::Macro,
although I suppose XML::Macro or CGI::Macro might be other possibilities.

Any suggestions?

Also, I'd like to register as an author; can I have "SOKOLOV" ?  If not,
"MSOKOLOV" would be OK.

Thanks,
