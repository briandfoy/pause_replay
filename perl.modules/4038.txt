Background:
WDBI was always a great tool for viewing and modifying a dbi database.
However, it is one gigantic cgi script (~4-5K lines) and has not been
updated in 1.5-2 years.  I have been  working on a mod_perl module to
allow this same functionality, and more using perl5 and mod_perl.  This
module will not only be targeted at developers who want to view, search
and edit a database through a web app, but will also allow very simple
database apps to 'just work'.  Simply specify the table name in the
config file and at startup a description of the table will be retrieved
from your database - from that point on you can specify a base location
where you can view, search and edit the table (or tables if you join).
Stylesheet support will allow you to customize how the app looks.  That
way with no programming and minimal config setup you get a db app that
changes with your database.  Because you specify only the table name,
the app will include any columns in that table (there will be a
directive to leave out columns).

name: Apache::DBApp
DSLI: cdpO
Description: A mod_perl application to create a db app.

Discussions:
I have repeatedly run into situations where people want to have a simple
database application they can customize.  As a developer we have created
apps like this merely to avoid being tied to sqlplus or the like.  But
more importantly, I have friends who have apache set up with mySql and
want to set up a simple app to store and share information.  For
example, if you have friends who like to go camping - it would be great
to share our experiences, but there is no easy way to keep track of all
the trips everyone is doing.  With Apache::DBApp I merely need to create
a table named camping (e.g. with columns like: trail, area,
time_of_year, and description) add that table to the config file and
kablamn, you have your app.  If I then want to make it look better, I
can merely set up a stylesheet to customize it.  This is useful both for
developers, and for apache users.
