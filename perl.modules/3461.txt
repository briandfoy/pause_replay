Description of contribution:

I will be contributing a perl interface to the commonly used crypto library MCRYPT.  MCrypt is commonly built as a module in PHP and has support for the following crypto algorithms:

BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES, 3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128, SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6, MARS, IDEA,
RIJNDAEL-128 (AES), RIJNDAEL-192, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, CAST-128 (known as CAST5), CAST-256, ARCFOUR and WAKE.
Block algorithms can be used in: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n bit, where n is the size of the algorithm's block length). 


I have built XS interfaces to mcrypt's C API.  It is lightning fast, easy to use, and has a more consistent interface than the Crypt libraries available via CPAN.

I believe this library is extremely useful and will be in high demand upon release.
