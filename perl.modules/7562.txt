And it's a one-liner to do it in pure perl.  Here's a very simple
version:

    print scalar localtime(time - 24 * 60 * 60);

Thomas, I strongly recommend that you don't bother with this particular
module, except perhaps as a learning exercise. 

But if you're interested in date and time calculations in Perl, or
intend to write any more complex date/time modules, I suggest you
subscribe to datetime@perl.org and talk to the other date/time hackers
over there.
