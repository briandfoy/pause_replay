Greetings,

I am Jon Bjornstad.
My PAUSE User id is JONBJ.

I am not a frequent uploader of modules, however
I did submit two modules (Getopt::Easy, Config::Easy) a while ago.

I have forgotten my password and the email address
associated with my account (jon@icogitate.com) is defunct.
So I need some help!

Can you please change my email address to jon@logicalpoetry.com
and have a change password token mailed to me?

Thank you very much,
Jon

P.S.   To validate that I am, indeed, Jon Bjornstad,
you can see the website http://www.logicalpoetry.com
where there is a resume, etc.
