The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Geography
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Look up country by IP Address
  userid:      TJMATHER (T.J. Mather)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module deals with IP addresses so that's why I chose the Net::
    root namespace

    Currently this module provides country information for IP
    addresses, but it is possible to extend it to provide more detailed
    geographical information, so that's why I chose Net::Geography

    As far as I know, there is no other program that looks up country
    by IP address.

  enteredby:   TJMATHER (T.J. Mather)
  enteredon:   Sun Jul  1 01:31:23 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Geography       adpOp Look up country by IP Address                TJMATHER
