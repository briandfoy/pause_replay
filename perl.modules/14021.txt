sure they do.  most of the Device modules provide a way to communicate 
with particular hardware.  that's what LCDproc does too.  the LCDproc
decribes it as a "linux LCD device driver".  that sounds a lot more
like Device:: than Net:: :)

the programmer's shouldn't have to work with anything but 
Device::Monitor::LCDproc, or even Device::Monitor if you make an
abstract interface.

the module name should instantly tell the user what it is, from
general to specific.  it should leave room for other people to
extend it or add similar modules.

LCD is not descriptive enough for a top level category.  LCD has
many meanings, so it's a bad choice.  Device::LCDproc could work,
but i don't think it's the best name.
