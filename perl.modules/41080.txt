Now the question is: what *is* commercial software? I can (and often do)
offer commercial software under the GPL, for money. Incidentally you
can also buy GPL versions of the module in question - it is not cheap,
however.

If donateware is commercial software, and GPL software isn't, then I think
this whole policy needs much more explanation, as licenses say nothing
about commercial status. They are a completely different thing, and should
be kept out of the discussion.

> Sorry to enter this discussion without being asked to.

I guess now is as good a time as ever to grind out actual policy - wether
licenses count, wether payment counts (regardless of in money or other
"currencies").

Whatever the actual policy will be - it should be clear, and executed
(i.e. by removing PApp and similar packages).

A related question is data in the module list - right now, the CPAN
module metadata (which is roughly the same as the module list contents)
allows commercial software regardless of license, and even allows
non-freely-copyable software.

I'd embrace efforts to sort this out - but before cleaning CPAN of
possible modules one needs to have a clearly defined policy.

(Not that I wouldn't recommend changing the module list from the current
censored who-licks-the-ass-of-its-admins best list into an open and
objective tool for finding modules - here, as with CPAN, should be a
clear policy and not personal taste of the maintainers that governs
inclusion/exclusion).
