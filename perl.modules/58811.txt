Hello, Brian!

Thank you for the letter. 

Unfortunately, I still can't attain my modules to appear at the appropriate catalogues.

> up on CPAN Search just fine.

I thought over your answer and then have two more questions.

1. How is it possible to exclude from indexing the catalogue of examples?
I tried to add the file meta.yml into archive of my module. This file has the next records:
no_index:
   dir:
   - examples
Similar to those ones on http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-v1.2.html
But it is useless.

2. Where should I point so that the QtCore and QtGui modules appear at last in http://cpan.org/modules/by-category/08_User_Interfaces/Qt/ as well as in http://cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html in Qt category?

Would be very grateful for help.
