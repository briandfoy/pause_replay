The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::CompiledC
  DSLIP:       bdhha
  description: C Structs as Objects;Dynamic generated code
  userid:      BLADE (Lionel Mehl)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    Nowhere so far, if need arises i will setup a mailing list

  similar:
    Inline Class::MethodMaker Class::Accessors

  rationale:

    Class::CompiledC uses Inline::C to deliver C structs as objects
    with out writting (or seeing if you don't want to) a single line of
    C code. Thereare also basic validation routines included, so it is
    possible to limit a particular field (instance variable, or whatever
    you call it) to a primitive type (Int Float String Reference [Typed
    Reference] or ISA relationship). For the Module name I can't imagine
    another one that suits better. (A long time this thing hung around
    as Insane.pm on my hard drive)

    I am not sure if it will useful, but i think it should be listed in
    the Module list just to show that it is possible and that it's
    there.

    I thank you for your Audience. blade aka Lionel Mehl
