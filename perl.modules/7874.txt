The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PGP::FindKey
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: A perl interface to the PGP WWW Keyservers.
  userid:      CHRIS (Chris Ball)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, #perl (rhizo), london.pm.

  similar:
    Crypt::OpenPGP

  rationale:

    The relationship given above isn't a good one, and I wanted to
    explain why not. FindKey.pm is an interface to the keyservers, and
    Crypt::OpenPGP is an implementation of the OpenPGP client spec - to
    which the functionality I've coded isn't specified in. I've mailed
    the Crypt::OpenPGP maintainer, who doesn't think I belong in his
    namespace, and recommended PGP::FindKey.

    There aren't any other interfaces to the PGP keyservers on the
    CPAN, so it's a unique module. It's useful, in that a perl interface
    enables linking of FindKey.pm and (for example) Crypt::OpenPGP.
    Through this, a public key can be imported from just an e-mail
    address, as long as there's a distinct match; something that's been
    desired in other OpenPGP clients for a while now.

The resulting entry would be:

PGP::
::FindKey         adpOp A perl interface to the PGP WWW Keyservers.  CHRIS
