Hi!

I like it. (Disclaimer: I'm no crypto expert.) Have you seen

   Crypt::OpenSSL::BN (Contact Author Ian Robertson <iroberts+perl@red-bean=
.com>)
   Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA (I/IR/IROBERTS/Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA-0.11.tar.gz)
   Crypt::OpenSSL::Random (I/IR/IROBERTS/Crypt-OpenSSL-Random-0.02.tar.gz)
   OpenCA::OpenSSL (M/MA/MADWOLF/OpenCA-OpenSSL-0.6.3a.tar.gz)


 fd> As the name 'OpenSSL' cannot be freely used (because of the
 fd> license terms), I was thinking of

 fd> Crypto::LibCrypto::*

 fd> namespace, with sub-modules as

 fd> Crypto::LibCrypto::BN for BIGNUM interface
 fd> Crypto::LibCrypto::RSA for RSA interface
 fd> Crypto::LibCrypto::IDEA for IDEA interface

 fd> and so on (like the prefixes in the OpenSSL API)...

A shorter name would be worthwhile for such a huge project.
Crypt::OpenSSL seems the natural choice and IROBERTS didn't bother
with a license term on a name. I don't know, but Crypto::LibCrypto
somehow sucks too much. Maybe Crypt::LibSSL?

 fd> Just let me know your thoughts about it. I've already a fully
 fd> implemented (but not yet documented) OO and overloaded ::BN
 fd> implementation available (with random and primes generation),
 fd> which I could submit very quickly.

Please coordinate with IROBERTS.

Thanks,
