The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::AptFetch
  DSLIP:       adpOl
  description: Perl interface for APT (of Debian) methods
  userid:      WHYNOT (Eric Pozharski)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Fetch

  rationale:

    I'm developing an application (it's in pre-release, File::AptFetch
    pending) -- this app manages building Debain binaries from Debain
    source (kind of parasite). It needs to fetch those source files,
    with repositories being found in F<sources.list>. Right now, the app
    is limited to to B<WWW::Curl::Easy> known schemas (C<http://>,
    C<ftp://>, and C<file:>). And what the app is supposed to do with
    C<scp://> schema being accidentaly found in F<sources.list> I have
    no control over?

    Meanwhile on any Debian based system there're all needed facilties
    -- APT Methods. But the app can't reach them -- those are regular
    executables, speaking custom protocol. I really would like that
    (interfacig) functionality being a stand-alone module, but
    integrated. I hope someone else could find it useful. For me -- it's
    mere attempt to kick out Debian's arrogance (after this trial I
    don't understand how Debian manages to work at all).

    So -- please approve.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
