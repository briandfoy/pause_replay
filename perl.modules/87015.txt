As I mentioned in my response, per Lancaster, ADOPTME means that PAUSE
admins can transfer permissions without contacting the author (usually
because that's already been attempted and failed).  HANDOFF does not
allow PAUSE admins to make changes.

Put differently, ADOPTME is a safety valve so someone *OTHER THAN THE
AUTHOR* can mark a distribution as needing a new maintainer (by
proposing ADOPTME as comaint after a period of non-responsiveness).

I don't know and since I don't handle permissions, I don't have to
form an opinion either.  :-)  I leave that to other admins to decide.
 I'm not sure a rule vs a guideline will make sense.
