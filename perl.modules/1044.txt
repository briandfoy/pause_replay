I have written a module I use for maintaining replica's of files and file
structures in different file systems. I'd like to submit this to CPAN.  Under
the module naming convention it would look like this I think.


Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
File::Repl     cDpO  File and File structure replication utility  DROBERTS


The utility has been written for Win32 - but has no dependencies on that
architecture.  I 'd appreciate anu guidance you can give.

This memo was sent a few days ago - it is being resent because of a spamming
incident (when some outgoing and incoming mails were lost).  If you replied to
my first memo please will you re-send.

Thanks


Dave
