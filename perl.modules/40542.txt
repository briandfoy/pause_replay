The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       App::Modular
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Application plugin framework ('Modularizer')
  userid:      BCEVC (Baltasar Cevc)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    mailinglists

  similar:
    Module::Pluggable Object::Meta::Plugin OpenPlugin Template::Plugin

  rationale:

    App::Modular provides a framework to create modular perl
    applications. Similar approaches exist, however they are mostly very
    specific to some sort of application (e.g. web apps).

    The two other generic modules take other approches:
    Module::Pluggable concentrates more on bringing perl modules
    together than on creating a modular application from a scratch

    Object::Meta::Plugin is very abstract and not suited very well for
    simplicistic modular applications.

    Concering the namespace choice: After quite some discussions on the
    mailing list module-authors, there was the suggestion to use App::
    something. Module::* was too oriented to Perl modules and not to a
    modular application.

    Modular shows that the module is meant to support modular
    application creation.
