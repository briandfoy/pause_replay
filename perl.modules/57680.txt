Subject: Module submission Data::Toolkit

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Toolkit
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Data pump / directory synchronisation tools
  userid:      AFINDLAY (Andrew Findlay)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    data-toolkit@skills-1st.co.uk

  similar:
    Data::MultiValuedHash

  rationale:

    Data::Toolkit is a module for building data-pumps and
    directory-synchronisation systems. It models data as Entries, which
    consist of Attributes which may in turn have zero or more values.

    The Entry class is based on Data::MultiValuedHash

    There are Connectors for various data-sources: currently CSV files,
    databases via DBI, and LDAP.

    Putting the module in the Data:: namespace seems reasonable by
    association with Data::MultiValuedHash and Data::Dumper (which it
    also uses). The name Toolkit was chosen to reflect the fact that
    this is a set of parts that can be used for many data-pump jobs -
    not just in connection with directories.

  enteredby:   AFINDLAY (Andrew Findlay)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 14 10:34:13 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Toolkit         bdpOp Data pump / directory synchronisation tools  AFINDLAY
