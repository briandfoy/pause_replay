  rationale:

    Hello List,

    The company I am a developer for (http://www.cpanel.net) is
    interested in my registering our name (cPanel) for use in our public
    modules' classnames and funtionality.

    Much in the same spirit as Websphere, Vonage, Symantec, AltaVista,
    IBM, Htdig, etc etc

    We already have several subclasses of it ready to go as well and
    would like to properly register them instead of uploading them
    without approval.

    Thanks you very much for your consideration!

    have a great day

    - Dan Muey, cPanel Inc

The resulting entry would be:

cPanel            SdpOp root of our company's public modules         DMUEY


Thanks for registering,
