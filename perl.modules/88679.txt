The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Salvation
  DSLIP:       RdpOo
  description: Architectural solution for huge applications
  userid:      GFILATOV (Gennadiy Filatov)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I believe that this is not well suitable for any existing namespace
    at least because it is a different product. I have chosen
    "Salvation" almost a year and a half ago because such thing really
    was a salvation for me, abandoning tons of legacy architectural
    solutions but not falling into an endless argument. Though I think
    that following architectural solution is really a salvation for a
    developer.

The resulting entry would be:

Salvation         RdpOo Architectural solution for huge applications GFILATOV
