I was on the PAUSE and selected the edit module metadata function. But,
none of my modules were listed, so I suppose I need to tell you about
it. The following are mine:

  * Data-Address-Standardize [new version today via PAUSE]
  * Env-Array [has been superceded by my contributions to Perl 5.6]
  * psh [Perl Shell]
  * ltag [just added today via PAUSE]
  * Games-Chess-Referee
  * Lip-Pod [Literate Perl -- sort of]
  * Morale

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to have these
handled correctly and completely.


Regards,

-- Gregor
