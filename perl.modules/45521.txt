That's sounds like a resonable idea. And it shouldn't matter too much if 
Bundle::Tree only contains your Tree modules, especially if your plans 
are to cover most of all of the possible types.

Sorry, I probably phrased my question wrong. My query was not so much 
about any specifics, but that if you really understood how significant 
adding a true generalised parent for all of Tree:: was. Which you've 
answered with this...

So then it really comes down to a social issue rather than a technical 
one. You understand what you are trying to do. But I don't know I'm game 
to say I'd add it based on a tick from two Tree:: module authors, given 
the sheer volume of modules that exist already. And I'm not qualified in 
this area to be assessing what you are doing myself.

There are some very big names on the list of existing Tree:: authors, 
it's practically a who's who of the top CPAN authors.

http://search.cpan.org/search?m=module&q=Tree%3A%3A&s=1&n=20

I'd be a lot more comfortable if I heard that 3 or 4 of them had gone 
over the idea for Tree.pm and given it a thumbs up. And more so if they 
were going to be porting over to Tree.pm.

Steven makes one. What do some of the others think?
