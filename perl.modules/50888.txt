The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Easy_NCBI
  DSLIP:       adpOo
  description: Connects to NCBI and fetches the useful data
  userid:      CHI (chitresh sharma)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    CVS repository.

  similar:
    Bioperl modules

  rationale:

    Dear all,

    We know the importance of data to an end user, usually a biologist.
    There are several perl/cpan modules to connect to internet, but they
    donot utilize the services provided by NCBI server. Moreover the
    existing packages are not an easy to use packages, first you have to
    install them and use. But this package is a very easy to use package
    to connect to NCBI and fetch data from there. Moreover, since it
    utilizes the Object oriented concepts in PERL, this module can be
    extended to any extent to suit vast amount of purposes. And even the
    complex workflows can be implemented using this set of modules.

    The namespace signifies the ready to use easiness while working
    with these modules. I feel they will be of a great interest to
    biologists and bioinformatitians all around the world. It will help
    them to develop and contribute useful softwares to the community.
    And i feel before even i use these modules for software development,
    it should be made open to other developers and user.
