    NCustom version 0.04 ====================

    NCustom provides some file editting routines and some package
    management hooks to assit in system configuration.

    File editting: The file editing routines include features such as
    transactions, and undo by transaction. The original files are
    archived within a directory tree structure.

    Package management: You may specify packages (and
    minumum/maximum/exact versions) that you require to be installed,
    and a routine to call if they are not installed. Your routine may
    use simple "rpm" commands (or whatever you want), or you may use the
    provided routine that uses "apt". In-built support for other package
    management tools is on the todo list.

    System configuration: A commandline interface provides for
    initialisation, configuration, and invocation (including invocation
    across the network). This enables NCustom to be used from the post
    section of Kickstart script. It may also be used stand alone on an
    already built system.

    If system configuration tweaking is minor, then scripts (even in
    the post section of a kickstart configuration) may be more useful.
    If the system configuration tweaking is related to only one rpm,
    then re-rolling the rpm with a new patch/post section may be more
    useful. If there are several packages that need inter-related
    configuration (eg building a Samba, PDC, LDAP server), then NCustom
    may improve the speed of development of automated system
    configuration.
