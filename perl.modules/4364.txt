Yes; I don't recall seeing Net::SSH discussed here before it ws released,
but when I noticed it on the CPAN, I was bothered by the fact that it was
just a wrapper, not an implementation.  I think people have come to expect
Net::${PRTOTOCOL} modules to be Perl/XS/etc. implementations of that
protocol.  This is quite unfortunate, IMO.
