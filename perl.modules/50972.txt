Subject: Module submission Wiki::Toolkit::Mediawiki

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Wiki::Toolkit::Mediawiki
  DSLIP:       adpnp
  description: Perl Clone of the PHP Mediawiki
  userid:      DPRICE (Derek Price)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Wiki::Toolkit::Kwiki

  rationale:

    This will be a pre-packaged set of scripts (based on HTML::Mason)
    which implement in Perl a clone of Mediawiki (the PHP scripts behind
    Wikipedia and friends). The idea is that they could be run in
    parallel with the PHP scripts without interference.

    Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::Mediawiki's one pass approach to
    formatting should be much more efficient than the multi-pass
    approach taken by the PHP scripts this module is based on, though I
    am unsure how the other modules this module set is dependent on will
    affect performance. The memory profile should be smaller than
    running mod_perl and PHP on the same web server.

    These scripts are written and work, but I have not generalized them
    to the point where I am ready to upload them. I simply wish to
    reserve the namespace now that I have announced the idea to the
    world by uploading the Wiki::Toolkit::Store::Mediawiki and
    Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::Mediawiki modules.

    I listed "interface type" as "none" because none of the categories
    seem to fit. A script will install the sources and the sources
    themselves are HTML::Mason sources, which is basically HTML with
    embedded Perl.

The resulting entry would be:

Wiki::Toolkit::
::Mediawiki       adpnp Perl Clone of the PHP Mediawiki              DPRICE
