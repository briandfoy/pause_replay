I never got CC-ed on the original mail (I'm long since unsubscribed to 
modules@), but I dug around in PAUSE and think I finally figured out 
where to transfer maintainership of the namespace.

Let me know if it worked?

        I got to know about your ownership of this namespace when I

        I think you need to go to your PAUSE account to transfer

        <p>The DBIx::Object was originally DB::Object.  It was renamed
