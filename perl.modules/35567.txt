I certainly wouldn't use the "bulk of code" as an excuse to cancel, 
especially if the API is identical besides the module name change.

Solution 1: Within said bulk of code, do a "search and replace", 
swapping old module name references for new module name references. 
I have done this multiple times with some of my modules (one just a 
few days ago), and it worked very easily.

Solution 2: Create an empty module with the old name of your module 
which simply sub-classes your new-named module, but adds nothing new. 
Distribute them together to the people using your bulk of code. 
Distribute just the new-named module to everyone else.  Voila, you 
can now use either the old or new name for your module at the same 
time.

In the longer term, solution 1 is best; solution 2 may be better if 
you don't have access to said bulk of code in order to do the search 
and replace.

So all that's left is the naming issues.  Not insurmountable, really.
