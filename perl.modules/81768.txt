     why:

    A new project, aiming to provide a integrated development
    environment. More specifically, a set of tools extending SubVersion
    to provide certain functionalities, including (but not limited to):
    - (Web) Repository search based on a Lucene like index, currently
    Lucy is used - Where-Used - (Web) Approval and review system -
    Automated code reviews - Integration between database and SVN (focus
    on Oracle and MySQL) - Deployment automation

    Ultimate goal is to support a complex development model (branch
    always) including the database(s)
