The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::KohaSupport
  DSLIP:       Rmong
  description: A bundle of the modules required for Koha
  userid:      KOHA (Mike Mylonas)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    The Koha devel mailling list and irc chatrooms and soon be be
    located in our CVS repository

  similar:

  rationale:

    I discussed the namespace choice with the Koha development team in
    #Koha on the irc.koha.org server and received enthusiastic support
    as its would both shorten the time and provide an easier
    installation path for the product.

    Using KohaSupport provides a descriptive naming convention that is
    clear and concise to people.

  enteredby:   KOHA (Mike Mylonas)
  enteredon:   Sat Sep 14 00:46:42 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::
::KohaSupport     Rmong A bundle of the modules required for Koha    KOHA
