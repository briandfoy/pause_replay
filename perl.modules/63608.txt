The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::OPC
  DSLIP:       idpOl
  description: Manipulate Open Packaging Conventions files.
  userid:      DOUGDUDE (Douglas Christopher Wilson)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    IRC #Perl

  similar:

  rationale:

    Open Packaging Conventions is a way specified in ECMA-376 Part 2 to
    store files in a compressed format. Any compression format can be
    used, like ZIP, 7z, or even non-compressed like tar. Office Open XML
    files use this format, as well as XPS files. I am writing this to
    use as a base to write support for Office Open XML files.

    Originally I was thinking Archive::OPC since it is contained in an
    archive, but talking on #Perl, decided File::OPC was a better fit.

    I cannot find any modules on CPAN that provide this functionality,
    and so I am going to release one.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::OPC             idpOl Manipulate Open Packaging Conventions files. DOUGDUDE
