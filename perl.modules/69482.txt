Except they aren't, because none of the replies can be posted, because the
list is subscribers-only and messages bounce rather than going into a
moderation queue.

What you *should* be doing is bcc'ing the list on your outgoing messages
- note *bcc* so we don't keep accidentally replying to it - and then
forwarding the other messages on.

Alternatively, you could switch the list to moderated and let through the
replies.

I really don't mind. But cc-ing a list I can't post to doesn't help the P::C
developers be informed, it just wastes my time every time I try and reply
to you helping.
