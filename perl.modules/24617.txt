The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::GSHHS::PurePerl
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Read vector coastline data
  userid:      OWHITE (Oliver White)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    modules.cpan.org have discussed the name (for small values of
    discuss...)

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline
    Database (GSHHS) is a useful dataset which represents the coastlines
    of the world, in 5 different resolutions, as a set of polygons. It's
    very useful, not only for use as vector data, but because it can be
    converted to an image of the world for prorgrams which handle images
    (web-applications, for example).

    The data is published by the University of Hawaii, and available as
    a set of binary data files. I have a perl module which can read such
    data, and thought it might be useful to publish that on CPAN for
    others to use.

    I'm suggesting the *::PurePerl namespace, so that if somebody
    writes an implementation in C (which will likely be faster, hence
    more useful), then I won't get in the way of any later modules.

    I'm suggesting Geo::* rather than Geography::* because it seems to
    be common among other modules such as Geo::Shapefile, although the
    Geography::* namespace has started to appear recently

    I'm suggesting Geo::* rather than GIS::* or Cartography::*, because
    neither of those would show up in a search for "Geo" which might be
    initiated by anyone looking for modules similar to Geo::ShapeFile
    and Geo::GeoIP, Geo::OSGB, etc.

    Web links to the data files, and to a description of GSHHS itself
    can be found at: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhs/gshhs.html

The resulting entry would be:
