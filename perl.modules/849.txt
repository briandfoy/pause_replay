From: knight@baldmt.com (Steven Knight)

I'd like to register as a PAUSE developer.  Here's the relevant info,
per 04pause.html:

	Name:
		Steven Knight

	Email:
		knight@baldmt.com

	Page:
		http://www.baldmt.com/~knight/

	Preferred CPAN User-ID:
		KNIGHT

	What I'm planning to contribute:
		A Test::Cmd module that provides a portable interface
		to testing commands or scripts (not just Perl commands
		or scripts).  This includes portable management and
		cleanup of one or more temporary working directories,
		and portable file name manipulation inherited from the
		File::Spec module.  This module can be used in conjunction
		with the existing Test module to produce output suitable
		for the Test::Harness module.

		I will also pick up PAUSE upload duties for the Cons
		software construction utility, previously handled by
		Bob Sidebotham (BOBSIDE).  (Bob last uploaded version
		1.5 in December 1998, and Cons is up to version 1.7 now.)

	Module list format description:
		Test::Cmd   adpO Portable test infrastructure for commands      KNIGHT

	Where discussed:
		Posting to comp.lang.perl.modules.
			(I received no responses, but at least there
			were no objections to the choice of name...)

		Private email discussion with Cons developers.
			(Received endorsement from Bob Sidebothm to
			assume his upload responsibilities for Cons.
			Worked with other developers on the Test::Cmd
			interface.)

		The aegis-users mailing list.
			(Some of the Test::Cmd module's ideas originated
			with Aegis' testing model.)

I'm open to alternate suggestions if Test::Cmd is not a good choice for
the module name.

Thanks.

	--SK
