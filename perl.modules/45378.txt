Please communicate with the owner and CC modules@perl.org. Offer
taking over maintainership or ask for co-maintainership rights so you
can upload the next version.

Only if the current owner cannot be contacted for a sufficiently long
time we are considering to pass maintainership rights to other
interested people.

Until this is resolved in a cooperative way, feel free to upload a
patch or an updated package into your directory. Please try to help
both the current maintainer and the users of the module as much as
possible: make your intentions clear, explain the bugs, make it easy
to use your version, do not break backwards compatibility, etcetera,
etcetera. You get the idea.

Thanks,
