The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OSDial
  DSLIP:       Rdphg
  description: Interface for Predictive Dialer
  userid:      LOTTC (Lott Caskey)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    SVN, SourceForge, #osdial

  similar:
    DBI DBD::mysql Asterisk::AGI

  rationale:

    While admittedly this module is more-or-less a wrapper for DBI and
    Asterisk::AGI, this module inspires concise and terse coding
    practices within the OSDial project. So much that others may find
    value by reimplementing or adopting several of the functions. The
    OSDial project is a Predictive Dialing platform, built upon
    Asterisk, using PHP for web interaction, and Perl for the
    back-of-house operations. The top-level namespace is required
    because OSDial is an extensive project and the functions of this
    module effect specific triggers within the software (hmm, how many
    ways can I say API without using the phrase API?).

    One interesting function is sql_query, which statefully tracks dbh
    handles and query progression, even through sub-queries, and opens
    the database connection as needed for the query. while (my $result1
    = $osdial->sql_query("SELECT * FROM blah1", "dbha") { while (my
    $result2 = $osdial->sql_query("SELECT * FROM blah2 WHERE
    blah='".$result1['field1']."';","dbhb") { print
    $result2['somefield'] ."\n"; } }

    OSDial is registered on SourceForge and is an branch of another
    predictive dialer called VICIDial. One of the goals of the OSDial
    project was to rewrite all Perl functions and scripts to not only be
    readable, but also to consolidate common code into a module. OSDial
    has a 3-year history of independence, and we wish to expand
    functionality by making plugins and other aspects by providing an
    API that other parties can use that will allow for consistent
    development and coding styles.
