The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WordLists
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: for working with lists of words
  userid:      PERRETTDL (Daniel Perrett)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    These modules are intended to provide an interface for working with
    word lists for glossaries, coursebooks, etc. and simple dictionary
    lookups.

    It contains 14 Modules so far, including: A tagger which wraps
    Lingua::EN::Tagger to create a glossary; an generator for English
    inflections (taking a somewhat different approach to
    Lingua::EN::Inflect); a sort builder.

    Suggested a top-level NS because a) it matches the description of
    "functionality around an idea", and b)
    http://search.cpan.org/modlist/String_Language_Text_Processing
    contains no appropriate categories that I can see, and c) things
    like WordLists::Pronounce::Pronouncer are long enough names already.

    Core modules are OO, with some ancilliary modules providing some
    non-OO functions, e.g. for custom compare functions.

The resulting entry would be:

WordLists         bdpOp for working with lists of words              PERRETTDL
