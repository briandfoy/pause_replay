I think this should really be a patch to Clone.pm. Fixing memory leaks 
and all. The usual course of events when you can't contact the author is to:
a) post to this list with an explanation of the situation,
b) try to contact the author via his CPAN mail and any other means 
google might give you,
c) look out for the author in communities like perlmonks.org
d) After a few weeks post to this list again (if the author hasn't 
reacted) and ask for permission to upload a new version of the module.
