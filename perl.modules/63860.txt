Hi Brian,

I agree.

Again I agree, I too have been able to "insert" images in pod,
which is exactly what this "module" does.

At issue is what will search.cpan.org do with those images?
Do you know or is there a module that has images that show up?


So what I'm trying to achieve is the ability to have a person
be able to read text and see a graphics image in the pages
as presented by search.cpan.org.

AFAIK, there is no such items on cpan.

Either it is or is-not possible to present images in the
search.cpan.org due to how the pod is converted to that
which is presented. I've been told that the conversion process
is "secret".

If it is a simple pod2html process which would not strip out
some custom html in the pod and present it, then the next issue
would be how to present the url in the pod so it would find the
correct image file.

I did ask on an irc channel and on perlmonks, but nothing was
known or suggestions were off the point - e.g. ascii graphics
via light/dark densities of character glyphs or rudamentary
drawn stick figures. I had someone suggest just trying it, so
that is what I'm doing...

I believe that pod documentation is read more than 50% of the
time as html and not as textual "man" pages. As such, we should
foster better documentation by encouraging a mixture of text
and appropriate graphics. The technology is all in place, and
I believe that the audience would be appreciative and enhanced
communication (and polish) would be achieved with addition of
graphics.

I do assume that we want to push the envelop of better software
and its documentation.

At issue is HOW, which is exactly what this module is attempting
to determine.


Best regards - and Happy New Year!!!


..Otto
