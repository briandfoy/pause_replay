Hello,

Yes, it is true. But follow the code further. In the eval() is a read(), fr=
om a file handle to a .ttf file.

It reads the first 12 bytes of a ttf font file, and then evaluates it as a =
perl code block!

I found the current mail address of the author, Cc: is going to him now.

Bye,

Akos

How so? That's a block eval, not a string eval - it's effectively a
try {} with no catch block - see http://p3rl.org/Try::Tiny for a nicer
implementation of that.

An untrapped exception is potentially a bug - and I'd recommend seeing
if it is, and if so fixing it - but I don't see it as a security hole.
