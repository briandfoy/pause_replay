Many years ago I built some basic technical analysis modules.
There has been recent interest in expanding the library and I'm
really surprised how many people mail me about them.  I may even
build a mailing list for this...

I have Math::Business::EMA, ::SMA, ::MACD registered -- I usually
don't go for registering namespaces for modules that I imagine
very few people are actually using, but plenty of people use
these.

When I started adding even more (RSI, DMI, ATR, BollingerBands,
... soon ParabolicSAR, Stochastics, etc.), I started feeling like
the namespace was wrong.

It feels like I should un-register Math::Business::EMA, ::SMA,
and ::MACD and register Finance::TechnicalAnalysis and pour all
these modules in there.

Is Finance::TechnicalAnalysis another bad plan on my part?

Do people unregister namespaces?  Is it smarter to leave
M::B::EMA there and have it require and load F::TA::EMA?
