Hi Daisuke,

Thanks. We've been working with that module in the past few weeks and
it's seems to have a few issues.
Also we had a problem with finding the end of the stomp block. It was
ignoring the content-length, and looking for eom, so would only work
with ascii text. We got around this by using JSON to encode the data
structure we passed, instead of using Storable.
Dave is looking at your code now and we'll let you know if we've got
anything to add.

Cheers,
Phil (your old colleague from Livedoor)
