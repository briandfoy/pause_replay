     why:

    I was wondering if i could get access to my old PAUSE account:

    ADAVIES

    It's still registered at my old email account Alex.Davies@ti.com.

    Unfortunately i've forgotten the password :-\ (I only used it the
    once back in 1999!).

    I'd like to upload the latest version of my script "peg". It's a
    command line tool file search tool which is (mostly) compatible with
    GNU grep, plus extra bells and whistles. The new version benefits
    from being Windows friendly, runs much faster, can (automatically)
    handle encodings, colours output, can process archives, with more
    options than you want, plus the usual bug fixes.

    Thanks. alex.
