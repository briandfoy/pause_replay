Subject: Module submission SNC::Manipulator
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SNC::Manipulator
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Manipulate Sony SNC-RZ30N networked cameras
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    unknown

  rationale:

    I thought I had already filled this out, maybe I never hit submit
    as it didnt show up in the archive.

    I picked the root-level namespace SNC:: for this module since it
    stands for Sony Network Camera, and there is no such webcam::,
    Sony::, camera::, namespace currently.

    The uniqueness of my approach is because this module is unique;
    there are no other modules that do this.

  enteredby:   CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun 22 05:34:44 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SNC::
::Manipulator     bdpOp Manipulate Sony SNC-RZ30N networked cameras  CMORRIS
