Geoff,

I'm writing on behalf of the Perl-XML community to bring your attention to
a discussion we're having about XMLish modules. The full archive of the
discussion is available on Activestate's web site, somewhere off
www.activestate.com, although it would probably be nice for you to join the
mailing list. Here's the original message I sent to the list (please don't
take offense to this - the solution we'd prefer to see is you conforming to
XML - not pulling your module):

...

This is a light hearted email, so take it with as much salt as you
normally use...

I've noticed a number of things appearing (probably not limited to the perl
module world, but thats what I'm concerned with) that are saying "XML blah
blah" when in fact they're nothing more than angle bracket tagged blah's. 
The recent upload to CPAN that comes to mind is XML::Template, which I
noticed has nothing whatsoever to do with XML, except for using angle
bracket tags for markup (but not using them in an XML compliant manner).
Should we as the Perl-XML community be "cracking down" on these modules and
telling module authors (or CPAN maintainers) that they have no rights to
use the term XML, and/or no rights to the XML namespace?

As I said - I mean this half heartedly - noone made me the XML police! But
I do feel fairly strongly that things shouldn't call themselves XML when
they aren't - otherwise we get dilution of the term.
