Subject: Module submission Ham::Reference::Solar

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Ham::Reference::Solar
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Real-time solar data for Amateur Radio
  userid:      BRADMC (Brad McConahay)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.n8qq.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    The root level "Ham" already exists for Amateur Radio modules. The
    "Reference" level is to indicate that this module for solar data
    will be one of many more reference-type modules related to Amateur
    Radio (aka, ham radio). I believe it's important to delineate this
    from other types of ham radio modules, such as those for device
    control.

    A couple of sidenotes: I wish "HamRadio" was the root level instead
    of just Ham, but it looks to be a little late for that. And "Ham"
    appears to be in the Networking Devices IPC chapter, which is way
    too narrow for everything that ham radio encompasses.

    Thanks,

    Brad
