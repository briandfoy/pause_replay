The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::Mad
  DSLIP:       adhOg
  description: MPEG Audio Decoder (MAD) library interface
  userid:      MISCHKE (Mark McConnell)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    nowhere just yet, plans to announce on mad-user/devel mailing
    list(s)

  similar:
    Audio::MPEG

  rationale:

    This module is an abstraction of the C level interface of the MAD
    (MPEG Audio Decoder) library. The library, and this perl interface
    to it, have the primary function of converting one form of audio
    data (mp3) into another (pcm). I feel this qualifies it for the
    'Audio' namespace quite well.

    Already, there is a module on CPAN which implements it's own type
    of interface to the MAD library, and calls itself 'Audio::MPEG.'
    It's written by Peter Timofejew, and it's one of the modules that
    got me started on hacking this up in the first place. I choose to go
    with 'Audio::Mad' because I felt it was the best compromise
    available; and I didn't think it would be horribly misleading or
    conflicting to anyone. It represents it's place in the heirarchy,
    and has a name which is the same as the library it's built on.

    I would obviously still be using 'Audio::MPEG' if I thought that it
    was good enough. While I respect the work that has gone into that
    module, I don't feel that it allows you enough access to the MAD
    decoder library on the whole. It clumps a few things that are
    distinct in the C API together in the Perl API, and is quite a bit
    less isomorphic to me in general.

    My goal was to create a Perl interface that looked and worked
    almost exactly like the C interface, and providing you with
    opportunity to get at some of the more interesting data. As for the
    other interfaces for playing mp3's on CPAN -- I don't believe they
    even compare to what Audio::Mad is trying to offer.

    Audio::Mad is more or less feature complete at this point. It
    includes all of the relevant calls into the C API, provides
    accessors for data locked in the MAD structures, and allows one to
    use naitive perl datatypes with the library very easily. This allows
    you to take in mp3 data in a perl scalar, send it through the
    appropriate chain of objects, and you end up with pcm data in a perl
    scalar; with various opportunities for mucking around in between.

    I think this module is of enough use to enough people to warrant
    it's listing on the module list. Plus, I intend to maintain this
    module, and I look forward to seeing the feedback I get throughout
    the entire process.

    Thank you for your consideration, mischke
