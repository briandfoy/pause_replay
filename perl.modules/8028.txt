Hello,

I've written a module called JsFunctions.pm, which ports several JavaScript 
functions to Perl.  I'd like to register with PAUSE so I can upload it (I've 
already searched CPAN and I don't believe the JsFunctions namespace is taken).

My name: Evan Kaufman
My (incoming) email address: evank@scriptionsoft.com
My preferred user-ID on CPAN: EVANK (or EVANKAU, if previous is taken)

I also plan on contributing any modules, documentation, etc that I may write 
in the future.
