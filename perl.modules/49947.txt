I'm currently on a well-deserved holiday, with limited net-access. The patch
Mike is referring to popped up in RT 9 days ago... maybe a bit too early to
label me as AWOL already :)

I'm very much taking care of A::T and the patch Mike reported was not a
critical failure so it's in the queue till i get back from holiday.

No changes in permission will be required.

All the best,

Jos
