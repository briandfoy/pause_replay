The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::XOR
  DSLIP:       Rdcfp
  description: Package to handle XOR encryption of string b
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The XOR module is an XS module that allows you to quickly XOR two
    strings together by doing the operation in C, XORing integers out of
    an arbitrary-length string 32 bits at a time.

    This is the only method of encryption that (assuming the randomness
    of the pattern used as an encryption key) truly cannot be broken.

    I feel that this module should be entitled "Math::XOR". I was
    considering "Crypt::XOR", but decided that since this is a basic
    mathematical function that may very well have uses aside from
    encryption, I should use the more general module name.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
