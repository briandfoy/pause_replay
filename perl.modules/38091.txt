Subject: Module submission File::Spec::Link

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Spec::Link
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: reading and resolving symbolic links
  userid:      RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace: extends File::Spec to links, with same 00 interface.

    Approach: contains a pure perl approach to pathname resolution, as
    in Cwd; there is similar code to resolve linked filenames in FindBin
    but that module does not provide access to that functionality.

  enteredby:   RMBARKER (Robin Barker)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb  2 13:17:30 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Spec::
::Link            bdpOp reading and resolving symbolic links         RMBARKER
