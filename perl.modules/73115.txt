The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Git::DescribeVersion
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Use git-describe to show a repo's version
  userid:      RWSTAUNER (Randy Stauner)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion

  rationale:

    =head1 HISTORY / RATIONALE

    This module started out as a line in a Makefile:

    VERSION = $(shell (cd $(srcdir); \ git describe --match
    'v[0-9].[0-9]' --tags --long | \ grep -Eo 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+-[0-9]+' |
    tr - . | cut -c 2-))

    As soon as I wanted it in another Makefile (in another repo) I knew
    I had a problem.

    Then when I started learning L<Dist::Zilla> I realized that
    L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion> was nice but not do what I
    wanted.

    I started by forking L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git> on github, but
    realized that if I wrote the logic into a Dist::Zilla plugin it
    wouldn't be available to my git repos that weren't Perl
    distributions.

    So I wanted to extract the functionality to a module, include a
    Dist::Zilla VerionProvider plugin, and include a quick version that
    could be run with a minimal command line statement (so that I could
    put I<that> in my Makefiles).

The resulting entry would be:

Git::
::DescribeVersion bdpOp Use git-describe to show a repo's version    RWSTAUNER
