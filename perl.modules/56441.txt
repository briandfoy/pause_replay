Removed it from the deletion list. What likely happened is that the
PhotoRotate.pm file doesn't include a "package Tk::PhotoRotate;" but a
"package Tk::Photo;". Thus, it isn't indexed under ::PhotoRotate.

You could prepend this to the file:

package Tk::PhotoRotate;
use strict;
use warnings

package Tk::Photo;


Whether you want to do this is up to you, of course.

Best regards,
Steffen
