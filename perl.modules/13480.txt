A good idea.

How so? Which service did you try? What sort of URLs?

I have found web browsers tend to be reluctant to do some redirects
(e.g. http to telnet), but that's more a browser problem.

Anyway, if the services are prejudiced against the protocols, that's
more a limitation of the services rather than the modules. After all,
the modules only provide an interface to the servers.

A good idea. The current name mostly came about as an evolution of
WWW::MakeAShorterLink, hence WWW::Shorten::*. A shift to URI::Shorten
may be more sensible.
