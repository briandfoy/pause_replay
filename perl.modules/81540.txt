Neil's emails aren't getting to modules, so I'm relaying.

NEILB needs to become primary maintainer of Devel::Dependencies.

As I'm holding to my vow of doing ID's only, would another PAUSE admin
please do the honors?

Thank you,
David

Here's the thread of emails -- as you can see, Jean-Louis wasn't able
to assign Devel::Dependencies to me (NEILB)

Sorry but I have forgotten my login (tried a dozen plausible accounts
and passwords) and the associated email account doesn't exist any
longer.

Hi Jean-Louis,

As far as i am concerned you can have the namespace. The module was
just a byproduct of my article 'A Timely Start'.
Make good use of it ;)

Would you mind logging in to PAUSE and adding me as the lead
maintainer of the module please?
I've tried to contact the PAUSE admins a number of times, forwarding
them your email as evidence.
But to no effect.
Cheers,
Neil

Jean-Louis

Hi Jean-Louis,
I've just published a review of CPAN modules for getting dependency
information for Perl modules:

http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2012/07/cpan-modules-for-getting-module-d=
ependency-information.html

This includes your module Devel::Dependencies. Looking at these
prompted me to write (yet!) another module, which is similar in style
of use to yours, but it generates a dependency graph rather than a
flat list of dependencies. I haven't released my module yet, partly
because I'm not sure what to call it.
I noticed your module was released in 2006. Are you still interested
in maintaining this? If not, would you be happy to hand over the
namespace to me? Just be clear, if you did I'd just use the name for
my code :-)
No worries if you don't want to -- I'm happy to find another namespace.
Cheers,
Neil
