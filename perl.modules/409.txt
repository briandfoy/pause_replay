Should I take the lack of answer to the enclosed message as a silent
de facto agreement for the namespace request?

It's becomming an habit, but I have yet another module request to make...

	Log::Agent

It's meant to be a general logging framework. Modules wishing to get
logging support will say:

	use Log::Agent;

And then will use routines like:

	logerr
	logdie
	logsay
	logtrc
	logdbg

At the toplevel program, a logconfig routine will be configured as:

	logconfig(
		-prefix => "$me:",
		-driver => Log::Agent::Syslog->make(-name => 'local2'),
		-trace => 12,
		-verbose => 1);

The real power comes from the customization at the driver level.
When no driver is present, a default driver:

	Log::Agent::Stdio

is used, which maps (e.g., I don't know, the module is not written yet):

	logerr => warn
	logdie => die
	logsay => print STDOUT if $verbose
	logtrc(level, ...) => warn "..." if level > $loglevel;
	logdbg(level, ...) => warn "..." if level > $loglevel;

Naturally, with a Syslog driver, things are routed to syslog.

I also plan a Usrlog driver which will route things to a user-level
syslog-like logger that I wish to use for all my programs. No need to
use system services for pure user-level logging.

Why one more logging module? Well, I'm tired of having zillions of
incompatible logging systems which impede reuse. With the above scheme,
modules will use Log::Agent, but only the application will control where
logging should go.
