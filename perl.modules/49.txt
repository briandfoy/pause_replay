Personally I see no advantage either way, but the same can be said about
many modules on CPAN.

The two questions I would ask myself are

1) Would anyone ever sub-class this
2) Do I want to export functions

My answers would be no and no, so its makes no real difference.

That probably explains why it is under Devel::

However I think if I were implementing this module (which I am not)
I probably would have not chosen OO but

  $ns = ns_find($package);
  ns_set($ns, $name, 'CODE', $value);
  ns_get($ns, $name, 'CODE');

where $ns would have actually been a reference to the package hash.
