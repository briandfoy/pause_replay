Thanks Achim for the reminder. I seem to recall somebody informed me,
but I forgot about it, sorry.

So Dominique, there are two things to say: PAUSE allows overwrites of
HTML files, so in principle you could have uploaded into your CPAN
directory.

The other is my intention to bring the Tk module list back into the
main module list (Apache is brought back, XML pending). Here's how I
described my plan in a previous mail (slightly edited):

  I would believe the time has come to fold back the separate module
  lists for Apache, Tk, and XML into the main module list. Software on
  PAUSE is now a tad batter than it was at the time we went separate
  ways. (I would not suggest a change otherwise.)

  Would anybody object if I just started to do the folding now? Of
  course, all maintainers of module lists will get the required
  privileges to maintain the modulelist via PAUSE as far as possible.

  Recap why: The advantage for the users would be a consistent look at
  modules information (e.g. information accessible also from CPAN.pm),
  and a single point of getting at it (THE module list). The advantage
  for authors would be a single point of applying for registration and a
  software that handles their information mostly automatically,
  especially allows editing without human intervention. The advantage
  for both would be having to deal with less typos and inconsitencies.
  One advantage for maintainers would be to join their forces in
  handling THE module list, another advantage could be that we find a
  way to have more specialized modulelist pumpkings in the future (if we
  succeed in providing the right software).

  The most interesting improvement for us maintainers is the tiny new
  module CPAN::Admin that comes with the current CPAN.pm in
  A/AN/ANDK/CPAN-1.58_55.tar.gz. Please, give it a try with

      perl -MCPAN::Admin -e 'shell'

  You get an additional command on the shell, called "register", and
  this does a couple of things for you that seem to me very nice and
  useful, but of course, your milage may vary. Feedback welcome, please
  ask if you need further instruction on usage.

I have made you, Dominique, member of the group modmaint, so PAUSE
should show you the ModListMaint menu from now on. Let me know if this
is OK for you or which problems it may cause for you. One consequence
would be, of course, that the module list changes under your feet
because the users can edit their lines. But this makes maintainance
easier in some way. Let me know your thoughts.--Thanks!
