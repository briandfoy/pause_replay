The name seems to generic. It also sounds like it could be
split into at least two modules. The 'display' part seems
to be fairly trivial. The main functionality is in the data
scanning. Perhaps Data::Describe and Data::DisplayDescribed.

> Data::Loader -

This name is too generic and not descriptive of the (apparently)
oracle-centric nature of the module.
Perhaps Oracle::DataLoader.

Perhaps Fax::DataFax would be a better name.

Why not work with the author of Class::MethodMaker to extend it rather
than reinvent a slightly different wheel? If it must be different but
the only difference is the naming of methods then perhaps
Class::MethodMakerNamed would be better (to highlight to similarity).
