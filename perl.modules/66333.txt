Subject: Module submission CLI::Framework::Application

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CLI::Framework::Application
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Build standardized command-line apps
  userid:      KERISMAN (Karl Erisman)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    App::Cmd, App::CLI, CLI::Dispatch

  rationale:

    Namespace choice: CLI::Framework ("CLIF") is a command-line
    interface application framework.

    Uniqueness: CLIF offers too many differentiating features to
    mention here (details in the POD). It is more of a "framework" than
    any of the other similar modules, establishing a clearer conceptual
    pattern. It is also uncommonly flexible and has a unique way of
    handling subcommands.

    Why it should be listed: Perl developers have been reluctantly
    writing disposable scripts for too long or struggling to decide how
    not to do so. It's time for a CLI revolution!

  enteredby:   KERISMAN (Karl Erisman)
  enteredon:   Fri Jun 19 03:20:31 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CLI::Framework::
::Application     adpOp Build standardized command-line apps         KERISMAN
