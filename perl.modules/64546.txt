Hierarchical config loading for any back end is one of the goals of the
Config::Loader project which builds atop Config::Any (and I always use .conf
with Config::Any as do many Catalyst users :)

Perhaps you'd be better off subscribing to the config-loader list on
http://lists.scsys.co.uk/ and helping get the general solution built?

(note also Config::JFDI and Config::Merge, the authors of which are also
involved in the config-loader project)
