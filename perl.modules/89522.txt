Hi Grzegorz

Thanx for the link to the report about mail bouncing for 2.5 month. Of 
course that is not his CPAN email address, which is redirected 
elsewhere. Nevertheless...

I've made you primary maintainer for Search::Binary.

Erik is getting a copy of this, hopefully, via his CPAN email address.
