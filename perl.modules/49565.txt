Subject: Module submission IPC::Run::Simple
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Run::Simple
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Simple run() wrapper around system()
  userid:      SFINK (Steve A Fink)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    perlmonks

  similar:
    IPC::Run3 IPC::Run IPC::Cmd

  rationale:

    This module was written in response to a query on perlmonks about a
    dead-simple wrapper around system() (to fix the return value, and
    throw exceptions on failure.) It is a common problem that I run into
    fairly frequently, and nobody else seemed to come up with a simpler
    solution than IPC::Run3 and its ilk. My main problem with those are
    that they use a different syntax; I want a drop-in replacement for
    system().

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::Run::
::Simple          Rdpfp Simple run() wrapper around system()         SFINK
