OK, I have changed it here in my copy.

There are two ways: with the form at
https://pause.kbx.de/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_mod you can enter a
new owner and lose control over the module immediately. But you can
also mail me and I can enter other people into an per-namespace access
control list. Then both you and other people can upload modules in
these namespaces.

I'm planning to make access to this list public but it has a lower
priority right now.
