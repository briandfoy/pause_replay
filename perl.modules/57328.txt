Dear Steffen Mueller:

Please remove the namespace and my account as well.  I tried to do it 
myself, but the system didn't seem to want to let me delete the account.

I have module I want to submit someday, but since I use ActiveState, the 
impedence was too great until the book on how to submit CPAN modules came 
out, but I've been too busy to read it yet.

Thanks,
Larry
