The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       enum::fields
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Enums that can be inherited
  userid:      DMLLOYD (David Lloyd)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    enum fields

  rationale:

    This module most closely resembles enum in interface and usage. The
    difference is that you can inherit fields from another class. The
    main usage is in objects that consist of a reference to an array. So
    in that way it is similar in purpose to fields.pm, and similar in
    functionality and usage to enum.pm, aside from the ability to extend
    another class. Hence, enum::fields.

The resulting entry would be:

enum::
::fields          bdppp Enums that can be inherited                  DMLLOYD
