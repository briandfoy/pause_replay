The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::AA
  DSLIP:       bdpnp
  description: It undergoes plastic operation on a Japanese
  userid:      ARUTEIDO (satoshi ishikawa)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    These sentences hang with the translation software. In Japanese,
    there is ASCII art to which it undergoes plastic operation on
    sentences by using space and the colon. It expresses it by enclosing
    it with the ruled line by arranging the horizontal pixel size of one
    character of the font for Japanese. The module that was able to do
    the plastic operation was made now though the character-code was
    still EUC limitation.

  enteredby:   ARUTEIDO (satoshi ishikawa)
  enteredon:   Wed Sep 27 12:14:09 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::AA              bdpnp It undergoes plastic operation on a Japanese ARUTEIDO
