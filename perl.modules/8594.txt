I agree that the default for any variable should be the value that is most
widespread. However I do not believe that the fact that there are more
"people" in China or Europe or whatever should dictate widespreadness. In
this situation, surely it should be based on how many programmers are
going to use a given piece of code. If that were the criterion, perhaps
the American date format should be the default.

Nevertheless, in order to smooth the ruffled feathers of (my fellow) Brits
and other Euros, I shall change my module so that it is required to
provide a format specification. I only have 'us' and 'eu' at this
point: I suppose 'iso' would be redundant since that's how MySQL handles
dates.

Left undiscussed amid all the furor over ethnocentrism was the fact that
the module offers error checking as well, which is nice when using MySQL
since, if you supply an invalid date to it, MySQL fails silently and
inserts "0000-00-00".

I'll change the code as described and update the source and docs at
