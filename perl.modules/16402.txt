Computer Use in Kids Linked with Back Pain
Preventicare.com

Computers aren't only the domains of adults, youngsters also use 
them. And, just like adults, computer use may produce musculoskeletal 
disorders in youths, according to a new report.

Investigators interviewed 212 students in grades 1 to 12. One of each 
subject's parents was also interviewed. 

Results showed that "many students experienced physical discomfort 
attributed to computer use, such as wrist pain (30%) and back pain 
(15%). Specific computer activities - such as using a joystick or 
playing non-educational games - were significantly predictive of 
physical discomfort. Many parents reported difficulty getting their 
children off the computer (46%) and that their children spent less time 
outdoors (35%)."

Note: It's recommend you contact a healthcare professional skilled 
in helping you with proper ergonomic set-up of your at-home computer 
station. Specific exercises can also be recommended to reduce neck, 
wrist and eye strain. 

Your local chiropractor is one who is highly skilled in this area.

3. Safety Tip of the Week - Car Seat Safety
Parents.com

Harness too loose on the child?

Test your seat: "If, after you've tightened your child into his car 
seat, you can still pinch the fabric of the harness straps between 
your fingers, he harness is too loose," says Stephanie Tombrello,
executive director of SafetyBeltSafe USA, in Torrance, California. 

The danger: "A child who's loose in his harness can easily come out of 
his seat in a crash," Tombrello says. The child could then be severely 
injured if he hits part of the car's interior or another passenger. The 
worst-case scenario: the child is ejected from the vehicle altogether. 

Fast fix: Tighten the harness. Keep in mind that the straps should be 
snug and have no slack.

Eating Healthy for the Holidays
Chad Oler, N.D.

There you are, sitting at the table, taking in all the sights and smells 
of the smorgasbord of delicious and enticing holiday foods lying before 
you. Turkey, ham, your aunt's famous casserole, creamy mashed 
potatoes, 7-layer salads, and piping hot dinner rolls with melted butter... 
before your brain can even comprehend your countless choices, you 
see the dessert table, full of pies, tortes, cookies and cakes. And 
before you can even take your first heaping helping of mashed 
potatoes, that voice inside, that at times nagging little voice pipes up - 
'You'd better watch what you eat!', 'Might as well just put that piece 
of pie right on your hips, that's where it's going to end up anyway.', 
and 'Well, there goes your diet!'

And then you feel bad, almost guilty about the thought of enjoying the 
wonderful food, made with love for loved ones. But fear not, there are 
ways to quiet that little voice - here are several: 

1. First thing - control what you can control -eat a healthy 
breakfast and light lunch, like a cup of soup and a salad before 
the holiday meal. That will take the edge off so you won't be starving
when you get to the table.

2. Take smaller portions that you normally would, eat slowly and savor 
each and every bite. Don't put more than one spoonful in your mouth 
at any given time and set your fork/spoon down while you savor the 
flavors of the delicious foods you are tasting. 

3. Take only those things you can't normally have. If you can regularly 
have potatoes and gravy or buttered rolls, pass them up and enjoy 
some of the other scrumptious foods you can only have here and now.

4. Remember, a salad is a wonderful addition to any meal and a great 
way to super-charge your meal with plenty of nutritious and filling foods.

5. Chew each mouthful of food thoroughly and take in all the flavors 
and textures of the food you are eating.

6. Spend a lot of time talking at the table - this will give you time to 
properly digest - and everyone knows it's not polite to talk with your 
mouth full!

7. Have dessert only if you really have room at that time. You may find 
that you will enjoy your desert more if you wait an hour or two. When 
you do have dessert, have a small piece, sit down and enjoy it. Desserts 
are more for leaving a good taste in your mouth and to finish off a 
delicious meal - they are not supposed to be a main course. 

Always remember the holidays are more than just the food - take in the 
company of those around you and share your experiences as well as 
your recipes. And don't forget, no one becomes overweight on one 
holiday meal. It's what you do the day after and the entire year that 
will make a difference.

Holidays are a time for tradition and family gatherings. And if everyone 
takes the time to enjoy that, then the food is not as important, and we 
can do with less.
