The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PGHandler
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Accessors for PostgreSQL data
  userid:      CSA (Lance Cleveland)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    PGHandler was selected because it is a unique namespace and the
    module does not really fit under any existing Postgres module (which
    is why it was written). PG-Simple is similar but does not provide
    the level of functionality I needed, therefore I could not use it as
    a super-class. I did not want to pollute the DBD-XXX namespace since
    that tends to be pure DBI/DBD drivers and not for add-on modules.

    If there is another namespace that this Postgres DB interface
    should be under, I would be happy to change it. I simply could not
    find one that seemed fitting, especially since PGHandler does not
    inherit properties from any of the existing Postgres modules.

    If the new PGHandler namespace is not appropriate, please advise.
    This is the first module I have published from scratch (though I
    have contributed to many existing modules).

The resulting entry would be:

PGHandler         bdpOg Accessors for PostgreSQL data                CSA
