To whom this may concern,

I uploaded a module called  Text::NSP version 1.21 to cpan through my 
pause account (btmcinnes) on Friday. I am not seeing it updated yet.
I tried to reload it today - in case I didn't load it properly. It came 
back stating that that version has already been loaded. I am not certain 
what to do now.  Did I mess something up? Would you be able to fix this?

Thank you very much for your time!

Sincerely,

Bridget
