The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::WWD
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Manipulate network based WWD objects
  userid:      BALESHI (John Baleshiski)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://idserver.org/wwd

  similar:
    KT::WWD (This is replacing the KT::WWD module)

  rationale:

    WWD, originally developed by Kaizen Technologies, is a static
    method for retrieving dynamic data. Restricted Perl applications,
    pointers to other data, or actual data can be referenced on an
    Internet connected machine from any other Internet connected
    machine. In any WWD enabled medium, instead of referencing actual
    data such as a person's email address, users can reference an
    "Internet variable", i.e.,

    <wwd servername-or-ip/objectname [optional parameters />

    Assume the following for objects:

    idserver.org/name is set to "John Baleshiski" idserver.org/test is
    set to "This is a test."

    Example webpage: <html><body> <wwd idserver.org/test />
    </body></html>

    Viewing that in a web browser will output "This is a test."

    Set idserver.org/test to "wwd://idserver.org/name"

    A view in the web browser will be "John Baleshiski"

    Set idserver.org/test to "<dperl> return "Hello from Perl. The time
    is " . time; </dperl>"

    A view in the web browser (as of right now) would show "Hello from
    Perl. The time is 1085710246"

    All objects are either owned by a specific user, a url, or an ip
    address. Temporary passwords, temporary
    authorization/deauthorization to view the data, view passwords, and
    other controls are allowed by the WWD protocol.

    Data can be restricted so only the owner can view it, only people
    with the proper read password or permission, or anybody can view it.

    White paper and forum to be set up on idserver.org.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::WWD             adpOa Manipulate network based WWD objects         BALESHI
