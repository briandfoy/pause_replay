Dear Sergio,

I see that you have registered the Fortran::Namelist name but you haven't
uploaded any code yet, and I was wondering about the status of your code
because I have been looking at the cpan webpage hoping to download and test
it but, It is been a while and I don't see any progress. Therefore I decided
to write my own module and now I have a working Fortran::Namelist  that I
would like to upload. I Don't know how the name registration works but, I
would like your feedback.

Thanks.
Marcelo.
