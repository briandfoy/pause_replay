The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IP::Country
  DSLIP:       MdpOp
  description: Fast lookup of country codes from IP address
  userid:      NWETTERS (Nigel Wetters)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    irc #london.pm on london.rhizomatic.net

  similar:
    Geo::IP

  rationale:

    Very fast, pure Perl lookup of country codes by IP address. Stores
    >30,000 IP ranges from the four regional Internet registries (ARIN,
    RIPE, APNIC, LACNIC) in a 43KB database.

    Avoids using performance-degrading network lookups against DNS or
    whois.

    Scripts are included with instuctions on how to create the database
    from Internet registry statistics, just in case you don't trust my
    monthly upgrades.

    As opposed to Geo::IP, database upgrades are free, and module is
    written in Perl rather than C.

    Memory use is minimal (<200KB), and performance is great (>25,000
    lookups/second on my 1.3GHz Athlon). If you're using a country
    lookup within mod_perl, you should really consider switching to this
    module.

The resulting entry would be:

IP::
::Country         MdpOp Fast lookup of country codes from IP address NWETTERS
