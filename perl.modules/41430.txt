Do we have any other Google interfaces?

Short of reversing it and doing Google::Maps::HTML (I'm assuming we will 
be accumulating more Google APIs over time) I don't see that it's a 
problem. It specifically generates HTML fragments, rather than connect 
direct to Google, so as far as I'm concerned HTML:: is a relatively sane 
place to keep it.
