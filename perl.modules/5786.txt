ok, no problem to move it to HTTP::

Taking over HTTP::Dav will not work, because HTTP::Dav is a pure Perl module
and Net::Webdav a Perl wrapper for a C library and both has different
interfaces. Also I have talked to the author of HTTP::Dav, he still want's
to add the missing features someday, so he doesn't give up at all. Since I
had an urgend need for a webdav client in Perl, I have considered a)
patching the existing HTTP::DAV or b) creating a new module, which uses an
existing, well maintained C library. I have choosen the second alternative,
because I have gotten much more functionality with much less work.

ok, I rename the next version to HTTP::Webdav and delete the already
uploaded Net::Webdav from CPAN

Is this ok ?
