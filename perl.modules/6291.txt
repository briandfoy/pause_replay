RFC: Class::MakeMethods

I have made what I hope will be the final name change to my
class-generating module before it is uploaded to CPAN.

(Earlier versions circulated as "Class::MethodMaker draft 2.0",
"Class::Methods", and "Class::MethodGenerator".)

Here's the "elevator pitch" for the module:

  By passing arguments to "use Class::MakeMethods ..." statements,
  you can select from a library of hundreds of common types of
  methods, which are dynamically generated and installed as
  subroutines in your module, simplifying the code for your class.

This release also includes substantially revised documentation,
several new method generating subclasses, and support for declarations
via Attribute::Handlers under Perl v5.6.

I've posted the package overview, a "getting started" guide with
examples, and a tarball of the current version:

  http://work.evolution.com/dist/Class-MakeMethods-1.0.13.README
  http://work.evolution.com/dist/Class-MakeMethods-1.0.13.GUIDE
  http://work.evolution.com/dist/Class-MakeMethods-1.0.13.tar.gz

Suggestions and comments would be much appreciated.

In particular, I'd be interested in answers to these questions:
- Does the "Class::MakeMethods" name make sense on first read?
- Is the getting-started guide helpful? What about the documentation
  for the individual subclasses, like Class::MakeMethods::Basic::Hash?
- Can you find the methods that might be useful to you? Anything missing? 
  What would make the module more useful to you?
- Does it test cleanly on various platforms, under Perl 5.004 through
  wherever bleedperl is these days?

Please feel free to post to the list or send me feedback directly.

Thanks,

-Simon
