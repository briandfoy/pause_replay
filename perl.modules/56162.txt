The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Hyper
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: The Web 3.0 Pioneering Framework
  userid:      ACID (Andreas 'ac0v' Specht)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://trac.hyper-framework.org/, http://svn.hyper-framework.org/,
    http://www.hyper-framework.org/

  similar:
    Catalyst, Jifty, Maypole

  rationale:

    Hyper - Hype reloaded The Web 3.0 Pioneering Framework

    Hyper is is an OO workflow-based framework. Workflow code can be
    generated from INI-style config files. Validation is maintained in
    perl-code and happens with Ajax as well as server-side.
    Service/use-case paradigm. The rootlevel namespace is required
    because of the sane reasons as Catalyst and others have it, below
    Hyper are its components such as Hyper::Config, Hyper::Interface,
    Hyper::Validator and others.

    Why Web 3.0? Well - that's Hype. :-) Working with Hyper is more
    configuring than coding. You configure and the code is generated.
    However, if you need to do something special, you can code - by
    inheriting from the generated code. Its neat. :-)

    Hyper uses the state-of-the-art techniques like InsideOut objects,
    the source is coded according to Damian Conways Perl Best Practices,
    and is already used in a large enterprise application and thus being
    developed in a professional manner.

The resulting entry would be:
