The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::MyParsePP
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Pure-Perl SQL parser based on MySQL grammar
  userid:      PHILIPS (Philip Stoev)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    DBIx::MyParse

  rationale:

    Calling the MySQL parser natively requires an XS glue, therefore a
    compiler needs to be installed. To overcome that, the yacc grammar
    was taken out of MySQL and was compiled with Parse::Yapp in order to
    obtain a pure-perl SQL parser. The MySQL lexer was also translated
    from C into Perl, thus providing a complete pure-perl parsing
    package that parses the entire set of SQL that is understood by
    MySQL, including subqueries and nested joins.

  enteredon:   Sun Aug  5 23:18:54 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::MyParsePP       bdpOg Pure-Perl SQL parser based on MySQL grammar  PHILIPS
