Hello,

thank you for your response :-)

I think present behavior of "warnings" pragma is proper, and
the result which brought about by my code describes it's
nature -- it works with static scope:

|(1)  use warnings;
|
|     package GrandMother;
|     use warnings::register;
|
|     sub deliver {
|       my $self;
|       warnings::warnif("GrandMother", "You have warned by grandma.");
|       bless \$self;
|     }
|
|     package Mother;
|     use base "GrandMother";
|     use warnings::register;
|
|     sub deliver {
|       warnings::warnif("Mother", "You have warned by mom.");
|(2)    $_[0]->SUPER::deliver();
|     }
|
|     package main;
|(3)  no warnings "GrandMother";
|(4)  no warnings "Mother";
|
|(5)  my $me = Mother->deliver(); # => You have warned by grandma.

Let's see what's happen.

   A. at the line (5), warning bit of category "GrandMother" is
      OFF by pragma at line(3).

   B. In Mother::deliver method around line (2)  called from line
      (5), warning bit of category "GrandMother" is ON by pragma at
      line (1), because of "use warnings" pragma turns on warning
      bits of all categories, and it's value can't be overridden
      at runtime.

   C. As the result of B., GrandMother::deliver method called from
      line (2) warns here.

   D. Returns to line (5), warning bit of category "Mother" is OFF
      by pragma at line (4), so "Mother::deliver" method does not
      warn.

As you see above, warnings pragma works properly and I think there
is no room to be fixed.

Although warnings pragma is faithful to it's duty, the code above
brings me the result which I didn't want, so I wrote this module.

Best regards,
