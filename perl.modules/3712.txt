You may be right, but I wasn't talking about the build of the module
package as much as the module itself. Unless there's something h2xs does
that I'm not aware of? I use h2xs to build all my packages, but I'm not
aware of it being able to provide a stub module, which is what I'm
talking about here. But I could be wrong (if so, please correct me).
