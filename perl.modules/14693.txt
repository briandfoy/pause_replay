 Brian,
  
   yes the module goes both ways. It will create
a well formed XML document based on query results.

  The module is for importing data from one data(XML)
structure to another(SQL DB) and back. 
  
  I am not sure what you are looking for in a name.  
But I know I would not think to look for it under
SQL::Statement.

  The module is more of a XML processing tool than
anything else.

  I was creative enough to write the module but at
this point I am at a loss for a better name. I would
find any suggested name most likly acceptable
