Hi there,

I've attempted to contact the author of Win32API::ProcessStatus in order
to fix the prerequisite problem specified in this bug:

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=97460

Following advice on the Internet I also posted publicly  about my intent
to request take over for the dist here:

http://blogs.perl.org/users/graham_ollis/2014/05/intent-to-adopt-win32apiprocessstatus.html

I haven't received any feedback from either of these postings.

I also sent this email which I am including inline at the end of this
message.  The email has not been responded to.

I am hoping that I can get permission to upload a version of this dist
that simply fixes a prerequisite so that it can be installed via CPAN.  If
anyone can help me out in this task I would greatly appreciate it.  If
anyone has any concerns about this proposal it would be nice to hear about
that too.

Thanks,
Graham

Hi Ferdinand,

I just spent a few minutes trying to get the CPAN module
Win32::ProcessStatus to install.  The main problem is that it had an
undeclared dependency on Win32API::Process.  While I was at it I fixed
the test so that it would work under Cygwin (where $$ isn't the same as
the windows process id).  I've put my fixes on GitHub:

https://github.com/plicease/Win32API-ProcessStatus

My interest in this module comes from some recent work that I did on
FFI::Raw where I needed to use psapi.dll from its XS code, and I thought
it would be nice to use that API from Perl as well.

Do you think you could incorporate these changes and send a new release
to CPAN?  If you don't have the time or the inclination to do it yourself
would you like me to adopt the distribution?  If so, I am happy  to have
co-maint status, but if you're not interested in this module any  more,
you could give me ownership of that module, as that would give me  the
ability ot grant co-maint status to others, should the need arise.

You can give me permission via the PAUSE web site

http://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

My PAUSE id is plicease

Thanks,
Graham
