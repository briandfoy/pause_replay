     why:

    I'd like to upload a module developed to access the WordNet lexical
    database (see http://wordnet.princeton.edu/). This was developed
    during my time working at the Princeton University Cognitive Science
    Laboratory, and will be released under the same licensing terms
    (approximately equivalent to the MIT license).

    There is already at least one other module to do this, but this one
    is different for at least two reasons: 1) It was developed by the
    team that created the file formats in the first place, so the
    parsing is more correct in some cases. 2) It's more object-oriented
    than other approaches I've seen.

    Best, Ben
