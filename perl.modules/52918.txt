Hi Adam,

yes this definitely Lucene:: stuff since I'm the author
of the Lucene module on CPAN and this is bascially an
extention.

However it should be called Lucene::Search::Highlight
not Lucene::Highlight. That was a mistake.

Are you a modules maintainer or was this just a
general question ?

Thomas Busch

------------------------
Are you sure this should be in Lucene:: and not part of Plucene?

(just checking)
