The only problem here is with how general your module is...

Is it useful for all Sony camera, all in the SNC line of cameras, or 
just that one specific web camera, or all web cameras.

I dislike SNC as a top level namespace only because it's only part of 
the model name, not the entire name. In 5 or 10 years, will anyone still 
find SNC of relevance?

Some alternatives...

Web::Camera - You take an approach that could be generic enough to then 
have Web::Camera::Sony::SNC or Web::Camera::Sony::SNCRZ30N tacked on the 
back...

Sony::SNC - Something that works for all Sony SNC cameras, but isn't 
applicable to every type of web camera.
