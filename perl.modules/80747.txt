The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::WubWubWub
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Wub up your IRC channels!
  userid:      SIRMXE (Gary Warman)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Namespace choice was decided upon as this is a plugin for the
    POE::Component::IRC framework; as to the exact naming of it, the
    point of it is to randomly send some variation of multiple
    repetitions of WUB to a channel, therefore I find that WubWubWub is
    an entirely accurate name. As far as listing it in the module list,
    who know? Maybe someone wants a bot that will wub up an IRC channel.
    Lord knows I do!

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::
::WubWubWub       bdpOp Wub up your IRC channels!                    SIRMXE
