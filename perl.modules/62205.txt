     why:

    Initially I'm working on expanding ExtUtils:: and Module::Install::
    to support installation of limited none perl stuff. Such as a
    (/usr/local/)share/DISTNAME/ dir or
    (/usr/local/)/share/docs/DISTNAME/. Also some support for system
    configs (/etc/DISTNAME/). This is for a perl application that
    extends beyond just a module. I plan to avoid making changes to
    exiting modules, but hope to be able to work with their authors. The
    first module I hope to upload is ExtUtils::Install::Generic. An
    initial version of something like ExtUtils::Install for none perl
    files (and not to go into perl's dirs). Currently fairly simple and
    not feature complete.
