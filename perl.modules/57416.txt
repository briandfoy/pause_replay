Subject: Module submission Clone::Closure

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Clone::Closure
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: A clone that knows how to clone closures
  userid:      BMORROW (Ben Morrow)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Clone Storable Clone::More Clone::Fast Clone::PP Scalar::Util::Clone
    Data::COW

  rationale:

    This module is a modification of Clone that is able to clone a
    closure, including all its closed-over lexicals. None of the (many)
    clone modules currently on CPAN have this functionality.

  enteredby:   BMORROW (Ben Morrow)
  enteredon:   Sat Oct 27 04:27:16 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Clone::
::Closure         bdcfp A clone that knows how to clone closures     BMORROW
