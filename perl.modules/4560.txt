I was wondering where my ID had got to, but just assumed that you were
busy!  I just looked in the archive and noticed that you sent my "Welcome"
message to the wrong email address, downen@midsomer.org rather than
dowen@midsomer.org.  I also never received my instructions on how to set up
my password.  The ID I was allotted is DOWEN.  If you could resend the
instructions on how to set up my password I would be very grateful.

Thanks

dowen
