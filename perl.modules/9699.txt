The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MySQL::myperl
  DSLIP:       bmcng
  description: Stored Procedure Support for MySQL in Perl
  userid:      KROW (Brian Aker)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Slashdot, http://cvs.tangent.org/

  similar:
    mod_perl is about the only thing I can think of that is similair

  rationale:

    I have gotten a few requests from people to add it to CPAN. Since I
    am working on a new version that will finally have full dynaloader
    support I was thinking that it was about time that I got around to
    seeing if CPAN was an option to distribute it.

  enteredby:   KROW (Brian Aker)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan 14 06:57:16 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MySQL::
::myperl          bmcng Stored Procedure Support for MySQL in Perl   KROW
