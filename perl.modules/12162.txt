Hello!

I'm looking to contribute some material to CPAN - mostly relating to the 
following:

Linux ipchains - patches to existing IPChains modules, including missing 
features in IPChains, also a related log parser (i was thinking 
IPChains::LogParse).

General firewalling modules, probably to add into the fwctl:: namespace, 
covering automatic creation of rules based on ipchains log parsing and 
sendmail relay attempts, something a la fwlogwatch.

Maybe some additional functions for Net::CIDR and Net::Whois to support these.
