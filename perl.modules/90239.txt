     why:

    Im planning to contribute some libraries for common gaming
    platforms for example Steam, to increase the usability for this.
    Because so many people in the World uses bad/insecure languages like
    java/php, but Perl is such faster and easy to use. I showed some
    people who develop games the "awesomeness" of the native RegEx
    support in Perl, currently there are only using Perl to parse files.
    And I realy promise i never will make duplicates, like there it is
    currently on CPAN look for IMAP ;) there are multiple libraries
    which does all the same, only in a other way.
