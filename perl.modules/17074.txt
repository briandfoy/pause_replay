Hi,

Jochen Wiedman (JWEID) transferred ownership of SQL::Statment to me over 
two years ago.  PAUSE lists me (JZUCKER) as the registered owner. 
However the modules list still lists the module as owned by JWEID and, 
most importantly CPAN.pm downloads his outdated version of the module 
rather than my much newer version.

Please help!
