Greetings,

I'd like to request a CPAN Author ID.

Name: Gryphon Shafer
Email: gryphon@gryphonshafer.com
Home Page: http://gryphonshafer.com
Preferred Author ID: gryphon (or gryphonshafer if previous is taken)

Initially, I have only one module to contribute: ManagementSpeak. I'm 
going to start an RFP on PerlMonks later today, so perhaps the name will 
change before I get to uploading it to CPAN. It generates grammatically 
correct, managerial-sounding text that means absolutely nothing. It can 
output sentences, paragraphs, and whole documents with embedded 
structure. The goal is to easily provide filler or lorem ipsen content 
that has the potential to pass as real. This module does for geeks what 
lorem ipsen does for designers.

Thanks.

Gryphon
