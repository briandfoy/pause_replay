     why:

    Maintain many Perl programs that should have been contributed many
    years ago including:

    WinReEnCode MP3s (WRECK MP3s) a program that catalogs, identifies
    and batches MP3s for re-encoding

    KAMXbase a module and program that allows the importation of FoxPro
    Dbase files into MySQL with Memo Fields

    CheckTables (will be renamed) a program that allows two MySQL
    databases to be checked for format differences between them. Ideal
    for propagation of code between servers that also rely on database
    format changes.

    I have been learning h2xs and Makefile.PL stuff to begin collecting
    many dozens of projects for public release.
    http://www.peregrinehw.com/downloads/ has examples.
