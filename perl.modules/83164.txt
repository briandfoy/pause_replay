Hi,

 yesterday I tried to update the README file of my module

http://search.cpan.org/~jds/DBIx-Table-TestDataGenerator-0.001/

 since I am about to do a bigger refactoring and wanted to tell something about that in the README. I read that documentation such as README files can be uploaded any time (without needing to put them in a file with a higher version number).

 It seems I did not use the correct target directory, I chose "http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/J/JD/JDS/" since that is where my other uploads ended up. Because of this upload, subdirectories http, wwwcpanorg, authors,... have been created. I tried to delete this upload, and the deletion has been scheduled for Friday.

 I also tried to upload to "." and the README file now sits there on PAUSE, but cannot be uploaded, giving the error message "Could not enter the URL into the database. Reason: Duplicate entry 'JDS-README' for key 2".

 Before I mess up even more I would like to ask you how I can get rid of the superfluous folders and the misplaced README and what to use as target folder for the upload to PAUSE of my README file.

 Thank you very much.

 Best regards
 Jos√©
