MHO, FWIW:

Unfortunately, Devel has a special place in perl's heart: the -d
command-line switch.  I.e. "-d:foo runs the program under the control
of a debugging, profiling, or tracing module installed as Devel::foo."

And besides, this ARM thing sounds too similar to Devel::DProf to
not be placed along side it. 

But if this -d: feature is not expected to be used, then probably 
a Perf top-level is needed.  If a new top-level is going to be
created, it should be broad enough that it doesn't end up
under-populated, as I fear Tune/Tuning would.

(Am I correct in inferring that this ARM module is not specific
to use with DBI?  That was the only context it was given.)
