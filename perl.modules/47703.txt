The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CMS
  DSLIP:       adpOd
  description: Flexible CMS written in pure Perl.
  userid:      STRZELEC (Strzelecki Łukasz)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms, CVS repository

  similar:
    CGIS; Digest::MD5; Module::Load; DBI;

  rationale:

    This module was projected as tool to develop Content Management
    Systems - it's a reason of namespace choice.

    This module assure easy way of creating flexible, objec-oriented
    WWW portals with CMS functionality. All elements
    (menu,banners,login,etc.) are plugins and can be easy added.

    In the module will be included protal based on it (with some
    plugins), which is the best example how to use it.

    At the moment there isn't any module, which can give WWW developers
    such functionality.

The resulting entry would be:

CMS               adpOd Flexible CMS written in pure Perl.           STRZELEC
