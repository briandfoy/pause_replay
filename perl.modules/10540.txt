> 
>     [Sieve is] a language for filtering e-mail messages at time of
>     final delivery. It is designed to be implementable on either a mail
>     client or mail server. It is meant to be extensible, simple, and
>     independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating
>     system. It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may
>     not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box
>     Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as it has no
>     variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external programs.
> 
>     I can't find an implementation in Perl yet, and since my favourite
>     Webmail application, Squirrelmail (yes, I know it's in PHP -
>     http://www.squirrelmail.org/) now comes with a Sieve filter editor,
>     I'd like to be able to use that for filtering my incoming email.
> 
>     I imagine I'll be using Mail::Audit for most of the grunt work, and
>     something else nice for defining the parser - this module will just
>     plug it all together, and come with a 'binary'[tm] which can be
>     called as the delivery agent by your friendly MTA, and will do all
>     the filtering and mailbox creation on the fly.
