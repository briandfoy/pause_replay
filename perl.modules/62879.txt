Hi modules@,

I'm a little sick of typing in explanations of the co-maintenance
assignment process, so I finally spent the ten minutes to write it down
separately. It's just a rough draft, mostly just a brain dump. Does it
cover all important steps and does it convey our intentions and the
reasons for the requirements well? Typos and grammar?

http://steffen-mueller.net/taking_over.txt

If the text is (after revisions) considered acceptable, I'd be more than
happy to see it move over to pause.perl.org/somewhere or any other, more
"official" looking location.

I'll attach the text for convenience.

Best regards,
Steffen

So there's a module on CPAN that has a critical bug, lacks some
features, or is generally under-maintained and you would like to
step in?

It's great that you want to help out and we, the PAUSE admins, really
don't want to create any unnecessary barrier to getting involved with
an existing module (or distribution) on CPAN. There are, however,
some precautions we have to take. The following paragraphs outline the
reason for these precautions and the steps you have to take. Please
read them carefully.

The majority of modules on CPAN has active maintainers. If the
maintainer didn't answer the ticket you created in the request tracker,
maybe she doesn't know about the CPAN ticketing system yet? Or she's
just very busy this week and will get back to you in due time. The best
way of helping out is to talk to the current maintainer about what you
can do. Getting the PAUSE admins involved is only a last resort!

In some circumstances, we can grant co-maintenance permissions to you
or others if the current maintainer of a module has entirely
disappeared. Our most pressing concern is to protect voluntary
contributors like yourself or the author of the module at hand
from any malicious acts. You have to realize that the author has
probably invested a signficiant amount of time into writing the code
in the first place and then gone through the additional work of making
it available to others via CPAN free of charge. Therefore, it is
crucial to be very polite. If you published your code to CPAN, then
went on a hiking vacation (or to hospital) for a couple of weeks only
to see that somebody took over, replaced all credits, and released a
new version, you would rightfully be upset. In order to prevent this
from happening, please go through the following steps and remember to
be polite all along:

1. Try to reach the author via mail. At the very least, try
   PAUSE_ID@cpan.org, any mail address the author listed on his
   search.cpan.org/~PAUSE_ID page, and any mail address that's listed
   in his or her module documentation. If there's even a mailing list,
   don't forget that either.

2. Google for other ways of contacting the author. Send more mail.

3. Use the rt.cpan.org request tracker to submit a bug report. If the
   module's documentation lists another request tracker, try that
   instead.

4. Try posting in public places such as your use.perl.org journal,
   perlmonks.org or other forums about your looking for the author.

5. Wait for *at least* several weeks. Remember, the author might be on
   vacation, ill, or simply busy.

6. Always keep modules@perl.org in the picture. Send us a copy of your
   mails to the author. After a reasonable period of waiting, send
   another mail to the list explaining how you tried to contact the
   author and pointing at the proof thereof.

Usually, after all this hassle, we are reasonably quick at assigning
co-maintenance permissions, but don't hold your breath, we're only
human after all. Most requests won't even get here as many authors
who moved on and don't maintain their modules any more are more than
happy to see them taken care of and will assign (primary or)
co-maintenance permissions after you've tracked them down and asked
nicely.

Good luck and thanks for stepping up.
