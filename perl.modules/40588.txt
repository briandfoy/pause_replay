Subject: Module submission HTML::CheckArgs

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::CheckArgs
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Validates data passed to web applications
  userid:      EFOLLEY (Eric Folley)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    CGI::Validate CGI::Untaint

  rationale:

    This module was developed for use in web applications, but it
    doesn't use the CGI modules. Hence, HTML::CheckArgs.

    While I have used other modules, none of them did exactly what I
    needed. Having spent the last three years doing a lot of validation
    work on a large enterprise website, I wanted something that would do
    everything I needed it to, be extensible in terms of validation
    routines and error reporting, and have an interface that might be
    easier to master than others.

  enteredon:   Tue May 24 23:17:55 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::
::CheckArgs       RdpOp Validates data passed to web applications    EFOLLEY
