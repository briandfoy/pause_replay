I have just subclassed Dave Rolsky's Log::Dispatch::Output with a windows
event log module that provides the windows event log as an output channel.

Dave already has such other subclassed modules as Log::Dispatch::File,
Log::Dispatch::Screen, Log::Dispatch::Syslog and Log::Dispatch::ApacheLog.

My initial naming choice was Log::Dispatch::EventLog, but I'm not sure
whether that is the best choice or whether something under Win32::EventLog
would be better. Although it seems backward to me (Win32::EventLog::Dispatch
or something) because my module is just another channel for Log::Dispatch
outputs - I wanted to check here what you thought?

This is my first CPAN module, sorry if I'm more verbose than is required.
