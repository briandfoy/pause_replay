The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Connector
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: Generic connection to key-value data
  userid:      MRSCOTTY (Scott T. Hardin)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    https://github.com/mrscotty/connector

  similar:
    None. (A _very_ distant cousin might be DBI/DBD)

  rationale:

    The Connector is generic connection to a data set, typically
    configuration data in a hierarchical structure. Each connector
    object accepts the get(KEY) method, which, when given a key, returns
    the associated value from the connector's data source.

    Typically, a connector acts as a proxy to a simple data source like
    YAML, Config::Std, Config::Versioned, or to a more complex data
    source like an LDAP server or Proc::SafeExec. The standard calling
    convention via get(KEY) makes the connectors interchangeable.

    In addition, a set of meta-connectors may be used to combine
    multiple connectors into more complex chains. The Connector::Multi,
    for example, would allow for redirection to delegate connectors via
    symbolic links.

    Regarding the namespace choice: None of the current namespaces
    seemed to fit. The closest cousin seems to be the DBI/DBD stuff,
    which is clearly _not_ the proper place for this module.
    Alternatives we considered were "Data::Connector" and
    "Generic::Connector", but these seemed like poor kludges whose only
    purpose was to avoid the top level namespace. In any case, we're
    open for suggestions.

The resulting entry would be:

Connector         ampOp Generic connection to key-value data         MRSCOTTY
