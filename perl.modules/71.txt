it's high time i got my own PAUSE id.

    Registered developers have a unique username and a home
    directory in the authors/id/ tree of CPAN. The write access
    to that directory is password protected. If you have written
    a module, script, or documentation, if you have some porting
    material or patches you would like to contribute to the
    archive, send the following to the maintainers at
    modules@perl.org

     your name 

meng weng wong

     your email address 

mengwong@pobox.com

     your homepage if you have one 

http://www.mengwong.com/

     your preferred user-ID on CPAN. It must be between 4 and 9 characters long,
     all uppercase, letters only. One dash allowed. 

MENGWONG

     a description of what you're planning to contribute 
     for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry, which is:
     Development stage, Support level, Language used, Interface style (see the
     modulelist), and a 45 character description). 

no modules yet, maybe my Procmail.pm later, and others.  i
wrote most of the software behind pobox.com v1.0, so there
are lots of neat things ready to trickle out to into
GPL-land.  i seem to have preinvented lots of wheels.

     for scripts, ports, documentation, etc. please send a
     concise description that helps us to categorize the
     issue so we can forward your mail to the maintainers of
     the corresponding archive branch.

mp3tocddb, which reads .mp3 files with MPEG::MP3Info and
groks them against CDDB to produce a playlist file.  it
would go under the Audio::MP3 category of the scripts
repository.

grepmaillog, which shows not only what you grepped for but
all other related lines with the same message id.  this
would go under UNIX:System Administration or Mail.

fsbackup, which provides complete network backup management
control.  it is superior to swiss army backup in that you
can make configuration statements like
"somebox:/some/file/system should be backed up with rsync
(or tar.gz) on a weekly basis, so no backup should more than
7 days out of date".  put it on cron and forget about it.
it also deletes out-of-date jobs.
UNIX:system_administration

the systemprofile suite, which produces nice system
statistics charts which you can see at
http://icg.pobox.com/systemprofile/199803/
UNIX:system_administration

fsmail, a teensy interactive command-line mailer.
this would go under Mail.

h15d, a high-availability daemon which responsively brings
up and down virtual interfaces, so you can do a rudimentary
sort of failover for things like web farms.
UNIX:system_administration

the irc-activity suite which you can see at
http://icg.pobox.com/tmp/perl/ graphically tracks irc
activity by person.  probably classified under Web or Irc.

pcdindex, which produces image-gallery slideshows, at
http://www.mengwong.com/photography/little-india/
classified under Web.

textamp, a fullscreen text-mode mp3 player frontend.
classified under Audio::MP3.

     It would be very nice, if you could also send a note
     about where you have discussed some or all parts of
     your contribution publicly, and if there was at least a
     little bit of interest. We are quite open for
     submissions, but we owe our users at least some
     rudimentary quality control. If your work has never
     been discussed publicly, then it's extremely difficult
     for us to make our judgement whether to accept the
     submission or not.

people on #perl can vouch for me.  i have been programming
perl since 1993 and perl5 since 1997 and have been certified
by mjd over beer.
