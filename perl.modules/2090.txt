Subject: Very simple blessed exceptions

I'm thinking of uploading a very simple blessed exceptions class that can
simply store key/value parameters. I'd probably call it
SimpleException.pm. It doesn't try and confuse things with new syntax of
try/catch or anything like that - it simply lets you do:

eval {
	die SimpleException->Error(text => 'Some text');
};
if ($@) {
	if ($@->isa('SimpleException::Error')) {
		print "Simple Error: $@->{text}";
	}
	else {
		print "Uncaught Error: $@";
	}
}

Of course you can overload simple exception to your heart's content. The
most important thing it does is makes sure that $@->isa() works by
overloading CORE::die, and dying with a SimpleException::Uncaught
exception (which overloads "" so that "$@" works). This sort of simple
base class is vital in things like mod_perl where you can have many
applications that use blessed exceptions but you want 1 place where
CORE::die is overloaded providing access to isa() without having first to
check for ref($@).

Of course CORE::die should be overloaded in core perl, as has been
discussed on p5p endlessly with no results yet... And I also know of
several other efforts for exception handling, but they all try and do a
lot, whereas I'm trying to do a little and let the programmer do whatever
he wants on top of that.

Thoughts?
