     why:

    I have a module I have been using which quickens both implementing
    and using OO modules, and it's been refined enough to where I think
    it might be worthy of CPAN. It's vaguely inspired by Ruby and
    vaguely similar to the autobox pragma, but uses no source-code
    filter or tampering with Perl internals, so it can be installed with
    no headaches. Classes implemented via this module have special
    export mechanisms and automate some tasks, such as creating accessor
    methods for attributes. They export subs "as" and "obj" for
    autobox-like user code like this:

    'C:/myfolder/log.txt'.as FileObject; ("Hello World!".obj)->match
    ('(?:\A|(?<=\s))\S+(?:(?=\s)|\Z)');

    where those "."s are overload operators. I also have a related
    module (which does use Filter::Simple) that duplicates certain
    functionality (e.g., subroutines) across multiple packages in one
    file, making the above-mentioned implementation shortcuts easier for
    classes with subclasses.
