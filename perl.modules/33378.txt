Hi,

I've (NEDKONZ) been maintaining Algorithm::Diff for some time now, having 
taken it over from Mark-Jason Dominus (MJD).

Now I'd like to add Tye McQueen (TYEMQ) as a co-maintainer (or maybe changing 
it to him altogether, if he's willing).

But there is no primary maintainer of the package! Both MJD and I are listed 
as "co-maint".

Could you change my status to the primary maintainer so I can add TYEMQ and/or 
give it to him?

Thanks,
