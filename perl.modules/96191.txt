I concur with this sentiment.  I have contributed code lately, but as
pointed out by Riba upthread a lot of it is blocked:

I know a bunch of the the pending changes are not ready to merge (or
"sub-par" if you will); this is because I haven't had the motivation to
put more work into them beyond the initial prototype/proof-of-concept,
either because of vague review feedback or statements that the
underlying code was being rewritten, but with no public work-in-progress
branch for said rewrite.

Ditto.

Ditto.  I realise that fostering community involvement requires that the
people who are intimately familiar with the codebase spend more time
giving constructive review feedback on contributions and mentoring new
contributors.  This can be frustrating in terms of short-term progress,
but I strongly believe it's better for the long-term health of the
project.
