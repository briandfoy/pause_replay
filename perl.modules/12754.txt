Dear "modules@perl.org":

I've been working on extensions to GD that provide a new object -- 
GD::Polyline -- as well as a host of new methods on GD::Polygon, most 
notably the creation of cublic splines to polygons and polylines.  I've 
been discussing my work with Lincoln Stein (GD's author); he has 
expressed interest in the work and excitement at the preliminary API.  I 
will be sending off the near-final module and sample code to him soon 
for his comment.

Anyway, this will be my first upload to PAUSE.  I have a host of 
questions and really could use a pointer to anything like "Official 
Instructions", an FAQ for First Time Pausers, or just a kindly 
mentor/guru/penpal to discuss some of my questions.  Below are a couple 
of points and specific questions that may help you send me the right 
pointers.

THANK YOU for your time and patience.

=================================================================


- My module is currently dubbed GD::Polyline and I look for your 
"blessing" on using this name.

- I'm a very experienced Perl programmer, but have never quite figured 
out Makemaker, and other incantations to prepare a module for 
distribution like others I download from CPAN.  Do I .zip the files? TAR 
the files?

- The module is pure Perl (Although I develop on Windows under ASPerl 
5.6.1, I expect it to run elsewhere without a hitch.  But it has not 
been run under other platforms/Perl versions.)

- I have rather complete POD in my module; when installed by folks like 
me (with AS Perl), what do I need to do as module developer to get the 
HTML docs placed in the "right place" for the ActiveState Perl 
"Documentation" link to "see" the HTML docs?

- I have an example script to demonstrate the use of the module.  It 
generates several PNGs and an HTML file to display them all, with notes. 
  Any special steps to include a plain .pl file in the release?

- What are files are considered de rigeur in a CPAN upload?  README? 
CHANGE log?
