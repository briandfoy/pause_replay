The following paragraph is in the docs:

   See also Tie::IxHash by Gurusamy Sarathy.  It's similar (it also does
   ordered hashes), but it has a different internal data structure and a
   different flavor of usage.  It makes your hash behave more like a list
   than this does.  This module keeps more of the hash flavor.

I agree, I could add more detail about what the differences are.  I'll
do that now.
