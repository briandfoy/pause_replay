Your link is to search.cpan.org, a closed source application which is no
more official than metacpan is. Please don't refer to that as CPAN; it
isn't.

I'm suspecting that metacpan fails because you put the TRIAL after a .
rather than the Module-Name-1.234-TRIAL format that every other trial dist
I've seen uses, but I don't think that's your fault.

Assuming your distribution hasn't been indexed by PAUSE itself, then "CPAN"
so far as it exists is fine, and you just need to file a bug against
metacpan to get it to keep track as well.
