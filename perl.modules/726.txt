MODULE:
Name           DSLI     Description
TUXEDO         adcO     A PERL interface into TUXEDO.

I have discussed this module on the tuxedo newsgroup.  It was in response to 
a query asking about a TUXEDO perl module availability.  I also required 
this module, found out that it didn't exist and decided to write it.  Since 
then I've been contacted by another person also interested in the module.

It could be catagorised as MIDDLEWARE which doesn't exist as a catagory 
within CPAN at the moment.  In other words, it definitely doesn't belong in 
any other module that already exists.

Regards,

Anthony
