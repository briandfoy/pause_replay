I've just finished a module which allows users to generate and
validate hashcash tokens.

Hashcash tokens are bitstreams which are hard to calculate, but
easy to verify, and are therefore proof that the generator 
performed a certain amount of CPU work, and have been proposed
as a solution to spamming. More on this webpage
http://www.cypherspace.org/~adam/hashcash/

Digest::HashCash  doesn't seem to be a good place, because it's
not performing a digest

Crypt::HashCash same problem, it's not doing crypto

Mail::HashCash would work, except I can see non-mail releated uses.

Hash::HashCash seems to be the least bad fit then.

Any suggestions?
