Subject: Module submission Sub::ReasonableParams

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sub::ReasonableParams
  DSLIP:       Rmpnp
  description: Simple subroutine signatures
  userid:      JHELWIG (Jacob Helwig)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    http://lists.technosorcery.net/listinfo.cgi/sub-reasonableparams-technosorcery.net

  similar:
    Perl6::Parameters Sub::Signatures Perl6::Subs Method::Signatures

  rationale:

    Sub::ReasonableParams is taken from internal code that has been
    used for several years by my employer, and is being released to CPAN
    with their permission.

    Drawbacks of existing modules on CPAN over Sub::ReasonableParams
    follow:

    Method::Signatures - Requires special "method" keyword, instead of
    standard "sub".

    Perl6::Parameters - "sub foo(ARRAY $foo)" with "foo(1,2,3)" turns
    "1,2,3" into an arrayref, instead of making sure that "foo([1,2,3])"
    was called. "sub foo(Some::Thing $foo)" does nothing, instead of
    making sure that $foo is a Some::Thing.

    Perl6::Subs - "Do not use parameter names that turn into Perl
    quoting operators when their sigils are stripped". Optional
    parameters and @ or % cannot be combined.

    Sub::Signatures - All arguments must be scalars % and @ are not
    allowed. Optional parameters require multiple sub definitions.

The resulting entry would be:

Sub::
::ReasonableParams Rmpnp Simple subroutine signatures                 JHELWIG
