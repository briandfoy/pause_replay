The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Proxy::Lite
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Simple, lightweight object proxies
  userid:      NKUITSE (Paul Hoffman)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Class::Proxy Class::Flyweight

  rationale:

    Class::Proxy::Lite is lightweight, avoids storing target object
    references, and only defines one method (AUTOLOAD). The emphasis is
    on simplicity, unobtrusiveness, and dynamic behavior.

    From the README:

    All methods are delegated to a target object, but no reference to
    the target object is kept. Instead, a user-supplied token (any kind
    of data) and resolver (a function to convert the token into an
    object reference) are used to identify the target object each time a
    method is called on the proxy.

    Class::Flyweight is not in CPAN but is described at
    http://perlmonks.thepen.com/94783.html. A PAUSE registration message
    is at http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg07964.html.

  enteredby:   NKUITSE (Paul Hoffman)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 29 01:57:44 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::Proxy::
::Lite            RdpOp Simple, lightweight object proxies           NKUITSE
