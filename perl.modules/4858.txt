Looking at the distributions, I am at a loss to explain why
search.cpan.org indexed the first release.

This is because search.cpan.org should only index distributions
that unpack as expected. ie into a directory of their own.

These two unpack into multiple files in the current directory, this
is very annoying to many people.

However it does seem that you have used MakeMaker as there is a
Makefile.PL in the distribution.

I would suggest you make a distribution by running

  make dist

in your development directory and upload the file that is created.
search.cpan.org will then correctly index the distribution.
