Even with a mechanism, you'd have to get people to use it. I, for
instance, wouldn't go back to change all of my modules right away, and
*might* remember to change the Makefile.PL the next time I had to
update the module.  I still might not do it because I really don't
trust cpan-testers to understand it, so I'd wait a while to see what
happens to other people who convert their stuff.

Still, after all that, it would be a nice feature.
