Given that Malcolm hasn't uploaded anything for 2 1/2 years and that I
haven't heard anything from him for about that time and that you
already have uploaded 4 well respected releases for the two namespaces
(Thanks!), I'd say it is justified to make you co-maint without any
further action and delay. I'm pretty sure, Malcolm will welcome this
decision.

Done! You can either schedule re-indexing or uploaded a fresh package
to see the change in effect.
