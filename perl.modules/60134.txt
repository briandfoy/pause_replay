The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Unaccent::PurePerl
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: remove accents from characters
  userid:      PJACKLAM (Peter John Acklam)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Unaccent

  rationale:

    This module is a pure Perl equivalent of Text::Unaccent, but with
    the extension that my module handles Perl strings properly, whereas
    Text::Unaccent only handles strings of octets with an associated
    encoding. In other words, this module handles transparently what
    otherwise must be done by a combination of the modules
    Text::Unaccent and Encode.

    In addition, as the name suggests, it does not require a C
    compiler. On the other hand, it isn't as fast as the C compiled
    Text::Unaccent.

  enteredby:   PJACKLAM (Peter John Acklam)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 20 10:05:00 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::Unaccent::
::PurePerl        bdpfp remove accents from characters               PJACKLAM
