The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Interface
  DSLIP:       RdpOd
  description: interfaces & abstracts in perl
  userid:      SINISTER (Hartog de Mik)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    interfaces, Class::Contract

  rationale:

    ... tim towdy?

    I am aware of the presence of 'Class::Contract' and 'interface'.
    And are particulary charmed by the ease-of-use of the latter.
    However it lacks some insight. Thus I ecided to write my own;
    largely based on the principles of 'interfaces'

    I choose not to use an import method (as does interfaces'). Mainly
    because I wanted to be able to distinctly show others what they are
    dealing with (An interface or an implementation). Second to that I
    wanted to be able to create abstract interfaces within the same
    code. Abstracts are interfaces 2...

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Interface       RdpOd interfaces & abstracts in perl               SINISTER
