     why:

    I've written a module that parses fetchmailrc -style run control
    files. I also have some other bits in the pipeline (for management
    of the Exim MTA, to which I am a contributor), and thought it about
    time I began putting my stuff into the CPAN :-)

    My department (See email address) would also like to contribute
    those reusable parts of a new DNS/DHCP/etc management system we are
    developing.
