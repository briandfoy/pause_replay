Just because you could also stream video with it doesn't make it a
vdeo-only module. Besides, it is highly linux-specific.

Video::Capture::V4l (the name was wrong, sorry) is indeed also a misnomer
in my opinion, but not as much, because even though it also supports data
services it will decode this data out of the video stream, so video is
always involved, unlike DVB, where you can have data-only transponders and
streams that have nothing to do with video (or audio).

Some of the functionality, such as SI-decoding, are linux-independent, so one
could also imagine the following structure:

   DVB::Linux
   DVB::Decode::SI

and so on, but my plans for the module do not include making it that large
in the future. It's more or less a quick hack that allows people to read
and sometimes decode DVB streams using the Linux-DVB API.

Well, exceptions such this case exist.

I don't think such things exist, except in vmware. Besides, "linux
compatbility mode" exists solely for the purpose of running linux-specific
programs, so even if there were emulations for the linux-dvb interface the
name would be correct, also, as it simpy says "linux is required".

It would not run, for example, on freebsd even if it's linux emulation
layer would support the dvb driver api.

This hasn't happened in the past with os-specific interfaces, so it's not
likely to happen in the future.
