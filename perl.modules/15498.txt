The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::ApacheFormat
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: use Apache format config files
  userid:      SAMTREGAR (Sam Tregar)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    Apache::ConfigFile, Apache::ConfigParser

  rationale:

    There are at least two other modules on CPAN that perform a similar
    function to this one, L<Apache::ConfigFile|Apache::ConfigFile> and
    L<Apache::ConfigParser|Apache::ConfigParser>. Although both are
    close to what I need, neither is totally satisfactory.

    Apache::ConfigFile suffers from a complete lack of tests and a
    rather clumsy API. Also, it doesn't support quoted strings
    correctly.

    Apache::ConfigParser comes closer to my needs, but contains code
    specific to parsing actual Apache configuration files. As such it is
    unsuitable to parsing an application configuration file in Apache
    format. Unlike Apache::ConfigFile, Apache::ConfigParser lacks
    support for Include.

    Additionally, neither module supports directive inheritence within
    blocks. As this is the main benefit of Apache's block syntax I
    decided I couldn't live without it.

    In general, I see no problem with reinventing the wheel as long as
    you're sure your version will really be better. I believe this is,
    at least for my purposes.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::ApacheFormat    RdpOp use Apache format config files               SAMTREGAR
