short description of what you're planning to contribute: 
Apache perl modules. Two already have been written.

The first is a Web File Manager module that can be invoked directly 
through a PerlContentHandler or via an OO interface. It provides file 
manipulation tools such as copy, cut, delete, rename, extract, new 
directory, uploading, and syncing with a production server. All file 
manipulations are done via perl interfaces so it isn't OS specific.

The second is a generic record-set class that makes it very easy 
to write web database applications. The class is very useful in that it 
enables users to see a customized view of their data and then view it in 
different styles.
