G'day everyone,

I've developed a lot of code for implementing the Ranked Pairs voting system
as described on wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_Pairs .
I'd like to bundle up the relevant parts of this for CPAN, but I really have
no idea what it should be called.  CPAN doesn't have much in the way of
voting modules, and those that do exist seem to be mostly about collecting
or displaying votes.  The closest module I can find to what I'm planning is
Statistics::RankOrder .

I feel the module-name should end with ::Condorcet::RankedPairs, to allow
for the inclusion of other Condorcet[1] voting systems into CPAN.  What goes
before that, I don't know.  Vote::Condorcet::RankedPairs would introduce a
new top-level namespace.  Statistics::Vote::Condorcet::RankedPairs may be
suitable.

Any advice would be very much appreciated.

Cheerio,

	Paul
