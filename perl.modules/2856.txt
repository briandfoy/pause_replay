I'm not sure, but I may already have a registration (but if so I'm =
afraid I've lost all the details).
I'd like to register though as I've written a module which is being used =
a lot by Perl developers via its homepage, and I'd like to get it on =
CPAN to reach a wider audience.

My Details :

Name :		Ian Steel
Email :		ian@bilstone.co.uk
HomePage :	http://freeweb.ftech.net/bilstone/parser.html
Pref. UserID:	isteel
Contribution:	HTMLTMPL.pm - It's a module which merges data from cgi =
scripts with a Template. This allows
		The htnl to be kept outside of the perl. It is similar to FastTemplate =
but more flexible as it allows
		The repeating parts of the page (table rows, etc) to remain within the =
single web page.
DSLI:		RdpO (Merges data into HTML templates)

Some user feedback I've received via email :

You module kicks some serious ass.  I really appreciate the work you =
have done on this.  I just started contemplating writing something =
similar but decided to check cpan.org first.  I guess it pays to be =
lazy, because your module does everything I wanted to do and more =
(without me doing a thing!) Within minutes of installing it I was able =
to convert gobs of ugly perl code into nicBe templates!
This module gets locked away in my bag of trick for sure.   I will =
definitely recommend it to anyone who does dbase/web programming. =20
Thank you!


Hi
It=B4s just to say I=B4m using your HTMLTMPL perl module.
It=B4s great. It works fine. Good idea: simpe and and very useful.
Thank you for making public your work.
