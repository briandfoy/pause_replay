Hi Matt

This is actually the third time I've made this offer (the second one is
below).  Maybe my messages are falling foul of your spam filters or
maybe your replies are falling foul of mine.

I am very keen to see a bug-fix release for XML::SAX(::PurePerl).  So
keen that I'm happy to take over maintenance or co-maintainership of the
module.  If you're OK with that, then we'll need to work
out the mechanics of source control access.  The two most obvious
options would either be for you to grant me commit access to the current
CVS or for me to move it into the perl-xml sourceforge svn repo.

Cheers
Grant
