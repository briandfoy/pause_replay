I never got any response. Today I happened to notice that
the 01mailrc.txt file has a very strange address for me:

  alias ELIJAH     "eli+cpan@panix.com <Benjamin Elijah Griffin>"

Instead of a more reasonable:

  alias ELIJAH     "Benjamin Elijah Griffin <eli+cpan@panix.com>"

Perhaps this is why I never got my password?
