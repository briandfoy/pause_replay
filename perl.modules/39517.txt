The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Number::Phone::IE
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Ireland-specific methods for Number::Phone
  userid:      DERMOT (Dermot McNally)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Number::Phone

  rationale:

    My namespace choice is based on the corresponding
    Number::Phone::<various> modules that already subclass
    Number::Phone, in particular Number::Phone::UK by the author of the
    base class. I have been in contact with him, and we are not aware of
    anybody else providing Irish phone number support. A crop of similar
    modules for other countries is already coming onstream.

  enteredby:   DERMOT (Dermot McNally)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr  7 17:48:36 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Number::Phone::
::IE              bdpOp Ireland-specific methods for Number::Phone   DERMOT
