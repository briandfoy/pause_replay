* a short description of what you're planning to contribute

I have completed 2 modules lately

MasonX::SB is an extension to HTML::Mason.  Information can be
found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/statusboard/

Date::DayOfNthWeek is a small module for calculating if today is the
nth of the first,last or nth Week of the month (ie is today the 3rd
Wed of the month?)

In addition:

CGI::WML is a module I co authored with Angus Wood.  The module needs
to be updated and I have been unable to contact Angus for over a
year.  I would like permission to update and post changes to the
module.


Thank you

Andy
