Hi Chris, Lincoln,

I just uploaded MP3::ID3v1Tag 1.08 to PAUSE. The more I think about this
name space issue, it seems that the ID3v2Tag module is intended for more
then the MP3 audio format. So it might not make sense to move it. (Although
having it under MPEG video isn't right. We might need an Audio::MPEG section,
but this was already turned down on the modules@perl.org list in february).

At the same time though, Napster is now mainly used for MP3s, but there is
no real reason it can not be used for anything else.

I am sure Matt, will make his own decision for his module, but I do feel that
MP3 is better then MPEG Video.

Also, I was wondering if it might make sense to add these modules with the
new Bundle::MP3

Cheers,
