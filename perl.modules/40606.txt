There are thousands of horse owners each year trying to buy, sell, or train their horses. In most cases it requires a lot of energy and in most cases it takes 18 months or longer to make some progress. 
Wouldn’t it be useful for you to get support in your process, to learn from the masters, and navigate through the process of buying and selling horses with ease?
      
If you are interested in finding the perfect buyer for your horse, we provide detailed information collected from the masters in their field: you will discover how to sell your horse... what approach best applies for your online/offline horse marketing strategy... what specific actions to take to line up motivated buyers… and more. Check out the two books of the first professional horse trainer to turn the horse sales process into a 21-day system. Go to www.horsesalespower.com.
       
Best of all, if you are tired of touring around for months and years without finding your close-to-perfect horse, reserve your space for a German Sport Horse Shopping tour. The Athens Olympics show that the best Sport Horses in the World are bred in Northern Germany. Take advantage of our special guided Sport Horse Shopping Tour in Northern Germany. Terms and conditions apply. For more details, GO TO www.travelbuyhorse.com.  If you decide not to book a tour reservation at this time, I will send you "101 HORSE BUYING SECRETS" just for checking out the site. You will be required to complete the form and the secrets will then be sent to you via instant e-mail to your in-box.
      
Please visit www.travelbuyhorse.com to list your requirements with our travel service free of charge, and you will be on your way to be connected to the World’s Best Sources of Quality Sport Horses.
       
Please list with us only if you want the best for your current or future horse(s).  Your listing will be declined otherwise. As I have reached you directly however, I apologize in advance if I have misunderstood your website.
      
I hope that you choose to join our service.  If you have any questions or require assistance buying, training or selling horses, don’t hesitate to email me directly at jorg@TravelBuyHorse.com.
