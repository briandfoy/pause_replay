print the text response to STDOUT. 
*	this is not a module
*	  A
special-purpose simple script (a web robot) that looks up a word from
Merriam-Webster site.  This script only uses Socket and no other modules or
packages, and it demonstrates the use of POST method to submit a FORM.
However, the specific use of this script is limited to talking to
www.m-w.com, and the fact that many parameters are hard-coded makes it
dependent on the stability of that web site. Nonetheless, since everything
is explicitly written, it is very easy to manually change those hard-coded
strings
*	 I have let my
friends use it on their UNIX machines and they enjoyed using it, since it
takes no time to run, compared with using Explorer or Navigator just to go
to Webster's web site. I think it could be useful for other non-English
native speakers. So far as debugging is concerned, it is my sole
responsibility. After all, there is very little interest in debugging other
people's code, especially if it is not work-related.
