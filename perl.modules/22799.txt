Earlier I poked RBS on this, and he transferred ownership of all 
File::Spec::* namespaces to me - but for File::Spec itself he was 
apparently denied permission to do so.  Now it looks like those 
transfers didn't stick either.

Maybe we need to call on the Koenig?

Or maybe it needs to reindex now that the ownership transfer has 
happened?
