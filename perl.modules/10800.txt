I am working on two contributions:

1. A _simple_ module for manipulating MARC records:
MARC::Simple.pm
This is an easy to use alternative to the very complex MARC.pm.

2. A _simple_ module for reading and writing CGI forms:
CGI::EZForm.pm
(Yes, yet another CGI forms module -- but this will have
features which distinguish it from all the others.)
