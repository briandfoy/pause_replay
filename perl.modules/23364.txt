The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Shares::Function
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Base class for all line/function classes
  userid:      CPWILLMOT (Christopher Willmot)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Finance::Shares::Model Finance::Shares::Line

  rationale:

    Finance::Shares has migrated from a toolbox to an engine for
    generating models, and the way graph lines are used is quite
    different from version 0.

    A model is run from a 'model specification' which includes user
    perl code as a central part. This code access various specialist
    functions which normally generate one or more graph lines.

    Finance::Shares::Function is the base class for these auxilliary
    functions. There are about 20 already, but I see no need to register
    them all. They are more 'user data' than 'system'.

    Finance::Shares::Line is the class implementing the graph line(s)
    created by Finance::Shares::Function, providing data for the code
    fragments.

  enteredby:   CPWILLMOT (Christopher Willmot)

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Shares::
::Function        adpOp Base class for all line/function classes     CPWILLMOT
