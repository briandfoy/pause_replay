The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::MPD
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Class for talking to MPD (Music Player Daemo
  userid:      NJH (Nicholas J Humfrey)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.musicpd.org/forum/ and
    http://www.musicpd.org/MPD-pm.shtml

  similar:

  rationale:

    Audio::MPD is a perl module for interfacing MPD (Music Player
    Daemon). It wasn't previously in CPAN - but I am adding it now
    because it has been documented and cleaned up.

  enteredby:   NJH (Nicholas J Humfrey)
  enteredon:   Mon Sep 26 20:58:06 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::
::MPD             RdpOg Class for talking to MPD (Music Player Daemo NJH
