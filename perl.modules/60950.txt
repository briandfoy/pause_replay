The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::AMQP
  DSLIP:       idhOp
  description: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol interface
  userid:      RYBSKEJ (Eric Rybski)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Having been unable to find any Perl interfaces for AMQP
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol) on
    CPAN or elsewhere on the internet, I have been working on a Perl XS
    interface to the OpenAMP WireAPI client library
    (http://www.openamq.org/wireapi.html), which is currently compliant
    with the AMQP/0.9 specification
    (http://jira.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/Download).

    My intent is to implement a standard AMQP programming model with a
    Perl object-oriented interface, using the WireAPI interface as the
    primary protocol backend interface. Since AMQP is a standard
    protocol, the generic namespace prefix Net:: seems appropriate.
    (OpenAMQ::WireAPI was my first idea, but seemed too restrictive
    since WireAPI is functionally a standard AMQP/0.9 client API.)

    I may also pursue development of a pure-Perl implementation in this
    distribution after the WireAPI implementation is complete, as time
    permits.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::AMQP            idhOp Advanced Message Queuing Protocol interface  RYBSKEJ
