It's certainly a hyrbrid at best. Both Set::Array and my module DO do 
set operations (for example, there are methods named difference, 
intersection, union, etc. which definitely do set operations; but there 
are other operations which treat the array as a traditional list).

So, Array::AsObject works fine for me.  I'll go ahead and register that.
