The key case I can see as an advantage is if somebody is happy to put
together a release now but doesn't want to take ownership beyond handling
any bugs that directly result from that release.

I see this a fair bit, and I'm not sure we really have a process for
"willing to be one time release manager, would also like to see the dist
flagged so if somebody wants to adopt it long term they can do so" yet,
and this seems the closest to such a process that's yet been proposed.
