The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PerlTalk
  DSLIP:       adphp
  description: Objective-C syntax parser and runtime
  userid:      EIDOLA (Paige Marie DePol)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    None as yet, currently being developed

  similar:
    Objective-Perl

  rationale:

    I chose the name PerlTalk as a homage to SmallTalk, even though the
    source used is more like Objective-C.

    There is already a package called Objective-Perl, which did provide
    some inspiration, however, it was easier to start from scratch
    versus correcting the existing project... which was also around 4
    years stale.

    I will also be building a PerlTalk interface called WebTalk, so
    will eventually be requesting that namespace as well.

    I hope to have something to publish soon, and wanted to get this
    request in officially so the namespace could be reserved.

    The PerlTalk system is a source code parser which converts
    Objective-C style syntax, which other then the addition of new
    directives the syntax is virtually identical, along with a
    message-passing runtime.

    The system currently supports objects for the three basic perl
    datatypes (scalar, array, hash) along with the ability to create
    subclasses, like for example PTInt, which forces all values assigned
    to it to be numeric.

    Since I am requesting a new root level namespace my justification
    is that new PerlTalk modules can live under PerlTalk:: instead of
    other namespaces.

    This would help keep all the PerlTalk modules related, especially
    since the system itself only reserves a handful of sub-namespaces.

    Thank you for your time, and if you have any questions please do
    not hesitate to ask... I look forward to releasing my module on CPAN
    in the near future. :)
