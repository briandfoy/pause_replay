The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HoneyClient
  DSLIP:       bdphg
  description: Framework for detecting client-side attacks
  userid:      MITREHC (MITRE HoneyClient Project)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    http://www.honeyclient.org/trac

  similar:

  rationale:

    A 'honeypot' is designed to detect server-side attacks. See:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_%28computing%29

    In contrast, a 'honeyclient' is designed to detect client-side
    attacks. Specifically, a honeyclient is a dedicated host that drives
    specially instrumented applications to access remote servers to see
    if those servers are behaving in a malicious manner. Specifically,
    honeyclients can proactively detect exploits against client
    applications without known signatures.

    We have developed this framework in Perl, using a client-server
    model with SOAP messaging as the primary communications. We use the
    free version of VMware Server, as a means of virtualizing the client
    environment.

    For a complete overview of the framework, see:
    http://www.honeyclient.org/trac/wiki/Definitions

  enteredby:   MITREHC (MITRE HoneyClient Project)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul 26 19:48:54 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

HoneyClient       bdphg Framework for detecting client-side attacks  MITREHC
