Subject: Namespace for RULI Perl module?
To: modules@perl.org
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

Hi,

I'm providing a Perl binding for RULI:

  RULI stands for Resolver User Layer Interface.
  It's a library built on top of an asynchronous
  DNS stub resolver. RULI provides an easy-to-use
  interface for querying DNS SRV resource records.
  The main goal is to promote deployment of
  SRV-cognizant programs. RULI aims to automatically
  perform all the SRV logic described by RFC 2782,
  and to comply with related specifications. As a
  side-effect, RULI also provides a general-purpose,
  event-driven, asynchronous, stub DNS resolver.

Detailed info available at:

  http://www.nongnu.org/ruli/

Currently, there are only these methods for Perl:

  use RULI;

  $srv_list_ref = RULI::ruli_sync_query($service,
$domain, -1, 0);

  $srv_list_ref = RULI::ruli_sync_smtp_query($domain,
0);

I'm searching a proper name space for this module.

Please advise.

Thanks,
Everton
