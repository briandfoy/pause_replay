Preferably, those two classes should be under the same namespace.

It would be a good idea to add "my" to the synposis, so as to make it
"use strict;"/"use warnings;"-compliant.

I would suggest against contacting remote sites by default, due to
the "Test programs should not connect to Internet resources" item here:
