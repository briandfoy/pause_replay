Hi modules@,

Jean-Marc's mail addresses all bounced. RT tickets have been filed a 
long while ago. I haven't found any other address via google. 
Suggestions on how to proceed? Any further contact information?

The distribution is under perl's license, so I presume we can roll a 
bug-fix release? Adam: Perhaps we can add this to your 
SVN-repository-of-homeless-modules?

Steffen
