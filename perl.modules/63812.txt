The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Xcruciate
  DSLIP:       bdpfb
  description: Libraries for Xcruciate
  userid:      MELONMAN (Mark Howe)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    Swapped an email via modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Xcruciate is a soon-to-be-open-source project that turns XSLT into
    a virtual machine for realtime XML processing. The project includes
    an http interface and daemon management tools written in perl. This
    namespace will be used for the library functions used in various
    Xcruciate scripts, eg config file unpicking, process management. The
    Xcruciate project has been designed with extension in mind, so third
    parties may well want to use these libraries to construct their own
    interfaces (say a JSON gateway).

    That's fine with me, (although, for example, Net::Server isn't an
    implementation of a network protocol). In practice there will be
    several modules under whatever namespace we choose (so, eg,
    Xcruciate::Xteriorize).

    I'll go with Xcruciate as a rootlevel namespace in a week or so
    unless I hear otherwise.

    Cheers,
