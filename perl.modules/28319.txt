The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Wildcard
  DSLIP:       idphp
  description: Enhanced globbing and filename expansion
  userid:      IVORW (Ivor Williams)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    vmsperl@perl.org, london.pm@london.pm.org

  similar:
    File::Find, File::Find::Rule, File::Path::Expand, File::VMSVersions,
    File::List, File::Glob, File::DosGlob

  rationale:

    This module takes a syntax from VMS called the elliptic directory
    wildcard, and makes the equivalent available across all platforms.

    On a VMS system, you can specify a wildcard directory such as
    PERL_ROOT:[LIB...]*.PM

    I am proposing the equivalent, which although not part of the POSIX
    standard is consistent with it:

    lib///*.pm /usr/local/lib/perl_5.8.3///*.pm

    It also aims to include a means of parsing out the version number,
    which will be ignored for all platforms that do not support it (i.e.
    non-VMS).

    Interface is OO, or via an exported glob method.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::Wildcard        idphp Enhanced globbing and filename expansion     IVORW
