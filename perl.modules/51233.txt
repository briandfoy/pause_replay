And I agree with you. But note that CPAN is not that sort of repository.

CPAN provides a canonical source repository across EVERY platform.

If the things that an application needs to do can all be supported 
inside of the CPAN installation capabilities (like File::ShareDir and 
File::HomeDir and various other things) then it gives you a canonical 
installation source.

 From there, platform-specific binary builds/installers can be produced 
for specific platforms that localize the build and installation process 
to a single operating system.

But what CPAN does is provide a single canonical point of origin that 
works on all platforms, as a base for fully or semi-automatically 
converting it to a binary package.

If an application needs significant things beyond what the CPAN 
installation tools are capable of, sure it doesn't belong in CPAN.

But platform specific installers should exist in addition to the main 
CPAN source install.

And I agree with Brian though, while I personally care about having code 
in the CPAN first, and binary packages second, it shouldn't be the 
official policy of the PAUSE admins.
