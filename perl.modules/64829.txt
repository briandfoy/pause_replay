(Clearly) I don't have the time to maintain Net::SSH2 any more.  I'd
like to get to the bug queue some day, but as we all know a personal
itch is a big reason to write and maintain a module, and that's not
really there any more: I don't use the module personally or
professionally and haven't for a while.

School, work, other projects, and family edged out Net::SSH2. I was
almost at the point of posting to modules@ to ask for volunteers anyway.
I hope the module is in good hands, and I'll stay as co-maintainer in
case I ever get time to work on it. As the above (#takeover) link says,
please don't fix elements that aren't broken.

I would have appreciated a request for co-maintainership to me rather
than going to the admins first: I realize I was mailed about the 5.10
issue, but I wasn't mailed about co-maint. At this time I have no
objections to Rafael being added as co-maintainer. I'd like to see the
next version before it is released if possible.

Thank you,
