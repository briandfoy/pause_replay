The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::MakeMethods
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Generate common types of methods
  userid:      EVO (M, Simon Cavalletto)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    Prior posts to modules list and comp.lang.perl.modules.

  similar:
    Class::MethodMaker

  rationale:

    When &quot;use&quot;d by another class, this module generates
    common types of methods on demand, using closures and simple stash
    manipulation.

    This is essentially a re-write of Class::MethodMaker. Two dozen
    subclasses are included, with hundreds of types of available
    methods.

    I've spoken to the maintainer of Class::MethodMaker, and confirmed
    that he doesn't have an objection to the way this distribution is
    named.

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::MakeMethods     bdpOp Generate common types of methods             EVO
