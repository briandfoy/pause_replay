Now that you mention it, no, not really.  It could be modified to accept
input via an array or scalar value.  Currently a call to it might look like
this:

>it should go under IO:: instead.
It just reads streams and files right now because I wanted to use it as a
command line file processor.  I was doing a lot of piping and wanted a
middle-man to reformat the text stream inline.
>Does it do anything besides reorder fields?
It does anything you can use a regexp and an eval'd string to do.  Imagine
the following:
A single line of input is:  bob|1234|jane\n
You provide the following to fieldmapper:
Regexp: /^(.+)|(.+)|(.+)$/
Eval string:  $3|$1|$2\n
When Fieldmapper is done, you have this:  Sally|Bob|1234\n
You can also provide CODE refs instead of either the regexp or eval in order
to do more complex stuff.  So it's really an input processor, rather than a
simple ReorderFields.
Does this expanded explanation bring any good names to mind?  Namespaces?
IO:: might not be a bad idea considering my current usage of the module.
Also, does this thing sound too simple to warrant including it in CPAN?  I'm
rather fond of simple modules that do one thing and do it well, but others
might think it's not worth the trouble...
