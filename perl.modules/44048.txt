Hi Kane,

by accident I just saw your DBIx::Simple::OO. I like it.

It is somewhat disappointing, though, that you didn't discuss this with
me. I know that I can't claim control over a CPAN namespace, and that
you like to use the openness of CPAN to your advantage, but I am
convinced that we could reach a better product if we work together. And
we could have begun to work together much sooner if you had communicated
your thoughts.

Specifically, I'd like to somehow use your module automatically.

DBIx::Simple uses all sorts of modules when they are needed, cutting
dramatically in the number of use|require statements the user needs to
type and think about.

Because your current implementation simply injects methods into
DBIx::Simple::Result, I'd have to replace the called method and call it
again, which I think is a very ugly thing to do.

Would it be a problem for you to keep the methods in your own namespace,
so that I can release a new DBIx::Simple, that has the "object" and
"objects" methods already there, loading your module and calling your
methods?

I believe the performance overhead would be entirely negligible, but we
could even throw in a goto if needed.


Regards,

Juerd
