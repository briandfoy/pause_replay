     why:

    A good friend and I have written a couple of modules that
    streamline interaction with various CLI based devices, making it
    very trivial to write scripts that interact with, for example,
    network devices in a very general way. Much of our work leverages
    Expect.pm and other modules to make a very simple interface for
    writing both quick and involved scripts (manipulating multiple
    devices at once if desired). These libraries are very generic and
    should be useful to a broad audience. We have used them across a
    number of differentvendor products, anything that has some form of
    CLI could be automated/manipulated. You can access the CLI via
    various mechanisms (console, ssh, telnet, or running arbitrary
    commands that "get you there" e.g. tunneling connections as needed.)

    I have also implemented a much enhanced "autoexpect" module, but
    for perl!

    ..and many more network/security/system admin tools to come.

    Thanks, Brian Dowling
