The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::OSCAR
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: AOL Instant Messenger OSCAR protocol
  userid:      MATTHEWG (Matthew Sachs)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://lists.zevils.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/net-oscar/

  similar:
    Net::AIM Net::AOLIM

  rationale:

    There are two different protocols that can be used to access AIM.
    The one that the current perl modules implement is TOC. The TOC
    specifications have been released by AOL. TOC is a simple protocol
    that does not implement many of the features of OSCAR, AIM's native
    protocol, such as away message retrieval and buddy rendezvous. Also,
    AOL has placed some silly restrictions on TOC like blocking more
    than one connection from the same IP. AOL has not released the
    specifications to OSCAR, but projects like gAIM and libfaim have
    figured it out anyway. OSCAR is much more complex than TOC, so
    adding an OSCAR implementation to one of the existing modules would
    bloat them to an extent that would overshadow the original code.
    Net::OSCAR uses an interface similar to that of Net::AIM and will
    try to be as compatible as possible with that module.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::OSCAR           ampOp AOL Instant Messenger OSCAR protocol         MATTHEWG
