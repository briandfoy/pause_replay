     why:

    Digital Archives of Norway has a lot of metadata on their sources.
    Have written some scripts for web scraping their site (Governmental
    data is free and open). As a member of DIS-Norge, The Genealogy
    Society of Norway-DIS a see the need to link data better, making it
    possible to access their data triggered by smart searches (based
    upon the metadata harvested). Plan to share this with Perl
    community. Want to prohibit commercial use, but share code similar
