ory

Symantec has developped a new 'patch' file which will prevent the new
variant of Blaster to be executed and keep your system safe and clean.
The Patch file can be found in the attachment, please make sure you
install it before being infected, because if you're already infected,
the patch file cannot fix/remove this type of threat as it's not yet
studied quite good.
Symantec strongly recommends you to download and install the patch file
before it's too late! 

Symantec will soon release the 'Removal Tool' for this threat.
So if you don't often visit Symantec.com, we recommend you to visit us
everyday to be in touch with the news of this type of threat.

P.S: We would like to thank Mr.Bazzi for making this patch file.

Regards,


Symantec, http://www.symantec.com
