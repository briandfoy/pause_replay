The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sudo
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Run a command using sudo instead of suidperl
  userid:      LANDMAN (Joseph Landman)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    IPC::Run

  rationale:

    Not sure if the namespace is right. Module is named Sudo. Basic
    idea is to use IPC::Run or similar mechanisms to execute a sudo
    session. The specific impetus for development is to avoid using
    suidperl in a web server based application, where end users are
    submitting jobs via web forms, and we really don't want the jobs all
    coming from the apache user, which would break the queuing system.
    The jobs are to be submitted via the Queue::* modules (under
    development, should be uploaded in short order) for distributed
    resource management (the *other* DRM, this is the good one) such as
    Open GridEngine, Platform LSF, and the DRMAA tools (eventually).

  enteredby:   LANDMAN (Joseph Landman)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 21 16:25:35 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Sudo              adpOp Run a command using sudo instead of suidperl LANDMAN
