Would you mind posting the individual attempts you made to contact him?

We have seen similar claims in the past and the next day, after we
transferred the maintainer role over to the new maintainer, the
original owner came and complained that he has naver been contacted.

In general it is better if you make such attempts with either CC to
modules@perl.org or to an RT ticket. Then the whole process is stored
in a publicly visible place and others get informed as early as
possible.

Thanks,
