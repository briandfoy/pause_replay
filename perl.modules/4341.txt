what you're planning to contribute
    Initially, some scripts.
    Eventually, theoretically, modules of course.
    I've often left my code in condition not fit for
    public consumption saying to myself that one day
    I'd get around to rubbing off the rough edges or
    breaking out the parts which could make a module,
    or whatever... but just never get a round TUIT.
    My plan is to be a bit more motivated by having
    a hungry PAUSE author's directory begging me to
    feed it.

where you have discussed some or all parts
    The first two things I'd like to put in CPAN are
    cgi scripts. One is a game (jotto). An older
    version of the script was mentioned on the Fun
    With Perl list. The game is no longer on-line,
    but I'd like to touch it up a bit and CPAN-it.
    The second script is a web-based ADSI browser.
    I discussed some of it (non-publicly) with
    Terry Everett who has a Perl/TK ADSI browser
    http://opensource.activestate.com/authors/tobyeverett/browser.html
    There isn't much out there on Perl and ADSI,
    so I thought folks might appreciate another
    resource.
