Well, I'm sorry to bugger you, but it'd be real nice to settle this since 
I'm using it pervasively in a project (parts of which may end up in CPAN 
land eventually, dealing with ClearCase manipulation). It just becomes a 
nuisance if I have to refactor the whole thing later...

As you see below, it now seems clear to me that the Term:: namespace would 
be correct (there's precedent, such as Term::YAPI, Term::ProgressBar, 
Term::Twiddle, Term::StatusBar and Term::Activity - and BTW, ProgressMonitor 
is unqiue in respect to all of them wrt flexibility, scalability and 
architectural idea).
