The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Identify
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: module for language identification
  userid:      COG (José Alves de Castro)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Lingua::Ident

  rationale:

    Lingua::Identify will support several languages, allowing the
    possibility of learning news ones in an easier way, will implement
    several methods, allow the user to choose which one to use or let
    the module decide for him (based on things as the number of words to
    identify, the length of the text, etc; this is very important) and
    will also have some more functionalities.

    Almost all of these is all already implemented in a couple of
    scripts I have; I am now in the process of checking everything twice
    and migrating code to the module.

    Lingua::Identify will also allow for other things, as identifying
    the language of a file whether it is a pdf, html, ps, etc.

    Besides controlling which languages are active for identification,
    the user will also be able to activate/deactivate sets of languages.

    Regarding Lingua::Ident, we're talking about several languages
    (already twelve) vs. six, several methods vs. one (bigram method),
    not having to learn the languages each time we use it (as happens
    with Lingua::Ident), and several other functionalities.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
