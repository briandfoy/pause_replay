Although it doesn't show up on the author pages, he did release a
distribution that is apparently no longer indexed:
http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/J/JN/JNH/File-Cmp-0.03.tar.gz

From that, I think it's safe to transfer this name. You might want to
include the one function that's in the old module (although you don't
really have to support it :)

So, you are now a comaintainer. Good luck :)
