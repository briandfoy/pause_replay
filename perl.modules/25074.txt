The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filesys::Statfs
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Interface to the statvs() system call
  userid:      IGUTHRIE (Ian Guthrie)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    modules listserv

  similar:
    Filesys::Statvfs is an interface to a similar system call but is not
    used by all systems.

  rationale:

    This module is currently registered by Tom Christiansen. I have
    emailed him and he has given me permission to use it since no module
    currently exists for the namespace. This was discussed on the
    modules list. I can provide the email I received from him as
    reference if necessary or I am sure he can be contacted.

    The reason for this module is to provide an interface to the
    statfs() system call for systems that do not have statvfs(). Certain
    versions of BSD do not have statvfs (and MAC OSX etc).

    In the next month I wish to tie Filesys::Statfs into the
    Filesys::Df module so that it can be built with either
    Filesys::Statfs or Filesys::Statvfs depending on the OS. This should
    give the user a seemless exp regardless of what system call is
    supported.

    I will go ahead and upload the module tonight that doesnt have ties
    yet to Filesys::Df.

    Thanks, Ian Guthrie
