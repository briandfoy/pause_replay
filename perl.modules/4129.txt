Modules planned to contribute:

- libOurNet v1.4 (http://ourinet.com/libOurNet-snapshot.tar.gz),

  These modules are interfaces to BBS-based groupware projects used in
  Hong Kong, China and Taiwan by est. 1 million users. Used collabo-
  ratively, they glue BBSes together to form a distributed service
  network, called 'OurNet'.

OurNet       RmpO    Interface to BBS-based groupware platforms

(including following modules):
::Query      RmpO    Perform scriptable queries via LWP
::Site       RmpO    Extract texts with via templates
::FuzzyIndex RmcO    Fuzzy match for double-byte charsets
::ChatBot    RmpO    Context-Free Interactive Q&A Engine
::BBSAgent   RmpO    Scriptable telnet-based virtual users
::Cell       ampO    Interface-based RPC with Relay & Locating
::WebBuilder RmpO    Web Rendering for BBS-based services
::Template   ampO    Template Extraction and Generation
::BBS        bmpO    Component Object Model for BBS systems

   Plus assorted back-ends under OurNet::BBS::* namespace.

- Games::AIBots v1.2 (http://autrijus.org/AIBots.tgz)

Games::
::AIBots     RmpO    An improved clone of A.I.Wars in Perl.

- Term::ANSIScreen v1.0

Term::
::ANSIScreen RmpO    Generating ANSI cursor-control codes


References:

libOurNet is under constant revision and discussions by the
Elixir Movement, a Taiwan-based grassroot developer group
linking several independent companies, various user groups
including Taipei Perl Mongers, Taiwan BSD Mongers, The
CyberVision Organization, etc.

The Elixir BBS is at telnet://cvic.org/, area 5. However
most of the discussions are in Chinese.

Coordinated by myself, AIWars is the collaborative efforts
of the Perl Class of Beizheng junior high school, Taipei,
Taiwan, and resides under Elixir Movement's project space,
p4://p4.elixus.org/. It is a copyright-clean clone of
"A.I.Wars: The Insect Mind", a popular programming game
written by the fine folks at www.TacticalNeuronics.com.

Term::ANSIScreen was named Term::ANSI, intended as an extension
to Term::ANSIColor which is a part of standard distribution.
After consulting Term::ANSIColor's authors, its name had been
changed to avoid conflicts with the original module.


Sincerely yours,
/Autrijus/
