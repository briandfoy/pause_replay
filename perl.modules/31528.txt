So, since for other people a prompt during the install is problematic as
well, and since for me is problematic to not even know that someone is
installing my modules, I decided to put a clear note in the "INSTALLATION"
POD section which will inform the users about that checking version
process.

I hope that everybody could be happy with this solution.
