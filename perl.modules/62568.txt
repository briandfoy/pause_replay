Subject: Module submission RTG::Report

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RTG::Report
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: RTG reporting and data processing utilities
  userid:      MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    RTG mailing list, rtg@lists.grdata.com

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    The package was written specifically for generating reports from
    RTG data. Hence the name, RTG::Report.

    As I spent more time hacking at Layered Tech's RTG installation, I
    wrote a new target_maker script that fixes the numerous problems
    ailing the existing one. Then I added another script that
    consolidates old RTG data, preserving the actual values but reducing
    the granularity. Much like the internal processes rrdtool uses.

  enteredby:   MSIMERSON (Matt Simerson)
  enteredon:   Thu Oct  9 04:41:44 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RTG::
::Report          Rdpfp RTG reporting and data processing utilities  MSIMERSON
