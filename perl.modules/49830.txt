G'day brian and modules@perl.org,

Before I was whisked interstate for a week, brian wrote regarding
IPC::System::Simple:

> its simple.

Very true, but it does give the impression of an interface for common 
tasks, rather than a full-featured interface.  In particular, "Simple" 
gives the impression of an easy learning-curve.

I'd really love to keep the "Simple" in the name, as the module's goal 
is to be simple in as many ways as possible.  Simple to use, simple to 
understand, and simple in interface.

IPC::JFDI will certainly bring a few smiles, but unfortunately misses my 
target audience, which I envisage to include developers who are new to 
Perl, with whom the JFDI acronym is not necessarily wide-spread.  The 
contents of $? and the various POSIX macros and bit-shifts to decode it 
consistently receive puzzled looks in our Perl courses, so I know this 
is something that new developers can find hard to grasp.  It would be 
even worse if I mentioned that some concepts in $? are not portable 
across platforms.

I feel that providing a simple interface for running a command and 
checking that it worked will make it much easier for developers to "do 
the right thing".  I'm very interested in having a name that conveys 
that as best as possible, otherwise the module runs the risk of not 
getting used.

Like IPC::System?  ;)

Many thanks for your insights, and I look forward to your reply.

All the very best,

	Paul
