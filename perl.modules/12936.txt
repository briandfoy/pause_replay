Could use Text::Petal (or Text::PerlTAL)

You could also use Template::Petal (or Template::PerlTAL).

There are modules in the Template:: namespace that aren't related
to the template toolkit: Template::PSP, Template::Qtpl. I think
Template:: is too general to be dedicated to a single module/framework.
