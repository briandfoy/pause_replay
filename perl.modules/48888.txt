From: cpan@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

For a very long time the My:: namespace has been a sort of unregulated 
no-go zone. It's used by a lot of people for modules created for 
testing, demonstrations, and other sorts of non-real thing.

What do people think about chucking a My distribution up that documents 
the use of the My:: namespace? What would it say if we did? I'm thinking 
something along the lines of the Task distribution.
