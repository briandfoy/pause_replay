This is the right place to ask for help.

Stacy's module hasn't been updated since January 98 and Matt's mail
makes me believe that Stacy wouldn't mind if somebody would care for
his module. Last time I transferred a module to a new maintainer, the
old one judged this as a rude act. That's why I want to let pass a
small amount of time. Anyway, I'll make you the maintainer unless Stay
vetoes quickly, and I hope that you and Stacy work out how the module
should be treated in the future. If we do not hear from Stacy, we can
regard that as a consensus.

I'm CCing this to Stacy in the hope that he will tell us what to do.
If we do not hear from him till Saturday, I'll enter Anthony as the
maintainer into the database.

Anthony, please read CPAN/modules/04pause.html and send us a
registration sheet. Thanks!
