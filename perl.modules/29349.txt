The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PHP::DateTime
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Clone of PHP's date and time functions.
  userid:      BLUEFEET (Aran Deltac)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    module-authors mailing list (discussed 3/9/04)

  similar:
    DateTime::* PHP::DateTime is actually a wrapper around the
    DateTime::* modules but with tweaks to work the way the PHP datetime
    functions.

  rationale:

    Date and time functions that work how php date and time functions
    work (they are different than how the perl date/time
    functions/modules work).

    I believe that replicating all of the date/time php functions isn't
    useful. But, I do think that having perl equivalents of a couple of
    them (in particular date) would be very useful for people
    integrating perl with a php app's data. How many people have a php
    app running and want to write some perl code to enhance it - I don't
    know, but I know I'm one.

    In addition, I like to be complete. While I think a couple
    functions are useful, I'm anal and would just go ahead and make all
    of them in the odd chance that someone wants to call gettimeofday.

The resulting entry would be:

PHP::
::DateTime        adpfp Clone of PHP's date and time functions.      BLUEFEET
