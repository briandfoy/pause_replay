The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Starnet::DataAccounting
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to the SDA protocol
  userid:      SPOON (Iain Truskett)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailing lists

  similar:

  rationale:

    It's under Net because it's a network-related protocol. It's not
    under further subdivision due to it being a protocol of its own
    rather than a layer on top of another (e.g. http).

    It's under Starnet in case of further Starnet related modules being
    developed and it's called DataAccounting since that's the name of
    the product it's interfacing with (or supplanting in the case of
    clients).

    The point of the module is to provide a purish Perl implementation
    of the protocol so that non-linux/mac/win client machines are able
    to connect to the SDA server.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::Starnet::
::DataAccounting  bdpOp Interface to the SDA protocol                SPOON
