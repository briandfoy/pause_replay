Hello,

Yesterday I uploaded Text-MicroMason-2.12.tar.gz, but today I realized I
never got e-mail from PAUSE about it. I uploaded the file again today,
and then saw that it was already on the big yellow list of "click the
file you uploaded" options.

Now, the file exists and is indexed, but the big yellow list still has
the same file. I can't upload it by selecting it from the yellow list
since a file with the same name exists, but I have no way to remove it
from the list because it's not associated with me.

Can you nuke the file from the yellow list? The indexed version should
be identical, and is working correctly.

Thanks,
Alan
