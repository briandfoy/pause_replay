I think that the point Nicholas and brian are trying to make is
exactly what Jarkko Hietaniemi writes in "The Zen of Comprehensive
Archive Networks" (http://www.cpan.org/misc/ZCAN.html):

"Very much related to the licensing is of course commercial use: CPAN
took the easy and clear policy of no commercial software of any kind,
not even share/guilt/donateware would be allowed. We felt that any
other policy would be open to nitpicking, or maybe even legal
challenges, and as a volunteer group we do not have time or other
resources for any of that."

Sorry to enter this discussion without being asked to.

Regards,
Adriano.
