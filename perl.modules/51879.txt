     why:

    An implementation of MS's Simple Sharing Extensions spec, mainly to
    test how using RSS as a multidirectional read/write format would
    affect traffic. Basically, each entry would be updated based on the
    contents of other feeds, with some conflict management routine
    thrown in for good measure. I assume it would be an all-purpose feed
    reader/writer (like XML::FeedPP) and that it would be called
    XML::RSS::SSE. The SSE namespace can supposedly work within an Atom
    context, but it hasn't been explicitly proposed, hence the "RSS"
    tree.
