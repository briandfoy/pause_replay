Well, that's the trick.  You tell it what company you are
looking for (e.g. O'Reilly and Associates), and the module
finds instances of that company in the free text (e.g. 
O'Reilly, O'Reilly and Assoc., ORA, etc.)

The main point is that the code understands permutations
applied to company names in the English language, such as
contraction, abbreviation, embellishment, and so forth.

No, it can find any company name specified, although the
body of work mentioning public companies is much bigger.
This module does not provide any list of company names
whatsoever.

As usual with CPAN, we hope to put it in the section where
people will actually find it.  Finance or Business is the
most suitable first word, but unfortunately Finance is in
Chapter 23 "Also Ran", and this module is about text.  So
either would be appropiate.

How about Text::ExtractCompanyNames?
Business::ExtractCompanyNames?
