The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Solver1
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: 1-dimensional solver base class
  userid:      EMAHURIN (Eric Mahurin)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Brent

  rationale:

    Currently there are no modules for numerical root finding (one- or
    multi-dimensional) - at least that I could find.

    For now, I made the following:

    Math::Solver1.pm - 1-d numerical solver/root finder base class
    Math::Solver1::Bisect - derived class using bisection
    Math::Solver1::Falsi - derived class using regula-falsi
    Math::Solver1::Newton - derived class using newton/secant

    There are still many other ways of doing 1-d root finding and they
    all should fit under this interface.

    In the larger scope, some thought into the following following:

    - 1-D root finding : x where f(x)=0 - N-D root finding : X where
    F(X)=0 - 1-D optimization : x where g(x)=min (Math::Brent) - N-D
    optimization : X where g(X)=min (Math::Amoeba) - N-D opt w/
    constraints : X where g(X)=min, F(X)=0, H(X)>=0 (number of functions
    in F < number of variables in X)

    x : one variable X : vector of variables f : single function F :
    vector of functions (typically same number as variables)

    The GSL library has these divisions with the last most complicated
    optimization w/ constraints.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
