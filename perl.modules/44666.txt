If it is using TT2 internally, that would seem to make it dependant on 
it. i.e. You have to install TT2 in order to use it? And you'd greatly 
benefit from having TT2 caching enabled etc?

If you insist on proceeding I'll approve the name, but you REALLY want 
to think about making it truly independant if at all possible. I'm not 
sure anyone using HTML::Template is going to appreciate having to now 
load BOTH HTML::Template and TT2 at the same time. I'd hate to see a 
good namespace used up by a template-system-dependant module that claims 
that is isn't. You'll just get a ton of support requests saying "You 
claim it is independant, so why should I have to install TT2". The 
templating religion is quite a fierce one.

Otherwise you may want to consider a TT2-related name, or hold it back 
and work on it in private for a little while until it's more mature and 
you have had time to make it more generic than you have time to get it 
right now on your current project

(BTW, this is what I often do personally and at our company).

But again, CPAN didn't get where it is by holding people back, so 
confirm you definately want it registered now and I'll approve.

Just be aware that once you start getting users, your API is going to be 
stuck the way it is, even if you fix the implementation.
