PAUSE describes chapter 2 as:

2) Perl Core Modules, Perl Language Extensions and Documentation Tools

But in the submission itself it is described as:

2 (Perl_Core_Modules)


My guess is that that is why Arthur didn't want to put
Attribute::Property in chapter 2 at first, even though it's the only
suitable chapter (attributes *are* language extensions).

I didn't want to go discuss that issue again, so I put this one in 3,
because it can indeed be argued both ways.

It's all the same to me. I'll change it right away.
