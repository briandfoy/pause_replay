Request to register new user

fullname: William Schroeder
  userid: WSCHROED
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://genome.wustl.edu/
     why:

    I would like to contribute the Perl portion of
    https://github.com/wschroeder/Fern, work with my coworker Anthony
    Brummett to transfer App-Prove-Plugin-Cluster to my CPAN account,
    and eventually see about what it would require to take over
    dbix-objectmapper or finally get in touch with its author to
    register my major updates, including Oracle support.
