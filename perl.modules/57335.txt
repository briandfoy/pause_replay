I'd like to use Config::INI for common code found in Config::INI::Reader and
::Writer, but Config::INI is registered and not used.  (Well, Config::Ini is,
and I'm not thrilled about the idea of having both exist at once.)

I'd like to use App::Config for my long-sitting-around App::Config module, used
by Rubric and other internal-to-(code (simply)) projects.  That one's uploaded
by me, but the name is registered to ABW.

I've tried contacting both authors with no luck, several times over the last
several months.

I know that there's a coming purge*, but I wonder whether these two could be
purged earlier, so that I can get on with things, rather than sit on my hands.

Thanks for your consideration.
