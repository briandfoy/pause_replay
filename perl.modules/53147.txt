The DateTime APIs only cover Earth dates and times, specifically
on a sui generis variant of the UT time scale.  I'm on the datetime
mailing list, and we've discussed handling of multiple time scales
quite a bit recently, though not specifically Martian time scales.
There's some desire to extend DateTime to handle other time scales,
but it's certainly not imminent.  I'm doing experimental work on time
scale handling, and Date::Darian::Mars and Date::MSD are a branch of that.

Also, the style of interface that I want for these two modules is quite
different from what DateTime supplies.  This too has been discussed on
the datetime mailing list in the context of other modules (Date::ISO8601
and Date::JD).  My modules address only a particular aspect of date/time
handling (for D::D::M, the labelling of Martian solar days), and avoid
encumbering the user with baggage meant for other problems (e.g., time
of day).  My modules coexist peacefully with the DateTime suite; they
have different audiences.

Heh.  Different sub-day units seems like an easy case.  Mars has a
different kind of day.
