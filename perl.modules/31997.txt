The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       URI::OpenURL
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: URL encoding of Bibliographic Data
  userid:      TIMBRODY (Tim Brody)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    libwww

  similar:

  rationale:

    OpenURL's encode bibliographic data (such as publication year,
    journal title, authors) as the query component of a URL. The query
    component is a "contextObject", that is an OpenURL can contain data
    about the Network context as well as the target.

    My approach is to hide the fiddly bits (like the schema
    identifiers), and to provide a simple enough synopsis such that the
    user can generate OpenURLs without having to understand the
    standard.

    OpenURL is waiting NISO accreditation, and is implemented widely in
    library and publisher systems.

  enteredby:   TIMBRODY (Tim Brody)
  enteredon:   Tue May 18 13:48:27 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

URI::
::OpenURL         bdpOp URL encoding of Bibliographic Data           TIMBRODY
