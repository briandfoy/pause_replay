The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       X11::GUITest
  DSLIP:       bdhfg
  description: User emulation for X applications.
  userid:      CTRONDLP (Dennis K. Paulsen)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/x11guitest

  similar:
    Win32::GuiTest

  rationale:

    Project Description: X11::GUITest is a GPL'd Perl package intended
    to facilitate the testing of GUI applications by means of user
    emulation. It can be used to test/interact with GUI applications
    which have been built upon the X toolkit or those built upon
    toolkits (i.e., GTK) that "wrap" X toolkit's functionality.

    Reason For Listing: I believe this module will be helpful to other
    people.

    Difference From Existing Solutions: Existing solutions such as
    xmacro or xautomation seem to be cumbersome to implement and
    maintain use of.

    Implementation: The Perl package (X11::GUITest) exports the
    necessary higher level functions to perform GUI interaction through
    user emulation. Example functions exported: SendKeys,
    FindWindowLike, WaitWindowLike, StartApp, RunApp, ClickMouse,
    IconifyWindow, UnIconifyWindow, RaiseWindow, IsWindowViewable,
    GetChildWindows, etc. There are currently about 10 more functions in
    addition to this...

    Libraries Used: Xlib, XTest

    Programming Language: Perl, C

    Operating System Support: I have developed the package under Linux
    without using any Linux specific technologies, so as the name of
    X11::GUITest implies(-> X11), I'll be happy to help support and
    modify my package to work on any Operating System that provides a
    compatible X server, such as FreeBSD.

    Enhancements: I plan on maintaining enhancements to this package
    and welcome community involvement in doing so.

The resulting entry would be:

X11::
::GUITest         bdhfg User emulation for X applications.           CTRONDLP
