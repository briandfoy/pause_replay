Hi Greg, hi Rick,

this somehow slipped through the modules@perl.org people's nets. I'm 
CC'ing the datetime list in case Rick's reading that.

To me, it seems Rick is still around. He's been maintaining the module 
for several years and the last release is from 2008. Greg, have you read 
  http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover ?

Rick, please let us know how to proceed.

If anyone knows a working mail address for contacting Rick, please feel 
free to forward this.

Best regards,
Steffen, for the PAUSE admins.
