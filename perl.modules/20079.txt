The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::Constants
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Physical constants used in Astronomy
  userid:      DUFFEE (Boyd Duffee)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    perldl@jach.hawaii.edu

  similar:

  rationale:

    Astro::Constants is a short module that imports physical constants
    in Astronomy for use in calculations using either the CGS or the MKS
    system. Designed to be usable by other modules such as
    Astro::Cosmology and the number crunching bunch, it hopes to provide
    a proper perl module interface to Jeremy Bailin's Astroconst
    (http://www.astroconst.org/) package.

    In my view, it is better to have a unified source for such
    universals as physical constants where they can be discussed in
    public, rather than each module author choosing their own bespoke
    numbers. The module allows the site to customize the constants being
    installed for those who prefer values or precisions other than those
    provided.

The resulting entry would be:

Astro::
::Constants       adpfp Physical constants used in Astronomy         DUFFEE
