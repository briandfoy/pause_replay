Hi CPAN,

I would like to take over the maintenance of Net::Netflix.

  http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netflix/

The current version on CPAN (0.03) does not work, due to Netflix having
changed their html format. It has not been updated since March 2005.

I have patched the module twice, for my own use. Both times I emailed
the author, John Resig <jeresig@gmail.com>, to submit patches. Both
times I also offered to take over maintenance, if preferred. The first
time emailed was June 24, 2006 and the second was June 22, 2008. I did
not receive a reply from John on either occasion.

In the meantime, I have made my version available at:

  http://code.google.com/p/net-netflix/

Thanks,
-Colin.
