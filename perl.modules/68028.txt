The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SQLite_File
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Tie to SQLite files with DB_File emulation
  userid:      MAJENSEN (Mark Allen Jensen)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    bioperl-l@lists.open-bio.org (as Bio::DB::SQLite_File)

  similar:
    DB_File AnyDBM_File SDBM_File

  rationale:

    My inital motivation was to provide a DB_File emulation using
    SQLite (via DBD::SQLite), to obviate the external install of
    BerkeleyDB. This was mainly to provide ActiveState 5.10 users, who
    AFAIK are currently getting only a DB_File stub, with BioPerl db
    indexing functionality that currently depends heavily on DB_File and
    the Berkeley API. (SDBM works in some situations, but not all,
    because of its small record size in the standard build.) I wrote the
    module to work in concert with AnyDBM_File, to allow a transparent
    failover to SQLite, preserving the functionality of the Berkeley
    API, so that users on other platforms expecting DB_File/BDB would
    get it naturally, without a burp.

    Since SQLite_File has no dependencies other than DBI and
    DBD::SQLite, which contains in itself the SQLite implementation
    (very cool), it occurred to me that some in the wider community may
    desire this choice as well, for whatever reason. In the context of
    typical AnyDBM_File use, it seems natural (or prettier) to have
    @AnyDBM_File::ISA = qw(DB_File SQLite_File SDBM), rather than
    qw(DB_File Bio::DB::SQLite_File SDBM), even if and when the BioPerl
    version is contained in a future CPAN-hosted release. However, I
    defer completely to the namespace gurus. If you have a learned
    suggestion, I will use that instead.

    Thanks for your consideration-- MAJ
