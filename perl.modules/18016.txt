As the title says, it's a repository for text, not a widget (and as the
description says, a "backend" storage device.

In a nutshell, any text-handling widget can use this to store their text value
and feed it user input.  The main purpose is cursor-tracking, being able to
pull or set the cursor position in either ordinal index of the text string, or
as (row, column) coordinates when set to the widget's geometry.  The other
functions are there simply because a) they're text manipulation functions, and
b) they affect the cursor position, which is, again, the main point of this
module in the first place.
