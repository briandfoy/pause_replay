Hi John,

that's okay. I forwarded your message to the list, but got no reply. I 
can't approve namespace requests, so all I do to help out is answer 
submissions that I find questionable and try to suggest "better" 
alternatives. Thus, I couldn't do more than forward your answer and wait 
for those with approval-powers to catch up.

Unfortunately, these people aren't many (for a good reason) and they're 
extremely busy. Keeping up with modules@perl.org isn't first priority.

I wonder whether a large PDF needs to go on CPAN. I'm not the one to 
decide, but if I was in the situation, I'd just put it on my homepage 
and link to it from the (short) documentation of the actual code.

Other than that, we'll need to wait for one of the modules@perl.org 
maintainers to pick this up.

All the best,
Steffen
