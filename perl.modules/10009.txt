Howdy!  My name is Collin Starkweather.  I am currently the maintainer
of the Net::Peep modules under the PAUSE ID STARKY.  However, I have
worked with a variety of Perl programmers over the years who have
produced a body of work to which we hold copyright that we would like to
release portions of to the CPAN under the collective name CODECREW.

So I would like to apply for a separate PAUSE ID for the group work.

Here are the vitals:

Name:  Collin Starkweather
E-Mail Address:  collin.starkweather@collinstarkweather.com
Homepage:  http://www.codecrew.net
Desired Pause ID:  CODECREW
Contributions:  DBIx::DAO (Data Access Object), a family of modules
created by Moon Lee that forms a wrapper to data access through DBI for
MySQL and Oracle and includes a variety of advanced features such as
query profiling and tracing (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/dao).

Please let me know if you have any questions :-)

-Collin
