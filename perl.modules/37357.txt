To whom it may concern -

    I am not receiving RT alerts from the PDF-Template queue, even
though I've been the sole maintainer for almost 2 years. When I log in
to rt.cpan.org, it's not listed as one of my queues.

    How do I go about fixing this? Also, this is the third item I've
had to ask about with regards to PDF-Template. What other items need
to be migrated from Dave Ferrance to me?

    My CPAN id is RKINYON

Thanks,
Rob
