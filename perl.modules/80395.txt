     why:

    I'm working on Hypatia, an extensible API for data visualization
    that takes data from a database (via DBI) and creates a basic
    chart/graph/etc object. This allows the construction of basic,
    default charts without having to tinker with the underlying modules.
    For example, I don't have to remember how to create a bar chart via
    Chart::Clicker. Instead, I can just fire up
    Hypatia::Chart::Clicker::Bar, pass in the necessary database
    connection information, the query to produce the data, which
    column(s) are supposed to represent values on the x and y axes, and
    where I want the output saved.

    The initial release will include support for Chart::Clicker and
    GraphViz2, but I have plans to extend this to GD, R (via
    Statistics::R), etc. I should be ready to release within the next
    1--2 weeks.
