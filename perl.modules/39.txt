That's fine, but useless to us in the real world that have to wait for p5p to alter 'use' to have these new semantics. Especially when we can have the functionality right now, today with this module.

Again, I think the example was contrived, and a particularly bad usage - I don't see it as a 'real world' problem. I can't prevent people from using a module when they shouldn't be in the first place. And especially from Tom C, the loudest proponent of RTFM around.

WHY would 'use import "CGI";' ever be helpful to your program? What was the benefit expected from coding that way?

Access to the CGI module? 'use CGI;' already works well enough - why did you need the import pragma?

Aliasing the CGI namespace? To what? CGI is already a top-level namespace, and it already exports loads of functions.

I see no reason a programmer would *want* to write the code you suggest is "broken for the common programmer", and therefore not a common problem requiring redress at all.

I could add some checking to prevent 'import'ing a top-level namespace (i.e. the namespace must contain at least one non-terminal set of '::'s.) Would that address the concerns of not preventing wanton usage?

Michael
