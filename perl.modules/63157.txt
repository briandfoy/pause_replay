The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Monotone::AutomateStdio
  DSLIP:       bdpOl
  description: Perl OO interface to the Monotone SCM system
  userid:      AECOOPER (Anthony Edward Cooper)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net/all/branch/changes/net.venge.monotone.contrib.lib.automate-stdio
    irc://irc.oftc.net/#monotone

  similar:

  rationale:

    Monotone is a distributed SCM system. One feature it provides is
    direct control of Monotone via its STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR file
    descriptors. This feature is called automate stdio. This is why I
    called the module Monotone::AutomateStdio. There may be other
    modules that come along in the future that can also fit under the
    Monotone namespace (although I can't think of any at the moment at
    this module implements a complete interface to Monotone's automate
    stdio i/f).

    This interface module is specific to Monotone and no other SCM. It
    is currently used in mtn-browse, a Perl application I have developed
    using Gtk2+, and some Monontone developers are keep to make use of
    it in some web projects for Monotone.

    As per your instructions I have emailed modules@perl.org about this
    request and I got one response back saying that this root namespace
    request seemed fine.

    Yours,

    Tony Cooper.
