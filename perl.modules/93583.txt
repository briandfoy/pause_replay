From: craigberry@mac.com ("Craig A. Berry")

E-mail to brad@tgsmc.com bounces after multiple attempts and =
bhughes@cpan.org seems to be forwarded to that.  I posted to the vmsperl =
list last October, where Brad Hughes was active 10+ years ago, inquiring =
whether anyone knew how to contact him.  I have received no replies.  I =
have done various searches but not found any publicly available contact =
info for anyone who looks like the same Brad Hughes.

Can I take over, or at least get co-maint, on VMS::IndexedFile and =
VMS::Lock?
