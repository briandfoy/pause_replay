The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pots
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: OO modules for ithreads
  userid:      RCHIBOIS (Remy Chibois)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module tries do define an object oriented approach for working
    with ithreads. As it imposes some way of doing things and has not
    been tested along with modules from the "Thread" namespace, I think
    it should be placed in its own namespace, so has to not pollute
    "Thread".

    If there is a better alternative, I'll be glad to update the module
    and include it in an existing namespace.

    Thanks.

The resulting entry would be:

Pots              bdpOp OO modules for ithreads                      RCHIBOIS
