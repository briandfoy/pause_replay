These aren't specific guidelines.  If you change a file, then you
should stick to the general style of that file and commit messages
in git always start with a one-line summary, followed by an
empty line and further details.
And one-line doesn't mean that you simply remove all the line breaks.
It should fit on the subject line of an email message.
The further details can in some cases be omitted, but in this case
it does sound relevant to describe the actual problem that this
patch solves.

I suppose the best place to look for git commit message guidelines
is Documentation/SubmittingPatches in the git distribution, although
that file obviously also contains guidelines specific to the git project.

Well, I don't suppose we are going to release a new version with
just this fix and you were saying that more patches would be
forthcoming.

Anyway, the patch is ok with me, but I haven't been using fcgi
in a long time, so I do think you should send it to the mailing
list as well as any other patches you have lined up.

Also, would you like me to collect your patches or do you
plan on taking over eventually?  In the latter case, you should
probably become more active on the mailing list.  It's no
good replacing one inactive person by another.
