Subject: Module submission SLOOPS
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SLOOPS
  DSLIP:       RdpOl
  description: Simple Light  OO Persist System
  userid:      JETEVE (Jerome Eteve)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Alzabo DbFramework

  rationale:

    I tried a few persistance framework and didn't managed to get happy
    with them. They were too complex, or too unstable, or simply don't
    work. That's why I decided to developp my own simple and robust
    system : SLOOPS ( which stands for Simple, Light, Object Oriented
    Persistence System ) .

    The ideal namespace root should have been DbFramework but this
    namespaced is filled with 6 years old modules from the same author.
    Actually, my system is, just like alzabo, more a product than a
    collection of module that can fit in other namespaces. That's why I
    ask you to have the namespace SLOOPS to index it.

    Thanks for considering my request .

    Regards.
