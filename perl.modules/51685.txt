G'day all...

I've got a simple little MVC appplication of John Conway's "Game of 
Life" (i.e. the 0 player cellular automation "game"). It currently has 
two different views - One that writes basic output, and one that writes XML.

It's just for fun, and I'd like to upload it to CPAN. (I know that 
Game::Life already exists, but is significantly different from my 
application, and isn't MVC.)

The namespace I'm wanting to register is "Life" - and I've written 
Life::Model, Life::View, and Life::View::XML. (Writing a controller is 
trivial. The controller needs to do little work, and I can provide an 
example one)

http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html says: "/Think, better even talk 
before you upload"/

So, I'm just wanting to check out that my intended actions are 
appropriate and heed the above advice.

Thanks!
