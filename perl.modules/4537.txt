Yes

in as much as

The two XS modules I've written so far provide perlio layers to gzip/gunzip
and to limit a file handle to a particular subsection of a file.
The XS code only provides a layer to perlio - it exports no symbol table
entries, and the .pm just contains a call XSLoader and the POD.
My two modules are useless without perlio (they won't even compile, and
Makefile.PL will probe Config.pm to bail out before this happens)

The Encode module in the development tree provides an "encode" layer
(when perl is configured for perlio), but also provides perl language
accessible functions.  As I see it it, it wouldn't qualify to live in the
PerlIO namespace because it's doing a lot more than just layers.  The
PerlIO namespace would be just for modules that solely provide layer
functionality.

Except that I have this niggle that as perlio is in development it
may throw up something related to it that would also not really
have a home in any other namespace.
