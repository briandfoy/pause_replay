The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::DBI
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Internationalization for Catalyst via DBI
  userid:      MDIETRICH (Matthias Dietrich)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    Stuttgart.pm

  similar:
    Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::DBIC: very similar but couldn't get this to
    work properly. Also, Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::DBIC loads the database
    each time a user accesses a site (because it's based upon the
    DBIx::Class-Plugin of Catalyst which isn't available on
    initialization) while Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::DBI loads the lexicon
    only once while initialization of Catalyst.

  rationale:

    Namespace: It's the namespace for Plugins, DBI is only one way of
    storing lexicons for I18N. So this is the best namespace for this
    purpose.

    Uniqueness: The functionality is not unique, but how it works is
    unique: Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::DBI loads the lexicon once at
    application startup and holds it in memory which gives better
    performance than Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::DBIC.

    This module should be listed to be available for everyone. It is a
    great feature to Catalyst and improves performance compared to other
    solutions.

The resulting entry would be:

Catalyst::Plugin::I18N::
::DBI             bdpOp Internationalization for Catalyst via DBI    MDIETRICH
