Dear Sir/Madam

I am using your free software as Perl. I have downloaded and installed
some software this follow:
    - Perl 5.005_03 for i86 pc solaris
    - DBI-1_13
    - Data-Dumper-2_09
    - Msql-Mysql-modules-1_2018
and some software other:
    - gcc-2.95
    - mysql-3.22.32 for i86 pc solaris.
in my computer.
I have readed file README and to install. After I have been installed
all software this and run a program test1.pl to test Perl API:
## Source code of program test1.pl
1.    #!/usr/local/bin/perl
2.
3.    use DBD::mysql;
4.
5.    $dbh = DBI->connect("DBI:mysql:$test:localhost", "test", "test");
6.    print "OK!\n";
7.    $rc = $dbh->disconnect;

System return to me message error:
"Can't locate DBD/mysql.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.00503/i86pc-solaris /usr/local/lib/perl5/5.00503
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/i86pc-solaris
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005 .) at ./test1.pl line 3.BEGIN
failed--compilation aborted at ./test1.pl line 3."

I don't understood why appear message error this. May be I have been
installed to fail.
Please to help me

As soon as possible.
