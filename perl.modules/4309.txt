Subject: PAUSE reg., and new module for parsing GUIDO music notation

I am near completion on a Perl module that can parse, manipulate, and write
GUIDO music score files.  For more info on GUIDO, visit

      http://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/AFS/GUIDO

I would like to register with PAUSE and submit this module to CPAN.
However, I think it would be useful to place this module in a namespace like
Music::GUIDO rather than just GUIDO.  Particularly because I may also be
working on a module that performs similar tasks for the text music notation
format abc:

      http://www.gre.ac.uk/~c.walshaw/abc/

And, assuming the GUIDO and abc work I've done goes well enough, I (or some
other daring Perl hacker(s)) may also want to tackle a generic module for
music notation/representation that can be shared by different notation
parsers (and different programs, in general).  It's a daunting task,
proposed but never apparently implemented:

     http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/1998-11/msg00127.html

If something like this proposal were created, it would make sense to call it
Music or Music::Notation, which leads me to believe that the GUIDO module
should be called Music::GUIDO.  

I've announced this GUIDO module on the linux-audio-dev mailing list, which
put me in contact with people doing similar things with GUIDO in python and
C++.  I've also conversed over email with Holger Hoos, the original
architect of GUIDO and a current member of the GUIDO dev team.  I can
provide emails of these discussions if necessary.  Recent .tar files of my
work can be found at http://www.columbia.edu/~karlward/GUIDO.tar . 

Here's the required info:

Description:  Music::GUIDO is an object-oriented Perl module that can read
GUIDO music notation scores, store/manipulate them internally within the
object, and write them back out.  It provides an interface for creating
and/or manipulating these scores as well.
