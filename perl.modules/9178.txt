The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Session::Auth
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Session based CGI authentication
  userid:      SHERZODR (Sherzod Ruzmetov)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    There're no standard authentication methods for CGI applications.
    And everyone tries to envent his/her own one, which is very
    confusing most of the times. So I decided to write a library which
    does just that.

    I call this method "Session Based Active Authentication". "Active"
    because the server plays the active role. "Session based" because we
    will apply session tracking.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::Session::
::Auth            cdpOp Session based CGI authentication             SHERZODR
