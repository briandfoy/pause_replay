The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       nztop
  DSLIP:       adpng
  description: nz_top is a `top' clone for Netezza.
  userid:      JCUA (Jonathan Cua)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    mytop pgtop

  rationale:

    nz_top is a 'top' clone for Netezza. The idea came from mytop and
    pgtop.

    nz_top is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the
    performance of Netezza. It runs on most Unix systems which have Perl
    and Term::ReadKey installed.

    Netezza provides a Windows admin tool that monitors the performance
    of the database. But it means that you have to use Windows to run
    the tool. This is meant to help the user to quickly see what is
    happening on the database.

    The advantage of using this tool is that it can show you the plan
    files that the Netezza optimizer will attempt to execute on the
    query.

  enteredby:   JCUA (Jonathan Cua)
  enteredon:   Wed Mar 24 23:16:18 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

nztop             adpng nz_top is a `top' clone for Netezza.         JCUA
