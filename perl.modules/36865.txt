I am sorry I may have misunderstood your mail, here is my reply to the
other possible meaning:

lcse is a method and wraper methods for finding th elargest common
substring in an array of strings, it also allows you to divide the
string ahead of time, or by word/character through it's wrapper methods.
Currently the module is in alpha, it works and produces favorable
results, however at this point it is very specialised to a specific
project of mine. I intend to generalise the script and improve features.
I also intend to remove a few nasty hacks that came about from a time
crunch and rapid prototyping.

I personaly feel that the final result of the script (version 1) will be
most beneficial to the perl community. I also feel my module addresses
situations/needs/problems not addressed by other LCSS algorithm scripts
I found online through the many perl recources including cpan.
