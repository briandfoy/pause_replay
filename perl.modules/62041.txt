No, it causes me no grief at all. I was just responding to the request on https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=peek_perms to report any errors to modules@perl.org. As I said, I do not _KNOW_ that this is an error, but it looked funny to me so I reported it. The only thing I hope is that, if you take this name away from me, you will let me know so I can re-name the module.

Thanks,
Tom Wyant
