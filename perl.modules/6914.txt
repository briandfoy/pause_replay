Nice suggestion, but this module is intended
to be used by lower level daemons and third
party utilities for domain parsing and
configuration manipulation (Net::DNSServer
is one example).  It just takes care of some
of the nitty gritty work.  Also, this module
is where Kevin put it and where it has been
for the last four years.  I'm not sure what
the original motivation for listing it under
Net:: was.  Any other suggestions?
