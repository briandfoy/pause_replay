Hi Jean-Michel,

I'm having a hard time recommending a namespace for this. (Others might 
have a good idea, though.)
Have a look at the module list chapter 
http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Operating_System_Interfaces
There are several OS-specific sub-categories. If your software runs on 
Linux only and you don't plan to change that, for example, you could use 
Linux::MonstruousMonitor or Linux::SystemMonitor.

There is currently no System::* hierarchy of modules and I'd personally 
like to keep it that way. "System" can be used in various contexts...
There is, however, Sys::*. Possibly Sys::MonstruousMonitor would be 
good? Possibly "Sys::Monitor", but that sounds a little odd to me.

As a last resort, you can create a new "branded" top level namespace 
"MonstruousMonitor", but I would strongly suggest you don't. Branded 
t.l. namespaces make searching for modules that accomplish a specific 
task difficult and clutter the top level namspace of CPAN.

Hope this helps,
Steffen
