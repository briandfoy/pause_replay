G'day brian / Modules list,

Touché!  ;)

Looks like calling the pragma 'exceptions' is out the window.  There's
ambiguity, naming conflicts, and plenty of better suggestions, including
your fatal::lexical.

However it looks like my proposal to p5p of integrating the changes into
Fatal have not met with a total outcry, so I'm working on Fatal.pm for the
time being.  The name of the pragma to hide an otherwise ugly syntax is
being debated on p5p, and has gone through rigorous etymological scrutiny:

I believe the form currently in favour is "use kvetching".

Cheerio,

	Paul
