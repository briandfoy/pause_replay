Hi,

> Apologies for the bother, but could we get Net::AMQP version 0.06 =
(~CHIPS) reindexed on MetaCPAN. No new upload or anything, just looks =
like there may have been a permissions issue.
>=20
> It seems like when v0.06 was uploaded to CPAN, ~CHIPS may not have had =
authorization to upload Net::AMQP, as many of the packages in this =
distribution are flagged as Unauthorized[1].
>=20

authorized now for the packages in this distribution.

You=E2=80=99re right, it looks like he has all relevant permissions. =
I=E2=80=99ve triggered a re-index on it, which would be done in about an =
hour.
