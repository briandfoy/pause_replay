The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Cascade
  DSLIP:       bmphg
  description: Web-Based Content Management System
  userid:      MARKSTOS (Mark Stosberg)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    CGI::Application mailing list, Perlmonks.org,
    cascade-mysql@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    Catalog

  rationale:

    Cascade is a web-based content management application. It has a
    homepage with more details here: (
    http://summersault.com/software/cascade ). It is bit similar to the
    "Catalog" package on CPAN in spirit. It has several major
    differences though: It supports Postgres, and it uses a modern
    programming structure including HTML::Template and CGI::Application.

    Besides including several modules in the Cascade:: namespace, the
    application includes several HTML::Template files, a configuration
    script and some SQL files. The system is designed such that you only
    need for the Perl modules to be installed once on the system, and
    the application can be used by many users by using separate copies
    of the templates and configuration scripts to define their own
    instance of the application.

    I guess first I'd like to verify that it's appropriate to
    distribute applications like this on CPAN. :)

    In thinking about the best namespace for it, there is not top
    namespace for content management systems. Additionly, as the project
    grows, I would like for it to become more of a web-based community
    system, so I want a name that will stick over time.

    I can't think other users for the top level "Cascade" name. I'd
    like to think I'm similar to "Alzabo" or "Mhonarc" in my choice for
    a unique name for my Perl application. :)

    Thanks for your consideration!
