Hi,

I have  have not been working in this area for some time now, which is why I
have not kept up with the emails for this module.

Looks like there are persons interested in using this module.

I can continue to maintain the module and provide
support/improvements/defect fixes etc.

Hope this would work for everyone.

Thanks,
Prasad
