    I understand your relucance against putting it until CGI if it
also works under mod_perl.  From your description, it sounds like
it requires a web-based environment.  If this is the case, then I
would recommend HTTP::Something or HTML::Something.  Otherwise,
Test::Something sounds good to me.

    That would be HTML::Mason and NobodyEverAskedKurt::Tangram?  :^)

    I will only provide my opinion, which is that an accurately descriptive
name is more likely to produce trial users.  If you're really wed to
Monkeywrench, then go for it, but I, for one, would not be likely to find
it on CPAN by using the CPAN shell, which is how I generally poke around
for a module to perform any random function.
