Moin,

I am in the process of developint a new module - well, it works, it is
missing tests, doc and a proper package, oh and a name ;)

I am unsure as to where to put it, so I would like to have some feedback.

The module is a analyzer and graph tool, much like webanalyzer, or any of
these products that take a HTTP server log and visualize it in pretty
graphics.

Unlike these, however, it works on mbox files that contain spams (or just
normal mail). It plots various stats like spams/day, spams/month etc etc.

I thought of things like:

        Spam::Analyzer
        Spam::Graph

But since it is very like to Mail-MboxParser (in fact, I plan to switch my
code to use it), and it basically deals with emails (not just spams) and
then generates graphs from them, I think:

        Mail::Graph 

would be a very good name.

Thanx in advance,

Tels
