It's extremely error prone to fiddle with the innards of the database,
I would never do that. But instead I created a new account for you and
set the other one to rest.

There was no code yet that supported retiring of accounts. I have
added a checkbox that allows users to mark their accounts as ready for
retiring (but only for users that have never uploaded anything; others
can not retire).

I also relaxed the requirement for a valid username to /^[A-Z]{3,9}$/,
otherwise it wouldn't have been possible to create an account EIM.

You're welcome.
