The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Container
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Glues OO frameworks together transparently
  userid:      KWILLIAMS (Ken Williams)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    #perl, Mason mailing lists, module-authors@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    "This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that
    inter-operate. It was first designed and built for C<HTML::Mason>,
    in which the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component,
    Buffer, and several other objects must create each other
    transparently, passing the appropriate parameters to the right
    class."

    I could have called it Class::Framework or something, but that
    doesn't work as well as @MyMod::ISA = qw(Class::Container);

The resulting entry would be:

Class::
::Container       bdpOp Glues OO frameworks together transparently   KWILLIAMS
