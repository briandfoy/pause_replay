The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Chart::Clicker
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Extensible, speedy charting library
  userid:      GPHAT (Cory Watson)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    http://www.onemogin.com/clicker/

  similar:
    Chart Chart::Strip

  rationale:

    I chose the nonsensical name Clicker because all the good names
    were taken and while I rely on Cairo for my 2d drawing I prefer to
    not be tied to it in name. What if something better comes along? :)

    Anyway, I like to think Chart::Clicker is more approachable than
    the Chart libraries I've looked into.

    This is my second request, perhaps my first one wasn't very good?
    :)

The resulting entry would be:

Chart::
::Clicker         bdpOo Extensible, speedy charting library          GPHAT
