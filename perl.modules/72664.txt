Subject: Module submission Statistics::Sequences::Runs
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::Sequences::Runs
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: The Runs-test (Wald-Walfowitz)
  userid:      RGARTON (roderick garton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil at present

  similar:
    nil at present

  rationale:

    The Runs-test assesses the difference between two independent
    distributions, or a difference within a single distribution of
    dichotomous observations, in terms of the frequency of the runs of
    states within them.

    It is commonly used as a test of randomness of a single series, or
    of the statistical difference between two series of data.

    The module, apart from providing the basic test, offers various
    means by which to dichotomize data so that they are suitable for
    testing as runs.

  enteredby:   RGARTON (roderick garton)
  enteredon:   Tue Sep  7 14:00:34 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::Sequences::
::Runs            bdpOp The Runs-test (Wald-Walfowitz)               RGARTON
