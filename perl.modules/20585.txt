The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDF::Reuse
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Reuse and mass produce PDF documents
  userid:      LARSLUND (Lars Lundberg)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The name of the module is PDF::Reuse. It has good
    performance,sometimes very good performance, and high capacity. It
    handles forms, images, text, Acrobat JavaScript and graphics to
    create new PDF-files. "Forms" are ordinary pages from PDF-files
    transformed to "XObjects" (an internal PDF-format), which makes it
    possible to reuse the page as a unit, create long but compact lists,
    and to combine it with other elements. Images can be taken from old
    PDF-files. Text is created with 12 of the 14 standard fonts of
    Acrobat. You can reuse fonts from imported pages also. You can do
    "low level" programming with the basic graphic operators of PDF.
    This is powerful possibility. You can mix your "low level" code with
    the forms, fonts and other elements. You can merge JavaScripts from
    one included PDF-file with scripts you attach to the document you
    are creating, and you can initiate the attached JavaSripts. These
    "interactive" functions are experimental, but they work with Acrobat
    5.0 and Acrobat Reader 5.1. The other "graphic" functions should be
    fairly stable. You can have libraries of PDF-code, JavaScripts and
    "low level" modules written in Perl and reuse most of it. As the
    module has good performance, it is possible to mass produce files
    with it.
