A few months ago, mst gave me co-maint on XML::Feed. But something 
doesn't seem to be working correctly as the two releases that I have 
made since then are both marked as unauthorised.

   http://search.cpan.org/~davecross/XML-Feed-0.45/
   http://search.cpan.org/~davecross/XML-Feed-0.46/

I expect this also means that they aren't being picked up by various 
CPAN clients.

MetaCPAN doesn't seem to have the same problem.

   https://metacpan.org/release/XML-Feed

If there's something I need to do in order to fix this, could you please 
let me know.

Cheers,

Dave...
