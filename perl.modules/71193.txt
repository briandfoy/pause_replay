The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::A2E
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: A2E Multilingual Hypertext Makefile Language
  userid:      PILHAMU (PILCH Hartmut)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://a2e.de/adv/perl/A2E

  similar:

  rationale:

    The system consists of about 20 library files, most of which are
    not well suited for direct reuse by other systems. Thus they must
    all stay under one namespace. Currently they are all called A2E::*,
    but it would be feasible to move this to Text::A2E::* Since the
    whole approach to bottom-up assembly of documents seems to be rather
    novel or unusual, it seems to fit only into the rather generic
    'Text' category. The system is mature but user-level documentation
    has yet to be written.

  enteredby:   PILHAMU (PILCH Hartmut)
  enteredon:   Wed May 12 11:48:45 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
::A2E             RdpOp A2E Multilingual Hypertext Makefile Language PILHAMU
