IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MOST GRACIOUS THE MOST MERCIFUL
 
It is with heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in the context below.
 I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the second wife of the former Nigerian Head of state late General Sani Abacha whose Sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998. Having gotten your particulars from the World Business Directory in our family library, I have no doubt about your capacity and good will to assist me inreceiving into your custody (For Safety) the sum of US$22Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband.This money is currently kept in a Trust Deposit Account with a West AfricanSub-Regional Finance & Security Company. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband property is under the family lawyer's named(KOJO MENSAH Chambers).However, the new Democratic Government has on assumption of the office set
up a panel of inquiry to the financial activities of my late husband (former Head of State ) with a decision to freeze all his assets respectively.The investigative 
teams has submitted their report presently some cash and assets have been frozen and seized. Fortunately, our family lawyer has recently protected the Personal will of husband from the notice of the investigator sand have strictly advised that the willed money will be urgently moved into anoverseas account of a Trusted Foreign Family Friend without delay,for security reasons.  The Government had 
earlier placed Foreign Travel Embargo of all our family members and sized all known local and International outfits of our business empire.
 
The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well wishes. In view of this plight therefore, I expected you to be Trust Worthy and Kind enough to respond this call (S.O.S) to save my Children and me from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the fund when finally received in your Local Bank Account.The Attorney has perfected arrangement with the Bankers to effect complete dislodgment of this money within a week of the receipt of your response through mail. They have equally guaranteed 100% risk free and smooth 
transfer .Please all contacts must be made through my Lawyer Barrister KOJO
