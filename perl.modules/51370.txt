The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::Simple
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple Object-Oriented Base Class
  userid:      SULLIVAN (Michael Sullivan)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Class::MethodMaker Class::Std

  rationale:

    Things like Class::MethodMaker and Class:Std are nice and robust
    and all but sometimes I just want something simple as a base class.
    Something that will let me just use get_ and set_ methods and
    AUTOLOAD them for me. A few more optional niceties like private and
    readonly methods are added but not required. Usage can be as simple
    as:

    package Foo; use base qw(Class::Simple);

    ...then...

    use Foo; my $obj = Foo->new(); $obj->set_bar(1);

    I have looked and looked for something simple and I have used both
    Class:MethodMaker and Class::Std but I often come back to this for
    something simple. I've even re-worked it so objects are now
    inside-out.

    It's nothing earth-shatteringly brilliant. Just something simple
    and useful--or so I've found it.

The resulting entry would be:
