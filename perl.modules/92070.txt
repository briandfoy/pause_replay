Hi Ron

Thanks for the info. I see now that LZAP idles on freenode, though I
don't know where. I'll try to catch him active and see if we can work it
out from there.

Otherwise, I don't have a problem with taking over UUID. It's pretty
small to start with, and I don't have any spectacular plans. I just
don't want to see it disappear because it's exactly what I need most of
the time. (Minus the one tiny bit I want to add.)

Thanks!
Rick
