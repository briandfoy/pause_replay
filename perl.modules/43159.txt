The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::CDBI::GroupToken
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: simplified version of group-role-permission
  userid:      SSC (Scott Connelly)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::CDBI

  rationale:

    Seperation of Authorization and Authentication. This is a variation
    on roles in Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::CDBI that adds
    infinite levels of grouping and permissions.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION

    This is a simplified version of the group-role-permission paradigm.
    Working from the theory that at the end of the day all the developer
    really cares about is whether someone has permission to access
    something or not. Traditional roles and groups are just storage and
    assignment mechanisms. This model changes the notion of a permission
    to a "token". Roles and groups are simplified to "group". And a user
    is still a user. Tokens (permissions) are assigned to a user and or
    a group. A user is assigned to groups. Groups can also be assigned
    to groups (think of roles assigned to groups without all the
    headaches of realizing that a role has suddenly morphed into a group
    or into a permission). The flexibility is that exceptions are easily
    handled. If Rob is in Group A, but also needs also needs a
    permission for something from group B we just give him the
    permission directly. These alleviates the need to build another role
    or group just to handle the special case for Rob. Why all this you
    ask? Again it gets back to the concept of "all I really care about
    is can this user do this". So outside of an administrative interface
    the only thing to query is the tokens (permissions). This is similar
    to testing for a particular capability in javascript versus doing a
    browser detect and branching off from there.
