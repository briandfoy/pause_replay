interesting module, but I don't like the name, for a couple reasons:

* you can generalize the idea to minutes, hours, weeks, and so on,
so the grouping is more important than the things being grouped.
I think that concept should appear earlier in the name.

* you've probably already done most of the work, so why not
do it for other units of time too?  Hours can be grouped
by seconds, too :)

* i think that there must be something better than "group" to
express this idea, but i don't have anything to suggest at the
moment.
