The resulting entry will be:

SMUELLER comments:
I assume you're following brian's advice. The namespace brian suggested was Google::ProtocolBuffer (singular). I'll register your requested namespace (plural) for you. If you made a typo and wanted the namespace without the trailing s, let us know and we'll fix the registration.

Personally, I think "Google::ProtocolBuffers->new()" sounds a little strange with the plural form. But maybe that's just me.

Best regards,
Steffen
