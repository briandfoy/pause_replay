The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::ZH::bopomofo
  DSLIP:       bdpfb
  description: text processing between pinyin and zhuypin
  userid:      TOY (Jason Toy (朱仲光))
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is for converting and verifying Mandarin pinyin and
    Taiwan zhuyin. Lingua::ZH is for chinese text processing, so it goes
    there. It is not the same as Lingua::ZH::ZhuYinWen becuase of the
    approach of hwo the conversion is done and it will have more
    functionality. It will also work with unicode, while
    Lingua::ZH::ZhuYinWen only works with big5. The module has also been
    uploaded to CPAN

  enteredby:   TOY (Jason Toy (朱仲光))
  enteredon:   Thu Mar 25 00:26:21 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::ZH::
::bopomofo        bdpfb text processing between pinyin and zhuypin   TOY
