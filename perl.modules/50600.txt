Hi folks.

Despite sincere searching of cpan docs, perlmonks and perldoc, I have
yet to find what would seem to be a FAQ entry.

My firm needs to produce a module which is not suitable for distribution
via CPAN.  I have assumed that I could build a mini CPAN that contained
our private modules, yet allowed our customers to follow dependencies to
public modules our stuff depends on.  Our efforts to date have not been
very successful.

Is there something I should read that points us in the right direction?
It sort of feels like we are barking up the wrong tree.

Maybe my assumption is wrong: do folks publish vendor-specific modules
via CPAN?

Any pointers greatly appreciated...=20
