I have noticed that practically nothing submitted to the modules list has been registered in the last few months, where as prior to that there were typically a dozen new modules each week.

Does anyone know the reasons for this?  Have the registrars taken an extended leave, or are they focusing instead on the backend coding for nntp.x.perl.org?

I think that there are quite a few people now who are wanting to know.

Also, would it be practical to authorize extra people to do registrations?
