The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Compress::Archimedes
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Object Oriented zip and tar Compression
  userid:      NIRMA (Nicholas R. Maccharoli III)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:
    Chatrooms

  similar:
    Compress::Zlib

  rationale:

    I chose this as an extension of Compress due to the fact that I
    want to write a Class that allows an OOP Style Compression
    Interface. This should enable the user to zip and tarball data with
    out breaking the strict OOP Paradigm.

    NAME:

    The name Archimedes is a pun on "Archiving" what the intended
    module does. It is named in honor of the ancient mathematician,
    Scientist and Engineer Archimedes who's early ground work paved the
    way to such math topics that made the development of the LZ77 and
    LZ78 algorithms.

  enteredby:   NIRMA (Nicholas R. Maccharoli III)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr  3 18:27:38 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Compress::
::Archimedes      idpOp Object Oriented zip and tar Compression      NIRMA
