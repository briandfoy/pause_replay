The CCC has detected that your e-mail message is infected with a computer virus.  This may be because your PC has no anti-virus software, or because the software is out of date or incorrectly configured. The CCC has an obligation to its Members, staff, and all those with whom it communicates using e-mail, to ensure that all messages are virus-free. A policy is therefore in place to block your e-mail address at the CCC gateway. This means that ALL e-mail messages from you to Members or staff of CCC are blocked, with immediate effect, and will not be delivered.  If you rectify the problem by ensuring that your PC is being virus-scanned and is regularly updated and properly configured with an anti-virus product installed, please contact the CIS Helpdesk on 01228 606630. You will need to provide your e-mail address, and the name, version number and virus definition number of the anti-virus software you have installed. Your e-mail account will then be unblocked and you will be able to resume sending messages.
