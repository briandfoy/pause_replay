Kurt,

I'm dreadfully sorry to bother you with that.  I think I forgot to take my
medication.

Actually, P::C::P (as we like to call it), has been something of a joke
the past few weeks.  I was kidding when I sent that, and I would've been
much surprised had that been deemed an acceptable module for the likes of
CPAN.  I think I just had a good idea for a real module to work on.  You
just may get more mail from me in the near future.

Thank you for your patience, and have a nice day.
