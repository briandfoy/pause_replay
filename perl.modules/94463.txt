Subject: Could you please delete JCDUQUE's Digest::SHA2 uploads from the
 CPAN?

Hi. I'm the current maintainer of Digest::SHA2. I'm aware that I can
log into PAUSE and delete my uploads, but then the CPAN will fall back
on the previous maintainer's uploads.

The module has been deprecated since 2007. Below is an E-mail exchange
with the original maintainer (JCDUQUE) where he agrees that deleting
his uploaded versions is just fine. He's forgotten his PAUSE password
so he can't do it himself.

If you could kindly delete the ones he uploaded I could log into PAUSE
and delete mine, which would remove it from the CPAN, thank you.

I'm aware that the module still has some reveres dependencies. I've
filed bugs against all the distributions that currently use it, and
will give them time to migrate before deleting the module from my
PAUSE account.

Thanks!

Hi,

Thanks for contacting me. Yes, please delete my module Digest::SHA2. I
can't remember my password in PAUSE already.

Regards,
