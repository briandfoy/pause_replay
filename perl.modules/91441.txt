The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Backup::Datto
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Interface to Datto Backup Statistics
  userid:      MTOPPER (Matthew Topper)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I have several modules pertaining to Datto's backup system,
    representing different parts.

    I'm new to uploading modules to CPAN, so I hope that uploading it
    as Backup::Datto is the correct method (my distribution consists of
    Backup::Datto::Device, Backup::Datto::Agent, and
    Backup::Datto::Collection for now).

    I got a message that the Backup:: namespace is registered under
    chapter 17 already. Is this the wrong place for this type of module?
    I'm wondering if the Backup:: top level name was meant for modules
    that perform backups. This one is gathering statistics on a backup.

    Thanks, Matt
