     why:

    I have offered (and he has accepted) to take over the maintenance
    of the Bryar module by Simon Cozens. I also have a family CMS
    application I am writing in perl and HTML::Mason that will work
    similar to the website, myfamily.com, with probably eventually more
    features than they offer for families. I will also be integrating
    Bryar in as the blogging component for this project.
