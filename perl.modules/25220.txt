I sent this a month or two ago, and never got a response. Is this the 
correct address for this sort of thing?

Subject: WWW::Search::PubMed

The WWW::Search::PubMed module is broken and has been for quite some 
time. It was last updated over three years ago, and as far as I can 
tell has been broken for the majority of that period. I attempted to 
contact the author, Jim Smyser <jsmyser@bigfoot.com>, to offer to take 
over ownership of the module, but email to that address is bounced by 
bigfoot with the message "This account is not 
allowed...jsmyser@bigfoot.com."

Is there an established protocol for dealing with a situation like 
this? I've got a new version of the module that works that I'd be ready 
to upload, but I believe I'd need to be listed as a co-maintainer of 
the module before this could happen (is this correct?).

Any help you could provide would be appreciated.

thank you,
Gregory Williams
