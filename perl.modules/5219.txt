Hello to all of you !

It's been a long time since I last posted to "modules", but
here I'm back again.

For academical reasons, I've been playing with the libcrypto
from the OpenSSL project, and I've came with a usable BigNumber
cryptographically oriented Perl module. While investigating
more deeply the library, I came upon the idea of writing a
bundle of modules implementing from low to high level the
crypto algorithms available in the libcrypto. It's maybe --
let me know your opinion about it -- a little bit duplicate
with the MCrypt, but I really like the OpenSSL implementation
and I think it's worth contributing. But that's _my_ opinion,
of course.

As the name 'OpenSSL' cannot be freely used (because of the
license terms), I was thinking of

Crypto::LibCrypto::*

namespace, with sub-modules as

Crypto::LibCrypto::BN for BIGNUM interface
Crypto::LibCrypto::RSA for RSA interface
Crypto::LibCrypto::IDEA for IDEA interface

and so on (like the prefixes in the OpenSSL API)...

Just let me know your thoughts about it. I've already a fully
implemented (but not yet documented) OO and overloaded ::BN
implementation available (with random and primes generation),
which I could submit very quickly.

Best regards to all of you,

François Désarménien
