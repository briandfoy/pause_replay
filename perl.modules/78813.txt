I just recently uploaded CPAN::Testers::ParseReport which has this line:

    use version; our $VERSION = qv('0.2.0');

and pause indexed it.

I'm sorry that your variations thereof do not parse as you expect. I'm
surprised myself. It's not easy to navigate through all the variations
of version trickery. The above incantation is what Damian Conway has
reommended in PBP and that is what pause tries to support as long as
possible.
