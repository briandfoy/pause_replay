Hi Tim, hi Jeff,

Jeff, if you're getting this email twice, it's because I'm using two 
possible email addresses.

Noted, thanks.

Tim: I searched the net for contact information for getting in touch 
with Jeff. The jeffrodriguez.com domain seems to be unreachable. Maybe 
that's why he didn't get your mail. I *think* I found him on linkedin at
http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyrodriguez/, but since I don't have 
(and refuse to buy) a "premium" membership, I can't use the network to 
contact him. Maybe if you know somebody who's into that kind of thing, 
you could use that avenue to let Jeff know.

Best regards,
Steffen
