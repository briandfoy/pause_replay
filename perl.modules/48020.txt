The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::QuizTaker
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Create and take your own quizzes and tests
  userid:      TSTANLEY (Thomas Stanley)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://www.perlmonks.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    I wanted to be able to put together a quiz that I could use when
    study for certifications. It originally started off as a simple
    script, then I got the idea to turn it into a module.

    To my immediate knowledge, this module is the only one of its kind
    on CPAN.

    The newest version (2.0) represents a whole new way of doing
    things. It uses the Object::InsideOut module to represent the
    object, which provides it with much better encapsulation and more
    secure code.
