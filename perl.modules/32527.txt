     why:

    I am working on developing a frontend for flac123, a command line
    flac music player. This is to be the major component of a flac music
    player, aflac, also written in perl, that attempts to replicate the
    ipod interface on an lcd, using proclcd to write to the lcd. This
    program will be controlled using an IR remote and is intended to be
    run as a music appliance in a home or car setting. Eventually, I
    will post instructions on how to build this computer so that it
    boots up quickly, (root partition on a CF card) and starts my aflac
    program. There will be a hard drive in the computer that contains
    all the flac files, more file types to come later, and aflac will
    generate an XML database file with all the flac file info for use in
    the browse section of the interface. I guess that is more than you
    needed, hehe. Thanks! Joshua
