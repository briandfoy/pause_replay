I think we should either remove very old dists from CPAN, or update them =
to follow modern conventions (so they have a META.yml or META.json, for =
example). I had email with the author of CGI::Response (last released in =
1995) for example, and he agreed that it should be removed from CPAN.

I had a look at all the dists that were last released in 1995 and wrote =
up my thoughts on them:

	http://neilb.org/2015/04/30/curating-old-releases.html =
<http://neilb.org/2015/04/30/curating-old-releases.html>

Where people think dists shouldn=E2=80=99t be removed, I=E2=80=99m happy =
to try adopt them to release minimal updates, where I=E2=80=99m able to.

I=E2=80=99m interested to hear what others think.

Neil
