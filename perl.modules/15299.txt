Can you really help? I always loved running. And I want to go faster. You see, this is as close as I can get to flying. And I think if I find a way to run way faster, I can achive that special feeling again. Please help me. 

I also plan to be a traveller, so I also think that if I can run fast, I may be able to get to my destination faster, or protect my friends better when they are in trouble. So, as you can see, I don't want to do it for just myself...
