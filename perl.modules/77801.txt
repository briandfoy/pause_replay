Subject: Module submission RPC::ExtDirect

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RPC::ExtDirect
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Generic ExtJS Ext.Direct interface for Perl
  userid:      TOKAREV (Alexander Tokarev)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Dunno yet

  similar:
    CatalystX::ExtJS::Direct

  rationale:

    CatalystX::ExtJS::Direct is dependent on Catalyst framework, and
    therefore is only applicable to Catalyst based projects. Not all
    kinds of Web applications require this kind of firepower; there are
    environments where Catalyst (and its dependencies Moose and Plack)
    just do not fit. RPC::ExtDirect provides full ExtJS 4.0 compliant
    Ext.Direct interface implementation for Perl, while being dependent
    on only one non-code module (Attribute::Handlers) and compatible
    down to Perl 5.6. While being compatible to older systems,
    RPC::ExtDirect also tries to provide benefit for modern environments
    such as Plack. Environment specific gateways for RPC::ExtDirect are,
    at this point, CGI::ExtDirect and Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect;
    Apache::ExtDirect is next possibility if I ever need it (somebody
    else is welcome to implement).

    Summary: I would like to claim RPC::ExtDirect, CGI::ExtDirect and
    Plack::Middleware::ExtDirect namespaces for core modules and
    gateways.

    Well, maybe RPC::ExtDirect is not the best name for this module.
    I'm open to suggestions.

    Regards, Alex.

The resulting entry would be:
