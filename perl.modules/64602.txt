The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Drupal::Admin
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: screenscraping API to drupal admin functions
  userid:      DURIST (Dan Urist)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module will offer a limited API to the drupal administrative
    interface, which will allow for useful functionality such as
    scripted drupal core upgrades and drupal module management.
    Currently drupal does not provide a way to script these functions
    which makes dealing with multiple site installations a real hassle.

  enteredby:   DURIST (Dan Urist)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 18 05:06:47 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Drupal::
::Admin           adpOp screenscraping API to drupal admin functions DURIST
