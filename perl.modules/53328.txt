     why:

    Unfortunately, no particular plan at the moment. I have several
    small Perl modules which I use regularly, and which may be of use to
    other people, but it is not certain 1) when I will have time to
    clean them up to a distributable package, and 2) if they really are
    useful to anyone else. As for the latter, I will definitely use
    PerlMonks as a sounding board first.

    One example, which I meant to first submit in 2004, is a wrapper to
    libvorbis (and libogg) and allows you to encode Ogg Vorbis streams
    from within Perl. It uses Inline::C. However, I have not used or
    needed it since 2004, and it is uncertain when I will find time to
    expand it to a good module. (The two years may prove to be
    indespensable, because I have now more experience with C and Perl/C
    interfacing.)

    I am currently working on my Master's thesis, and am implementing
    the software part in Perl. It involves parsing massive mzXML files
    (http://sashimi.sf.net) (using XML::Twig), plotting them on screen
    using PDL and Prima, manipulating the data (PDL), and then writing
    it back as mzXML again. I will very likely want to share the code,
    once it is ready (which may take a couple of months).
