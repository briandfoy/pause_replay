The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::LCCN
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Use Library of Congress Control Numbers/LCCN
  userid:      ANIRVAN (Anirvan Chatterjee)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    LCCNs are book identifiers generated by the United States Library
    of Congress, used widely in United States libraries.

    There are at least three other print media identifiers under the
    Business::* namespace: Business::ISBN, Business::ISMN, and
    Business::LCCN. Given that mini-pattern, I'd suggest naming this
    module Business::LCCN.

    Another good alternative would be to name this Biblio::LCCN.

    The word "biblio" is very descriptive, but unfortunately, the
    Biblio::* namespace is very underused.

  enteredon:   Mon Apr  7 05:35:28 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::LCCN            bdpOp Use Library of Congress Control Numbers/LCCN ANIRVAN
