     why:

    To start off with, I'd like to set up the module I talked about
    here: http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=716747. I figure I should start
    small with this whole public-release-of-modules thing, and that's
    pretty small :-)

    But I'm trying to get the bosses here to let me open-source more of
    the code I write at work, and I'd love to help out with
    orphaned/unmaintained projects as well.
