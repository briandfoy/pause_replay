"denomination", or maybe "tradition"

I'm very much aware of that, and the intent for this module is that users
will be able to pass in a named option stating which tradition they want to
use. All of the liturgical churches, as far as I'm aware, have a year
similar to the cycle of Advent - Christmas - Lent - Easter - Pentecost or
Trinity; there are variations between them, but these will be better served
by having one module with options, or perhaps mixins, than several separate
modules with large amounts of copy-and-pasted code.

(It's not just denominations: the calendar as used by Anglicans in the US is
different from that used by Anglicans in England, for example, because it
marks different saints' days.)

peace
