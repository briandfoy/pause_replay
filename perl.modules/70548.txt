Absolutely.  I've meant to do work on it a few times and kept getting
dragged away by other things.  I also got blocked by wanting to make
changes to how Filesys::Virtual worked to allow properties to be stored
a-la xattrs, and to view quota information - but didn't get a very
enthusiastic response - so I shelved it.  The problem is, I'm running a
very forked N:D:S inhouse at FastMail - and I've never found the tuits
to backport all the changes and remove our custom filesystem interface
from it!

Of course, being shamed by this... I'm going to try to find the tuits,
but I'd love your help, and you're very welcome as a maintainer.

Thanks,

Bron.
