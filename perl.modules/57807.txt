The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::Dynamic
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Basic and dynamic/custom logging
  userid:      JCONERLY (James Conerly)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Log Log::Logger Log::Log4perl

  rationale:

    (From the POD)

    Yet another darn logger? Why d00d?

    Well, I wanted to write a lite weight logging module that...

    * developers could use in a way that felt natural to them and it
    would just work,

    * was adaptable enough that it could be used in dynamic, ever
    changing environments,

    * was flexible enough to satisfy most logging needs without too
    much overhead,

    * and gave developers full control over handling the myriad of log
    events that occur in large applications.

    Log::Dynamic still has a ways to go, but the direction seems
    promising. Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::Dynamic         adpOp Basic and dynamic/custom logging             JCONERLY
