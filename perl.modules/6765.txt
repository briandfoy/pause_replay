I've uploaded a new release of Sort::Versions to the PAUSE.  The
original author was Kenneth J. Albanowski, but I was unable to contact
him.  (Looking at mailing list archives it seems he has been missing for
several years.)

Anyway, this version is an enhancement to the version-comparison
algorithm to make it recognize 'decimal' version numbers, where leading
zeroes are significant.  For example, 5.6 should be considered newer
than 5.00503 (previously, 6 < 503, so it was considered older).

I hope you can register me as the new owner of this module.
