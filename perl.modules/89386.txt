     why:

    I'd like to develop CPAN modules, and by getting a better idea
    about how they work I wish to enhance my Perl programming skills.

    > There are 61 modules developed for the language Turkish. It'd be
    a nice experience to help on these, and maybe develop something that
    is not being though of yet. > There are hundreds of modules for
    Facebook, Twitter and other popular social networks. But there is
    none for the famous Turkish one (eksisozluk). I'm planning to
    develop one for that. I actually have a perl script that's still
    working (http://github.com/kyzn/eksidebe) but I believe it'd be nice
    to make its basic operations into a module that anyone can use.

    Sincerely.
