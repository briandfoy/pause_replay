Subject: The userid TERJE
X-Mailer: VM 6.75 under Emacs 20.6.1

From: terjebr@pvv.ntnu.no (Terje Br}ten)

I just found by searching for my own name at some search engines the UR=
L
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/1999-05/msg00123.html
where  I found that I have been given an account at PAUSE server after =
all.
I thought that did not get any answer to my request for an account,
but now I see that got an account, but I had given you an e-mail
address that do not work, and that is why I have never got that mail.

If you would please change the E-mail address for the account TERJE
to TerjeBr@pvv.ntnu.no that would be nice. If you also could re-send
the mail with the procedure of password approval to this mail address
I would be really happy.

You can check that Terje@pvv.ntnu.no is an address that is not working
by trying to send something to that address. You will discover that the=

mail bounces back to you.
