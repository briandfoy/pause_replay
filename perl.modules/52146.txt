The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Hash::Sorted
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Presents hashes in sorted order
  userid:      JGATCOMB (Joshua Gatcomb)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    PerlMonks

  similar:
    Tie::IxHash Tie::SortHash

  rationale:

    Relationship between Tie::Hash::Sorted and Tie::IxHash,
    Tie::SortHash COMPARISON Q: Is this module any different from
    Tie::IxHash or Tie::SortHash? A: Yes, let me explain

    Tie::IxHash vs Tie::Hash::Sorted: Tie::IxHash: Preserves insertion
    order Provides two sort routines, SortByKey & SortByValue, using
    textual compare Tie::Hash::Sorted Order is maintained regardless of
    insertion order Arbitrary sorting, may be changed at any time

    Tie::SortHash vs Tie::Hash::Sorted Tie::SortHash: Uses pseudo
    hashes (a deprecated perl feature) Uses eval("...") for sorting To
    generate the sorted list one time: Re-sort the list as many times as
    there are keys Loop over the hash as many times as there are keys,
    stopping on match Compare current key against last key (keys^2 +
    keys)/2 times Slow No support for lexical variables in sorting code
    Inflexible calling syntax Tie::Hash::Sorted Uses no deprecated perl
    features (tested from 5.004_3 .. 5.8.1) Uses a proper code reference
    To generate the sorted list one time: Potentially re-sort the list
    one time Add one to an iterator, and lookup the corresponding array
    element Potentially slow but with opportunities for optimization
    Supports lexicals, closures, etc flexible/expandable calling syntax

    WHY I WROTE IT Tie::SortHash was a perfect answer to a question on
    PerlMonks (http://www.perlmonks.org) Unfortunately it had a lot of
    issues with it and I received no response from the author.
    Originally, I wanted an drop in replacement, but it became nearly
    impossible to do that and maintain backwards compatability.

    I chose this name space because it clearly explained what the
    module does

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::Hash::
::Sorted          Rdphp Presents hashes in sorted order              JGATCOMB
