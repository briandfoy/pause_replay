Despite the fact that I don't know much about XML, I think that having
a simple API written in pure perl (i.e. portable and easy to install)
is a good thing.

But, you will need to change the name of the module to XML::MiniXML or
XML::Mini (but this name looses the filiation ...) so that it can be
listed with other XML::* modules

Thanks for proposing

Cheers
