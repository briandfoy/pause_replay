Subject: Module submission CGI::Class

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Class
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Create a CGI application by subclassing
  userid:      TBONE (Terrence Brannon)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    irc://irc.perl.org/perl-help

  similar:
    CGI::Prototype

  rationale:

    CGI::Class is so-named because the module aims to create a CGI
    application from a series of classes addressing each aspect of the
    CGI request cycle.

    It is a direct descendant of CGI::Prototype which was implemented
    using Class::Prototyped. However the author of CGI::Prototype has
    made it clear that only prototype-based object systems belong in his
    distribution, hence this fork of his work.

  enteredby:   TBONE (Terrence Brannon)
  enteredon:   Fri Sep  4 10:08:02 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
::Class           bdpOa Create a CGI application by subclassing      TBONE
