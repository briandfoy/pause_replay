We use the CallingPost primarily to remind and encourage everyone to
attend our monthly meetings. We also use this system to quickly notify
everyone about training opportunities or anything else that comes along
before our next meeting. 
It has more than doubled attendance at our meetings and literally saved
us hours on the phone which converts to money saved!! 
It is the greatest system I have ever seen...I would highly recommend
this to anyone who has more than 5 people to call on a regular basis.
