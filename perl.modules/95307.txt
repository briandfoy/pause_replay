Hi y'all,

I've uploaded a new package, App-Music-ChordPro. It has gone through several
uploads for the last couple of days. The first version was 0.51, the most
recent upload is 0.52.2.

The packages appears in the CPAN collection (www.cpan.org) a couple
of hours after each upload, but they still do not appear in the MetaCPAN.
When I look at my stuff in the metacpan, I notice there are more packages
missing. Amongst these is EekBoek, one of my important packages.

Since people are moving from CPAN to MetaCPAN, this is becoming more than
just a nuisance.

Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks for your help.
