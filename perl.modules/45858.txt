Do you mean HTML::Entities::Encode? I think HTML::Entities::Encode's 
function is different one from mine. But, module URI might have similar 
functions with a part of mine. However, I think, URI's direction is 
somehow different and is rather large scale.

Hmm, my intention is to provide a simple module which have minimal 
functions to be used from CGI program. Indeed, it can be said not a 
essential one.
