What embarrasses me with a name like Win32::Console::ANSI, it's
that one can think that ANSI is an extension of Win32::Console.
But this module doesn't add any functionality, no method, to
Win32::Console. It uses Win32::Console behind the scene; the user
doesn't have access to an Win32::Console-object or method.
It's because Win32::ANSIConsole doesn't have an interface :-)
It works like a pragma.
The user adds "use Win32::ANSIConsole;" in the beginning of his
script and that's all!
This 'pseudo-pragma' overloads the 'print' function  to permit
the interpretation of the escape-codes. It's transparent for the user.
In my opinion, it is more natural to write:
   use Win32::ANSIConsole;
   use Term::ANSIColor;
   ...etc
or
   use Win32::ANSIConsole;
   use Term::ANSIScreen;
   ...etc

Of course, it's only my opinion; it's subjective :-)
