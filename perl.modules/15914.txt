The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Spellcheck
  DSLIP:       RmpOa
  description: Spellcheck- a generic spellchecking module
  userid:      GCLASS (Gregory Class)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    CVS, maillinglist

  similar:
    Text::Aspell, Lingua::Ispell

  rationale:

    Why I wrote it:

    Roughly a year ago, I wrote an internal tool for our suite of tools
    and used the Lingua::Ispell interface for spellchecking.
    Unfortunately, the interface was not very clean and generated
    several problems when I was using it in Modperl. Developers at my
    work ended up contributing some fixes to that module but eventually
    decided it didn't suit all of our needs. Additionally, I ended up
    having to wrap the module with more code to make it work well for
    checking text in webpages. As a result of these problems I had with
    existing modules, I set out to write a newer simpler checker module.
    Last summer I wrote that easier-to-use module. It works in modperl
    and is very easy to integrate in tools. I even wrote an inherited
    module that allows client classes to spellcheck form elements with
    only one function call. The reason I wrote this module was because
    there was no existing module that had a minimal or complete enough
    interface to suit my Spellchecking needs.

    Rationale for Namespace:

    First of all, all this module is designed to do is Spellcheck. It's
    not designed to be a wrapper for a specific type of command line
    spellchecker or a specific type of input.

    Secondly, the module is not bound to any one type of command line
    checker because the method that interfaces an external spellchecker
    is loosely coupled to the rest of the module. Changing a
    configuration directive when the object is created could change the
    command used to check the text.

    Finally, I have written other inherited modules that are designed
    to be used in specific types of documents, notably Text and HTML so
    it makes sense for a usage for spellcheck to be Spellcheck::HTML or
    Spellcheck::TEXT. It'd make sense to do new modules in the namespace
    that spellcheck XML or POD, or whatever.

    To sum things up, this spellchecker module is written to be
    extended for different types of input, so it naturally should exist
    as a new root namespace.
