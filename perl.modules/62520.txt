Sure there is. Shift it to the new namespace and add shims for all class
methods that make things carry on working - or just make OpenGL an empty
package that does "use base qw(Graphics::OpenGL::POGL);" or whatever.

I've done this many times - that's how Class::Accessor::Grouped and
Class::C3::Componentised were factored out of DBIx::Class (where they were
DBIx::Class::AccessorGroup and ::Componentised respectively).

Something like Sub::Exporter will make it trivial for you to delegate
exports as well.

If you actually do consider it legacy and are interested in trying to
change it, I've no objection to taking this discussion somewhere more
suitable and helping you get through the process, provided you'd be willing
to write up what you did so we've got a document to point the next guy
needing to do this at :)
