     why:

    Hi, I am interested in the Net::YahooMessenger module which needs
    to be changed according to the new version(16) of the YM protocol. I
    am already using a custom version of this module that works for
    latest YM version. I am also interested in taking over the module,
    the actual maintainer(Tatsuhiko Miyagawa) seems to want this. I will
    contact him after I receive the PAUSE ID.

    Thank you!
