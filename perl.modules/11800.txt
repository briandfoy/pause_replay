Subject: Wrong IO::Multiplex version

These compile errors are happening because IO::Multiplex
is still out of date on the cpan list:

http://cpan.org/modules/01modules.index.html

You can get the latest version (1.02) from

http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=IO-Multiplex

I've been trying to maintain IO::Multiplex,
but I cannot contact LIRAZ (liraz_siri@usa.net)
who has control over the module.  I always get
bad email errors like the following:

---------
Hi. This is the qmail-send program at onion.perl.org.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<liraz_siri@usa.net>:
165.212.8.32 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 <liraz_siri@usa.net>... User not known
Giving up on 165.212.8.32.
---------

<liraz_siri@usa.net>: host mxpool01.netaddress.usa.net[165.212.8.32] said: 550 <liraz_siri@usa.net>... User not known

---------

I've also been trying to work with Bruce Keeler
(BRUCEK) who has contributed to IO::Multiplex
as well, but I'm not sure there is much he can
do either.  To fix this problem, I believe
that either LIRAZ must be contacted, or the
control should be changed to someone that is
willing to take over.  Can modules@perl.org
help?

PS: I have IO::Multiplex in my CVS server if you'd
like to checkout the latest source or verify the
history logs or provide patches or whatever:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.roobik.com.:/usr/local/cvsroot/freeware co IO-Multiplex
