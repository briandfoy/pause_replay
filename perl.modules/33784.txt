Dear Friends,
Myself Abhishek jain have requested for a New namespace SMS::API on 
24/07/2004 . However it has yet not been registerd yet .
Please register it soon or tell me the general time for being registerd.
I have uploaded the file but it not being seen at 
http://search.cpan.org/~goyali/ 
Please tell me when will it be visible. ie. how much is the general 
time to be visible.
Also as a friend please tell me how to make this module popular 
according to me it is a very important module as this module integrates 
one's application with the various servers to send SMS. At present only 
servers of http://www.goyali.com is supported.
I am not promoting the module here but giving you a briefing so that 
you can suggest me how to promote the module. I am new to programming 
and does require help.
Please help me and do reply to this email.
I shall be very very grateful.
Regards
Abhishek jain
