    App::Tasker - Filename component-directed scripting that considers
    dependencies

    It's like a make with a larger problem domain and without built-in
    implicit rules. Taskfiles define rules for creating files based on
    input files; filenames and paths can contain multiple fields,
    optionally matched with regexes, which are assigned to named
    variables. Target audience is users (who may not primarily be
    programmers) who need to automate the processing of scientific data
    on *nix using command line tools.
