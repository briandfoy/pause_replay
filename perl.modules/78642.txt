Maybe if you give us an example of what you were trying to do, someone
call tell you how to do it with a module that already exists. That way
you don't have to maintain a new module :)

As for the name, what sort of processing does your module do? It's best
to give your users a hint of that in the name. We have some help for
choosing a good name.
