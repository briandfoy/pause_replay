The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Convert::ToImage
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Converts Text to images in various formats
  userid:      HARRY (Harry Jackson)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    PerlMagick

  rationale:

    I was looking for a simple text to image converter and the simplest
    thing I found was PerlMagick which is not really a converter at all.
    Since PerlMagick is a lot more complicated than what I needed I
    started writing a wrapper to it and decided to release it to CPAN.

    I am not sure if the name is correct and would appreciate any
    advice as to what would be suitable. I noticed that I could use

    Convert::ToImage

    but this is not really as descriptive as

    Text::Convert::ToImage

    If the name above is suitable do I also need to register

    Text::Convert

    as a seperate registration because it has not been registered yet
    or will it automatically be registered.

    Regards, Harry

Text::Convert::
::ToImage         adpOp Converts Text to images in various formats   HARRY
