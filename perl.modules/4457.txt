I have a module ready to upload to PAUSE.  It provides access to the
hosts_ctl() function from libwrap.  The module is actually three years old
but due to an administrative oversight I never uploaded it. Long story.

Back in 1998, the tentative name was Authen::Libwrap.  The only issue is
that  most everything else in Authen, this module doesn't keep stock of any
authentication info.  I just provides perl-driven access to the existing
/etc/hosts.allow file.

Anu issues with that name ?  The module (with the old name) is available at

http://www.ehlo.com/~james/TCP_Wrappers-0.10.tar.gz

if anyone wants to look over it.
