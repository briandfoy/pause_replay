Hi,
Our Cyprus based newspaper, Free Classifieds, is running a special issue
looking at jobs in the Med. As part of a promotion we're offering businesss
based in the Mediterranean a chance to advertise any vacancies for free. If
you have any vacancies or job openings (or would yourself consider seeking
employment in Cyprus), you can email us here or visit our newspaper site
at: http://www.freeclassifiedswebsite.com
Free Classifieds is regarded as the islands's notice board and is published
fortnightly with 6,000 copies sold across Cyprus.
The next issue of the paper is due out next week Friday.  If you'd like a
complimentary copy with your ad in it, please let me know and we'll get a
copy over to you.


Regards,



Sally  (FC Advertising)
