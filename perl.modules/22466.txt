Astro::Telescope (http://search.cpan.org/author/TJENNESS/Astro-Telescope-0.50/) 
is not picked up by the CPAN indexer and this is causing some problems
since neither CPAN nor CPANPLUS will install it. I think the problem is
that the first release of Astro::Telescope (the module) was part of my
Astro::Coords distribution and now the indexer refuses to acknowledge the
presence of Astro::Telescope (the distribution) since it was not the first
occurenece of the module namespace. I've removed old versions of
Astro::Coords that included Astro::Telescope. Is it possible that the
indexer can be fixed such that Astro::Telescope appears?
