I sent a submission request to the list a long time ago, and thought I had
been given the go-ahead.  I only now have a semi-stable implementation.

This module was given a green light by the list as well.  As I explained then,
this is an analogue to Parse::PerlConfig, except that this is human-readable.
The author of that module and I had worked together (at the same company) and
we had coded our applications to be able to use either system, as specified by
the user's preference.

I will point a few differences between my module and ConfigReader::Simple:  my
module has no non-core dependencies, compared to a rather large list of
dependencies for ConfigReader::Simple.  Furthermore, my module appears to
support more data types, programmer-defined key/value delimiters, and also
writes configuration hashes to files, preserving existing comments or adding
new ones.  All while trying to keep the actual conf files as human-readable as
possible.

In short, as a companion to Parse::PerlConfig and a parser/generator, it makes
more sense IMHO to leave it where it is.  Not to mention that I've already got
a substantial number of users using this module who would have to update a lot
of scripts if there was a name-space change.
