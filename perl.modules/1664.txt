Hi,

On 4.4.2000 I registered to pause. My username is MSCHLUE. Next day I
uploaded

MSCHLUE   Class-Classgen-classgen-3.00.tar.gz, which is "adpo  ".

I've seen my upload moving until the 'recentness'-stage on CPAN during th=
e
next days. It does not appear in the module-list and I can not edit it vi=
a
pause
(off course).

What went wrong? E.g. GMCCAR's Mutator seemed to take only a few days to =

appear in the module-list.

When uploading to pause I have no way to specify DLSI. How to do that?

With kind regards,
Michael Schlueter
