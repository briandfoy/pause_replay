Is there really no module that does this already? Have you looked at
GTop?

It has been violent agreement in the modules librarians circles that
Sys:: is a bad prefix because it tends to become a bit basket. Maybe
you could live with Unix::? Or Linux::? or BSD::? Or does your module
really cover all platforms?

Please keep us informed what you find out and what you decide.
