Yes, this code breaks the indexer. May I ask you to move that code
further down after your own $VESION declaration? Alternatively break
it up differently until it passes this test to your satisfaction:

    perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -le 'print MM->parse_version(shift)' DBSchema/DBD/Pg.pm 

There may still be cases where this test succeeds and the indexer
chokes (Safe.pm is added into the equation), but these are rare.

Thanks, for now this place is good, I'll get an appropriate RT queue
when I release PAUSE.pm, which I promised years ago:-(
