I have seen no objections or questions on this module since I posted 
the registration request 5 days ago.  (It is a relatively simple 
module and should be easy to understand; plus, it is actually 
Released, rather than beta etc.)  Meanwhile, other modules have been 
approved within a day of being requested.

Can you please approve the registration for Locale::KeyedText now?

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
