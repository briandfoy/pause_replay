Currently, two ids have been assigned to you: IPLOC and IPTOLOC.
Unfortunately, both ids should not have been assigned anyway, since we
(try to) maintain a policy that CPAN ids are related to persons, not
to companies. This is due to the fact to often people within companies
change jobs, making it hard to track who is responsible for
modules.

So I propose that we will withdraw IPLOC and IPTOLOC, and that you
apply for a --personal-- CPAN id.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

Regards,

        Johan
