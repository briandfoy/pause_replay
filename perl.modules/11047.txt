have written bindings for TDB (tridge/samba's Trivial DataBase)
(tied hash and OO interfaces).

the perl bindings distributed with TDB are incomplete, don't cope with
8bit keys and is rather embarrassing code-wise (to be blunt), so i
rewrote them from scratch.

i was planning to name it TDB_File (similar to DB_File, etc) - but
that's probably not desirable. advice sought.


also written perl bindings for aegis (a GPLed SCM tool) and for the
"ldapfilter" and "ldaptemplates" functionality in openldap, but they
need a bit more work before releasing.
