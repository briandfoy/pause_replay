	People get Perl modules from CPAN.  If one distributes a Perl
	module, that's /the/ place to put it.  I was /asked/ to put it
	there.

	I never asked for advice.  I'm not looking for /anything/ from
	modules@perl.org other than disk space.  I simply wanted to put
	the file where the requester(s) asked it to be put.

	Recommendation noted.
