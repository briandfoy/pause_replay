An attempt to send this message yesterday from my yahoo account failed,
apparently due to "Strict DMARC policies at aol and yahoo". So I am trying
again using an account which is not the one registered at CPAN; that one
has the same username, but, obviously, a different domain than this one,
and is cc'ed on this message. Anyhow, down to business:

I have been unable to contact the listed maintainer of Date::Convert. I
attempted to do so on July 27 (to morty@umbc.edu) and August 23 (to that
address and morty@cpan.org and bug-DateConvert@rt.cpan.org); I received
bounce messages from the umbc address, and no response from his CPAN email
address. He lists a home page in CPAN, but it appears to have not been
updated since at least 1996. The current version of the module itself dates
back to at least 2000.

I discovered, and fixed, some bugs with the code as distributed. I would
like to share the fix with the rest of the community. I formally reported
some bugs on August 23 (bug #98287 -
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=98287), and have received no
response. There was already a report of a different bug which is pretty
easily resolved (https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55145);
that bug has been open since March 2010 with no response. I would fix that
problem at the same time as I fix those which I reported.

I signed up with CPAN id OLEIBMAN for the express purpose of fixing this
module. Please advise whether I can do so. Thanks.
