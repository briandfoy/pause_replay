The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::UniqueNames
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Make sure all of your test names are unique
  userid:      HEUMANN (Josh Heumann)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::NoWarnings

  rationale:

    Using a similar interface to Test::NoWarnings, Test::UniqueNames
    adds one test to a test script that ensures that all test names were
    identifiable.

    Tests without names are failures by default, although this is
    configurable. Tests that generate their own names like isa_ok are
    excluded.

  enteredby:   HEUMANN (Josh Heumann)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug 15 13:26:30 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::UniqueNames     adpOp Make sure all of your test names are unique  HEUMANN
