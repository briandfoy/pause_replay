From: neil@bowers.com (Neil Bowers)

A week ago I posted a proposal for a voluntary pledge, which CPAN
module authors could sign up to. With Bill Ward's tweak to the wording,
the discussion on per-distribution stating, and generalising the RT =
point:

   I hereby give modules@perl.org permission to grant co-maintainership
   to [% distribution %], if all the following conditions are met:

   (1) I haven't released the module for a year or more
   (2) There are outstanding issues in the module's public bug tracker
   (3) Email to my CPAN email address hasn't been answered after a month
   (4) The requester wants to make worthwhile changes that will benefit =
CPAN

   In the event of my death, then the time-limits in (1) and (3) do not =
apply.

In the discussion on module-authors, and talking to people at the London
Perl Workshop (LPW): about 60% thought it was a good idea, 20% a bad =
idea, and
20% indifferent. Most of the 'bad' being "it works that way already".

Talking to people at LPW, a number commented (paraphrasing):

    Just email the author, wait a month,
    then push modules@perl.org for a handover

Which to me doesn't quite match the spirit of the PAUSE "taking over" =
process
described at http://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=3Dpause_04about

I recently took over a module after 2 months, during which I tried a =
number
of ways to track down the author, mailed various other people, and =
posted
to module-authors. That seemed appropriate, because the author had =
clearly
put a lot of thought and effort into this, and his other modules.

So, I went to Andreas Koenig, since he has more experience of module =
handovers
than most of us! The group behind modules@perl.org have to balance two =
sides:
respecting individual authors, and helping the continued development of =
CPAN.
If none of the group know the current author, they have to err on
the author's side, not CPAN:

    "I've heard too many upset developers going berserk because they =
felt
     [their module was expropriated]"

Asked whether he thought an explicit pledge would be useful, Andreas =
said:

    "An explicit statement in a distribution like the one in your =
picture
     would make our lives a lot easier"

As a number of others commented, Andreas feels it should be stated on
a per-distribution basis, and not per-author.

In a side-discussion, it was pointed out that sometimes an author would
be happy for someone else to take over the module.
In this case the covenant would become:

   I hereby give modules@perl.org permission to grant lead authorship
   to [% distribution %], if the following conditions are met:

   (1) There are outstanding issues in the module's public bug tracker
   (2) The requester wants to make worthwhile changes that will benefit =
CPAN

There are at least three ways this could be provided:

    (a) a file included in the distribution. Eg Covenant.txt
    (b) text in the README
    (c) a feature on PAUSE, where you can select the "ownership status"
        or similar

The problem with (c), is that it's not very public; the information =
needs
to be closely associated with the distribution itself. To make things
easy for all involved, I think (a) is probably the best. The downside =
with
this is that having lost interest in one of your distributions, you now
have to do a release to let the (Perl) world know. The alternative would
be to email the covenant to modules@perl.org: that's publicly archived,
so your covenant could be found, especially once a convention
has been established.
