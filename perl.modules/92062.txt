Hi Rick

I see LZAP is registered in the module list, but is not the primary 
maintainer. He could log on to PAUSE and make you primary maint. Perhaps 
suggest that to him. Or, if you think he's not interested, keep reading....

Do you actually wish to become the primary maintainer of UUID? As long 
as you're clear in your mind about that, one of us PAUSE admins can 
given you that power.

Of course at any time you can reassign it to ADOPTME if you wish to stop 
work on the module.

And at any time we can let others become co-maint.

BTW: clone is not a CPAN command (AFAIK). He just meant d/l the code and 
start work.

Also, did you compare the CPAN version with the github version? I think 
that would be a good idea.

Let us know.
