Subject: Module submission Data::Validate::VIN

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Validate::VIN
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Basic validation of North American VINs
  userid:      CSEATON (collin seaton)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)

  rationale:

    The Data::Validate::VIN module started as a task at work. As a
    financial institution my company offers auto loans. As a lending
    institution we have to track the titles for the vehicles on which we
    have a lien. One of the critical pieces of data in managing our
    liens is the vehicle's identification number. If the VIN was keyed
    into the system incorrectly, we wanted to know about that. Since
    VINs have a standard definition behind them I could programmatically
    validate these-- or at least the basic formatting.

    I checked around the CPAN for modules with /VIN/i in their names
    but found nothing relevant. I also checked for /Vehicle/i and again
    nothing pertaining to identification numbers of was returned. 'VIN'
    didn't make sense as a root-level namespace. 'Validate' seemed
    promising and there is the Validate::Net module out there already.
    So I uploaded an initial version called Validate::VIN.

    Then I thought more about it. And dug more. And eventually Data as
    the root-level namespace made the most sense. This came after
    finding several other Data::Validate:: modules. None of these relate
    to vehicles or VINs, but that's part of the beauty of it:
    Data::Validate::* is already used for keeping track of various (and
    sometimes miscellaneous) data validators, why not add VIN to the
    mix?

    Incidentally I scheduled Validate::VIN for deletion & never
    registered the namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::Validate::
::VIN             bdpOp Basic validation of North American VINs      CSEATON
