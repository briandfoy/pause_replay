I just reached out to Tom with the same email text I tried to send to
Andrew and this was Tom's response:

  I'm not interested in it these days.  Haven't touched it in a long
  time, so there are probably loads of issues.  It's been long enough
  since I've used cpan that I forget how to hand over the reigns.  Let
  me know what you'd like to do, and I'll facilitate.
