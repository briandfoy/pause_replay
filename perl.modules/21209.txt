The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::EMAC
  DSLIP:       bdpfg
  description: Uses block ciphers to produce MACs
  userid:      JCDUQUE (Julius C. Duque)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    newsgroups

  similar:
    Crypt::CBC Digest::DMAC

  rationale:

    I just found out that Double CBC-MAC (DMAC) is now officially known
    as Encrypted CBC-MAC (EMAC). I have just recently registered
    Digest::DMAC. Now, I want it to be known as Digest::EMAC, to be
    consistent with its official name.

  enteredby:   JCDUQUE (Julius C. Duque)
  enteredon:   Sun May 18 21:18:12 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::EMAC            bdpfg Uses block ciphers to produce MACs           JCDUQUE
