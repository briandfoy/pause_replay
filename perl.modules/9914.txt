Hi,

I am in need of some help with a PAUSE upload problem which I am
experiencing.

I have recently uploaded my Crypt::Vigenere module to CPAN, however, I
incorrectly named the file Crypt-Vignere-0.03.tar.gz (Vignere instead of
Vigenere).

I have made subsequent uploads using the correct filename
"Crypt-Vigenere-0.06.tar.gz" (new version), however, the changes are not
being reflected on CPAN.

What could I do to rectify the situation?

Thanks in advance for any assistance,

Alistair Mills

PS: The module search on CPAN works as it finds the correct module
(Crypt::Vigenere), however, it is still the old filename.
