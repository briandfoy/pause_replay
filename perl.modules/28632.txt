The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::PDlib
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Simple OO interface to DBI
  userid:      UNRTST (Joshua I. Miller)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    DBIx::Abstract DBIx::Simple

  rationale:

    There are many similar modules that attempt similar goals, some
    abstracting DBI completely, some hardly at all, and some are only
    appropriate for a few select uses. DBIx::PDlib sits in the middle,
    providing an easy to use OO abstraction to DBI, that attempts to
    maintain DBI's flexibility.

    The existing modules that are out there can do the job, each with
    their own strengths and weaknesses. They just didn't fit me, so I
    wrote my own (DBIx::PDlib even borrows some features from some of
    the others).

    Many people I've passed this module around to have chose to use it,
    and I'd like others to be able to find it via the module list. I've
    asked whether it should be submitted on module-authors, and received
    no response, so I'm assuming no response is a go ahead.

    DBIx::PDlib provides a simplified way to interact with DBI. It
    provides methods for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE which result
    in having to type less code to do the DBI queries. It does as little
    as possible to make things easier.

    What it doesn't do... It isn't trying to replace DBI. It's not
    trying to completely abstract SQL statement building into some 100%
    perllike syntax (though that is REALLY cool, and what I liked about
    DBIx::Abstract).

    The name: DBIx::Simple and DBIx::Abstract both exist already, along
    with a lot of other DBIx:: modules. So, I stuck with out internal
    name, and placed it in the correct namespace (DBIx).

  enteredby:   UNRTST (Joshua I. Miller)
  enteredon:   Wed Feb 18 04:35:36 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::PDlib           RdpOp Simple OO interface to DBI                   UNRTST
