02packages.details is canonical. cpansearch.org is a closed source codebase
with its own indexer that does ... I'm not entirely sure what, but apparently
in this case "not what PAUSE does".

I can't find any permissions for Mustache::Simple at all, though. Maybe if
you avoid the v-string crazy and use a normal version like

our $VERSION = '1.003002';

it'll index?
