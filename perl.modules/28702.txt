The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SystemManagement
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Common System Management class
  userid:      COOK (Kees Cook)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/systemmanagement

  similar:
    none in CPAN, but PowerEdge::RAC is similar
    (http://lanceerplaats.nl/PowerEdge/RAC/)

  rationale:

    This was discussed briefly on the CPAN modules list, and it seems
    that no other high-level area is appropriate for these modules. The
    first under this name space will be "SystemManagement::GSP", which I
    will upload as soon as this namespace is approved. After that, the
    PowerEdge::RAC author may update his module name to follow the
    convention, and upload it to CPAN as well. I will be following up in
    the coming months with additional system management modules, as I
    mentioned in my original posting:

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/w3glimpse2html/modules/2003-11/msg00193.html?58#mfs

  enteredby:   COOK (Kees Cook)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb 19 18:38:51 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

SystemManagement  bdpOp Common System Management class               COOK
