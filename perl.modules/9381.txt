Dear reader(s),

I would like to register as a perl developer.
Here is the requested information:

Name:	  Maurice Makaay
E-mail:	  maurice@gitaar.net
Homepage: http://www.gitaar.net/ (Dutch)
User-ID:  MMAKAAY

What I would like to contribute to CPAN is my collection of
Curses based user interface modules (Curses::MWS::*) (MWS = 
Maurice's Widget Set). Using these modules it's quite easy to
create curses based applications in perl. Currently I have
the following modules (and more modules are planned). I'll try 
to provide a little explanation for each of them:

Curses::MWS::Frame		A frame widget that can handle
				positioning, border drawing, internal-
				and external padding
Curses::MWS::Common		Common methods for all widgets
Curses::MWS::Container		A frame containing a widget collection.
				A container will automatically take
				care of focusing the right widgets,
				so it's easy to create a form with it.
				NOTE: You'll mostly use the Window widget,
				which is a descendant of Container.
Curses::MWS::RootWindow		A curses window in which all work is done
Curses::MWS::Window		A curses window that can be added
				to the RootWindow
Curses::MWS::Buttons		A buttonbar
Curses::MWS::CheckBox		A checkbox
Curses::MWS::Dialog		A dialogbox (message + buttons popup)
Curses::MWS::ErrorDialog	An error dialogbox (with an ascii drawn
				exclamation mark sign :-)
Curses::MWS::FileBrowser	A widget to select a file, including
				filemasks and filename-editing
Curses::MWS::Label		A simple textlabel
Curses::MWS::ListBox		A listbox / optionlist with integrated
				search functionality (like 'less' does)
Curses::MWS::MenuBar		A menubar on top of the screen
Curses::MWS::MenuListBox	Used internally by MenuBar. Using the
				MenuBar it's possible to create 
				menu's for your application. Each menu
				can have one or more submenu's
Curses::MWS::PopupBox		A pulldown menu
Curses::MWS::ProgressBar	A progress bar
Curses::MWS::RadioButtonBox	A list of radiobuttons
Curses::MWS::SearchEntry	Used by ListBox and TextViewer for searching
Curses::MWS::Searchable		Used by LIstBox and TextViewer for searching
Curses::MWS::TextEditor		A texteditor widget including wrapping,
				undo, hard return viewing
Curses::MWS::TextEntry		A single line of textinput
Curses::MWS::TextViewer		A viewer for textfiles with integrated
				search functionality (like 'less' does)

One of the great features of this widget set, is that an application
that is build with it will be automaticalliy resizeable! That was the
main reason for me to build my own widget set. I couldn't find an
easy solution for building curses based applications that could do
that. In Curses::MWS all widgets have their own layout() method and
the RootWindow will recursively call this method for all widgets if
the window is resized.

I haven't used any of the ncurses specific functions, so these 
modules will work correctly with standard curses (for example
curses on Sun Solaris systems).

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

With kind regards,

Maurice Makaay
