I'm sorry that we missed your earlier registration request. Most likely
it got into a deadlock situation where no PAUSE admin wanted to
register it but waited to see if another admin did.

That's a lot of letters in a row. Isn't there a better (even if
temporary) name that you could give this?

If it's a successor to Rosetta, why not just call it Rosetta 2.0? You
could even talk all the alpha versions as developer releases until you
have the name that you really want to use.
