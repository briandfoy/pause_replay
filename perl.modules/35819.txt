     why:

    I've been working with Perl for several years now, and I believe I
    am able to provide some useful additions to the Perl community. In
    particular, I've written various modules and pieces of code dealing
    with encryption and authentication, as well as many other things.
    The encryption modules would be among the first things I would
    contribute.

    I'm not a Perl expert, so I won't claim to be one. But anything I
    will contribute will be designed and written as professionally as
    possible, to make it easier for other people to use what I have
    provided.

    You're welcome to take a look at my website, but it would probably
    be a waste of your time, because there really isn't anything there
    of interest. Many of the other pages on there haven't been updated
    in years. Most of the interesting stuff is behind the scenes and
    password protected for my own purposes.

    I wanted to go ahead and get my foot in the door by registering
    here, and then I will start submitting information about the modules
    I plan to contribute as specified on cpan.org.

    Thank you for your time! I look forward to contributing to the Perl
    community! Feel free to e-mail me with any questions.
