I understand.  You want to keep your namespace for yourself, which is
understandable.  As I said, I'll figure out a new name.

Johan> Besides, I like the Getopt::GUI::Std and Getopt::GUI::Long approach.

I'll register for those instead.  Thanks.  Seems a bit weird from a
class perspective, since Getopt::GUI::Long will actually be a subclass
of Getopt::Long, but that doesn't really matter much I guess.

I've deleted my registration entry for Getopt::Long::GUI and replaced
it with a new one for Getopt::GUI::Long.
