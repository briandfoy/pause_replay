Any particular reason it has to read and write files/streams,
rather than working on in-memory data?
I think that rather limits its usefulness.
If it absolutely has to read/write streams, then perhaps
it should go under IO:: instead.

Does it do anything besides reorder fields?
If not, then the name should be something like ReorderFields.
