The problem with deploying from Travis is going to be that PAUSE doesn't
really have an API, so you would have to store some sort of PAUSE
username/pw in a way Travis can access. That means the releases are still
tied to an account. Of course, you can make a "Foo group" account and share
the credentials, but it's a pretty gross solution. FWIW I've found that
using Dist::Zilla has made releases easy enough to not want even think
about automating it further.
