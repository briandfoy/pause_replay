Uh, I -have- uploaded a module with that name...

But perhaps I've mistyped it our did it in such a way that PAUSE didn't 
correlate the module to the registered namespace.

If someone would be kind enough to provide further information as to what I 
need to do in order to maintain this namespace registration that would be 
appreciated; I'm presuming that its likely something simple so that PAUSE 
matches the module together with the namespace, but I don't know what else I 
may need to do in order for that to happen.

Many thanks,
