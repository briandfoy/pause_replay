Request to register new user

fullname: Logical Helion, LLC
  userid: LHELION
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://www.logicalhelion.com
     why:

    I have a PAUSE account (LAJANDY) but a lot of what I am
    contributing to CPAN actually falls under my company's copyright and
    ownership, Logical Helion, LLC. It would be better if Logical Helion
    had its own PAUSE account, so it would be clearer what is LAJANDY's
    and what is Logical Helion's. It would also allow other company
    employees to upload files without giving them my personal PAUSE
    password.
