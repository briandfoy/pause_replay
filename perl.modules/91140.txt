The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::RNA::SpliceSites::Scoring::MaxEntScan
  DSLIP:       bdpf2
  description: Pre-mRNA splice site scoring by max entropy
  userid:      BRYKETOS (Brian Sebastian Cole)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    https://github.com/bryketos/Bio-RNA-SpliceSites-Scoring-MaxEntScan

  similar:

  rationale:

    Modern genomics pipelines to assess pre-mRNA splicing in dynamic
    contexts such as alternative splicing need modular splice site
    strength quantification tools. In 2004, Gene Yeo and Chris Burge at
    MIT released a Perl tarball for scoring of pre-mRNA splice sites by
    a maximum entropy-based approach, which they called maxEntScan. Fast
    forward 10 years and integrated Perl pipelines are commonplace in
    genomic data analysis, yet the only existing way to integrate the
    maxEntScan programs into a pipeline is through system calls, with no
    documentation or testing provided in the original maxEntScan
    programs. To address this, I refactored the algorithm of Yeo and
    Burge into a Perl module that can export splice site scoring
    functions into other namespaces. Additionally, I add version
    control, testing, documentation, and an adaptable package-based
    splice model for the creation of novel maximum entropy-based splice
    models as detailed in the original maxEntScan program from 2004. Of
    note: I contacted the original author Dr. Gene Yeo, currently a
    professor at UCSD, and he consented to the development of this
    current distribution and its upload to PAUSE. My thesis advisor also
    consented. Cheers!
