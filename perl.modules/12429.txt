PerLDAP was what Net::LDAPapi was renamed to when Netscape took over
maintaining the module. That was several years ago, Clayton should
probably remove Net::LDAPapi from CPAN. PerLDAP is now
maintained by the mozilla project.

Not true and Net::LDAPapi only support krb4 which is not reccomendes.
LDAPv3 introduced SASL and with Authen::SASL Net::LDAP can authenticate
using the cyrus SASL library. Although this will be with krb5.

Support for krb4 was dropped from LDAP when LDAPv3 was spec'd
