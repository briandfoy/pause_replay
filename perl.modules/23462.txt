The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Xtab
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: creates server-side multi-level DB crosstabs
  userid:      GMAX (Giuseppe Maxia)
  chapterid:    7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Data::Pivot does one level only - none does server-side and
    multi-level xtab

  rationale:

    DBIx::Xtab creates server-side multi-level cross tabulation
    reports. Given some parameters, it creates the appropriate query to
    get the crosstab, fetches the records and returns the output in raw
    format, HTML or XML. Unlike spreadsheet pivot tables, all the
    calculation is done on the server side, and in addition the query is
    not limited to one table only. I am writing the documentation and
    creating the installation tests In the meantime, you can see the
    code, some docs and a few colorful examples at this link:
    http://gmax.oltrelinux.com/xtab/xtab.html Any comments would be
    welcome.

    I am not sure about the DBIx:: namespace. The rationale behind my
    choice is that the module is - potentially - database independent,
    so it can really be a DBI extension.

    My second choice would be DBSchema::Xtab. (I used DBSchema:: on Tim
    Bunce's advice for my DBSchema::Normalizer).

    Please advise. Thanks
