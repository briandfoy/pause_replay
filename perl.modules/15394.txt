These are Perl Apache::Authen* modules developed for the ID-AUTH/AD-AUTH
projects. These have been tested and seem to work well for us -- they may
work
for you. But use at your own risk.

Install in your ...<perl-path>/lib/site_perl/Apache directory.

AuthenDBMCache.pm -- stack module to accelerate logins (cf AuthenCache
AuthenDBMFile.pm  -- implementation of AuthDBMUserFile method
AuthenFile.pm     -- implementation of AuthUserFile method
AuthenFTP.pm      -- authenticate against an FTP server (or similar
AuthenPOP3.pm     -- authenticate against a POP3 server (or similar

Each kit is/should be fairly Perl standard with the usual install
instructions. You can pull the kits down file at a time or yank down
the tar balls.
