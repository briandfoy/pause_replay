Hello,
     I'm writing to request being added to the PAUSE Author list.
Name: Paul Golds
EMail Address: Paul.Golds@BTInternet.com (Not the one I'm sending from..
  that's a work address which I would rather keep off the internet for
now).
Homepage: None.
Preferred User ID: MOLT
Description of what I'm planning to contribute in near future:
  HTML modules to extract all content and links from a website, making the
results suitable for spidering, also an automated spidering module for the
same. This is intended as the information-gathering component of a search
engine, and is in testing for an internal project at the moment.
Permission to
release outside
the company has been obtained, however.
  An IFF Parser, based on the SAX interface for XML but reading the old
Electronic Arts file-format specification for the Amiga, as used in the
IFF/ILBM
image format still in use in many graphics packages to this day but also
allowing subclassing to read the IFFs used in sound processing, or any
other IFF
still out there.
  A Lightwave 3d (www.newtek.com) 3d object reader based around the above
IFF Parser.  Builds up internal version of the 3d model which can then be
used in
any Perl 3d modules (With suitable middle-code, this isn't what I intend it
for
personally) or output in a more easily-read format (Not part of the module,
but
the reason I am making it).
