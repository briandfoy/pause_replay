    News::yEnc - yEnc decoder

    =head1 SYNOPSIS

      use News::yEnc;
      
      $yEnc = new News::yEnc RC  => $rcFile,
                             out => $outDir, 
                             tmp => $tmpDir;

    =head1 ABSTRACT

    yEnc decoder, with database of file parts


    =head1 DESCRIPTION

    C<News::yEnc> decodes yEncoded files and writes them to disk. File
    parts are saved to I<$tmpDir>; when all parts of a file have been
    received, the completed file is moved to I<$outDir>.

    C<News::yEnc> maintains a database of partially received files, called
    the RC database. The RC database is loaded from disk when a
    C<News::yEnc> object is created, and saved to disk when the object is
    C<DESTROY>'d.
