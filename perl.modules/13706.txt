The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::Regulator::Plasmatronic
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: Plasmatronics Power Regulator Interface
  userid:      SCOTT (Scott Penrose)
  chapterid:    4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Device::Regulator seems like the perfect place to store vendor
    specific interfaces to power regulators. These are devices which
    control and measure the amount of power in and out of a device or
    power store. The Plasmatronics series of regulators are designed for
    charging (measure and control) of batteries, usually used for Solar
    Power, Wind, Generators etc. Although there are currently no other
    regulator interfaces on CPAN, it seems to make sense that they are
    grouped together. Device covers things like modems which are
    external bits of equipment connected via serial ports, as are most
    Regulator Interfaces.

The resulting entry would be:

Device::Regulator::
::Plasmatronic    RdpOg Plasmatronics Power Regulator Interface      SCOTT
