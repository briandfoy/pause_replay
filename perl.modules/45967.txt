I am open to suggestions -  I agree that it is a bit of an acronym mess.

possibles:

Class::DBI::DataFormValidator - long
Class::DBI::Validator - not fully descriptive.

I think that 'DFV' is alright as it is a well accepted acronym for
Data::FormValiator - like CDBI is for Class::DBI. I suppose that those
familiar with DFV will know what it means.

It would be nice to come up with a name that would let a novice
scanning a list of modules see it and understand what it does. Tough
to do though as the concept behind DFV is quite involved.

I think that if it is to be changed then
'Class::DBI::DataFormValidator' is best - should I resubmit?
