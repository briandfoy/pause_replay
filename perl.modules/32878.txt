Some explanation about our collaboration politics

Our thrones are the first lot and this is a reason why we look for a dealer
First of all, we are interested in fast sale.
Probably this is a main reason explaining why our price is not so huge.
But, You could offer the price seeing the real situation at your area.

Short Description of the Thrones

After months of work, by our master craftsmen, we are pleased to have 
finally finished our first two Ceremonial Thrones. 
These royal thrones are the exact replicas of the thrones 
that were made for the Kings of Ancient Egypt over 3000 years ago. 
Meticulously handcrafted by our master craftsmen, Egypt Thrones Co. 
has made use of the natural elements used by the original craftsman 
in ancient times to maintain the authenticity of their reproductions: 
Gold, Wood, Stone and Leather.
 
Egypt Thrones Co. have conducted extensive research into the history 
of the thrones used by the powerful ancient rulers, and have specially 
selected five of the most important and exquisite thrones to bring back
to life in the new millennium. 

Please inform us: are you interested and how you prefer to work with us?
Probably you can have something else to offer us?

Beforehand thank you
We will be glad to collaboration
