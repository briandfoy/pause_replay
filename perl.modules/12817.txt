Do you hate the taste of your daily vitamins?
Do you even take vitamins daily anymore?
We all have heard that our bodies need a wide range of minerals and vitamins to keep it functioning properly. The experts preach over and over again that a daily supplement is MUST for a healthier lifestyle. Its true. But its difficult to establish a routine of taking multivitamins when the taste and size of the capsule is a deterrent right from the start. Choosing a healthier lifestyle should be an enjoyable experience not a struggle of willpower.
Did you know that some nutrients are not properly absorbed when taken in capsule forms? No one can afford to waste money on supplements that are not effective as they should be.
