It seems to me like the loading part is kind of what most of Config:: 
does, so the description as "Loader" might not be as effective as one 
including "Merge" or "Merger" in the name. A good module name kind of 
includes the information what sets it apart from similar modules. If I 
understand the description correctly, your killer feature is that it can 
magically merge configuration data from various sources without the user 
doing any work.

So this would suggest something like Config::Merge, but I agree with 
brian that Config::Any::Merge is even better because by using its 
plugins, it *is* related to Config::Any even though it doesn't inherit 
from it.

Would you agree to that namespace or do you have strong objections or 
are you set on Config::Loader?

Best regards,
Steffen
