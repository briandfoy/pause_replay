Not to toot my own horn, but if this is a package for data, then you may 
want to look at writing it as a subclass of Data::Package.

The Data::Package API was created specifically for providing an 
abstraction between using some data and the actual implementation 
required to find and load it.

It might help you.

The other issue I'm a little unsure or is the sort of volume we're 
talking about with this stuff. BioInf work can use a LOT of data, and 
I'm not sure how big all this data is going to be.

If the data is relatively compact and will be reused it's not a problem 
at all. If it's larger and there's going to be a lot of these things, it 
may be better to store the actual data somewhere more appropriate and 
have your Makefile.PL for the data package fetch it from that 
more-appropriate location as needed.

Just some thoughts.
