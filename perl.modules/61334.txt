Subject: Module submission Business::CardInfo
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::CardInfo
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Get/Validate data from credit & debit cards
  userid:      WREIS (Wallace Reis)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Mailinglists and IRC

  similar:
    Business::CreditCard

  rationale:

    The Business namespace choice is actually the right place for it
    since it's about business' data. Business::CreditCard doesn't
    validate all card types and this module covers for credit and debit
    cards.

  enteredby:   WREIS (Wallace Reis)
  enteredon:   Fri Jul 11 16:37:40 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::
::CardInfo        bdpOp Get/Validate data from credit & debit cards  WREIS
