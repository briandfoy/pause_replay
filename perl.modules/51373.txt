Hi,
I have written a Perl module to read and parse the content of ABIF  
files (.ab1 suffix, usually) as produced by Applied Biosystems  
sequencers. The need for this module arose, because the existing ABI  
module provides very limited functionality. My ABIF module provides  
extensive functionality (though some operations are not yet  
optimized): it can be easily used, for example, to produce analysis  
reports similar to Sequencing Analysis's ones.

I would like to upload the module on CPAN, but... which namespace is  
more appropriate? Should I call it simply ABIF, or Bio::ABIF, or  
something else?

Thanks for your attention
