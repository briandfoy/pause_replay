    That could be misleading.  Specific modules don't always reference a
DTD -- they may use XMLSchema, an RFC, something informal, etc -- and
they may have nothing to do with validation.

    I don't have an alternative in mind, but I like the idea of a top-level
namespace for `specific XML implementations and applications'.  I'm open to
suggestions.
