Upload rights is a foreign word on CPAN:) The permissions only decide if
something gets indexed or not. So I presume you wanted to say he should
automatically have comaint permissions. The answer is no (currently).
But he can assign the comaint permissions to himself, this isn't done
automatically for anybody to make sure everything somebody is doing is
done with intent.

I can recognize a pattern here and maybe most people in the same
situation would like to get the comaint permissions assigned
automatically to all "deputy" maintainers. I'm open to change this if
people think it's worth it. I concede the current solution seems a bit
clumsy but on balance it is just a few clicks away from the automatic
assignment of permissions on newly introduced modules.
