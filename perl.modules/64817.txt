OK, so reading this, I can say for sure that the original maintaner
(trostler@juniper.net) will no longer be touching that module as he is no
longer with Juniper Networks and the JUNOS module is an official Juniper
release.  I don't need to submit a bug against the module, I just need to be
added as a co-maintainer, or in fact replace Mark all together since I am the
script maintainer now at Juniper.

Is this the proper venue to get transferred over?  The only other thing I see
in the below information you quoted is to submit a bug via rt.cpan.org - but
isn't that simply to report a bug to the current package maintainer?  Who in
this case doesn't exist anymore?

Thanks for any info/help.
