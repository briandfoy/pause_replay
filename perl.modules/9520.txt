Ah, cool, I'd call that 'break handling'.

[It's been on my DBI to-do for years as "Add 'break handling' when
field values change? Use two fbav's so 'previous record' is available.
Define break fields and handlers. Call them via an alternate
fetch_with_break method."]

'Loop' is a bit vague. How about...

DBIx::
::FetchLoop       bdpOg Fetch with change detection and aggregates   BITS

Tim.
