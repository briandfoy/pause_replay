Can works with any size's of POST request safely.

I think it easy to prove in two ways: Or i am will draw reductive algorithm
of this module works,
or somebody check this by sending big and malformed(many elements, giant
headers, etc..)
requests to script based on this module.

> Do we need another one of these?

Yes. Becouse it impossible to change Standard Perl install module for safely
work with big requests(1 or more Mb).
If needs arguments, i have arguments.

ps: To be present at the CPAN modules catalogue need me becouse, i think, it
is a good way to
say people about this module.

pps: please, sorry my english..
