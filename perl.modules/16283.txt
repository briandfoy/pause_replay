Greetings!

I asked about this on the module-authors list, but I'd like to
run it past the 'experienced volunteers' if they have a moment.

I'd like to register Unix::UserGroups for a module that provides
user/group mappings a la GNU id(1); basically as a wrapper around
getgrent, getgrgid and the like, except providing the mapping
feature more readily.  Things like 'who are the users in group x',
'to what groups does user y belong', and 'is user y a member of
group x', among others.

I see Unix::GroupFile and Unix::PasswdFile, but they're more
management modules than query ones -- and they neither of them
answer all of the questions above.

This is something I needed, and it seems an innocuous-enough first
CPAN module. :-)

Any comments or guidance gratefully accepted and appreciated..!
