Dear CPAN Module Maintainers,

About 18 months ago, a student intern working for CAIDA Michel Young
(MHYOUNG) submitted to you a module he developed for us:
Chart-Graph.pm.  Since then, he has moved on and we continued to work
on the module.  We would like to submit the revised module and set up
a new author's area with CPAN for all CAIDA projects to simplify your
life and ours!

Could you please advise us on how to create a new CAIDA author's area
within CPAN and how we can transfer Chart-Graph.pm to that area for
version 2.0 that we are close to releasing?

Thank you,

Edouard Lagache, PhD
