Subject: Module submission Net::FindPAC

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::FindPAC
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Find a .pac or wpad.dat file
  userid:      MACKENNA (Craig MacKenna)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I would like to rescind/abandon my previous request for
    'Net::WPAD', on which I'm not aware of any action, in favor of this
    request. The functionality implied by this new name is a superset of
    the functionality implied by the old name, in that it combines
    searching for a .pac or wpad.dat file by means of the WPAD protocol,
    with searching for .pac files created by browsers in the user's home
    directory, in case WPAD doesn't find one.

    It's a nice modularity: "find me a PAC file by any means possible".

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::FindPAC         cdpOp Find a .pac or wpad.dat file                 MACKENNA
