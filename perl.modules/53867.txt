The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fortran::Namelist
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Provides access to Fortran namelists files
  userid:      VMS (Victor Marcelo Santillan)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    Fortran::Namelist

  rationale:

    There is a Fortran::Namelist listed but it is not available for
    download. I have tried to contact the author of the
    Fortran::Namelist module but his email is not longer valid. I have
    not seen any signs of progress in a long time, so I wrote the module
    and I would like to register it under my name .

  enteredby:   VMS (Victor Marcelo Santillan)
  enteredon:   Thu Apr  5 21:55:07 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Fortran::
::Namelist        bdpOp Provides access to Fortran namelists files   VMS
