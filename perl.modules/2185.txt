It was just pointed out to me that some of the directories on CPAN are not
up-to-date.  For example:


authors/id/SBECK:
  DateManip-5.21.tar.gz
  DateManip-5.38.tar.gz

modules/by-module/Date
  DateManip-5.21.tar.gz

modules/by-category/06_Data_Type_Utilities/Date
  DateManip-5.21.tar.gz


Is there something I need to do to keep these links up-to-date?  I've
checked out PAUSE and didn't see anything to do this.  I really need
those links though since version 5.21 is REALLY old.

Thanks
