I haven't seen your mail and the archive hasn't either. It must have
gone lost somewhere.

But the archive point me to an (unapproved) module named Tui by RFLENS
(CC'd). It would be nice if you could sort out together if there is
some overlap. (Ronald, please accept my apologies that you haven't
heard back from us, we were too busy this year. Please resubmit
whatever you would like to have listed).

Term::TUI sounds good to me. I'll add it to the module list.
