If they are all called Installer::something, they are apparently not
called Bundle::something.

Ahh, I see. Whatever is called Bundle::something should be nothing
more than a list of modules. The idea of collecting modules by
referencing their name. Not by collecting the modules themselves
(the referenced modules are expected to be on CPAN anyway).

A module should never be in the Bundle namespace.

Looks more like Rkit::something, as I get the impression, this hasn't
much to do with "applications" either.

Hmmm. If all you need is a namespace you use within the rkit script, I
see no reason to register a namespace at all. If the code is not going
to be reused, it may even live in the "main" namespace as no conflict
will occur. OTOH if there is a tiny chance that one of the packages
grows beyond itself and becomes reuseable, you can work in the
pet_s_mart::rkit:: namespace and wait until the time is ripe.

It seems to me that there's nothing wrong with the script rkit, but
that it is rather a script or application than a module. There's
nothing wrong with that, just nothing to be registered in the module
list.
