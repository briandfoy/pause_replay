I have dropped Greg London (GSLONDON)=E2=80=99s permission on package =
=E2=80=98Constant=E2=80=99.

Greg: you had ownership of package =E2=80=98Constant=E2=80=99, which had =
been included in an earlier version of your Parse-Nibbler distribution =
on CPAN. You dropped that package from the distribution, but had =
retained the permission. PAUSE is now case-insensitive, so this was =
causing a conflict with =E2=80=98constant=E2=80=99. Would you be happy =
to delete older releases of Parse-Nibbler from CPAN, so Constant will be =
removed from the CPAN index? One of the PAUSE admins can do that for =
you, if you=E2=80=99re ok with that?

Neil
