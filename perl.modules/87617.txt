No.  Smart people regularly do things that make them look stupid. If I thought
they were actually stupid, I wouldn't waste my breath pointing it out.

I chose my words quite carefully on that basis.

If you want to use indirect means to call people stupid, be my guest. But
don't put words into my mouth. If I'm going to insult somebody, I'll do it
to their face; don't project your cowardice onto me.
