in that case i don't think this belongs in Finance.  it doesn't
have anything to do with Finance (or as much to do with Finance
as Marketing::*, Sales::*, etc).

i think this might live under Lingua:: or something similar,
then.

neither is approriate for just the reason you say---it's about
text.  the module isn't about Business or Finance, although
you could use it for that.  however, it is much more general
than those.

even those name have problems.  right now you only handle english,
but someone may want to handle another language.  your namespace
should be able to accomodate that.

beyond that, you want to separate parts of the names.  
"ExtractCompanyName" has too much in one part of the namespace,
so the "Extract" should be separated from the "CompanyName".

i'm thinking something like:

   Lingua::EN::CompanyName

that can easily accomodate other languages.  then, you can provide
another module to extract the possible permutations that the Lingua::
modules return (and that module probably lives in another namespace).
separate the permutation logic from the extraction logic and you will
have much better flexibility.
