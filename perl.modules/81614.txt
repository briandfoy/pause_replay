The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Abridge
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Simplify data structures for serialization
  userid:      DAOTOAD (Mark Swayne)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    JSON JSON::XS

  rationale:

    Data::Abridge takes complex perl data structures that are hard to
    serialize and converts them into a simplified form that a naive
    serliazer can handle.

    Data::Abridge is focused on creating simple, human readable
    structures for use in human readable serialized output such as in
    log files or data dumps. The serialization process loses information
    and cannot be reliably reversed to 'thaw' a structure. Hence the
    "Abridge" in the name.

    Data::Abridge simplifies recursive structures to make them
    non-recursive. It converts objects, glob references, and other perl
    exotica into a mix of hash and array references with string values.

    It was originally written to make arbitrary data dumpable vs JSON
    and JSON::XS. These modules have some hooks for serialization that
    could be used to customize handling of structures that are not
    normally possible to represent in JSON.

    Instead of relying on hooks, Data::Abridge recursively transforms a
    copy of a structure to make it readily serializable.

    Data::Abridge was originally written to ensure that JSON dumps of
    data structures in log-files would not generate JSON errors. It has
    proven useful in multiple cases for preprocessing data structures
    for dumping and/or pretty printing.
