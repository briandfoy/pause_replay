Hello again modules,

I still havent been able to get in touch with Florian Ragwitz to discuss 
handing over maintenance of Net::SSLeay.

To recap, I have tried to contact him directly

many times upt to....
26/12/2017 rafl@debian.org
6/1/2018 rafl@debian.org
13/1/2018 rafl@debina.org
11/3/2018 FLORA@cpan.org
12/3/2018 FLORA@cpan.org

and I have not had any email from him since 18/2/2011
I have been effective and only maintainer of Net::SSLeay since 2005.

So now I ask you modules to promote me to Maintainer of Net::SSLeay so I can 
pass the baton to someone else.

Cheers.
