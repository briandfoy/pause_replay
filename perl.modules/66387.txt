Subject: Module submission IRC::Formatting::HTML
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, leedo@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IRC::Formatting::HTML
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Convert raw IRC formatting to HTML
  userid:      LEEDO (Lee Aylward)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    I am currently using it in two IRC clients, one is on CPAN now

  similar:
    There are a few POE IRC filters that involve HTML, but it looks like
    they are closely tied to POE

  rationale:

    I am working on two IRC clients that display the conversation in an
    HTML window. I need to be able to convert the IRC color and
    formatting codes to HTML on the fly. This module lets me do that,
    and think would be very useful to others.

  enteredby:   LEEDO (Lee Aylward)
  enteredon:   Thu Jun 25 15:48:56 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IRC::Formatting::
::HTML            bdpOp Convert raw IRC formatting to HTML           LEEDO
