Thank you for your prospective contributions,
The Pause Team

Note from Matt S Trout:
Yo. Welcome to PAUSE, glad to see you finally came up with some code that was motivating enough to ship :D

You might want to have a poke around the VCI project - it's intended to be a generic VCS interface done using Moose. Dunno if it's worth doing code overlap with it or not, but their ideas at least are rather cool.
