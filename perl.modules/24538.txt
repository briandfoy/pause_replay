I didn't save this mail the first time around (couple of months ago),
but I had assumed my module made it into the lists, because it has
clearly been indexed.

AFS::Command shows up in the "modules by name" hierarchy, and
everything I have been uploading to my home directory has been getting
indexed there as well.

Today, I went to "Edit Module Metadata" on PAUSE, and it said I don't
own any modules.  Well, I own this one.

Is my assumption incorrect?  I had assumed that getting indexed
required acceptance into the modules list, but that doesn't seem to be
the case.

Are there issues with this module submission?  Please let me know, and
I'll be happy to address them.
