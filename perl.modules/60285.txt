Subject: PAUSE ID request (CODEREPOS; CodeRepos Committers)

Request to register new user

fullname: CodeRepos Committers
  userid: CODEREPOS
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://coderepos.org/share
     why:

    CodeRepos is a very large shared repository of various Perl
    projects. CodeRepos is not limited to Perl, but there are CPAN
    module authors contributing to this repository.

    We'd like to create a fallback PAUSE id, so in case one of our
    authors falls (sick, busy, etc), another person in the same
    CodeRepos team can take over, if only temporarily.

    While coderepos itself gives commit access to everybody who wants
    it, we intend to limit the number of people who can actually release
    modules to CPAN to a handful of people, and limit the usage of this
    account for fallback and/or join projects.
