     why:

    I have a perl module I would like to create/submit, for the Google
    Short Links service recently released, and there are several modules
    I have used extensively that I would like to submit patches for in
    the near future. After using Perl for nearly 15 years, I figure it's
    about time to start contributing back to the community!
