Hello,

Devel::SmallProf module doesn't work with perl 5.8.0. I have a patch
for it but I have been unable to contact the author because its email
address is bouncing. The module was last updated three years ago and
I believe that the author is not interested on it anymore, he has
already transferred his other CPAN modules.

As I am actively using this module for my own projects I would like
to upload a new patched version and to take over its maintenance.

(I have already sent this request to modules@perl.org several times
but I never got a response back :-( )

Bye,
 
 - Salva
