     why:

    I am a CS graduate student at the University of Minnesota Duluth,
    working on perl modules to compute the semantic relatedness of word
    senses using an electronic dictionary called WordNet. This work is a
    pert of my Master's thesis, however I would like to distribute all
    the modules I write. Most of the modules are already widely used by
    a great number of people in their research work and I have seen
    papers based on work that use the modules. Putting them up on CPAN
    would make them more accessible to everyone.

    Thanks.
