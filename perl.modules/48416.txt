In cases like this, sometimes the email has just gone bad. So it's worth 
a quick look around the internet (Google etc) to find alternative email 
addresses.

We've even seen cases in which people have managed to find the person's 
phone number and call them, and this might be an option. Generally the 
author is quite happy for someone else to take over co-maintainership.

As for uploading, that is not done primarily because it would be far 
beyond the capability of us to do that for all 10,000 distributions.

When a module goes stale, the person that cares enough about the problem 
to fix the bug and come to the list for help is far better qualified to 
deal with the problem, and further is also far more likely to care 
enough about the module to continue fixing any new bugs that appear in 
the future.

Once co-maintainership is assigned, you should also receive any new bug 
reports filed against the module, which I'm sure you'll want to see 
fixed as well.

It's one thing to help manage and assign responsibility for 10,000 
distributions, it's an entirely different thing to take on 
responsibility for it directly.
