Immediately I am planning to contribute WINS::Winsdmp, a module
for working with the CSV data generated from the unique Windows
winsdmp utility. This module has immediate application to WINS
admins everywhere struggling with the transition to AS or trying
to get off of it. The module includes "guess" (sometimes that's
all you can do with MS) algorithems that associate a unique IP
with most recent host and user login, useful for finding out
who was last on an IP. (Take a look at the anonymous CVS tree
on http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/winsdmp/
or better yet, add yourselves as developers and help me put
the polish on this thing.)

I'm also working on Array::Shell in my spare time.  It is
a module for helping authors create quick array-centric
command-line apps for interactively manipulating their favorite
arrays.

Also hoping to put up a version of the Picture Metadata Project
(currently in C++ and some Java) in Perl. It may be that this
ends up named something like DIG35::<names> instead.

I've made contributions to the Perl community in the past the
most notable of which was probably my work on "Mailmerge.pm"
with Lincoln Stein (but that was ages ago).
