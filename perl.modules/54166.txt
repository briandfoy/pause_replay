The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::Coder::HostIP
  DSLIP:       RupOp
  description: City, lat, long, from IP OO via hostip.org
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Geo::IP Geo::IPfree Geo::IP::PurePerl

  rationale:

    Fits with Geo::IP etc above, uses HostIP open IP geocoding
    database, gets city when it works (only about 40-50% of IP addresses
    are currently accurately geocodable but the database is getting
    better the more it's checked).

    Also I really think my Google Maps v2 utility method is pretty
    damned cool and I suspect other shall as well. Woot!

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::Coder::
::HostIP          RupOp City, lat, long, from IP OO via hostip.org   DODGER
