I think we're risking breaking the 'names should reflect what the
module does not how it does it rule'.

On reflection I think a DTD, or similar, namespace is risky.
I think we'd be better off *ignoring* the use of XML in the
implementation (where possible) and just considering the abstract
functionality the module offers when thinking about suitable names.
