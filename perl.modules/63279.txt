Yes, Graciliano hasn't released updates in a while and I seem to
remember there was a similar maintenance issue before. Thus, I just
assigned co-maintenance permissions to BRICAS.

Graciliano, please note that this is a reversible action in case you
object or choose to pick up maintenance yourself again.

Brian, please make sure to read
http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/04pause.html#takeover for details on
this process.

Best regards,
Steffen
