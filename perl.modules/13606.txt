Hi, can you set me up in PAUSE?  The required details are:

     * Matthew Mallard
     * perl@mallardcorp.com
     * http://www.mallardcorp.com
     * MMALLARD
     * I'm working on an inventory (for want of a better word) module 
that will provide information about a host, such as OS, model, make, 
ram, disks, etc, etc.  It is platform independent (for UNIX like 
anyway), so that regardless of the system you're on, you use the same 
methods and arguments.

Which brings me to my next question.  Is Inventory a good name, or is 
UNIX::Inventory better (although it is UNIX only now, it might become 
useful for Windows down the track)?  Or would another name altogether be 
better?
Though there seems to be a few modules out there that do specific OS's, 
I cannot see any that use a platform independent interface (correct me 
if I'm wrong).

Regards,
Matthew Mallard
