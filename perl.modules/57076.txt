From: dthomas@ti.com (David Thomas)

I have obtained permission to publish a group of Perl modules developed
at Texas Instruments.  TI holds the copyright to these modules; they
will be released under the Artistic License 2.0.  These modules have
been in use inside TI for several years.  To avoid collisions with
modules developed externally, we adopted the convention of placing our
internally-developed modules in a TI:: namespace.

I know that other commercial namespaces exist (Nokia:: and IBM::, for
example), but typically those namespaces have been used for modules
that are related to those companies' products, not necessarily for
modules that were developed by those companies.

The modules that we are proposing to release are general in nature;
they're not specific to any TI products or design or manufacturing
processes.  (If they were, they would be subject to export control
restrictions and we wouldn't be able to release them).  These modules
are not particularly innovative; they fit into categories that are
well-represented in CPAN already, but our implementations generally
have feature sets that go beyond modules that are currently available.
The initial set of modules that we intend to release consists of:

    TI::Config          -- Application configuration
    TI::Log::MsgHandler -- Message generation and logging
    TI::DefineClass     -- Class builder

Our primary intent is to share these modules with our EDA development
partners.  By making the modules available under the Artistic License,
our partners will not be constrained from including them with their
EDA tools and making them available to their other customers.  Since
these modules are generally useful, the Perl community at large may
benefit from them, too.

Would there be a strong objection to our registering and using a "TI::"
namespace for this purpose?
