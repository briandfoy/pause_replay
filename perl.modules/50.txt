Or, as a slight variation, provide a mechanism to actually *rename*
the package.   This code probably suffers from some obscure gotcha,
but it should be possible to make the basic idea work:

        BEGIN { local *Packname:: = %Myname::;
                require Packname;
                Myname->import;
        };
