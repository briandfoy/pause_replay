Hi. I got no response to the post quoted below, and there was no =20
apparent traffic on the mailing list, so according to the FAQ this =20
means I should just go with the name I suggested - but I suggested =20
several.
If there is no response to this email, I'll go ahead and use =20
Games::Tournament::Blackjack, despite it being a third-level namespace =20=

and my not having code for Games::Tournament. There is surely room for =20=

other authors below Games::Tournament as a subject-level division, =20
rather than a code-compatibility-level thing. So.. any objections?

- Paul


Obviously I was either onto something, or on something.
