The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Mappoint
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Mappoint web service SOAP access library
  userid:      CGARCIA (Claudio Garcia)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Mappoint .NET is a MIcrosoft web service that provides a SOAP API
    for creating maps and other geography related functions, such as
    geocoding (obtaining latitude and longitude for a street address).

    Microsoft provides a WSDL file which describes the service and is
    used by SOAP client libraries to expose its API to programs.
    SOAP::Lite does not support WSDL to the extent needed by Mappoint,
    thus the need for this module.

    Net::Mappoint provides a perl mapping of the complete Mappoint API.
    It automatically encodes the required SOAP requests for each call in
    the API, and presents Mappoint responses as nested data structures
    that are easy to access.

    We chose the Net::Mappoint name because of the precedent set by
    Net::Google and Net::Amazon, which provide similar APIs for Google
    and Amazon web services.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Mappoint        bdpOp Mappoint web service SOAP access library     CGARCIA
