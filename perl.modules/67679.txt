As I previously mentioned on here, what I think Net::IRC really needs is a
final release with DEPRECATED in big letters and pointers to the modern
modules that have replaced it.

Christopher's email is a first step to see if we can find the maintainers
and get them to agree, but we're keeping modules@ cc'ed for the record so
if we can't find them, this can be turned into a takeover process in a
few months.
