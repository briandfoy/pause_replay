Contribution: I hope to adopt the HTML::Table module.  This appears to have been 
orphaned by its current owner, and I wish to distribute an updated version that I am using 
in my applications.  My research shows that Stacy Lacy was hoping for someone to take 
over the module a couple of years ago.  It hasn't been possible to contact them recently.

Module: Current entry reads:
    HTML::Table    bnpO    Write HTML tables via spreadsheet metaphor

Discussed:  I have tried to reach Stacy Lacy by email, comp.lang.perl.modules, and 
modules@perl.org.  I have also discussed this with Matt Sisk who had contact with 
Stacy Lacy a couple of year ago.
