Sprout -

    Sorry about ENOTIME before. I should have at least replied and
gotten you set up to comaint (which I can definitely use help with!).

    Do you want me to apply patches or do you want to apply them
yourselves? I'm good either way. I've left several version numbers
open between the current release (1.0014) and the dev release of the
new refactored version (1.0019_01) if we need them.

Rob
