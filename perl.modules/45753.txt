The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::RandomResults
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Test non-deterministic functions
  userid:      COG (José Alves de Castro)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Testing functions when you know the expected behavior can be
    troublesome on its own. Testing functions that are supposed to
    return random results is even more complicated and people tend to
    not even test them at all, not knowing what to test exactly.

    Test::RandomResults provides some ways of testing these
    non-deterministic functions and, through documentation, it aims to
    help users understand what else they can do to ensure their
    non-deterministic code works as expected.

  enteredby:   COG (José Alves de Castro)
  enteredon:   Mon Nov  7 00:10:58 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::RandomResults   Rdpfp Test non-deterministic functions             COG
