The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bundle::OpenSRF
  DSLIP:       cdpnp
  description: Defines all preq modules for OpenSRF
  userid:      KADOS (Joshua Ferraro)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This bundle defines all prereq modules for the perl code used in
    the OpenSRF component of the Open-ILS (http://open-ils.org)
    Integrated Library System (library as in librarian). For now, it
    only includes non-OpenILS and non-OpenSRF modules (ie, ones
    publically available but eventually, it will include all the perl
    for that project (when it is uploaded to CPAN).

  enteredby:   KADOS (Joshua Ferraro)
  enteredon:   Thu Dec  8 00:58:23 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Bundle::
::OpenSRF         cdpnp Defines all preq modules for OpenSRF         KADOS
