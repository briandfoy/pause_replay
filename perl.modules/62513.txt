As noted in my other mail, I really don't think this is true.

The biggest obstacle to people using CPAN modules is them not finding
them in the first place - and the primary way people -do- find them is
through the name.

I really hope you'll reconsider - I strongly suspect that your current
name is substantially less findable, and therefore substantially less
likely to be used, than any of the alternatives suggested.
