Subject: Tidying up CPAN author directories - deleting old releases

Hi Yoshioka-san,

I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins. The NOC have let us know that =
we=E2=80=99re getting low on diskspace on the CPAN master. This is =
caused by old (superseded) releases being retained in CPAN author =
directories. So we=E2=80=99ve identified the authors who can free up the =
most diskspace by deleting old releases from their author directory.

Deleting the old releases of your Lingua-JA-WordNet distribution would =
free up 241M, plus you have old releases of your other distributions as =
well.

Would you be happy to cull your old releases from your CPAN author =
directory please? All releases you=E2=80=99ve ever done will always be =
available from your BackPAN author directory:
	http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/P/PA/PAWAPAWA/

There are at least 3 ways we can make this happen:

1. you could use the script here: =
https://gist.github.com/xdg/1739bea8ef36c4a48e4d2969bc31bf38
2. you can manually mark files for deletion via the PAUSE interface
3. you can give me permission to do this on your behalf

The script mentioned in (1) was written by David Golden and Rik Signes. =
It keeps all developer releases later than a stable release, keeps up to =
3 stable releases, and deletes everything else. Use at your own risk, of =
course.

If you give me permission, I would delete everything other than the =
latest release for anything older than a year, and 3 releases of =
anything less than a year old. When marked for deletion, you=E2=80=99d =
have 3 days to check and revert anything you=E2=80=99re not happy with, =
before PAUSE would actually delete them.

Thanks for your help =E2=80=94 please ask if anything isn=E2=80=99t =
clear, or if you want to suggest something else.

Cheers,
Neil
