Well, you clearly do ok at writing documentation - why not contribute some?

Brad is wrong. See below.

If you look at that thread it clearly shows that there are about four
subroutines that are "expensive" and that these can all be easily optimised.

Moose done right can be considered heavy in terms of -startup- overhead
but runtime is normally fast - and if startup is the issue then Mouse can
be used instead at the cost of the introspection features.

So no code rewrite is required, just somebody willing to spend about a day
doing some optimisation tweaking.

Moose objects allow plain hash access.

I think code to allow the protobuf-perl project to fuynction without protoc
would be a very good idea.

Keep your parser, throw away the Class::Accessor parts since C::A is old,
limited and actually slower than properly optimised Moose code by some way,
and do some quick optimisation on the protobuf stuff so it performs properly.
