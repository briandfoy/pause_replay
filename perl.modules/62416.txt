I have granted Stefan co-maintenance permissions for Inline::Python and
the sub-namespaces. This means that Stefan can upload new versions and
they will be indexed by the PAUSE indexer.

Neil, it does *not* take away your primary maintainer status. You can,
at all times, remove co-maintainers, but I assume good maintenance of
your modules is in your best interest.

If you have any further questions, feel free to contact modules@perl.org.

Best regards,
Steffen
