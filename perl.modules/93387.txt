Hi Andy,

Would you be happy to give me co-maint on Pod::POM? I don=E2=80=99t have =
any plans for it myself, but have someone who wanted to submit a PR to =
fix a bug.

I noticed that Andrew Ford previously had co-maint, and did releases =
from 2009 to 2013, but his account is now in PAUSE custodial state. And =
I see that you still have ownership over the modules, which is why I=E2=80=
=99m mailing you.

I=E2=80=99ve also copied modules@perl.org <mailto:modules@perl.org>, in =
case anyone there knows of any stated preferences of Andrew.

Cheers,
Neil
