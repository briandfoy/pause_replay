    Well, it should be able to parse any IHC config files (as they're all
the same syntax) -- at least BIND and DHCP, off the top of my head.  It
would be good if the name reflected that level of generality.

    Also, the Net:: namespace is all about network protocols, not file
formats or parsing.  How about Text::IHCparse?
