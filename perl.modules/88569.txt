     why:

    I worked with Mark Grimes <mgrimes@cpan.org> with some updates to
    the Finance::Bank::Schwab module--and I'll probably submit more
    changes through him in the future as I enhance the functionality
    even more.

    My next project will likely be Finance::Bank::AonHewitt which will
    pull similar data from my own 401(k), but I suspect that it'll work
    for any corporate front-end that has accounts held with Hewitt.

    Another may be Finance::Bank::Fidelity because, heck, I seem to
    have an active brokerage account there, too, and I'm sort of getting
    the hang of meddling with financial sites.

    If I ever get around to it, another module would be to slurp up
    data from my SolarEdge account--it's one of the manufacturers of
    Solar-powered inverters. Folks have been asking for an API for
    years, but since that may not happen for a while I may as well roll
    my own and provide it on CPAN.

    Thanks!

    Ryan
