The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Geometry::Planar::Offset
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: create interior and exterior polygon offsets
  userid:      EWILHELM (Eric Wilhelm)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is the first open source implementation of an offset algorithm
    which does not create self-intersecting polygons in the output. Many
    papers have been written about offset polygons and straight
    skeletons, but little or no code has been made available.

    This module contains a recursive subroutine which reliably
    calculates interior and exterior offsets of simple (without holes)
    polygons. It handles vertex split and join events, and will return
    multiple polygons if any vertex intersects an edge during the offset
    process.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::Geometry::Planar::
