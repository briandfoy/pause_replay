Please make use of the menu entry "Edit Module Metadata" on PAUSE, you
can change the entry there yourself.

It seems that you did not receive my answer to your previous mail.
Sorry bout that, apparently I lost it before sending.

The mistake is that the file version.pm does not contain any package
statement or package qualifier. Thus $VERSION is interpreted as being
in the main:: namespace. I suppose qualifying alone will do. Please
note that FCGI 0.58 had a file FCGI.pm with a $VERSION statement and a
proper package declaration. That's why it worked in 0.58 but not in
0.62.
