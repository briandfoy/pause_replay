The module list says:

   If developing modules for private internal or project specific use,
   that will never be released to the public, then you should ensure
   that their names will not clash with any future public module. You
   can do this either by using the reserved Local::* category or by
   using an underscore in the top level name like Foo_Corp::*.

It was added to the module list at 1997/05/06.
