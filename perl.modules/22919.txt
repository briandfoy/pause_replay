Hello,

I'm working on a module to do some validating of US SSNs above any
beyond seeing if they are "9 digits". I'm currently working off the
area data located at:

http://www.ssa.gov/foia/stateweb.html

Currently, the module (infancy stages, so I want it on the CPAN so
others can pitch in) validates SSNs based on those area ranges, making
sure the group isn't '00' and the serial isn't '0000'. I plan to work
in the High Groups next. As well, it will return the state for a given
area. 

I am working with the package name of SSN::Validate. No
SSN:: root namespace exists. I'm not sure if it should be
Validate::SSN, as it would then sit next to Validate::Net which could
be seen as a namespace pollution. I'd rather follow suite with the
*::Validate modules.

Does SSN::Validate or SSN::Valid seem ok to use? Any other suggestions?

Cheers,
Kevin
