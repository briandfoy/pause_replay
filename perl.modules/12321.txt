    <P><B>INTERNET VIP, Inc. (IVIP) DBA NEWTECH BRAKE CORP</B>, has
    entered into a re-organization and re-orientation of the Company.
    These changes are being made pursuant to an Asset Acquisition
    and Change of Control Agreement dated as of April 11, 2002 between
    IVIP and NewTech Group International, Inc., of Blainville, Quebec.
    In essence, <U>the agreement calls for the spin-off of the former
    IVIP telecom business into a new corporation</U>, and the simultaneous
    acquisition of the rights to exploit the patents for a revolutionary
    heavy vehicle braking system developed by NewTech Group. In addition,
    IVIP has turned over control of the Company to senior management
    of NewTech Group to administer and profit from the newly acquired
    assets. The new business of the Company is to identify, develop
    and exploit, under licenses bought from NewTech Group,opportunities
    to provide a new full contact disc brakes and related components
    to the North American and European heavy vehicle market. <U>These
    new brakes are called NT brakes.</U><BR>

    <P><B>The motor vehicle industry has been in existence since
    the 19th century</B> and can be classified as a mature and =
performance/cost
    driven. Brakes are complex, high-precision components and part
    of the most critical components of motor vehicles. Nevertheless,
    there has been no significant innovation in the brake industry
    for over fifty years, and the caliper concept disc brake has
    reached its optimal development potential. As a result, the brake
    industry is very competitive, with a small number of suppliers
    depending on economies of scale and intra-industry consolidation
    for growth.</P>

    <P>Although disc brakes have gradually replaced drum brakes in
    automobiles and light trucks in North America, they have not
    proven significantly superior and economical to use on trucks,trailers
    and buses. <U>Drum brakes, a technology that dates back to the
    First World War, are still installed onapproximately 97% of heavy
    vehicles</U>, i.e., classes 7 and 8, in operation in North America.
    A significant fact, and key to NewTech Brake&#146;s marketing
    strategy, is that the customer selects the brakes to be installed
    even when purchasing his new bus or truck.</P>

    <P><B>Competitive factors are: durability and reliability, price,
    ease of installation, low maintenance requirements and light
    weight combined with high strength</B></TD>

    <P><B>The patented NewTech full contact disc brake</B> is a bold
    departure from conventional braking technology. It combines disc
    brake braking efficiency, lighter weight with large contact friction
    area comparable to drum brake. The NewTech brake can stop a truck,
    loaded to its maximum gross weight, from 60 MPH in less than
    200 feet.</P>

    <P>After nearly ten years of virtual and computer design, the
    expenditure of over US $30 million of research and development
    work, and more than two years of extensive testing, <U>the current
    design of the foundation full-contact brake is now ready for
    industrialization and commercialization.</U></P>
