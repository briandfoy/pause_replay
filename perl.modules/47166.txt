I've very much also like to take a look at the issue of parallel and 
cluster naming, as I'm heading down a similar path.

See the Process:: family of modules for the beginnings of my work on 
abstract computational process objects.

Certainly, I know there are people working on the PITA project that are 
talking about build various types of clusters that work using the 
Process:: modules. I myself will probably be doing a basic software 
testing cluster in the next few months.

Because Perl clustering as a general field in CPAN is still relatively 
young, I'm not sure I'm keen to see anything in particular take the 
"authorative" root name for a single module, in the same way that one 
module too Workflow.pm and then turned out to be not necesarily the best 
module to be holding that name.

I'd be happy to see Cluster::Brand modules start to accumulate, and then 
if some sort of consolidation happens after that to refactor into a 
generalised best practice Cluster.pm module, we can do it then (in the 
same way that Tree:: just went through a consolidation).
