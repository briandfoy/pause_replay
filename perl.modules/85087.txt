Gisle, if you're ridiculously busy I have no problem with doing the
release management - but while I can currently accept the pull request,
I don't have co-maint.

I'm cc-ing in modules@ because hopefully they'll be able to ping you some
way that I don't currently know - and because I think this is a big enough
problem that if we don't hear back soon I'm going to be asking modules@ to
grant me temporary co-maint for an emergency release.
