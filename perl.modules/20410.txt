The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       W3C::LogValidator
  DSLIP:       Rmppo
  description: Web log processing and validation
  userid:      OLIVIERT (Olivier Thereaux)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/

  similar:

  rationale:

    W3C has a decent number of perl development projects
    (http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/perl), and per our coding policy, modules
    developed at W3C use the W3C:: root namespace.

    These modules used to be experimental tools (mostly proof of
    concept for the new technologies developed at W3C) but we
    (especially the new W3C QA development team, in charge of the
    validator for example) are currently pushing for their release, as
    well as developing tools for a wider audience (such as this
    W3C::LogValidator).

    I have pondered whether we should apply for this root namespace
    (W3C::) or modify our modules and concluded that the namespace would
    be useful to identify modules related to the development of W3C
    specifications and technologies (and not just easier for us
    developers).

    Now for this particular module... It's a rather old project,
    started as an internal tool at W3C, and everyone would tell us that
    it would be a good tool for webmaster (at least validation conscious
    ones) so we developed it as a flexible Log processing/validation
    module.

The resulting entry would be:

W3C::
