The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::Reconciliation
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Reconciliation routines for Data::Table(s)
  userid:      CHATEAU (Châteauvieux)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.moderated

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    Reconciliation - Utility to compare tables & report differences

    DESCRIPTION A reconciliation program is a program which tries to
    establish connection between two data sources. The variant currently
    implemented is actually a kind of diff which works on records and
    fields, instead of lines. The implementation expects Data::Table
    objects as sources.

    This kind of comparison is typically used to cross check two
    systems where a interface is transfering data.

    This is only an Alpha version. The INTERFACE WILL CHANGE to allow
    better reporting.

The resulting entry would be:

Data::
::Reconciliation  idpOp Reconciliation routines for Data::Table(s)   CHATEAU
