Hi Jan, hi modules@,

as Alexandr Ciornii mentions in a recent mail, Jan Dubois' releases of
libwin32 are tagged with the "unauthorized release" flag on search.cpan.org.

I think we all agree that his releases aren't actually unauthorized.
Would anybody mind if I give him co-maintainer status for those modules
which lack him?

Best regards,
Steffen
