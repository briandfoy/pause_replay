The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::SAX::Writer
  DSLIP:       ampOp
  description: SAX2 XML Writer
  userid:      RBERJON (Robin Berjon)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perl-xml@lists.activestate.com

  similar:
    XML::Handler::YAWriter

  rationale:

    Hi,

    this module is an XML writer for SAX2. It is different from
    previous modules of similar functionality in that it is the first
    SAX2-compliant XML Writer. Patching previously existing modules was
    a problem because we need to maintain SAX1 compatibility in them,
    which is not compatible with SAX2. Besides, it also uses a pluggable
    approach based on consumer classes that do the writing while it only
    does the formatting.

    Thanks !

    PS: I note that there appears to have been a slow-down in
    processing from modules@perl.org recently. I'd be happy to help
    there with what time I have if tuits are in short availability.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::SAX::
::Writer          ampOp SAX2 XML Writer                              RBERJON
