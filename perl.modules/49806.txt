The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TL
  DSLIP:       bmhOp
  description: Tripletail, a framework for Japanese Web App
  userid:      MIKAGE (佐野 拓)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    Catalyst, CGI::Application, Jifty

  rationale:

    We send you a registration application with the same namespace as
    we sent you before, since we couldn't outfit one in English at that
    time.

    TL (Tripletail) is a framework for Web application.

    In case of developing a software that work with Japanese, there are
    often problems in treating character sets: There are several
    different character sets for Japanese, and a software sometimes
    needs to use some of them without being confused.

    TL works around to those problems which are specific to Japanese,
    and provides many features that are needed to develop a web site
    centers around web applications.

    This framework mainly targets Web applications, but it also has
    features for batch processing, mail manipulation, and the rest. So
    we don't think CGI:: namespace is appropriate for TL, we desire the
    root one.

    Some features like Debug Screen and DBI Wrapper can be used not
    only for web applications, but also batch scripts. The debugging
    utilities provide the following features: - Send a mail containing
    stack trace to the administrator - Profile the execution time of SQL
    statements - Watch certain variables and log the content of them
    whenever they change

    In addition, TL has the following features that are other than
    CGI-related: - Recognize Japanese holidays - Create and parse mails
    in Japanese - Turn a web page to HTML mail - Sign a mail with S/MIME
    - Process its own mail queue, and send mails using SMTP These would
    be under Date:: or Mail:: if they were considered as separate
    modules.

    We want to avoid moving TL:: namespace to another, because TL has
    already some actual achivements and we don't want to break the
    compatibility.
