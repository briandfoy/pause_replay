The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       ScriptUtil
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Make typical command line scripts easier
  userid:      CAMSTUART (Cameron Stuart)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Script::Toolbox

  rationale:

    I didn't want to clash with Matthias's Script::Toolbox, so I
    figured 'ScriptUtil' was a nice short and succinct alternative.

    I plan to make several sub modules under ScriptUtil:: which may
    also have similar names to Script::Toolbox, and therefore become
    confused.

    The coding style and usage differ also, my module(s) are and will
    continue to be Mooseisfied, I want to encourage inheritance and
    other lovely OO techniques for ScriptUtil's use.

    Also, I would like to see more modules written using Moose under
    the hood because it's cool.

    I decided against adding Moose somewhere in the namespace because
    when Perl6 arrives I intend to rewrite my modules according to the
    final Perl6 object system's style, and hopefully have no (or at
    least minimal) changes to the interfaces.

    Another reason for motivating me to have this module on CPAN is
    this: I have worked with Perl for many years and always wanted to
    get my 'name up in lights' so to speak, but always found that there
    were one or more modules already doing exactly whatever my
    imagination could come up with. Until now of course.

    And finally, It would be great to have it on my Resume. Next time a
    potential employer ask to see some of my code, I can point them at
    the cpan. Hey, at least I'm honest :)

The resulting entry would be:
