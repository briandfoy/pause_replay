The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Files
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Test file contents and directory structures
  userid:      PHILCROW (Philip Crow)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Differences Test::File Text::Diff

  rationale:

    Test::Files makes it easy to compare files generated during testing
    to strings in the test script or to files shipped in the
    distribution. It is a wrapper around Text::Diff which uses
    Algorithm::Diff. The result is a small adapter which simplifies file
    comparisons while still giving quality diff output when the tests
    fail.

    Test::Files uses File::Find to check whole directory structures and
    their files' contents. This is useful if you need to test
    interactions with a revision control system, or anything else that
    manages collections of files.

    Test::Differences is a wrapper around Text::Diff which is great for
    comparing strings. But, it doesn't open files for you. Test::Files
    is another wrapper around Text::Diff which does open files.
