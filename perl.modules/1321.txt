comrades--

For the past several months, on and off, I have been working on a
general-purpose software construction framework.  It's written in Perl, and
it is currently distributed in two modules (one of which delivers an
accompanying script).  Future directions point to at least one more,
potentially many more.

I requested an author directory with the PAUSE back in December, and I
uploaded my first draft versions of code at that time, but I seem to have
misunderstood the process for requesting that my contributions be
considered for adding to the Module List.  It's just as well, since I am
nearly ready to upload a second draft.  Now is the time to get it right.

My author directory is--

	http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/J/JW/JWOODYATT/

All the code I have submitted so far is located there.

I consulted the module-authors list for advice on picking a good namespace
for my framework.  It's a tough call.  There have been a lot of different
attempts at software construction tools in Perl, and mine is very different
from most of them.  It's not simply a script like "cons," and it's not
intended for a narrow subset of software construction problems like
MakeMaker.  It's a general purpose framework, so modules in the framework
need a good basename.

I chose 'Conjury::*' as the base of my namespace at the suggestion of
several participants on module-authors.  I suppose I could change it again
if the Perl module namespace cabal finds it unacceptable.

Just so you know, the next version of the software I submit to my author
directory will be the version that will be used as the construction toolset
for a moderately complex commercial software project involving two other
developers besides me, and which is due to be completed this summer.  I
would really like to get the namespace issue settled before I start coding
the build system for this project.

My first question: what is the next step for me to take for my contribution
to be considered for listing on the Module List?
