Hello.

Does anybody know any realization of a simple HTTP interface to the CDDB or
FreeDB database.
I need to do string searches without the need for the CD or the CD ID that
is normally needed.
For example, I need to get all albums for particular artist.

I've found module Net::CDDBScan in span.org but I see there are no updates
since 2000.
It's exactly what I need but it doesn't work I suppose this module is dead
because I see it uses
HTML document parsing and I think the layout of this document changed since
2000.

Who can suggest any ways to resolve my problem?
Once again:
- I need to get all albums for particular artist.
- I need to get all tracks for particular artist and album.

Thanks in advance
Vitaliy.
