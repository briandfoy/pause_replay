Brian,

Again, please feel free to ship me off to comp.lang.perl.modules or 
wherever.  Anyway, the concept of this module is to provide an efficient 
Perlish scripting environment for the Web.  I'm thinking maybe "PGI - 
Perl Gateway Interface" because it's very similar to CGI in intent.

There are things I want to include that make it unlikely that I can 
simply use existing projects.  Specifically:

Simple URI-to-file mapping that can still hide executable file 
extensions (e.g., /admin/kill maps to /admin/kill.pl)
A persistent Perl instance that can cache scripts
Consistent, concise, Perlish names
Directory configurations (a la Apache's .htaccess)

Thanks for all your help and input,
CvH
