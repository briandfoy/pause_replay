     why:

    Greetings! I have a very fast file-based constant database that I
    would like to make available on CPAN. Similar to how the existing
    CDB_File module sits on cdb, this new module is called MCDB_File and
    sits on top of mcdb (which I wrote). The Perl module can be found at
    https://github.com/gstrauss/mcdb/tree/master/contrib/MCDB_File

    Please feel free contact me with any further questions or
    suggestions.

    Thank you! Glenn
