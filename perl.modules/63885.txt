the reason why I'm asking is that Finance::Quote has received extensions
by various authors over the years and that seems to have worked well. My
rule of thumb when to include some sub-module in the main distribution
is that it makes sense if it does not impose any serious additional
dependencies that some users might not need. Obviously, that's satisfied
in this case.

All that being said, I'll register the requested namespace for you if
you insist.

Best regards,
Steffen
