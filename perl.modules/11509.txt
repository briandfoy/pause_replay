The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Cfe
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: File configuration module
  userid:      JHAGG (Jörgen Hägg)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The module is inspired from the file edit function in cfengine and
    cfengine-users should recognize themselves rather easily so it feels
    natural to name it Cfe. (Note that Config::Cfe is only inspired from
    cfengine, it is not a direct replacement, it has evolved from a need
    to automate remote configuration of unix hosts.)

    And after an earlier discussion on the modules-list I added Config
    as prefix, after all, it is designed to edit configure files and
    other similar types of files. (Although there is nothing that
    restricts it to just config files. :-)

    It has been used for a year or more in a production environment for
    configuring servers and clients without any major changes so it
    should be stable by now.

    So I hope I could help other people, especially admins, by
    releasing the code.

    There is also an executable script included, update-cfe, which uses
    Config::Cfe to edit text files in shell scripts.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::Cfe             Rdpfg File configuration module                    JHAGG
