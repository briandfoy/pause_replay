TO: Admin of PAUSE

Hello, This is Satoshi Azuma (a.k.a. YTURTLE on CPAN).
I wrote this mail like praying, because I had a problem on PAUSE...

I cannot login to PAUSE from some years ago.
Following is synopsis of this problem.

Step 1. LOGIN-ID / PASSWORD never came to my mailbox in some years.
I tried "Forgot Password?" in PAUSE many times.
Still LOGIN-ID / PASSWORD never came.

Step 2. I contacted to PAUSE Administration team.
He (Johan Vromans) responced as following.
> Your password has been reset. You'll receive a personal mail with the
> new password.
But, LOGIN-ID / PASSWORD never came.
(I misunderstood his mail, because my english skill is so poor. I
responced with password I generated. But this was so nonsence.)

Step 3. Retried "Step 1".
Still never came one.

PLEASE, PLEASE RESPONSE TO THIS MAIL WITH PAUSE LOGIN ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD.

ONEGAI SHIMASU.
