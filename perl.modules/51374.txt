I believe could agree with that.  This name is technically accurate, but ICS
is also Internet Calendar/Schedule format.  I would rather not change the
name, but it seems like it should be changed.  Is there any way to change
the name to something that would continue to suggest that it extends the
CyberSource ICS module without being ambiguous?

Thanks,
Dusty
