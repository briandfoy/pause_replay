The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Podcast
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Root module for the Podcast namespace
  userid:      CLONE (Steve Bussetti)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    IRC

  similar:
    Podcast::Publisher MP3::Podcast

  rationale:

    The Podcast namespace lacks a root level module that handles low
    level functions like, writing the podcast.

    Other packages provide larger solutions ( Podcast::Publisher
    manages lists of your podcasts in the database, and MP3::Podcast
    implicitly scrapes directories for MP3s; both are fairly
    un-malleable ).

    My module exists to take array refs of hashrefs containing podcast
    episode information (path and metadta) and converting those
    structures into an XML file.

    It accepts any open IO::* class module to write to, excepting
    IO::String, which is (evidently) not compatible with XML::Writer,
    and therefor the substitute XML::Writer::String is used.

    There could be an argument made that the root namespace item should
    be more general, but based on modules currently on cpan, it appears
    to be devoted only to *writing* podcasts, and therefore calling it a
    Podcast::Writer class would be redundant. To wit, instead of
    Podcast::Reader most people (like the venerable Lincoln Stein with
    MP3::PodcastFetch) chose to list the target first, and then Podcast
    as the subordinate namespace.

    I have this module written and in production, so it can be supplied
    for discussion.

The resulting entry would be:

Podcast           cdpOp Root module for the Podcast namespace        CLONE
