 Dear Sir 
 
 My name is LOIS .C.ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH 
 ESTRADA, the former President of Republic Of The Philippines. 
 . 
 My husband was recently impeached from office by a 
 backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. 
 
 My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on 
 charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the 
 mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. 
 The present government is forcing my husband out of 
 Manila to avoid demonstration by his supporters. 
 
 During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, 
 I realized some reasonable amount of money from 
 various deals that I successfully executed. I have 
 plans to invest this money for my children's future on real 
 estate and industrial production. My husband is not 
 aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for 
 now. 
 
 Before my husband was impeached, I secretly moved out 
 the sum of $35,000,000 million USD (Thirty Five million United 
 states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money 
 with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments 
 through diplomatic means. 
 
 I am contacting you because I want you to go to the 
 security company and claim the money on my behalf 
 since I have declared that the consignment belongs to 
 my foreign business partner. You shall also be 
 required to assist me in investment in your country. 
 
 I hope you will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me 
 properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of 
 the total money you will take for your assistance. 
 
 When I receive your positive response I will let you 
 know where the security company is 
 and the payment pin code to claim the money which is 
 very important. 
 
 For now, let all our communication be by e-mail 
 because my phone lines are presently beign monitored by the 
 state security services in the Phillipines. Please 
 also send me your telephone and fax number. 
 
 I will have my son contact you for more details about
 the transaction on receipt of your reply,and also give you a  . 
 safe phone and FAX number for subsequent corresspondence.
 . 
 
 MRS LOI C ESTRADA
