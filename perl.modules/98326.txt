     why:

    I have used several packages from CPAN and find I am manually
    modifying them or even creating my own to accomplish a particular
    task. If I could contribute to current packages, and possibly create
    my own in some cases, others may be able to benefit from the changes
    as well.

    I have already created a pull request for Convert::ASN1 via github.
    I do a lot of SSL work and would like to create packages and/or
    contribute to packages related to SSL, managing certs/keys,
    validating them, managing bundles, etc. I am in networking and would
    like to contribute to the NetAddr::IP package and possibly create
    sub packages of that as well.
