The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::DE::DeutscheBank
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Interface to Online Banking (Deutsche Bank)
  userid:      WSCHL (Wolfgang Schlueschen)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    As there does not exist any module which is able to access the
    online banking webpage of the Deutsch Bank I decided to write this
    module. The namespace was choosen in the same way it was done for
    other finance banking modules by other authors. The level ::DE:: is
    inserted between because I don't know if this bank offers webpages
    in other countries, too. Support for other languages ( which would
    be needed to parse table headers in HTML ) will lead to the same
    needs.

  enteredby:   WSCHL (Wolfgang Schlueschen)
  enteredon:   Thu Dec  4 21:08:10 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::DE::
::DeutscheBank    bdpOg Interface to Online Banking (Deutsche Bank)  WSCHL
