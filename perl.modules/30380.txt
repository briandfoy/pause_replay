Subject: Module submission Data::ID::Maildir
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Data::ID::Maildir
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: generate maildir-style unique IDs
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    UUID Win32::Guidgen Data::ID::Exim

  rationale:

    See the rationale for Data::ID::Exim (which I uploaded a few
    minutes ago) for discussion of the Data::ID:: namespace choice.

    Maildir-style IDs are useful particularly to anyone who is
    operating on maildirs. They're also of great general utility, as
    they're simple, textual, and robust.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Fri Apr  2 18:52:40 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Data::ID::
::Maildir         Rdpfp generate maildir-style unique IDs            ZEFRAM
