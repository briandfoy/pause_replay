... or else we'll all have to live with my name for it. :-)

I tried posting on comp.lang.perl.modules (I forgot which how-to doc 
suggested it) when naming Data::XHash and got zero feedback.

Since the Pause naming article suggests modules@perl.org and 
module-authors@perl.org, I hope I've got the best places now. (If not, 
where should I be asking these days?)

My "yet another text template module" has these as some major design goals:

  * Absolutely bare-bones syntax (it is my hope that even non-programmer
    users (with some limited training) can edit templates)
  * "String-sized" templates (like "useful and still fits in a
    varchar(255)")
  * Control over maximum text length and number of template "steps"
    executed in order to prevent accidental or malicious
    denial-of-service attacks

It is content agnostic, and initially targeted toward application 
message localization, but there is nothing that makes it specific to 
that use. I plan on using it in a CMS system I have in mind, but there's 
nothing that makes it specific to that either. It's not a derivative of 
another template system. (I searched CPAN for template-related stuff, 
including Template::Toolkit and company, Text::Template, and 
(HTML::)Mason and didn't see anything similar; if I missed another 
similar package, I would love to hear about that too.)

I've been developing under "Text::TemplateLite" (for light-weight 
syntax, size, and resource usage), but I realize it's yet another one of 
those "Simple, Easy, Reduced, Tiny,..." names and I'm hoping someone can 
share some specific wisdom rather than general guidelines.
