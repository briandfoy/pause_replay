I noticed a couple things on CPAN as I was looking at this module

   * a lot of this sort of stuff shows up under Digest

   * the String::CRC module hasn't been updated since 1997, and
   is in the public domain

I would really like to see a Digest:: version, but if you don't
want to do that much work, I wonder if there is some way you could
move into the String::CRC spot.
