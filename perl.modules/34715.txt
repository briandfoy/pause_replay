I answer like that, but I don't know if it is the right way to answer....

Yes, it is a real module. I used to write perl scripts, and I would like 
them to log. So I wrote a sub for logging. As I wrote more and more 
scripts, I copy/paste that snippet of code. Them I decided to make a 
modules.
So, first of all, it is a module for logging. Useful at least for me :)
Then, I decided to put a bit of fun in the logs (if you read french, 
read the reports of the tests) : if you specify fun => <n>, then it will 
write a funny things each times it logs something, with a probability of 
<n>%
For example, if you say 'fun => 100', it will write a funny thing each 
time something is logged!
Actually, that 'fun' option is not really useful for production scripts 
(like those I make at work), but of course you can use it without fun, 
and then it become a nice and easy to use logging module.

Regards

I added fun :P

is this a real module (as in not some sort of Acme::* joke)?

What does it really do?
