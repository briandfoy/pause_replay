     why:

    I have been in contact with the CPAN module owner of
    Apache::AuthCAS (Dave Castro) for the purpose of generating a forked
    version of AuthCAS that provides essential features that it would
    not otherwise provide. Both Apache/Apache2::AuthCAS have not been
    touched for updates in several years my hope is to contribute a
    forked version of combining both of these modules that does not
    require a database connection (DBI) but could also use FastMMemory
    (CHI) instead. A working version using CHI has already been created
    the work remaining includes adapting the benefits from the two
    existing AuthCAS modules.
