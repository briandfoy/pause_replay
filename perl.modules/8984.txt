The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::Fake
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: fake the mod_perl environment in CGI scripts
  userid:      JWALT (Jörg Walter)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Apache::Emulate

  rationale:

    This module tries to provide a complete mod_perl environment, not
    just some "Apache-Object-Fake", like Apache::Emulate and several
    scripts around the net do. It currently fakes 8 modules of the
    Apache:: collection and is already fairly complete. It even uses the
    original apache config files (httpd.conf, .htaccess) to retrieve any
    mod_perl related settings - switching from/to Apache::Fake is a
    matter of seconds. Apache::Emulate, while very incomplete, might
    have the advantage of smaller size and more compact configuration,
    while Apache::Fake aims for completeness and isn't restricted to the
    Apache object.

The resulting entry would be:
