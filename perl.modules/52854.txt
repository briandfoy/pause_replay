Greetings,

I have a question about the module process.  I just now uploaded
a module (Language::Logo) which seems to be working okay.

There was a similar namespace to my module created on or near
January 19th, called /Tk::CanvasLogo/, by Greg London, who saw
my Language-Logo presentation at Boston Perlmongers, and created
a short but similar version of his own.  After exchanging emails, we
agreed that I would take over the Tk::CanvasLogo project and the
corresponding namespace (his most recent email to me is attached
below).

I'm wondering -- what do I need to do to assume control over the
Tk::CanvasLogo namespace?  In his email, he suggests that it's fairly
easy to do, but I thought it best to run it by you first.

Thanks,
John

Following is Greg London's email to me from January 20:

>         > module and namespace for it.
>               

        Sure. Consider it yours.

            

>         > Please let me know how to go about doing that.

        As far as I know, all you need to do is create an
        account on the cpan PAUSE server here

        http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html

        (click on item 3)

        And then upload a more recent version when youre ready.

        (explained in item 2)



        The way to create a distribution (.tar.gz file that people
        can download from CPAN and intall using standard commands)
        is explained in my book "Impatient Perl" here

        http://www.greglondon.com/iperl/html/iperl.htm

        section 15.4

        If you start with the tarball I created and add to it,
        then all you need to do is add any new filenames you need
        to include in the tarball to your MANIFEST file
        (at the top level directory) and run 'make dist' when you're
        ready to create a new tarball. That will give you a new
        version of "Tk::CanvasLogo" tar.gz

        If you want to rename the root namespace for the whole
        distribution, then use the instructions in my book.
        You could use this to start a new version called
        "Language::Logo" tar.gz and then Tk::CanvasLogo would
        be a module included inside as part of the MANIFEST file.

        Let me know if you have any questions about the upload
        process or about my code.

        Enjoy,
        Greg
