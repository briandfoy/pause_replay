All,
I tried to contact the author of Authen::NTLM, as it has a 2+ year old =
bug that can be fixed very easily, but his advertised email bounces....  =
The email bounce, and my original message are below. How do I go about =
getting this little fix put in to CPAN.=20
It's already listed as a bug at: =
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=3D9521 and has been for a =
long time - but it seems it's still not in the module.  =20

What do I do to get it fixed?=20

Hi Mark,
	I've just been using your great Authen::NTLM perl module on CPAN =
(http://search.cpan.org/~markbush/NTLM-1.02/) , as its still way better =
than any of the other alternatives out there ( accessing it via =
LWP::Authen::Ntlm is so great!)... however, it has a bug that prevents =
it working out-of-the box, and I had a very hard time trying to find the =
solution..... but here it is, and someone already beat me to it:


http://groups.google.no/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/6ebc5125e599c423?hl=
=3Den&lr=3D

in short:
NTLM.pm V1.02, Line 173 needs to be changed:

#original version
    $domain =3D substr($c_info->{buffer}, 0, $c_info->{domain}{len}); =20

# revised version
    $domain =3D substr($challenge, $c_info->{domain}{offset}, =
$c_info->{domain}{len}); ;=20

any chance you could release a new version (1.03?) to CPAN?
