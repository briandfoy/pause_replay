From: John.Redford@fmr.com ("Redford, John")

I would like to publish another module of mine. This module is (presently)
named Spawn. It exports two routines. 'spawn' and 'spawn_pty'. The usage is:
  ($pid, $in_fh, $out_fh, $err_fh) = spawn( "command" | ["array", "of",
"command", "words"] );
  ($pid, $fh) = spawn_pty( "command" | ["array", "of", "command", "words"]
);

I suppose this does not seem very dissimilar to Open3. The main differences
are the calling convention (I don't believe that exposing GLOBs is ever a
really good idea), and the 'pty' option.

This module was written to support the 'React' module, which I'll be
describing in my next mail...
