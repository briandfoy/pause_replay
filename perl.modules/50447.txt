I haven't but I shall. There's not much there at the moment though -  
he can generate basic GPX files including only waypoints. I'm also  
not /that/ keen on the interface he's defined. My plan was to produce  
these two modules and then contact him with a view to implementing  
his module in terms of the new modules.

But I'll contact him and discuss it :)

My thinking in creating two modules is that there's actually very  
little overlap between reading and writing.

Possibly not... I'm not sure what would be preferable though.

I was thinking that the GPX bit of the name logically sits higher in  
the namespace hierarchy than the Parse / Read bit.

Geo::GPX::Parser
Geo::GPX::Writer

seems to me better than

Geo::Parser::GPX
Geo::Writer::GPX

what do you think?
