	Noted.

	It's not written in C.  Incidentally, the reason for using the
	_ (underscore) is quite simply because HTML_Tree is a valid
	identifier whereas HTML-Tree isn't.  I may get around to
	namespacing the C++ code and HTML_Tree would be the namespace
	name.

	HTML_TreeC++ is not a valid identifier.

	I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.

	Apache is a full software product: its name can be as
	meaningless as automobile names and it's still OK.  Mere
	modules, however, should be more descriptive (just like the
	individual components of a car: I'd like the windshield wiper
	control in my car to be called a windshield wiper control).

	Just because there are other bad names out there that people
	have come to know doesn't mean I have to follow suit.
