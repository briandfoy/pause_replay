Since Crypt::Enigma was just uploaded yesterday and I have spent a good
bit of time in the last year researching the different Enigma algorithms,
both pre-1938 and post-1938, I would like to suggest working together to
make one historically correct Crypt::Enigma distribution. There were never
9 rotors on the military enigma rather from 3 up to 5. The wiring
reflector, or more notably Umkehrwalze A,B,C or D, D being more secure
theoretically and mostly the job of Hut 6 at Bletchly since it was
primarily used by the German Army. A was used before the war, B was the
general purpose, and there is little known about C but it has been
identified as having been used by the German Air Force in 1940.

Since the movie if not about enigma, at least titled so, is coming out in
the spring it would be really cool to have a full historical
representation of the machine and its different variations. So, I hope you
are interested in at least trying to make a go of it. I'll be happy to
donate the algorithms I have as well as the historical research.

Also, there is a crypto perl mailing list for module announcements and
discussion at http://lists.cpan.org/search.cgi?cat=Crypto and if either of
you are interested, http://crypto.perl.org/ needs someone with time and
enthusiasm to give it some life.

*>The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:
*>
*>  modid:       Crypt::EnigmaMachine
*>  DSLIP:       adpOg
*>  description: Perl implementation of the Enigma Machine.
*>  userid:      ALIZTA (Alistair Mills)
*>  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
*>  communities:
*>
*>  similar:
*>    Crypt::Enigma
*>
*>  rationale:
*>
*>    The Enigma library which I have written follows the specs of the
*>    original Enigma Machine to the letter, including the full set of 9
*>    rotors, 4 reflectors and a plugboard.
*>
*>    I have had discussions with the developer who is using the
*>    Crypt::Enigma namespace and it appears that he is illustrating the
*>    features of the Enigma Machine but is not designing a full
*>    implementaion of the WWII ciphering device.
*>
*>    Hence, I would like to use the Crypt::EnigmaMachine namespace to
*>    provide an exact software replica of the Enigma Machine
