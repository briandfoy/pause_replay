I have made a simple module that curries functions, and returns
anonymous subs that are ready to execute. Originally I wanted to use a
toplevel Curry namespace, but quickly saw that that wouldn't be too
polite.  It seems logical to use Sub::Curry, except that Sub doesn't
exist as a namespace.

I think I would like to go for Sub::Curry, as I imagine more modules
could go there. For example the already existing Usage.pm and perhaps
Memoize.


What to do?
