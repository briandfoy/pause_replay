I didn't get this message from Adam Kennedy in my mailbox. I'm
copying it off http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/47169

Scoring, as in the libtour library.

Simulation of play, as in Games::Tournament::BlackJack.

Others: adjudication, perhaps.

Everything that a tournament organizer has to do after the
tournament starts and the league members begin playing.

However, whether anyone is likely to write a tournament module
that does eg scoring specifically for roundrobins, as opposed to
a more generic category is another question. I don't expect
anyone to want to register a Tournament:: Scoring::RoundRobin
module, for example.

However if there is a Tournament::RoundRobin class which has been
subclassed by Tournament::RoundRobin::Schedule, would it be
natural to also want to write a Tournament::RoundRobin::Scoring
subclass?

All my module is doing is packaging the algorithm, so it seems
like including Schedule in the name is a 'truth in packaging'
issue. Perhaps I don't need to worry about that :-)

I read up on blackjack tournaments.
     http://casinogambling.about.com/cs/blackjack/a/BJtournament.htm

It seems like Games::Tournament::BlackJack, in tournament system
terms, is modeling one round of a multiplayer game.

The names which have been proposed so far are:

Games::RoundRobin::Schedule
Games::Schedule::RoundRobin
Games::RoundRobin
Games::Tournament::RoundRobin (by Aristotle and Adam)
Tournament::RoundRobin::Schedule
Schedule::RoundRobin
Algorithm::RoundRobin::Schedule
Sports::Schedule::RoundRobin

I guess Games::Tournament::RoundRobin has the most support.

Dr Bean			    I have an elaborate mnemonic for
                             remembering what day it is. It's
                             called the number system.
