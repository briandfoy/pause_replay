I make a small difference between searching for a perl module and
writing a perl module. In an ideal world we could give the same answer
in both cases, but in the real world we must optimize the answers. But
I'm not going to split hairs, the reality calls us for action indeed.

Correct. You're simply lost right now which is bad.

Agreed.

I am evaluating ways to improve searches on CPAN. It's still a long
way down the road. CPAN::WAIT was a first try but it is not maintained
right now. I hope I can activate it again.
