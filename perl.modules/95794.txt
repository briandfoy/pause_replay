Hi Yung-chung,

As you know, I=E2=80=99m working through resolving PAUSE permissions =
conflicts that arose when PAUSE started treating package names =
case-insensitively. One of the distributions affected is =E2=80=9CLlg=E2=80=
=9D, which was last released in 1996, and cannot be installed from CPAN =
on recent versions of Perl. The author of that distribution is happy for =
it to be deleted from CPAN, since he hasn=E2=80=99t done Perl for a long =
time, and has no interest in maintaining it.

There is one distribution on CPAN which uses Llg, and that is your =
Lingua-LinkParser-MatchPath distribution: the =
Lingua::LinkParser::MatchPath::Lex modules uses the Lex module which is =
part of the Llg distribution.

Your Lingua-LinkParser-MatchPath hasn=E2=80=99t installed on any =
versions of Perl for at least the last 10 years, so I=E2=80=99m =
wondering whether you want to maintain it, or whether you think the best =
thing would be to remove that from CPAN as well?

There are at least two options:

  * If you want to get your distribution working again, you could adopt =
the Llg distribution and fix its problems.
  * You could delete Lingua-LinkParser-MatchPath from CPAN, or give me =
permission to. Then I could safely delete LLg.

What would you like to do?

Cheers,
Neil
