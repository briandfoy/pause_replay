The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Carp::Notify
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Complain remotely when things break
  userid:      BCONRY (Brian Conry)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Name was chosen by previous author.

    The premise behind the module is that it will be used in a
    controlled environment (e.g. within a company) by people responsible
    for modules and/or programs as a way of getting notifications from
    things that break, no matter where they are running when they break.

  enteredby:   BCONRY (Brian Conry)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb  1 19:20:49 2013 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Carp::
::Notify          Rdpfp Complain remotely when things break          BCONRY
