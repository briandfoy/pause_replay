The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parse::Extract
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Suite of tools and templates for parsing
  userid:      CMORRIS (Charles Morris)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Device::MAC Net::IP::Extract Parse::PerlConfig
    String::Comments::Extract Hub::Parse::DataExtractor HTML::Extract

  rationale:

    Although many many modules currently exist to extract and report
    various kinds of data, they are all uncoordinated, in various
    namespaces, and in various stages of maintenance. Some are
    efficient, while some are not. My approach would allow many
    configurable templates for standard (IPv4, IPv6, MAC-48, EUI-64,
    Social Security Numbers, etc) to exist within the same namespace,
    and work in tandem with one another. It is planned that by simply
    stating what templates a user is searching a string for, all
    relevant data will be extracted and returned.

The resulting entry would be:

Parse::
