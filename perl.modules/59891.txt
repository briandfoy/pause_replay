Subject: Module submission Image::BoxModel
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::BoxModel
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Define boxes and put elemets on them
  userid:      MBP (Matthias Bloch)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Image::Mate

  rationale:

    This is an attempt to bring somewhat like the css-box-model to
    images: Inward boxes are created from the borders of an image to
    offer space for elements and to avoid conflicts between elements.
    Elements are put on boxes. Therefore, I thought Image::BoxModel
    could be the name.(?)

    Second, there are & will be more backends for some graphics
    libraries. The aim is to provide the same user interface for all of
    them. Image::Mate is a good start for this.

    The code is here: http://puffin.ch/perl/mnnm/

    Namespace suggestions I received are: Image::Nested Image::Tiled I
    am not sure if I like them. :-)

    I don't know if my proposal hits the point / means something in
    english / perl. Feel free to criticise. Suggestions are welcome, of
    course! Please help with "Description in Module List".

    I plan to upload as soon as the name is set. (And as soon as I
    manage to make it install properly, which it does not at the
    moment.) Tests will follow.

    Cheers :m)
