The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Log::AndError
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Logging and Error mod for ISA inc./OO access
  userid:      TBOLIOLI (Thomas Bolioli)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    Log::ErrLogger

  rationale:

    This is a generic log and error class for Perl modules that are
    part of larger programs. There are two distinct pieces here. The
    error functions and the logging. The error functions are unique and
    are added for convenience. The logging function is similar to
    Log::ErrLogger but it has templating options which will come in
    handy when I get around to expanding this to log into SQL databases,
    etc; There is also a service naming component which makes it easy to
    have this one class log errors for many different components of a
    larger app while continuing to differentiate (transparently) where
    the errors came from. A modified version of this has been battle
    tested at Brown University.

The resulting entry would be:

Log::
::AndError        RdpOp Logging and Error mod for ISA inc./OO access TBOLIOLI
