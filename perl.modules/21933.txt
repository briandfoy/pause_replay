Hi,

I have submitted a Nagios::Config module and would like it to appear in the
Nagios/ directory
under http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/

I had been informed that the creation of the Nagios namespace had been
accepted by CPAN.
Is there any other steps that need to be taken in order to get the directory
created and my
module indexed under it? There is also a Nagios::WebTransact module created
by a colleague
of mine (HOPCROFTS) that should be indexed under the Nagios/ directory.

Thank you very much,

Patrick LeBoutillier
