Hi ho Perl Dudes,

My PAUSE ID = "scott"

I have had transferred the above three modules from Simon Cozens to 
myself.
Apparently they should appear in my Pause List / CPAN list.

They are not there yet. Should they automatically appear, or does it 
wait until I do the first upload / change ?

If they should be there, can someone have a look why they are not.

The original transfer request came from andy@petdance.com (pause id = 
petdance)

Ta

Scott

Microsoft is not the answer. It's the question. And the answer is no.
