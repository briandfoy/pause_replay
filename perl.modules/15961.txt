Hello,

Some days ago I sent requests to register in CPAN three
modules I have done:

  Language::XSB
  Language::Prolog::Types
  Language::Prolog::Sugar

but I didn't get any response, nor approving the requests,
neither rejecting them. I understand that this is a
collaborative process so maybe they just were forgotten.

Please, could you take a look at the proposals again and
approve them or give me some feedback?

Bye,

- Salva
