Hi,

I was hoping to get a fix implemented for IPC::Shareable.  The bug in
question was reported, with a patch, 4 years ago.  I tried pinging the
author but his mail bounces.  The CPAN faq said to mail this address if
that happens.

I have a PAUSE account (MSOUTH), and if you want, I am willing to put this
patch in ( https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41401 ) and
release it, and "take over maintenance", which might mean no more than
"apply supplied patches and release a new version" since I have little idea
about either the use or the guts of this module right now.

(I am an experienced coder, just to be clear, but IPC is its own beast and
it's been years since I had to do anything very complex with it).

Let me know if you would like me to do this, or if there is some other way
I can be of help.  I was not able to find Mr. Sugars through a google
search, either.

Thanks!

mike

Any chance this will be fixed?  There is a patch on the bug that looks
correct.

Thanks!
