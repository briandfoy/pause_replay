Hi Shlomi,

Thanks for your thoughts.

>> PAUSE::PermissionsFile
>> Module::Permissions
>=20
> Preferably, those two classes should be under the same namespace.

Yeah, I realised that as I continued working on it. They are now.

I'm leaning towards PAUSE::Permissions now, but am waiting to see what =
Andreas thinks.

I'm in two minds on that. Generally I think a SYNOPSIS should be as =
brief and clear as possible, to get across how to use the module, so =
sprinkling it with 'my' is a distraction. For example, all the reviews I =
write have SYNOPSIS style code examples, and none of them have 'my'. But =
the code is all run with strict and warnings, but I just predeclare =
everything before the section that gets included in the review.

But there's the subliminal "of course you always declare things, and use =
strict and warnings, right?" effect.

So I've added them :-)

here:

The module mirrors by default, but for my tests I use a local mini =
06perms.txt, for exactly the reasons you give.

Cheers,
Neil
