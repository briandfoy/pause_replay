Dear PAUSE Admins,

Can you give me co-maint on ex::constant::vars please?
It's currently listed as having two maintainers:

	CTWETEN: Casey West
	CWEST: also Casey West

ex-constant-vars-0.01 appears to have been released in 29 Nov 2000, =
though the pod says copyright 1995 Casey Tweten, and gives a different =
email address. Looks like these are perhaps the same person?

I first emailed Casey at the start of January, and again in the middle =
of the month. I tried the CPAN address given, and the one in the pod. I =
haven't had any reply, and haven't been able to track him/her down by =
other means.

I'm working on a review of modules for defining constants, and while =
looking at this module fixed some bugs and added a lot of test cases. My =
version is on github:

	https://github.com/neilbowers/ex-constant-vars

I've copied Casey on this email.

thanks,
Neil
