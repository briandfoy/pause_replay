     why:

    I've written a module to parse files issued by the Norwegian
    Banking Payment Processing Central (my translation, I have no idea
    what they call themselves in English). I've used it in production to
    parse files containing payment information amounting to about NOK
    200 000 (~$25 000), so it works... :-)

    It's fairly simple, and follows a pretty clear specification to the
    letter.

    I've planned calling it No::Finans::BBS::OCRData. Great Perl Hacker
    Gisle Aas started No::*, and I asked him about use of the namespace,
    but I haven't received a reply. I'm a bit in doubt how to do this,
    or whether it is a good idea to use that many sublevels, but it is a
    rather natural think to do, given that BBS is this Banking Central,
    and they have quite a bunch of specs. Aas' module No::KontoNr would
    for example fit perfectly as No::Finans::BBS::KontoNr. Advice
    appreciated.

    Obviously, this is just the start! It's my first module, but I'm
    hacking away happily to the best of my ability so it is not the
    last! :-)

    Cheers,

    Kjetil
