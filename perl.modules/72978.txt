     why:

    During the years I've written several modules that I find useful.
    There's plugins for IkiWiki and Dist::Zilla. There's yet another
    command-line application framework utilizing Moose and several
    applications (for example MP3 ID3v2 and file name editor with
    interactive and batch modes and MAME data file collection manager).
    I'd like to clean these up and make available to the whole world
    using CPAN. I've been enjoying using CPAN since about 1997 so I'm
    quite familiar with the common practices and also it would be just
    fair to give something back after all these years.
