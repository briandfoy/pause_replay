Subject: Co-maint on Image::EXIF
To: modules@perl.org

From: arc@cpan.org (Aaron Crane)

Dear PAUSE admins,

Please can you give me co-maint on Image::EXIF?

I recently discovered that this module won't build on a
case-insensitive filesystem (including the commonest configurations of
Windows and Mac OS systems).  This bug has already been reported in RT
(as have several others):

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=4973

I'd like to put out an Image::EXIF release which fixes all the known bugs.

The author of Image::EXIF is CCPRO, Sergey S Prozhogin.  Image::EXIF
is his only module on CPAN, and it last had a release in 2005.  I
tried to contact Sergey by email on December 30th, offering to take
over maintenance, and I haven't yet heard back from him.

Thanks.
