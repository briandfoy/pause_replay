Hello,

I stumbled upon a message from Brian D Foy in the archive for
modules@perl.org today, where he questions the name for my module
HTTP::TransparentCache:

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/35451

I didn't deliberately ignore his message regarding the name of my
module, I had just configured my @cpan.org address to not forward mail
to me since I didn't think that I needed yet another mail-address. I
have changed that now.

I discussed my module on the libwww mailing list before I uploaded it to
CPAN. I also chose the name according to the documentation on CPAN:

"Please avoid using more than one level of nesting for module names"

http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html


I have already uploaded three versions of HTTP::TransparentCache to
CPAN. Right now, the HTTP::TransparentCache module is used by the
XMLTV-project, but they haven't made any release that uses the module
yet, so I can easily change that. Apart from that, I only know one
person other than me that has actually used the module.

I can change the name of the module if you want me to. I have no
particular preference between HTTP::TransparentCache and
HTTP::Cache::Transparent.

What do you want me to do?

/Mattias
