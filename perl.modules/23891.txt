That's an excellent idea. 

But POE already features a POE::Wheel::Curses. May be you module
should be named POE::Wheel::Curses::UI ? Rocco, do you agree ?

Then, you should discuss with Rocco to dedice whether to distribute
your own package or to integrate your module into POE main package.

Marcus, it would be nice if you could include in Curses::UI's doc a
mention of Scott's module.

Once, the name is agreed upon, I'll register it.

Cheers
