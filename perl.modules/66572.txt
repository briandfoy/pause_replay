The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FCGI::EV
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: FastCGI protocol for use in EV-based apps
  userid:      POWERMAN (Alex Efros)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    FCGI

  rationale:

    This is FastCGI protocol implementation using EV.

    FCGI::EV work using non-blocking sockets and initially was designed
    to use in event-based CGI applications (which able to handle
    multiple parallel CGI requests in single process without
    threads/fork). This require from CGI to avoid any operations which
    may block, like using SQL database - instead CGI should delegate all
    such tasks to remote services and talk to these services in
    non-blocking mode.

    Of course this way such "CGI" application may have some background
    events (I/O, timer, etc.) even if there no incoming CGI requests at
    all.

    It designed to be very flexible to allow using any external module
    as backend for processing CGI requests without modifying FCGI::EV
    module code. For now only existing backend is FCGI::EV::Std
    (available as separate module on CPAN), which support both blocking
    and non-blocking modes to handle CGI request, using standard CGI.pm
    or any other similar module.

The resulting entry would be:
