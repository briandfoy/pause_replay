The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SMS::MT
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Sends mobile terminated SMS messages.
  userid:      CMANLEY (Craig Manley)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    newsgroup comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Net::SMS WWW::SMS

  rationale:

    Maybe Net::SMS would have been a better choice if it had not
    existed, but unfortunately it exists and it belongs to Simplewire so
    that you can only send SMS's via Simplewire.

    WWW::SMS has just been proposed as another module for sending SMS's
    through free services and via HTTP protocol only.

    GSM::SMS exists but has a totally different design with many
    related modules and I don't want to pollute that namespace.

    I chose SMS as the root namespace because all my modules are
    related to SMS only (and do not necessarily have anything to do with
    the WWW or with GSM's). Other SMS related packages I'm proposing
    are: SMS::Ringtone::RTTTL::Parser, SMS::Ringtone::RTTTL::MIDI, and
    SMS::Image.

    I have no SMS::Ringtone class, so others may use that as the root
    for their ringtone based module names.

    I have no class called SMS so that others may use the SMS root
    namespace as the base for their module names (for example
    SMS::MassMailer or whatever).

    My main class SMS::MT is meant to be a simple and signle interface
    for sending SMS's to any SMS service provider. Support for different
    SMS service providers is implemented by means of plugin modules
    (similar to the idea behind DBI and all the database plugin
    drivers).

    I've got the list of modules and their POD's at this URL:

The resulting entry would be:

SMS::
::MT              bdpOp Sends mobile terminated SMS messages.        CMANLEY
