The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::Phonology
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Make and manipulate phonologies
  userid:      JASPAX (Jesse S. Bangs)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, comp.lang.perl.misc

  similar:
    Lingua::FeatureMatrix Lingua::SoundChange

  rationale:

    The namespace choice should be fairly obvious, since the whole
    purpose of this module is to provide a maximally flexible and
    powerful way to work with linguistic phonologies. There are no other
    existing modules using this namespace.

    This module duplicates much of the functionality of
    Lingua::FeatureMatrix and Lingua::SoundChange, but it is drastically
    more powerful than either of them. I have been in contact with the
    author of Lingua::FeatureMatrix, and we agreed that it would be
    easier to start from scratch than to build on top of the existing
    module.

    This module provides a number of features I have always wanted,
    like feature geometry, ability to algorithmically find phonetic
    symbols, very powerful rule system, and others.

  enteredby:   JASPAX (Jesse S. Bangs)
  enteredon:   Sun May 18 19:28:08 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::
::Phonology       adpOp Make and manipulate phonologies              JASPAX
