As the requester of the namespace I have to confess that a similar 
thought had crossed my mind.  I think that the taxonomies are something 
like this:
SGML->HTML
SGML->XML->XHTML
In other words, XHTML is not a subset of HTML.

My initial thought would be to request my namespace as under 
XML::XHTML::..., but decided towards HTML::XHTML because many people 
think HTML==web and as my module is primarily for the web, that's where 
I thought of putting it.  Having said that, I can certainly appreciate 
the merits of Brian's XHTML::... top level node.

Cheers
