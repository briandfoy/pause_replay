The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::RailRoad
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: a train simulation game
  userid:      JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    irc.perl.org#perlfr

  similar:
    none afaik.

  rationale:

    this module is a tk-based game, allowing one to draw a railroad,
    place trains and watch them run. same as what you did when you were
    kid, but on your computer now.

  enteredby:   JQUELIN (Jerome Quelin)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 23 16:24:06 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::
::RailRoad        bdpOp a train simulation game                      JQUELIN
