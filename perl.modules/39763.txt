Dear PayPal Member,<br><br>

PayPal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for its community of<br>
buyers and sellers. To protect the security of your account, PayPal employs<br>
some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our anti-fraud<br>
teams regularly screen the PayPal system for unusual activity.<br><br>

Recently, our Account Review Team identified some unusual activity in your<br>
account. In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your<br>
account has not been compromised, access to your account was flagged. Your<br>
account will remain flagged until this issue has been resolved. <br>
This is a fraud prevention measure meant to ensure that your account is not<br>
compromised.<br><br>

 In order to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may<br>
require some specific information from you for the following reason: <br><br>

Our system requires further account verification. <br><br>

Case ID Number: PP-056-245-481<br>
We encourage you to log in and restore full access as soon as possible.<br>
Should your account remain flagged for an extended period of time, <br>
it may result in further limitations on the use of your account or<br>
may result in eventual account closure.<br><br>
