I'm in the middle of writing a module to perform Freshmeat announcements 
automatically when I release version of my various software projects.  
However, I want to abstract this slightly so I can do similar things for 
Sourceforge, Savana, etc.  Since they're all Web site interaction modules 
(that will heavily use HTTP::UserAgent and friends), I figured they'd have 
some 'web' or 'http' or 'site' name in their name space.  I was thinking:

WebSite::Freshmeat
WebSite::SourceForge

or

Web::Site::Freshmeat

etc?

They'd have methods like "login", "search", "announce", etc... all tied to 
the various web functions their pages make available.

Ideas?
