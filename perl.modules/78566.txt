Typically we ask that people who want to use a pragma name clear it
with the p5p folks. I don't think there will be a problem, though.

I'd like to see something that spells out the "version" part somehow. A
good name escapes me at the moment. Depending on the use, the "lib"
portion might not be the right name either if you're only loading a
particular module version, even if the mechanics are the same.

   use moduleversion::exactly Some::Module => 3.1415;
   use moduleversion::range Some::Module => [ 3.14, 3.16 ];
   use moduleversion::maximum Some::Module => 3.16;

I'm not recommending those particular names or interfaces. I don't like
those names that much either. It's a great idea and I'm glad your doing
the work. Maybe another PAUSE person has an idea, and you can also try
module-authors@perl.org.

Good luck, :)
