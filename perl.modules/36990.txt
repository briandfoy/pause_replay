I wasl also thinking that Business:: is something more generic. IT could 
have other things like ::Manufacturing and ::Distribution.  ::Commerce 
is just a small part.

 From a toplevel standpoint, a new toplevel new for the project sounds 
ok. Personally, I'm not fond it using a toplevel name. It's to self 
absorbed. I just want to put the code where it makes sence rather than 
stand out as a toplevel if that makes any sense.

There's also YACF::, Yet Another Commerce Framework.

Should I resubmit?
