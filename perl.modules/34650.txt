     why:

    Modules that I've developed for myself. Some are redundant, e.g.
    I've made yet another Term::TUI, (It was just too easy, and (I'm
    sorry) I didn't think to search CPAN first...).

    I'm hoping I can use my moniker, RMK, as a name space since that
    will keep my redundant stuff from colliding with others' even on my
    own computer (Just because I make redundant stuff doesn't mean I
    won't use others' stuff...)

    I've made some handy HTML writing/generating tools.

    I've made some TCP/IP server tools to go with my version of
    Term::TUI.

    I've made tools to make clients to go with the server tools.

    I've made tools to interface CGI to the server tools (and these
    tools use the HTML generating tools.)

    So taken all together this is stuff to turn .ph or .pm files (or
    combinations of them) into either command line apps, server apps, or
    web apps, or all three.
