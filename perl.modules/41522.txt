Subject: Module submission DBIx::Threaded
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Threaded
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: DBI subclass to share handles across threads
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    dbi-users@perl.org, c.l.p.modules, perlmonks.org

  similar:
    DBI

  rationale:

    Currently, DBI does not permit handles generated within one thread
    to be used within another thread. Database resources are one of the
    most commonly shared items in most threaded languages (e.g., Java).
    DBIx::Threaded will provide a client/server wrapper for DBI to
    permit DBI objects (connections, statements) to be shared between
    threads. The client DBI subclass will simply remap all std. method
    calls to an RPC-type mechanism (via Thread::Queue::Duplex) to a
    server class that wraps a DBI handle within a single thread. (See
    the Pots::* modules for similar, but more general, concept).

  enteredby:   DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  enteredon:   Sat Jul  9 18:56:42 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

DBIx::
::Threaded        cdphp DBI subclass to share handles across threads DARNOLD
