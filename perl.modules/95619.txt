Hi. I'm happy to help, but I'm on my phone, so can't do much yet.

For identity verification, we like some public account that connects you to
your identity.  If you are on LinkedIn, for example, send me an connection
request to this email address. That seems to work for a lot of people.

Regards,
David Golden
