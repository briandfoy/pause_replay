I'm pretty sure you peeked at my source code for 
this. A primary funciton of 'import.pm ' *IS* to 
rename the package. :)

This is very close to how the 'import' pragma 
actually does its thing. With the addition of being 
also able to auto-'use' all the modules it finds in 
the same Packname directory.

See 
   CPAN/author/id/MIKEKING/import-1_01.tar.gz
for details.

So, how about it, modules@perl.org gang? Do I get the namespace and I can announce the module? I won't do so before updating with revisions from the commentary, and I'll give y'all another crack at reviewing it.

Thanks for the time to take a peek and respond for everyone.

Mike.
