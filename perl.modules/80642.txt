The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Perfide::BookSync
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Synchronize books in plain text format.
  userid:      ANDREFS (André Fernandes dos Santos)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    CPAN RT

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module performs book synchronization -- an alignment of plain
    text books at section level.

    The reason for the name is that it is being developed in the
    context of Per-Fide (http://per-fide.di.uminho.pt), a project which
    aims to build several large parallel aligned corpora.

    Many of the implementation decisions, structures, notations and
    conventions used are dictated by the logic of other Text::Perfide::*
    modules and the specific requirements of the project. Nevertheless,
    we believe that this and the other modules may still be useful to
    other people, and as such we felt it made sense to group them under
    a common namespace.

    Examples of other modules in Text::Perfide::* are:
    Text::Perfide::PartialAlign Text::Perfide::BookPairs
    Text::Perfide::BookCleaner

  enteredby:   ANDREFS (André Fernandes dos Santos)
  enteredon:   Mon May 21 23:34:43 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::Perfide::
::BookSync        bdpfp Synchronize books in plain text format.      ANDREFS
