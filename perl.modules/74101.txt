Hi all,

I'd like to adopt the CPAN distribution 
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Stash-AutoEscape/ by 
http://search.cpan.org/~mala/ who appears to be Japanese and whose homepage 
appears to be in a Japanese social network - 
http://subtech.g.hatena.ne.jp/mala/ . Now, so far I've tried to contact him by 
filing a github issue, an rt.cpan.org issue, E-mailing him, and sent a module 
adoption request to modules@perl.org. None of these were successful in 
reaching MALA . 

I'm contacting you (Miyagawa and Yappo) in case you have any idea about how to 
reach him. I have some changes to Template-Stash-AutoEscape in my github fork 
of the AutoEscape repository: 

https://github.com/shlomif/Template-Stash-AutoEscape

Please return to me.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish
