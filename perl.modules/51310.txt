From: cpan@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

Let it be known I've done some more shuffling of Win32:: permissions.

The problem has been that Jan is releasing libwin32 to CPAN without 
actually having permissions for it.

These new versions are included in ActivePerl, but other Perls (i.e. 
Vanilla/Strawberry) have dependencies on Win32:: modules in libwin32 
resolve to a very old Sarathy release that fails to install.

I've updated a few groups of 3 or 4 modules at a time to force co-maint 
permissions to Jan as a temporary solution to this.
