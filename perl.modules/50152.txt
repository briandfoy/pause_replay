I apologize if this is not the right e-mail address to send this
question to.

I tried to e-mail the author of LSF::Base and LSF::Batch regarding
support for newer versions of LSF.  I have been making changes to
LSF::Batch to support LSF 6.2, and wanted to feed back some patches to
the author, however, when I e-mailed him I received the bounce message
below.

What happens when you can't contact the author of a particular module?
Is there a process for taking it over?

Thanks!
-Eric
