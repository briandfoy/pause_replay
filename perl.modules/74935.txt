Subject: Module submission fytwORM

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       fytwORM
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: An ORM you won't like
  userid:      NEOPHENIX (Brian Clapper)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Choosing my own namespace because this doesn't really fit within
    anything. It is a project that some people might find useful so I am
    uploading it here. Most people won't like it, and that is ok.

  enteredby:   NEOPHENIX (Brian Clapper)
  enteredon:   Sun Feb 27 15:30:04 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

fytwORM           bdpOp An ORM you won't like                        NEOPHENIX
