Hi,

I've just requested a pause account, and also read that it's best to
first inform about the module names. It's only after the request ID was
submitted I noticed it was send to the same email address (sorry).

The first modules I plan to upload are for creating OpenOffice
documents. At first it would only be 2 packages:

OpenOffice::OOBuilder      base class
OpenOffice::OOCBuilder   for building the spreadheets (sxc / calc docs)

Later on (the base class has been prepared for this), I have the
intention to create
OpenOffice::OOWBuilder   for building text docs (sxw / writer docs)
and maybe (not sure yet) also for drawings (OODBuilder), impress
(OOIBuilder), math (OOMBuilder).

I made these modules especially for creating spreadsheets easy and fast.

In the meantime I found
http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc-1.111/ which already uses
the namespace OpenOffice::*

I don't think this should be a problem, but wanted to ask your opinion
before proceeding.

Thanks in advance for your comments,

Best regards,
Stefan
