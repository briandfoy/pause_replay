The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::EN::BioLemmatizer
  DSLIP:       RdoOp
  description: Perl interface to UofCO's Java BioLemmatizer
  userid:      TOMC (Tom Christiansen)
  chapterid:   9 (Language_Interfaces)
  communities:
    This is part of the result of a paper submitted for peer review.

  similar:
    Lingua::EN::Inflect is the closest, and it is quite different.

  rationale:

    Here's the description from:

    http://biolemmatizer.sourceforge.net/

    We developed a domain-specific lemmatization tool, BioLemmatizer,
    for the morphological analysis of biomedical literature. The
    BioLemmatizer is tailored to the biological domain through
    integration of several published lexical resources related to
    molecular biology. It focuses on the inflectional morphology of
    English, including the plural form of nouns, the conjugations of
    verbs, and the comparative and superlative form of adjectives and
    adverbs. The BioLemmatizer retrieves lemmas based on the use of a
    lexicon that covers an exhaustive list of inflected word forms and
    their corresponding lemmas in both general English and the
    biomedical domain, as well as a set of rules that generalize
    morphological transformations to heuristically handle words that are
    not encountered in the lexicon.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::EN::
::BioLemmatizer   RdoOp Perl interface to UofCO's Java BioLemmatizer TOMC
