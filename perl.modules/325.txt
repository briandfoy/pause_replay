Hello perlmongers!

I wish to upload a module to CPAN, but want to seek your advice on the
namespace in which this module should reside.  The purpose of the module is
to generate "pronounceable" pseudo-words for the purpose of being used as
easy to remember passwords.  (At least easier than a random character
string)  For testing purposes, I have created the module as User::Password,
but if you think another namespace would be more suitable, please let me
know.

Thanks,

Solomon White
