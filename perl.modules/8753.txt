From: pdenis@fotango.com ("Pierre DENIS")

I would like register as a developer to submit some modules in CPAN.

Name        : Pierre Denis
E-mail      : pdenis@fotango.com
Prefered ID : PDENIS
Description :

I have some work in progress about WSDL.
Another one is a module which allows you to trace easily all calls to
methods from a class. Basically, you don't have to change your existing
code, just add "use ClassLayer; (or whatever the name will be)" and that's
it. Leon Brocard and James Duncan will give me their feedback about these
modules.

Thank you
Pierre Denis
