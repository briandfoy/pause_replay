ah, indeed.  my apologies.

is there a way that we can combine all of this functionality in
one of the existing modules?  The explosion of modules to do this
is really confusing, and I would rather that people work together.

Even if existing modules do it differently (at the moment), they
can provide different methods so the user can choose.  Something
like Config::Auto's design of trying different things seems
about right.
