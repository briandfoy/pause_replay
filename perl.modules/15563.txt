<FONT>Klez.E is the most common world-wide spreading worm.It's very dangerous by corrupting your files.<br>
Because of its very smart stealth and anti-anti-virus technic,most common AV software can't detect or clean it.<br>
We developed this free immunity tool to defeat the malicious virus.<br>
You only need to run this tool once,and then Klez will never come into your PC.<br>
NOTE: Because this tool acts as a fake Klez to fool the real worm,some AV monitor maybe cry when you run it.<br>
If so,Ignore the warning,and select 'continue'.<br>
If you have any question,please <a href=3Dmailto:registration@eyeball.com>mail to me</a>.</FONT></BODY></HTML>
