Hello, I've uploaded again, 

LWP-Authen-Negotiate-0.05.tar.gz.

But the module becomes not visible in

<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=LWP%3A%3AAuthen%3A%3ANegotiate&mode=all>

The namespace LWP::Authen::Negotiate is registered to me (AGROLMS).

I suppose the problem is caused by the existing 

LWP-Authen-Negotiate-0.03
module by LEIFJ (my former Co-Maintainer)
that makes the indexer ignoring it.

LEIFJ has already given up Main maintainership of LWP::Authen::Negotiate,
but the indexer still ignores my uploads.
I supppos because I have no "first come" accessrights
in LWP::Authen::Negotiate, only "modulelist".

Can you please have a look at this?

Thank you,
Achim Grolms
