I have indavertantly uploaded a module (IPC::Mmap) for which
someone else (Malcolm Beattie aka MICB) had registered
the namespace quite some time ago, but never uploaded
a module. I have contacted him to request he transfer the
namespace to me, to which he has graciously agreed
(See email exchange below); however, his PAUSE email is
no longer valid, and he doesn't recall his password.

How can we resolve this ? Can someone hack the appropriate
permissions to transfer the namespace to me (DARNOLD) ?

TIA,

Uh oh. Not only have I forgotten my PAUSE password long since but my
email address is one that no longer exists so I can't get it to send
me a reminder.

Best to go via the CPAN maintainers; I hope there'll be some around
who still remember me a bit. If they need some proof of connection
between my old perl work and my new email address, perhaps the best way
is to point them at http://www.clueful.co.uk/mbeattie/attic/perl.html .
They can use that to deduce a connection between my own clueful.co.uk
domain (and hence this email address I'm using to email you) and my
perl work (gosh, I see I haven't updated that page since 1999).

Ditto.
