Thanks David, for volunteering. Unfortunately it is not *that* easy to
reassign the ownership. We're ready to do it under the condition that
you carefully use search engines to find out possible current email
addresses of the current owners and send them (each separately if
different owners) nice offers to take over the maintainance and CC to
modules@perl.org. Although we're grateful if new maintainers are
volunteering we must respect the current owners' rights and allow for
vacation and other periods where they are not responsive. So we
usually only reassign permissions when *some* time of waiting has
passed (and the time must be visible on the modules@perl.org archive).

Thanks again,
