I would like to propose that /AIX be added as a top-level namespace and that the cpan@aixadm.org list be used as a discussion forum for new modules in this namespace.

The list is open and unmoderated and there are already a couple of modules that have been uploaded to CPAN that are specific to the AIX operating system.

Thanks
