Awesome. Please!

How sure are you that that's what your customers will be looking for when
they're going to look for a module?

Sort of wonder if Net::Internap::XIPCloud might be better and then make
sure you've got OpenStack in the description in the =head1 NAME section.

Or if the XIPCloud stuff is using standard protocols,
Net::OpenStack::Something and mention the Internap part in NAME.

Net::XIPCloud still seems fairly reasonable to me btw - just wondering if
a more verbose name would be more findable.
