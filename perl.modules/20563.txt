The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CircuitLayout
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: circuit layout items like polygons and texts
  userid:      SCHUMACK (Ken Schumack)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    nothing yet

  similar:
    GDS2.pm can be used as a lower level module to feed CircuitLayout

  rationale:

    This is CircuitLayout, a module for working with circuit layout
    items like boundaries, texts, rectangles, and srefs. It is not tied
    to any particular file format and is intended to help users work
    with circuit layout items at a higher level of abstraction once they
    read in a layout format of their choice (e.g. GDS2, CIF, or
    whatever). CircuitLayout is a name that clearly advertises to a
    person that is in the integrated circuit field and would be
    interested in what the module has to offer.

  enteredby:   SCHUMACK (Ken Schumack)
  enteredon:   Tue Apr 22 03:30:54 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

CircuitLayout     bdpOa circuit layout items like polygons and texts SCHUMACK
