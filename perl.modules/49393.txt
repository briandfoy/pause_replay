The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::TAI
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: International Atomic Time and realisations
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module knows all about International Atomic Time (TAI). TAI is
    the link between astronomical timescales, specifically Terrestrial
    Time (TT), and civil time, specifically Coordinated Universal Time
    (UTC). Time::TAI is correspondingly designed to interoperate well
    with Time::TT and Time::UTC.

    This module provides a conversion between TAI as a pure count of
    seconds and as a day-based date. Just as with TT, TAI doesn't really
    have any days, because it's independent of the Earth's rotation. The
    convention for how to divide up the TAI time line into nominal days
    differs from that for TT, and also from that for GPS (GPS being one
    of the main ways to access TAI).

    This module knows all about realisations of TAI. National
    metrological institutions, such as NIST and the UK's NPL, and some
    other agencies such as GPS and GLONASS, broadcast time signals which
    are steered to keep step with TAI. Of course, none of them precisely
    agree with each other. Furthermore, the canonical TAI itself is only
    determined a few weeks in retrospect. At the microsecond level it is
    necessary to know how far one's source of TAI differs from the true
    TAI. This data is published monthly by the BIPM (International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures). This module processes that data,
    using the model supplied by the Time::TT module for realisations of
    TT.

The resulting entry would be:

Time::
