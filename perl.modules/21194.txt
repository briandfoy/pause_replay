The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Smart
  DSLIP:       RnpOp
  description: A smart, easy and powerful way for XML.
  userid:      GMPASSOS (Gaciliano Monteiro Passos)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    www.perlmonks.com

  similar:
    None with the multitype architecture to access the tree (and this is
    the purpose). Can be compared with XML::Simple.

  rationale:

    XML::Smart create around it a very dynamic way to access the data,
    since at the same time any node/point in the tree can be a HASH and
    an ARRAY. You also can make a search for nodes that have some
    attibute, etc...

    You just access/manipulate the object, and the XML tree inside it
    is changed automatically. So, the hard work stay internally in the
    module, not with the user, what make this a "Smart" way. ;-P

    The namespace is needed since it has sub-modules, like
    XML::Smart::Tree and XML::Smart::Parser (used when XML::Parser is
    not installed), and can have more in the future.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Smart           RnpOp A smart, easy and powerful way for XML.      GMPASSOS
