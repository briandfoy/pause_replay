Oh no, certainly no, I didn't impose that, but as the librarian deputy
I take a bird's eye view on the books and try to shape the namespaces
they are using. As such I see a merit in a marriage of your two
modules into one. The underlying implementation can then use any
amount of namespaces below HTML::DataConvert to gain
speed/memory/convenience as much as needed. I'd like to point out that
the word "result" looks pretty useless in the namespaces you proposed.
