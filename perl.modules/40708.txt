Subject: Module submission HTML::Template::HTX
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       HTML::Template::HTX
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Handle HTML Extension template (.htx) files
  userid:      TALE (Theo Niessink)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    HTML::Template

  rationale:

    HTML::Template::HTX is a lightweight version of HTML::Template and
    some related modules, but it uses a different approach. It was
    specifically designed for scripts generating sequential data, e.g.
    search engines, but it may be useful for any server side program
    that outputs HTML (or even some other ASCII file format). This
    module supports some interesting features, e.g. automated counter
    variables, input and output to and from files as well as scalars,
    forced UTF-8 (or not) on the output, etc. The template files the
    module uses are called .htx files, hence the name of the module.

The resulting entry would be:

HTML::Template::
::HTX             RdpOp Handle HTML Extension template (.htx) files  TALE
