I've been using your Tk-804.029-PPM58 package from cpan.org for awhile but tried 
to use getOpenFile and discovered getOpenFile.pm is missing.  getSaveFile (both 
.pm and .pod) are missing altogether. Also missing in Tk-804.030-PPM58.  The 
getOpenFile.pod is there and getOpenFile is in the documentation. Can you help 
me with this?

Also, I'm running perl 5.8.0 on WinXP on some old hardware.  Some Tk functions 
use unicode/utf8 modules
which are missing on my system. I don't know enough about the 'Perl world' to 
know where to get the appropriate
?.pm files.  Have searched cpan (and ActiveState doesn't have 5.8.0 available 
anymore), so no luck.
Please don't suggest I 'upgrade' to newer perl version.
Any help you can provide this perl novice would be greatly appreciated!
 Thx.
