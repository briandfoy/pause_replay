The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::NicoSound::Download
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: A downloader of web service of NicoSound.
  userid:      KUNIYOSHI (Kuniyoshi Kouji)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    None.

  similar:
    WWW::NicoVideo::Download

  rationale:

    [ reasons of namespace ] I gave the module the name for the
    following reasons. - The moduel name of WWW::NicoVideo::Download
    does already exist (NicoVideo is similar to NicoSound). - This
    module is a downloader of web service of NicoSound. - There are more
    services existing in NicoSound. It is not only providing MP3, it can
    convert to MP3 too. It was not named WWW::NicoSound for those
    reasons.

    [ reasons of be listd ] Sometimes using web interface is a hard
    work than CUI. And, it can be said also to NicoSound. If ID is
    understood, this module can automatically obtain MP3. And this
    module can parse ID from HTML file.

    The people who download from NicoSound are many in Japan. Today's
    reproduction frequency is 372,667 times at 3:00PM.

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::NicoSound::
::Download        bdpfp A downloader of web service of NicoSound.    KUNIYOSHI
