Subject: Module submission Voting::VoteFairRanking

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Voting::VoteFairRanking
  DSLIP:       Mdpf2
  description: Calculates VoteFair Ranking election results
  userid:      FOBES (Richard Fobes)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    GitHub, CPSolver account

  similar:

  rationale:

    The already-created VOTING category is a clear fit for this
    Voting::VoteFairRanking module, which implements the
    election-counting methods described in my book titled "Ending The
    Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections: Let's Use VoteFair Ranking To
    Reduce The Excessive Influence Of Campaign Contributions". (Although
    this module also can be used for other ranking-based and
    optimization-based purposes, it does _not_ belong in the broader
    ALGORITHM category, where the module's main purpose would be
    unclear.)

  enteredby:   FOBES (Richard Fobes)
  enteredon:   Sun Dec  4 20:29:02 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Voting::
::VoteFairRanking Mdpf2 Calculates VoteFair Ranking election results FOBES
