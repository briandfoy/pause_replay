     why:

    I have a fork of WWW::Resource 0.01. If I can get it integrated, it
    will stay under that name. If I can't find the author, I want to
    submit REST::Resource.

    I'm now the owner of the Cisco IT (EMAN) Perl framework and I want
    more CPAN usage in it (rather than relying on re-invented-here
    semantics). Where generic stuff makes sense to contribute, it will
    be posted to CPAN rather than kept internal.

    Where things are confidential, they will be kept internal.

    I anticipate that there will be more modules coming, but
    REST::Resource (or an update to WWW::Resource) is currently on-deck.
