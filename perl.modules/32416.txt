Greetings,

  Thank you for your message about cgi-lib.pl, CGI, or Perl.  I regret
that time constraints mean that I am unable to answer general queries on
these topics.  Over the past ten years, I have answered thousands of
email messages without any compensation.  Tending to the volume of mail
was taking several hours a day, so answering them all has become
untenable.

  There are many resources available to help you with CGI and Perl.
As a first stop, I recommend you look at the cgi-lib.pl homepage:
       http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/
In addition to providing the cgi-lib.pl library, that page also has
examples and pointers to other information.  If the information
available online is insufficient, I suggest you purchase one of the
several high-quality books about CGI and Perl.  In particular, you may
be interested in consulting the book I co-authored, "Introduction to
CGI/Perl."  This book was written in part to answer the many queries I
receive; hence, you will probably find the solution to your problems
somewhere within that book.

  For many questions, I do try to provide some very brief answer in a
following message.  However, if your question is particularly basic,
general, or difficult to answer briefly; or, if I am even more busy than
usual, you will not see any notes.

  Once again, I apologize for not being able to answer your mail
satisfactorily.  And I wish you the best of luck in your web creations.

Sincerely,

Steven Brenner
