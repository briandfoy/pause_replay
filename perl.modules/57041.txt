Hi Daniel,

I'm removing all of those registration you wish to keep from the 
deletion list. The purpose of this is to clean out unused or wrong 
registrations.

However, you really, really, have a lot of unused registrations plus, 
which is somewhat worse, a lot of mostly empty placeholder-distributions 
on CPAN. I know about the "release early, release often" principle, but 
that does not mean uploading a module saying "will be implemented later" 
and then not doing that for a long time. This is not a great service to 
others in the Perl community and certainly not to the CPAN users. I'm 
saying this as a fellow CPAN author and user thereof, not necessarily as 
a PAUSE admin. Others feel similar about this, it seems. You've seen 
some of the harsher reactions on CPAN Ratings.

So please do not upload any more non-functional module-placeholders.

Best regards,
Steffen
