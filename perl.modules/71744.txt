Request to register new user

     why:

    I already have a PAUSE ID (jessssst) but I realize that I made a
    mistake in choosing the username. It's impossible to explain what my
    username is when people ask. I've only uploaded one module, and I'm
    willing to do whatever is necessary to transfer the module to my new
    username. Or, I don't mind if you just leave the old module
    associated with the old username. Whatever you think is easiest. I
    apologize ahead of time if this is an inconvenience.
