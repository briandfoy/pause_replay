This alone solves all problems, no change to the indexer needed.

It's doable if we maintain another table for all modules in the latest
official perl or for all modules in all distributions. We currently
don't have that.

BTW, you asked in a different posting about the schema: A current
database dump is always in ~ftp/pub/PAUSE/PAUSE-data/moddump.current.
It's written every 6 hours and available in bzipped form too.
