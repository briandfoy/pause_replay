     why:

    I'm a PhD student in the molecular biology field. My currently
    planned contributions include tools for the analysis of proteins
    (protein engineering using evolutionary algorithms, contact
    assessment of protein-protein complexes and in-silico protein
    hydrolysis).

    All of the code that I plan to upload can be seen at my github
    repository at http://github.com/brunov.

    I have recently published a peer-reviewed article
    (http://tinyurl.com/qew63j) in which I use BioPerl for some protein
    sequence analysis.
