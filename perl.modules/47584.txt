Hi,

It seemed about as informative to me as API2 :) It's a library of functions 
for creating PDF documents, aimed more at the one-page graphical variety than 
the multipage structured document variety. So PDF::OnePage would be an 
option, I suppose, except that I'll probably work out how to add extra pages 
eventually. This afternoon I uploaded

http://search.cpan.org/~melonman/PDF-EasyPDF_0_03b/lib/PDF/EasyPDF.pm

which might give a better idea of what I'm trying to do.

Well, yes. The specific issue for my (Windows) application is that PDF::API2 
is a total pain to use with PerlApp. Each font is a separate PM, which 
doesn't get loaded at compile time and there are at least 3 text files used 
at runtime for constants such as page sizes, fonts and named colours. The 
solution, apparently, is to bind each of these resources into the executable, 
unpack them into a temporary directory at runtime, and then delete them after 
execution. I couldn't get this to work properly, and I worked out that I 
would need to either --bind or --lib over two dozen resources, which is 
madness. That was when I decided to write a module that contained everything 
in one file.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Mark
