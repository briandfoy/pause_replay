Hi all!
I recenly submitted a module (Spice-0.01) to CPAN and checked on
CPAN tester. All tests are passing. Still module does not show up in the 
cpan search.

When I try searching with the module name, it does not show up. When I try 
searching with my name(author-id: srohit), my name shows up with
"Distributions- none found."

Can you please throw some light on this. Did I forget to do something?

Thanks a lot in advance.

regards,
-Rohit
