Hi,

>>Does this handle only one sort of template?<<

No it will parse tags in any sort of template - html, php etc, basically 
anything that includes the special tags.

You pass a template name into the parser as an agument, eg...

$parser->parse('demo.html', $tags, $opts)

...and it looks for the file in the appropriate template set. It will look 
for a cached copy first and if it doesn't exist it will load, parse and 
cache the unparsed template.

In design it is similar to Template::Toolkit, but that is a huge collection 
of modules, perhaps overkill for most people - the parser I'm suggesting is 
far more lightweight but still with highly flexible functionality.

Thanks,
Paul.
