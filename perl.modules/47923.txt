Hello....
I've provided a very small sample Perl script (below)  that will produce 
invalid code according to the www.w3.org HTML validator.

When I use the -noscript option with start_html, the resulting code is 
produced INSIDE the <head> area... But <noscript> is not allowed there. 
It should be produced in the <body> section.

This is simple to work around... don't use -noscript with start_html, 
and instead code an explicit noscript(...) statement after start_html. 
But where's the fun in that? :-)

Also.... a feature suggestion....  I like to start some of may pages 
with a "css warning":
    print p({-style=>'display:none;'},'This page may not appear properly 
because your browser does not support CSS');

so along the same lines as the -noscript option on start_html, it would 
be nice if there were a -nocc option that produced  paragraph in the 
body with style="display:none".

Sincerely,
Don Russell

#!/usr/bin/perl -Tw

use strict;

use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
use CGI qw(:all);

print header();

print start_html(
        -title=>'A Nice Title',
        -noscript=>p('Some features of this page will not work because 
Javascrip
t is disabled, or your browser does not support Javascript at all.'),
        );

print p('View the page source... the noscript tag is in the wrong place');

print end_html();

exit;
