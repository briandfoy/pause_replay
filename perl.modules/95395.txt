Hi again Manish,

> You have ownership of the package name =E2=80=9Cbest=E2=80=9D =
namespace, and have a =E2=80=9Cbest=E2=80=9D module as part of your =
=E2=80=9Cmanish-db=E2=80=9D release. But the best module appears to be =
accidentally included in the release, given it=E2=80=99s location and =
contents:
>    https://metacpan.org/source/HUGHES/manish-db/best.pm
> This is conflicting with the =E2=80=9CBest=E2=80=9D module, which is =
part of the =E2=80=9CBest=E2=80=9D distribution: =
G/GA/GAAL/Best-0.15.tar.gz
>=20
> Similarly, the manish-db distribution contains a module =E2=80=9CMyTest=E2=
=80=9D, which is conflicting with =E2=80=9CMytest=E2=80=9D, owned by =
user STELLAR.

I=E2=80=99ve further looked at the manish-db.tar.gz =
<http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/H/HU/HUGHES/manish-db.tar.gz> release, =
and would like to propose that as well as dropping your permissions, =
that we delete this release as well.

It contains a good number of modules from at least 3 other peoples=E2=80=99=
 CPAN distributions. You don=E2=80=99t have PAUSE permissions for those =
modules, which is why the release is listed with some many unauthorised =
entries:

	https://metacpan.org/release/manish-db

As a result the best course of action is to remove this from CPAN, and =
then drop the permissions for the conflicting package names, as =
previously outlined.

Are you ok with me scheduling this release for deletion?

Cheers,
Neil
