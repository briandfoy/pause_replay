well, on unix systems there is a /dev directory, but this is Perl.
If you want something to emulate a device, then Device::* seems
to be the right place. perhaps people would like to use this
one other platforms than Unix.

besides, in the context of programming languages,  i always think
'Dev' means some sort of development tool, even though i have to
keep reminding myself that 'Devel' is where Perl development
modules live.  the 'Device' name, on the other hand, is not
ambiguous.

there are a lot of 'interesting' modules in Acme::, too.
