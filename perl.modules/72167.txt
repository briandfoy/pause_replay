I think that's probably not the right name. Matt made all the same
comments I would have made.

I don't think you are really making a module that is a development aid,
necessarily. Smart::Comments provided features for normal operation, so
if that's what you are after, Devel::* is the wrong top level
namespace.

However, we can't really stop you from using that name. We're just the
voice of reason rather than the hammer of authority. :)
