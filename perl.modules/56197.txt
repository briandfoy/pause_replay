Phew.

The parser is built into ExtUtils::MakeMaker and you can test your
files by running MakeMaker's parse_version against it. An example is
on CPAN/modules/04pause.html. Instead of using META.yml you can also
just specify $VERSION in a line before the line you're citing. I
blieve this is would be the quickest solution.

I think the canonical place for it at the moment is:

http://svn.perl.org/modules/Module-Build/trunk/website/META-spec.pod
