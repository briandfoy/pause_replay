The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Backup::Duplicity::YADW
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Yet Another Duplicity Wrapper
  userid:      GRAVATTJ (John Gravatt)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:
    none that I could find

  rationale:

    Duplicity is a versatile backup utility. Unfortunately, the
    commandline options can get out of control. This module is simply a
    wrapper around Duplicity to help make it easier to use. So, in my
    opinion it is a natural fit for Backup::Duplicity. However, since it
    is just a wrapper, I felt inclined to add another NS level. As far
    as YADW, there are no less than 20 other Duplicity wrappers (none of
    which work how I want them to) out there so I felt it was
    appropriate.

The resulting entry would be:

Backup::Duplicity::
::YADW            adpOp Yet Another Duplicity Wrapper                GRAVATTJ
