Hello fellow marketer - 


Do you like long, boring "sales pitch" emails?  Me neither.

It's simple:  We have found a way to make money, using the
internet, from home.  It's not "get rich quick", and it does
take work.  But it does work - we are doing it and people in
my group are making substantial incomes!

Want to know how?  Just send an email to: msalonen@msn.com
with the subject line "Send the info!" and I will make sure you
get the details.

You are receiving this mail because you either posted to
one of our FFA Pages or to our classified ad site, you have
sent me your offer by email, or you subscribed our e-zine,
or I am responding to your ad.
If you don't want to receive anymore mails from us
please reply to this e-mail with "remove" in the subject line.
