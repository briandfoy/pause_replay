     why:

    Actually, i come from few other languages, Python mainly. I've
    worked for few years with BI Suites and Applications like Pentaho,
    and even built once an adhoc q&r tool which resembled an olap
    system.

    Actually i'm writting a Module to consume Mondrian's web service,
    parse the data, and let the developer play with it. There are many
    features i've got planned, but this is the start.
