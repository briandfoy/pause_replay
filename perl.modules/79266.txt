How about actually namespacing it? I can appreciate the desire to have
a "pretty" name, but what I've been playing with is doing both, i.e.
HTML::Zoom gets referred to as just 'Zoom' but is more findable - so
perhaps you'd be better off with XML::Diamond for this? (if the XML part
was important enough to be in the original name, seems like it might be
worth having it in the new name too :)
