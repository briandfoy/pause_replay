Slinke         bdpO  Handles Control of Slink-E product           BPAULSEN

I have discussed this module on the website maintained by Nirvis products
(http://www.nirvis.com) who are the makers of the Slink-E product.  There
seemed to be some interest in this module.  Also, there has been interest in
the MisterHouse-users mailing list.

The Slink-E product is a piece of hardware that connects to the computer via
a serial port.  This hardware then connects to a combination of Sony
products via the S-Link ports and it also has an Infrared receiver and
transmitter.

Thanks,
Brian
