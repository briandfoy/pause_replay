The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Record::Filter
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Separate duplicate records in a text file
  userid:      KIMRYAN (Kim Ryan)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Text::Record::Cleanser

  rationale:

    A standard part of the data loading and transforming process is to
    filter or suppress records so they conform to a standard defined by
    the user. Utilities currently exist to do just this in several
    database and data warehousing products.

    Types of filtering operations that can be applied to a record
    include:

    - filtering records where fields contain defined strings, or match
    a mathematical expression - filtering records that contain misformed
    or missing fields

  enteredby:   KIMRYAN (Kim Ryan)
  enteredon:   Thu Aug 18 02:37:39 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Text::Record::
::Filter          idpOp Separate duplicate records in a text file    KIMRYAN
