The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       POE::Component::Server::REST
  DSLIP:       RdpOg
  description: An easy to use REST daemon for POE-enabled
  userid:      JSTEBENS (Jean Stebens)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:
    Mailinglists

  similar:
    POE::Component::Server::SOAP

  rationale:

    # Info: the first module request was probably ignored and I never
    got the NS Grants, therefore I'm specifying it again with a more
    detailed description and reasoning.

    # The module is heavily based upon POE::Component::Server::SOAP,
    I've asked the author for copy permission:

    Thanks for letting me know - I'm happy that it provided a good base
    for you to start work on your module! Feel free to upload it to CPAN
    and if you find anything that can be contributed back upstream,
    please let me know :)

    Have fun hacking!

    # reasoning about the namespace choice:

    I've chosen POE::Component::Server::REST as namespace because of
    it's sibling relation to POE::Component::Server::SOAP.

    # the uniqueness of your approach:

    I've written a POE::Component::Server::SimpleHTTP based Service
    which parses binds a RESTful API to POE Event calls. There is no
    real perl standalone REST service yet.

    # why you believe this module should be listed in the module list:
    RESTful API's are an upcoming design feature which leads to easier
    WebService calls. This module would help in building more RESTful
    Webservices with PERL.

The resulting entry would be:

POE::Component::Server::
::REST            RdpOg An easy to use REST daemon for POE-enabled   JSTEBENS
