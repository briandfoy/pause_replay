A short description of what I'm planning to contribute:
HTML::ParseBrowser
     A lot of people have tried their hand at building this
mousetrap. I have tried all of them and have been extremely
unsatisfied. I have built a module that does it well and
thoroughly, and merely need toput together a decent test
and CPAN package.

HTML::Lister
     Dismayed with the fact that the CGI.pm UL() and OL()
methods/functions do not support multidimensionality, I
built this cute little module that takes any variable and
formats an HTML list, with functions for ordered lists,
unordered lists, and definition lists (the latter for
hashes). I am working on a non-oo interface and the above
CPAN-ification of it.

CGI::GetOptions
     I'm working on this merger between the GetOptions
command-line way of thinking and the CGI way of thinking.
I have this underway, and the idea will be a module that
will be able to convert a command-line script into a
functional (if not pretty) CGI in a few scant lines.

I am sure more will occur as I go.

Please note: the reason these all at least have building
Makefiles and so on to do still is that I am following
22.3 in order.
