I am writing to register for a username and password for the PAUSE
server. The information below should cover everything. Please e-mail if
any questions:

Name: Eric Anderson
Email: eric.anderson@cordata.net
User-ID: FIDUS
Stuff I am planning to contribute:
* Currently have a Attribute::Constructor module that allows a
programmer to mark a method as a constructor and have the object
created, blessed and returned automatically.
* Planning a way to easily specify getter/setter methods (already have
it pretty much implemented, just need to work on the interface and make
sure there isn't anything like this already out there that I should be
using instead).
* Planning some XML stuff and Database stuff (prefer not to go into
detail since it may be a month or two before I get that done)
