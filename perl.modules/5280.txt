The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Peep
  DSLI:        RdpO
  description: Clients for Peep: The Network Auralizer
  userid:      STARKY (Collin Starkweather)
  chapterid:   5 (???)
  communities:
    ;login magazine, LISA 2000, peep-devel@lists.sourceforge.net,
    irc.openprojects.net#peep

  similar:

  rationale:

    Peep is a network monitoring tool written by Michael Gilfix (I
    recently rewrote the clients as Perl modules), which was recently
    covered in USENIX's ;login magazine and was the winner of the LISA
    2000 best paper award. (For a copy of the paper, see the link at
    http://peep.sourceforge.net/intro.html.) The modules in the
    Net::Peep namespace consist of base, utility, and client classes for
    Peep clients.

    This is a follow-up to a previous submission, which originally used
    the Peep namespace, but which has since been changed to the
    Net::Peep namespace per the suggestion of Kurt D. Starsinic.
