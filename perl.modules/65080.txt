Adam and I have been discussing this with Matt Sergeant for some time and
he was happy with it.

I don't think dbi-dev is a good place for it - how about I provision a

tweaking was done with the help of @dbic-devel so I figure stuffing the
community on the same infrastructure is probably no bad thing.
