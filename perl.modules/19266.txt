I'm proposing the following module for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::PBMlib
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Library for reading PBM, PGM, PPM images
  userid:      ELIJAH (Benjamin Elijah Griffin)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pix)

  rationale:

    PBM (etc) tools work on the many small tools principle. This
    module aids in reading PBM, PGM, PPM images for making such
    tools in perl. Since writing the images reading the images is
    much less complicated, less support is needed.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::PBMlib           Rdpfp Library for reading PBM, PGM, PPM images   ELIJAH

Thanks,

Elijah
