Request to register new user

fullname: Jacob C. Bachmeyer
  userid: JCB
    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    I have been unable to find modules on CPAN for handling WARC (web
    archive) files of the sort that wget can produce but want good tools
    for handling them. Since it seems that I will need to write those
    tools, I would like to publish the modules on CPAN.

    I understand that to do this will require a PAUSE ID, so here I
    apply for one. I have requested my initials as an ID, but am okay
    with a longer string if need be. If needed, I prefer that more
    letters be added from my surname, "JBACHM" or "JCBACHM" are good
    second choices, since my full surname fills the length limit all by
    itself.
