I'm not sure if you are the correct person to receive this.  If not, would
you 
pass this along to the appropriate person?  I got this email address from
the module list at cpan.org.

The CPAN search engine is broken. When I click on a link on the
Module List which uses the search engine I get an error.  For example:
http://search.cpan.org/search?module=Pod::Usage

returns:

	The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was
unable to complete your request. 
	Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@chaos.wustl.edu
and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have
done that may have caused the error. 
	More information about this error may be available in the server
error log. 
	Apache/1.3.20 Server at search.cpan.org Port 80

I hope you can get this fixed.

Thank you for your time and attention.
