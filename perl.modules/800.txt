Subject: Naming Error on My Part -- SlideShow

Hi,

I just contributed my first module to CPAN (SlideShow), but I
believe I have erred.  The name 'SlideShow' also exists 
under Tk:: as Tk::SlideShow.

If possible i'd like to have this submission removed -- i
just uploaded it a bit ago (SlideShow-2.0.tar.gz) as
LENZO.

I'd like your advise on naming it -- i think WWW::SlideShow
is more appropriate for it.  The module allows one to control
browsers remotely, so you can give talks (for instance with
a conference call) and have slide content over the web.
It was just on www.perl.com in Ziggy's last article.

Thanks, and please accept my apology.
