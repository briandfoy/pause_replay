	A version of the module indeed never got uploaded, as it got promoted to  
Language::l33t early in its development stage.  So yeah, please feel free to 
delete Acme::l33t from the database.

	Btw, I remember looking around when Acme::l33t became Language::l33t for a 
way to free up Acme::l33t, but never found it. It'd probably be a good idea 
to mention somewhere on the PAUSE site that the right way to release a 
namespace is to contact modules@perl.org. (assuming it's not already there 
and that I somewhat missed it)


Thanks!
