The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Convert::FEC
  DSLIP:       adcOb
  description: Forward Error Correction (Vandermonde Matr.)
  userid:      MLEHMANN (Marc Lehmann)
  chapterid:   17 (Archiving_and_Compression)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I think forward error corerction, as used in many places (freenet,
    par) should be available to perl users, too, and couldn't find a
    module to do it.

    That's why I want to write Convert::FEC.

    I am certain about most aspects, except the name. I looked through
    the Crypt, Data, Convert namespaces and the closest fit was Convert.
    Althoguh I am not too hapyp with that.

    So I'd be happy to hear about better names.

    What does this module do:

    Take some data, split it into n parts, and create m new ones and
    put all of these into a set. Then, any n parts of this set taken
    togetehr can be used to restore the original data blocks as well as
    the additional ones.

    Freenet for example uses this to upload larger files by e.g.
    partiitoning a file into e.g. 100 blocks and uploadign 100 data
    blocks + 50 fec blocks. If a user wnats to download the file she
    tries to get any 100 of these 150 blocks, which are enough to a)
    decode the original file and b) "heal" freenet by re-uploading the
    parts that couldn't be found.

    I hope somebody has _the_ perfect existing (or future) namespace
    that I can use other than Convert. Or tell me that Convetr, indeed,
    is the right thing for a libarry that encodes/decodes these
    additional error correction blocks.

    Thanks (please CC:, as I am not on the list).
