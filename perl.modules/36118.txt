     why:

    I have written two simple modules for parsing/writing CSV files.
    Surprisingly, there don't appear to be any existing modules that do
    this so I thought I would share them with the Perl community.

    They differ from the Text::CSV module in that they are
    file-oriented and don't just work on individual strings. The biggest
    drawback being that they do not support CSV rows that have line
    breaks inside a cell.

    I think that calling them Spreadsheet::ParseCSV and
    Spreadsheet::WriteCSV should be appropriate, but I will solicit some
    opinions before I proceed.
