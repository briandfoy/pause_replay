Generally we ask that you try a couple of different times to contact the 
author, repeating to same addresses over a couple of weeks.

The author my not have replied because they were too busy, but if you 
email again noting you'll be applying for co-maint, it might jog their 
attention.

If they still don't reply, let us know and we'll change it over.
