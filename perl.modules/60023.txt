Request to register new user

fullname: Matthew Horsfall
  userid: WOLFSAGE
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://hiddenrealms.org
     why:

    For starters I'd like to contribute a wrapper around Net::Jabber
    that allows Net::Jabber to work with Wildfire/Openfire servers. It's
    a bit of a hack, so it may not be a good idea to put in CPAN, not
    quite sure.

    After that, if I come up with any useful modules or decide to patch
    anything, I'd like to be able to.
