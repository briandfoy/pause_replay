http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_maintain_module

This and the question following the above one give reasonable advice.
One can't point out often enough that it is like everywhere with
diplomacy. Make your claim visible to the original author and all his
friends and customers so that nobody afterwards can tell you "you
should have...". CC the authors and coauthors, use their name when you
talk about them.

Thanks,
