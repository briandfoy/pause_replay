The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::Framework
  DSLIP:       RdpOl
  description: Various methods of "gettext" through same IF
  userid:      OESTERHOL (Hans Oesterholt-Dijkema)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:
    module-authors@cpan.org

  similar:
    Locale::gettext, Locale::I18N, etc.

  rationale:

    What makes this module worth listing?

    1. This module provides *one* external interface for multiple
    locale backends. 2. It provides a very simple way of translating
    your application. 3. If one uses a backend that can be dynamically
    written, it will record all strings of your programm while your
    programm is running. See e.g. the SQL backend.

    The namespace:

    I first called it Lang (as I like short names), but a CPAN tester
    suggested I should choose an other one, because this module might be
    interesting to list.

    So I choose Locale::Framework, indicating that this could be a way
    to have access to localization methods like I18N, GNU Gettext,
    wxLocale, etc.

The resulting entry would be:
