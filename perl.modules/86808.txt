     why:

    I'd like to share with the community the results of my work for a
    course about genetic algorithms at university (which is a library to
    solve problems using the GA approach). At the same time it's a tool
    that my college mates from the biotechnology branch of the same
    university will probably be using frequently, so this seems to be
    the perfect place for them to find it and receive feedback for
    everyone interested. Thanks in advance.
