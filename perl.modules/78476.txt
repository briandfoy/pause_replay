sure.

I was actually able to get in touch with Francis back in the day, but this
was... I dunno, like two years ago, somewhere around there. He was more
than willing to give me co-maintainer rights, and said that he didnt work
with the module anymore. That was the last I've heard from him.

I actually had already tried to give Yanick rights to GnuPG (I'm actually
the one he was thinking of, who gave him rights to the other modules), but
found out that I didn't have the proper authority level for GnuPG itself.
He and I together attempted to contact Francis. This was some time ago
(month? Maybe more), and we've never heard back yet.

I think it's the right thing to do. GnuPG has been bounced around a few
times, as fresh people keep taking fresh interest in it. I'm glad to see
it's being kept alive, as it served me well during my time with it. I am
all for Yanick being given the requested rights.
