The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Email
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Test Email via POP3
  userid:      JAMES (James Tolley)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Builder

  rationale:

    Hi,

    I was surprised to see that there's nothing yet to help create
    automated tests for email delivery and arrival. Test::Mail exists,
    but isn't tied into Test::Builder, and so seems less likely to be as
    widely useful. Test::Email will use Test::Builder to provide
    something like this:

    my $pop = Test::Email->new($host); # ISA Net::POP3
    $pop->login($user,$pass);

    # wait until 3 messages arrive... or timeout
    ok($pop->wait_for($count,$timeout) == $count,"got 'em"); $pop->ok({
    subject => qr/thanks/i, },'got the thanks message'); # auto-deleted
    from server $pop->ok({ headers => { 'X-Test-Email', 'application
    form', # msg id ok? }, attachment => { name => $name, # right
    filename? mime_type => $type, # right MIME type? content =>
    $filename, # is this the right file? }, },'got the application
    form'); # auto-deleted

    # similar search configurations for headers, body, etc

    # get the email to check it by hand... my $email =
    $pop->get_email($same_config_as_above);

    # ISA MIME::Entity ok($email->parts() == 3,'it has three parts');

    ok($pop->delete_all() == 0,'no other messages waiting');
    $pop->quit();

    I could also see naming it Test::POP3, but since it's not testing
    POP3, I thought it would be clearer as Test::Email.

    Many Thanks,

    James
