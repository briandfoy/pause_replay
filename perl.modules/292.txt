Quoting kstar@chapin.edu:
:> CGI::State is too good a name to waste.
:
:    What about CGI::FSM?

Because it's more than a Finate State Machine. The framework handles a FSM,
right, but that's an internal part of it. It also handles screens, forms
(that cooperate with the state machine)...

All those objects really form a "cluster" and need to be under some common
namespace that is general enough to encompass them all. FSM looks like it's
too restrictive.

:> I think CGI::MultiScreen would be better then. Or perhaps, CGI::MxScreen
:> to acknowledge the name Tom gave to his script. If he agrees and does not
:> uses that name already.

Tom seems to like the name "CGI::MxScreen"... I do too, because it's shorter
to type than MultiScreen.

Other opinions?
