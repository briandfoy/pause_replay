I've been working on several tie()-able modules.  Some I've released early
versions of on CPAN already, others are not yet released.  If you have any
comments on any of them (listed below) please yell!

already on CPAN:
  Tie::Hash::Rank - a hash which turns values into ranking positions
  Tie::Scalar::Decay - scalar variables whose values decay

both are Rdp-p.  I say that the interface is '-' because I'm not really
sure whether n or r is suitable for a tie()-able module.

I'm working on:
  Tie::Hash::Transactional - a hash with checkpoints and rollbacks
  Tie::Array::Transactional - an array with checkpoints and rollbacks

to give a better explanation, here's part of the docs for T::H::T:

" This module implements a hash with RDBMS-like transactions.  You can
  checkpoint the hash (that is, you can save its current state), and you
  can rollback the hash (restore it to the previous saved state).  You
  can checkpoint and rollback multiple times, as checkpointed states are
  saved on a stack. "

both of these are bdpOp - the methods for checkpointing and rolling back
are called in an OO-ish style.
