The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Dev
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Network Device Management Interface
  userid:      SPARSONS (Scott Parsons)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    Newsgroup, CVS repository

  similar:
    not known

  rationale:

    Requesting Net::Dev for a space to put Perl Modules that
    communicate with Network Devices. Communication may be achieved
    through other modules, such as Net::SNMP, Net::Telnet, LWP,
    Net::FTP, etc etc. This communication with the network device would
    be use to manage the device. A Net::Dev module would use a
    'protocol' type module to access the device and then perform desired
    functions on the device.

    Other modules to support the communicating modules are also
    envisioned, such as Net::Dev::Tools. A planned upload is
    Net::Dev::Tools::MIB::MIBLoadOrder, (determines load order for a NMS
    given a group of MIBs).

    My work includes writing scripts that solve customer problems on
    network devices, have written several modules to support myself,
    would like to post publicly.

  enteredby:   SPARSONS (Scott Parsons)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug 22 22:48:00 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Dev             bdpOp Network Device Management Interface          SPARSONS
