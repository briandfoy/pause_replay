     why:

    I have written a module for creating barcodes on the fly. The
    module supports multiple graphics file formats, is machine
    independent (everything is in perl) and supports multiple barcode
    types (I have written Code128, Code39, Code93 so far). Adding new
    symboligies is done by creating a module in BCode/Types (a template
    of the class is supplied). The same is true of file formats
    BCode/Formats (I've written xbm, bmp so far and am working on png).
    The program also generates human readable zones on the barcode in
    various fonts (two supplied at present). I plan on adding 2D
    barcodes too at some stage.
