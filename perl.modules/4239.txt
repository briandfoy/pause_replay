Greetings,

This is a proposal for a general purpose Perl module for manipulating IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

Name: Manuel Valente
E-Mail: mvalente@ripe.net
User-ID: MANU or MANUV
DSLI: Rdph Manipulation of IPv4/IPv6 addresses

AnonFTP archive file: ftp://ftp.ripe.net/tools/Net-IP-1.0.tar.gz

Discussion: There are already a few modules which allow IP address manipulation and calculus - Net::IPv4Addr  and NetAddr::IP are two such modules. At RIPE-NCC, we felt that these modules did not cover all the functionality that we needed for manipulation of IP addresses. More importantly, none of these modules allowed manipulation of IPv6 addresses. The Net::IP module tries to answer to these problems and also include the functionality present in the other modules.

The module is already being used internally in our organization, RIPE-NCC, the European Regional Internet Registry. 

I tried to supply all the correct information, but feel free to correct whatever mistakes I may have made - this is my first contribution to CPAN.


Cheers.
