The rule I've implemented (which can be found in a basic stats textbook)
is based on combining the variances of data, so stricly, it does rather
assume that the data is statistical in nature.
But it's true, you could also apply the rules to numbers where the error
is a systematic experimental uncertainty rather than a statistical one, so
perhaps making these these objects more generally "mathematical" in
nature might be more useful.
Anyway, I'm happy to put this module in Math::
Need I submit another namespace registration?
