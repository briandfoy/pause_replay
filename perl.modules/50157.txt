Subject: Module submission Devel::Strace

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Devel::Strace
  DSLIP:       Rdpfa
  description: strace-like runtime call trace for Perl appl
  userid:      DARNOLD (Dean Arnold)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Devel::CoreStack

  rationale:

    Devel::STrace implements a passive debugger that records the
    callstack (along with line numbers and timestamps) for every thread.
    Devel::RingBuffer and IPC::Mmap are used to store the information in
    a shared memory area which can be inspected using an external
    monitor application (e.g., Devel::STrace::Monitor). Where
    Devel::CoreStack is a post-mortem tool (that appears to be
    abandoned), Devel::STrace provides a near realtime view of the state
    of an application, while minimizing the impact on the app under
    test. Devel::STrace is useful for diagnosing misbehaving, but
    running, applications, while minimizing "Heisenberg" effects and
    avoiding logging and analyzing gigabytes of data.

The resulting entry would be:

Devel::
