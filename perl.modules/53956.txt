From: bfree@graphcomp.com ("Bob Free")

I've posted a new OpenGL 0.55 candidate (http://graphcomp.com/opengl) - 
recently headlined on opengl.org - and would like to submit this to CPAN; 
I'm a registered PAUSE developer.

The OpenGL module has not been updated in about 7 years; I've attempted to 
contact the original contributors (Stan Melax and Kenneth Albanowski) 
without success.  I've had sporadic contact with one of the last 
contributors (Ilya Zakharevich), but have not heard from him recently.

The advantage of this module over SDL::OpenGL and others is that it is not 
dependent on any other modules, and limits its focus solely on OpenGL, 
making it light-weight and simpler to install.  I'm also prioritizing this 
module's future development to support GPGPU operations and server-side 
support - as opposed to SDL's multimedia focus.

What is the protocol for taking over a module - just submitting it?

Thanks - Bob
