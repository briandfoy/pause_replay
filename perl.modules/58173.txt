Hi Alexandr, hi Andy, hi modules@perl.org,

unless I misremember, Andy Lester is taking care of handing out
co-maintenance permissions for Nick's modules where appropriate.

However, File::Compare has been a core module since 5.004 and is
maintained by the perl5-porters. Therefore, I would suggest you send
your patches to p5p and after they have been applied, ask p5p (and
specifically Rafael) for permissions to "dual-life" the module. That is,
to release it as a separate CPAN distribution so older perls can
benefit. When they gave you permission, send a quick notice to
modules@perl.org again and we will set you up with the necessary PAUSE
permissions.

Rafael is planning to release perl 5.10 within a week, so your patches
will have a hard time getting through before that.

Best regards,
Steffen
