     why:

    Initially an IIS administration module (utilizing Win32API::Net and
    Win32::FileSecurity). After that, who knows what else.

    I've been involved in some discussions about a perl-based
    conference system. Once I start the project, I would plan on
    contributing it (or relevant parts of it), as well.
