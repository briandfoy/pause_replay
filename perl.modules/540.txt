I've changed the text under letter e and added a headline and added
the whole chapter as "Namespace Coordination" to the module list. The
whole thing now looks like so:

Part 1 - Modules: Creation, Use and Abuse

1)   Perl 5 Module Terminology
2)   Guidelines for Module Creation
3)   Guidelines for Converting Perl 4 Library Scripts into Modules
4)   Guidelines for Reusing Application Code
5)   Namespace Coordination

[...]

5) Namespace Coordination

The maintainers of the module list are not the Internic for perl
namespaces. They do neither sell namespaces nor can they establish
property rights. What they try to do is to minimize namespace clashes
and maximize usablility of the CPAN archive by setting up a catalogue
of modules and control the indexers. Time permitting, they will also
try to give advice for what they think is a proper usage of the
namespace.

It is an important part of the namespace concept that the module list
maintainers do not guarantee to you that somebody else won't use the,
say, Foo::Bar namespace. The upload area is not censored except for
abuse. People are free to upload any modules they like. Instead, there
are several levels of protection for your namespaces:

a) The most important is the module list which actually lists and
   proclaims your namespace.

b) The second is the indexing mechanism of the CPAN. Modules are
   indexed on a first-come-first-serve basis. The module namespace
   that is uploaded for the first time ever gets indexed, but not the
   module of the second one who tries to use the same namespace.

c) As the whole process is trying to benefit the community, all
   parties are subject to a wider monitoring within the community.
   This is sometimes referred to as security by visibility.

d) So the next level of namespace protection is the common sense. Your
   own common sense. Help to save the world. If you get the impression
   that something goes wrong with regard to namespaces, please write
   to modules@perl.org and let them know.

e) The perhaps most interesting namespace protection is provided by
   the perl symbol table itself. A namespace Foo:: is just a package
   name and its relationship to a namespace Foo::Bar:: is not
   predetermined whatsoever. The two namespaces can be closely or
   loosely related or not related at all, but what's most important,
   they can be writen by different authors who may work rather
   independently from each other. So if you have registered any
   namespace, it does not mean that you own the whole namespace tree
   that starts there. If you are registered as the contact for
   Foo::Bar, you are not necessarily also associated with
   Foo::Bar::Baz.

f) In a few rare cases the module list people restrict indexing of
   certain categories. For example:
     DBI::* under the control of Tim Bunce
     Sun::* under the control of Sun Microsystems


If I don't hear otherwise, I'll publish that tomorrow,
Cheers,
