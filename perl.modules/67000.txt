Subject: Module submission Bio::FastaGrep

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::FastaGrep
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Like grep, but enhanced for searching fasta
  userid:      JIMI (Jimi-Carlo Bukowski-Wills)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    File::Grep Bio::DB::Fasta Bio::SearchIO

  rationale:

    Fasta files contain formatted protein/nucleotide sequences along
    with identifiers and other metadata. When searching through one or
    more fasta files, it can be desirable to limit the search to the
    metadata or the sequence, and it is absolutely necessary to remove
    formatting characters (newlines, etc) from the sequence before
    searching for sub-sequences/patterns. This module bridges the
    functionality of File::Grep (the ability to search lots of files for
    strings) and Bio::DB::Fasta (the ability to correctly parse and
    distinguish the parts of a fasta file). If you need to process a
    bunch of fasta sequences you might use Bio::SearchIO, but this
    doesn't use a simple grep-like interface (you have to write your own
    per-record handler) and it doesn't make optimal use of $/ to read
    the format. This module should be quicker to use both in coding and
    execution.

    examples of use:

    # search by accession number in a specific file fastagrep
    'IPI00845377', '~/fasta/ipi.CHICK.3.43.fasta';

    # search a file for a sequence fastagrep -n => "\n\r",'-S', #
    options (set newline char, search sequence) qr/[^KR]{50,}/, #
    pattern (search for stretches of 50 residues or more that don't
    contain lysine or arginine) '~/fasta/*.fasta', # list of files/globs
    '/usr/local/mascot/sequence/*/current/*.fasta';

The resulting entry would be:
