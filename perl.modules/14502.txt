The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::RU::Translit
  DSLIP:       bdcfp
  description: Converts texts from "translit" to koi8-r
  userid:      SERG (Sergei Golubchik)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lingua::RU::Charset - converts between various Cyrillic charsets

  rationale:

    well, I failed to find a module that converts from Russian
    "translit" (that is Russian text approximated by latin1 charset)
    back to Cyrillic. Lingua::RU::Charset and Convert::Cyrillic (also
    more generic Convert::Translit and
    iconv-based-don't-remember-the-name) convert between Cyrillic
    charsets, but they only do one-to-one translation (simple
    tr/.../.../). Lingua::RU::Charset can convert to "translit" - it's
    one-to-many lossy convertion (tr/.../.../ and few s/./.../g). As
    cyrillic-translit conversion is lossy, translit-cyrillic conversion
    is ambiguous, so this module uses Hidden Markov Model to choose a
    most probable cyrillic original. Here's "uniqueness of approach" -
    this is the only charset conversion module (though, russian
    "translit" is not technically a charset), that is not a set of tr///
    and s/// commands (and cannot be rewritten as such).

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::RU::
::Translit        bdcfp Converts texts from "translit" to koi8-r     SERG
