The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Goo
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: The Goo helps you stick Things together
  userid:      NIGE (Nigel Hamilton)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    blog.thegoo.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Goo" helps you stick "Things" together in your working
    environment.

    Things include Perl modules, Perl scripts, log files, javascripts,
    configuration files, database tables, templates etc.

    The Goo records a "Trail" as you jump quickly from Thing to Thing
    in a simple, text-based console. It remembers how you associate
    Things in your environment.

    Accelerate your work by quickly traversing the Trail of
    associations between Things.

    The Goo is a framework for associating "Things" in your working
    environment. The Goo namespace acts as a distinctive top level
    namespace for plugins for "Things". I have chosen a short
    distinctive word so I don't expect name clashes with other modules.

    Modules within the framework are grouped as follows:

    Goo::Object Goo::Thing::pm::ProgramMaker
    Goo::Thing::js::ProgramMaker

    etc ...

    The Goo blog is found here: http://blog.thegoo.org The website is
    found here: http://thegoo.org The alpha release will be presented at
    the upcoming London Perl Workshop: http://london.pm.org/lpw

    Looking forward to sticking The Goo on CPAN ...
