Hello!

Tried to contact author by e-mail (Gabor Egressy <gabor [AT] 
vmunix.com>) twice from 2006-10-22. Also tried to contact Matt Sanford 
(uploaded new version with tests, but without rights to do it).

This module has hanging bugs/patches in RT 3 years old. Is used by 6 
other modules. Version that is installing is from 1998.
I'm planning to do dist cleaning, resolve RT queue and mark it as 
"deprecated".
