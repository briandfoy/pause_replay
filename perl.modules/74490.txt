Request to register new user

fullname: Colin Kennedy
  userid: MOSHEN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://moshen.net
     why:

    Over the past year I have been sharpening my development skills and
    have started sharing code on GitHub ( https://github.com/moshen )
    and have just completed a small perl utility script that I would
    like to share on CPAN.

    Hopefully the first of many.
