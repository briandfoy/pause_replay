     why:

    Well, you probeably dont know me.

    I have been a perl programmer for... two or three years now, and I
    will be able contribute alot to CPAN.

    I have at least three modules in the pre-release stage that I will
    release to CPAN being worked on (one I probeably wont submit because
    they already is a version on CPAN, the rest of my modules are unique
    to my network invironment so whats the point in submitting them?).

    The one that will probeably come out first is a <some ns>::PJL, my
    package that can communicate with most HP laserjet printers
    preforming all admin tasks. (Im testing on a 9000 right now)

    If any other info is needed drop me a line.
