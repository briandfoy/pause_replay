The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::FITesque
  DSLIP:       bdpOb
  description: FITesque test framework
  userid:      KONOBI (Scott McWhirter)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    perl-qa@lists.perl.org

  similar:
    Test::FIT Test::C2Fit

  rationale:

    This framework matches the behaviour of the C2 Fit framework, but
    is a lot simpler, more lightweight and a lot more perlish. It should
    provide the means to do acceptance/integration testing in the perl
    world with more ease.

    As for the name, it's not FIT and it sorta is FIT... so it's
    FITesque. Rationale behind the distributions existance are provided
    in the Test::FITesque POD docs.

  enteredby:   KONOBI (Scott McWhirter)
  enteredon:   Mon Jul  9 00:29:34 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::FITesque        bdpOb FITesque test framework                      KONOBI
