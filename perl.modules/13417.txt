I'm very sorry.

I started investigating for Crypt::Tea. Are you sure, it ever was
registered in the module list? I don't think so. Crypt::TEA yes, but
Crypt::Tea no. I'm not saying it should not be registered, but right
now, for the sake of debugging, I need to know if it ever was in. I
cannot find a record of it being registered.

What you do not mention, but mention in your email to Gerrit, is the
fact that new uploads are not recognized by the indexer. Now this is
the root of all evil. In your upload PJB/Crypt-Tea-1.36.tar.gz you set

$VERSION = '#VERSION#';

PAUSE had big troubles with this version number containing "#". It
decided to code this strange version as a v-string as you can easily
verify by asking CPAN.pm:

cpan> m Crypt::Tea                  
Module id = Crypt::Tea
    CPAN_USERID  PJB (Peter Billam <computing@pjb.com.au>)
    CPAN_VERSION v35.86.69.82.83.
    CPAN_FILE    P/PJ/PJB/Crypt-Tea-1.36.tar.gz
    MANPAGE      Tea.pm - Perl module to implement TEA, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm
    INST_FILE    (not installed)

Since then any new upload with a $VERSION that doesn't beat v35.86...
is not recognized as a new version.

The solution to the problem is to delete Crypt-Tea-1.36.tar.gz and
re-index the newest version as soon as Crypt-Tea-1.36.tar.gz is gone
from CPAN. You have a menu item "Reindex" on your PAUSE menu.

I'm not sure I can improve PAUSE's guess-work on v-strings, so I have
no better solution for now. Perl 5.10 will most probably offer a
better solution, but it's a long time until that will work.

Never, really never has such a thing happened on CPAN. We never evict
anything. If things do not work as expected, there is a bug somewhere.

Being registered in the module list is only an additional approval,
but strictly speaking not in any way a necessity.

Please accept my apologies for not recognizing the problem earlier.
And please don't give up.

Please let me know if this resolves your problem for Crypt::Tea and
probably also for your other modules on CPAN.
