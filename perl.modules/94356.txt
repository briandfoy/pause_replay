Request to register new user

fullname: Sarvesh D
  userid: SRVSH
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: 
     why:

    I worked with the author of RT::Client::REST on some existing bugs
    and he suggested making me a co-maintainer, for which I'll need a
    PAUSE account.

    I have an account named 'SRVSD' which I registered before the CPAN
    pull request challenge 2015, but I want to rename it to 'SRVSH' to
    be consistent with my GitHub account.

    Thanks!
