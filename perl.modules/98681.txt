     why:

    I have been asked to publish my software from an academic journal
    in Japan from the editor. So I will try uploading my software on
    CPAN. The deadline for writing about the article is in about 3
    weeks. I read the O'Reilly book translation of Perl and it indicates
    me to create PAUSE account as a first step. I have been a Perl
    programmer for many years and I have read many Perl books at my
    company, and I bought Oreilly books about Perl yesterday because I
    determined to upload my software.
