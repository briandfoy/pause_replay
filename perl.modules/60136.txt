The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tamino
  DSLIP:       aapOp
  description: Tamino XML Database minimal driver
  userid:      YURAN (Nevinitsin Yury)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Tamino XML DB is not very well-known database but still, i have
    seen people looking over Internet for a driver. The Tamino web-site
    said there is no libs for Perl. Here it is now.

  enteredby:   YURAN (Nevinitsin Yury)
  enteredon:   Sun Apr 20 19:45:12 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tamino            aapOp Tamino XML Database minimal driver           YURAN
