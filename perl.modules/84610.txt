Hi

I've made ACFEREN co-maintainer of Net::Flow and Net::Flow::Ie.

Happy Perling!

Hi,

I've been trying to adopt Net::Flow for a while.  The author has kindly
given me permission, but the process has stalled there.  I am preparing
to do some work with the module and was hoping someone at perl.org could
do the ownership transfer.

Thanks,
-Andrew

Hi Atsushi,

Not problem about missing my earlier email.

I think the easiest thing to do to allow me to maintain the module is to
log in to your PAUSE account and make me a co-maintainer or transfer the
module to me.

http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_adopt_module

My PAUSE id is acferen.

If you need more specifics I'll see what I can dig up.

Thanks,
-Andrew
