Paul,

autodie is a dual life module, which has CPAN listed as upstream. I
notice there are several RT tickets which note breaks in 5.14 and the
coming 5.16. I'm guessing you've been busy and unable to get to these
fixes. Would you be open to giving me co-maint to fix these bugs? I've
done this for several other dual life modules. My only goal is to keep
CPAN in sync with the latest perl.

Thanks,
Todd Rinaldo
