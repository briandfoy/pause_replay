It's part and parcel of open source. Your alternative is to start from
scratch with no prior work at all.  I'd wager that even with your
wasted time on this module, CPAN still saves you an amazing amount of
time overall. 

We specifically and purposedly do not impose a quality level on CPAN
uploads. CPAN wants the barrier to participation to be as low as
possible. If the buggy versions were not avialable, most of CPAN
wouldn't be around.

If you'd like to take over the module, however, we have ways of
handling that. But, it looks like Ricardo SIGNES last released a
version in April.  I don't see any issues from you in the RT queue for
the module, and I don't know what else you tried to do to contact the
author.
