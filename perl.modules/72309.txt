If "in here" you mean the PAUSE people, I thought that was the
opposite. I'd rather see you take over Smart::Comments and release a
2.0 with new features.

Nope. PAUSE tries to index anything that anyone uploads, no matter what
we say. When people want to register (which is not indexing) modules,
we try to help with our extensive knowledge of what is already on CPAN
and how new names can best fit into that.

If you don't register your module, nothing bad is going to happen to
you. However, we do try to get CPAN authors to cooperate to reduce the
amount of pollution on CPAN and reuse as much of the existing work as
possible.
