Sorry, I was a bit quick in sending this paragraph. The successful
ones are APML and BIOPERLML, others are in experimental stage.

On PAUSE you see all at

    https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=show_ml_repr

These accounts have no password and cannot upload. The users in that
table have the ability do maintain permissions on behalf of the
virtual ID and so they do not need our help to sort things out.

What has repeatedly been rejected were userids that are just a company
name. And what is completely unacceptable from a security POV are
userids where people share passwords. Of course we cannot enforce that
this doesn't happen.
