The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::TCLink
  DSLIP:       Mdhfl
  description: interface to the TrustCommerce payment gw
  userid:      TRUSTCOM (Orion Benjamin Henry)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    developer@trustcommerce.com

  similar:

  rationale:

    The TrustComerce payment gateway is a fast easy means to do
    creal-time credit card and check processing over TCP/IP and SSL.
    Net::TCLink is a perl interface to this service.

    This is a network module (thus the Net::) prefix as it implements
    the TrustCommerce network protocol . The "TCLink" half is the name
    was choses as it is short for "Trust Commerce Link". This module is
    a high-quality, easy-to-use, open-source tools that all perl
    programmers should have easy access to.

  enteredby:   TRUSTCOM (Orion Benjamin Henry)

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::TCLink          Mdhfl interface to the TrustCommerce payment gw    TRUSTCOM
