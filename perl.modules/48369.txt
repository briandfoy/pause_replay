Subject: Module submission RT::Client::REST
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RT::Client::REST
  DSLIP:       adpOg
  description: Talk to RT using REST protocol.
  userid:      DMITRI (Dmitri Tikhonov)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    rt-devel@lists.bestpractical.com, #rt on irc.perl.org

  similar:
    RT::Client does a similar thing, but using Atom protocol.

  rationale:

    RT::Client::REST is /usr/bin/rt converted to a Perl module. I
    needed to implement some RT interactions from my application, but
    did not feel that invoking a shell command is appropriate. Thus, I
    took rt tool, written by Abhijit Menon-Sen, and converted it to an
    object-oriented Perl module.

  enteredby:   DMITRI (Dmitri Tikhonov)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 19 21:40:05 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RT::Client::
::REST            adpOg Talk to RT using REST protocol.              DMITRI
