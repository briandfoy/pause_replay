     why:

    I don't know what exactly I am going to contribute, yet. I have
    just started going through the book Intermediate Perl and there it
    was suggested to apply for the account upfront. I think the reason
    is that the account will be ready by the time I reach a level where
    I'll be capable to contribute.
