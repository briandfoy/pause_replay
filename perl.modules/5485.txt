I think Class::Methods is a good namespace for what you describe.

The name of the package is irritating to me. Better you call it just
Class-Methods-*. The reason is you do not use the Bundle:: namespace
anyway and the Bundle:: namespace in turn would mean something
completely different, a directory of modules that are available
separately.
