The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Basename::Object
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Object wrapper around File::Basename
  userid:      CRAKRJACK (Tyler MacDonald)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:

  similar:
    File::Basename

  rationale:

    C<File::Basename::Object> is an object-oriented wrapper around
    L<File::Basename|File::Basename>. The goal is to allow pathnames to
    be presented and manipulated easily.

    A C<File::Basename::Object> stringifies to it's full canonical
    pathname, so it can be used in open(), etc. without any trouble.
    When compared as a string (C<cmp>, C<ne>, C<eq>, etc), it's full
    canonical pathname is compared. When compared using numeric
    operators (C<==>, C<!=>, etc), the file's base name is compared
    instead. Some methods are also provided:

The resulting entry would be:

File::Basename::
::Object          bdpOp Object wrapper around File::Basename         CRAKRJACK
