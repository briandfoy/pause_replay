Yes, I'm planning to catch up with this soon, and get it into a state where
I'm either able to carry on with it, or happy to hand it over to someone.
I don't want to decide which until I've got a grip on what state it's in,
and what I have in various source trees locally.

Life has been rather too busy for the past 15 months. Some things have
changed to improve on this. We have now moved (most moving stress is over)
and

1) my commute is now shorter (the time saving will add up, and work isn't
   getting it)
2) we're nearer multiple sources of (reliable) babysitting
   (which we weren't before)


There's a few things still to do before I can get time to work on fun stuff
(including finishing unpacking the office, which is mostly still in boxes,
and after that, whatever interesting questions the account is about to throw
my way) but I think that it's realistic that by the end of September I'll be
making progress. (Although I'm not sure what order I'm going to tackle
things)

This is also why I've been rather absent from perl5-porters for a while.
(and most everywhere else)
