The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       AI::Evolutionary
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Evolutionary algorithms in PERL
  userid:      JMERELO (J. J. Merelo)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    perl-ai , perl-es

  similar:
    AI::Gene

  rationale:

    Another option would be Algorithm::Evolutionary (but couldn't list
    it in the form). Even as there have been several evolutionary
    algorithms in Perl released, none of them is in the shape of a OO
    library that can be used or extended. AI::Gene contains just a part
    of an evolutionary algorithm: the "chromosome".
    (AI|Algorithm)::Evolutionary contains several shapes of
    "chromosomes", along with its variation operators, and the
    corresponding population-level algorithms.

    Of the two names requested, I would go for AI::Evolutionary, since
    it's not a single algorithm, but a set of algorithms with a common
    skeleton; besides, evolutionary computation is usually placed within
    AI. Algorithm::Genetic has been used in the past (I think by Alex
    Vandiver), but wasn't finally registered; it's maybe worse because
    it gives the idea of a single algorithm; AI::Evolutionary will
    contain genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and other
    approaches.

The resulting entry would be:

AI::
::Evolutionary    bdpOg Evolutionary algorithms in PERL              JMERELO
