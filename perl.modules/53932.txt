The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::NL::CLIEOP03
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generate CLIEOP03 files for Dutch banks
  userid:      ZEBAZ (Sebastiaan Hoogeveen)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The CLIEOP03 format is a format for sending transactions as a batch
    job to a Dutch bank. Since banking interface modules have already
    been put under Finance::Bank::<countrycode>, I propose placing the
    module below Finance::Bank::NL.

    The CLIEOP03 format is managed by InterPay, which is a
    collaboration of all Dutch banks. Since Interpay itself is not a
    bank, and the CLIEOP03 format should be usable with all Dutch banks,
    I propose the namespace Finance::Bank::NL::CLIEOP03 (this is very,
    very unlikely to ever clash with the name of an actual bank in the
    Netherlands).

    Note that this module is not a website automatizer hack like most
    other modules below Finance::Bank; the CLIEOP03 interface is
    officially supported.

  enteredby:   ZEBAZ (Sebastiaan Hoogeveen)
  enteredon:   Wed Apr 11 10:01:20 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::NL::
::CLIEOP03        adpOp Generate CLIEOP03 files for Dutch banks      ZEBAZ
