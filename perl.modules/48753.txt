If there weren't already 10 other "frameworks" for doing classes, I'd be 
inclined to say yes.

But given all the others out there, do you think there might be an 
alternative that uses more specific terminology?

That's not a criticism of the function of this module (god knows there's 
enough otheres, and you've at least pleaded your case, which shows 
thought) just of the word "Framework".
