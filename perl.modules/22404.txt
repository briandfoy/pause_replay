From: hsiegel@progress.com (Howard Siegel)

I've long wanted something in the Windows environment that behaves like
the
classic Unix "script" command, and I've managed to do so using the
ActiveState
perl. (MKS perl doesn't work, and I don't know about other
Windows-platform
versions of perl.)  It doesn't have as many features as the Unix script,
but it's better
than what is otherwise available.  (Yes, I do know about U/Win, but that
doesn't
suit my company's needs.)

The set of routines that I use to implement it can also be used by other
Perl scripts,
and in fact I created the routines as part of an automation effort.  I
want to turn
them into a module, and if my company approves I'll contribute it to
CPAN.

"Interact" would seem to be an appropriate name, but I find it hard to
believe that
no-one has yet appropriated it, given that Expect supports an 'interact'
function.

Is there an "interact" module anywhere in CPAN?  I've looked and haven't

found one, but perhaps I haven't looked in the right places.  If
"interact" hasn't
yet been used, is there some way I can reserve it?

TIA

Howard Siegel
