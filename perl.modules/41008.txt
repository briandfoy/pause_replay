If you are interested in some projects to work on, I have a couple that 
could use some assistance.

Specifically, the ThreatNet:: family, CVS Monitor, Test::Platform, etc.

Module::Install could _really_ use some love and tenderness as well, 
because Autrijus is otherwise busy with pugs.

Email me directly if you are interested, cpan@ali.as
