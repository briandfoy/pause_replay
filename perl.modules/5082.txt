Hello,

On checking the PAUSE e-mail archives on-line, I notice that I have been
added as a PAUSE user with ID ANDREWHO:

    Name:      Andrew Ho
    email:     andrew@zeuscat.co
    homepage:  http://www.zeuscat.com/andrew
    enteredby: Johan Vromans

Thanks, Johan! However, in the e-mail it says this:

    Once you've gone through the procedure of password approval (see the
    separate mail you should receive about right now), this userid will be
    the one that you can use to upload your work or edit your credentials
    in the PAUSE database.

Unfortunately, I have not yet received this password e-mail.  Also, I
never received the e-mail above, either. Is the missing "m" in zeuscat.com
intentional, or would this explain the fact that I never got the password
e-mail? Thanks in advance--

Humbly,

Andrew
