I'm sorry, but that just doesn't work for me, that works even less.

Class::Auto?

"Auto what?"  "Auto AutoClass."  "What?!"  "Or Auto AutoArgs."  "Huh?"

Auto?  That doesn't work for me, either.  "Auto" is just another 
"positive
word", compare with (hypothetical):

Class::Fast
Class::Transparent
Class::Better

Feel free to proceed with your naming, but I cannot be the only
one that gets confused by vague naming like this.  The name is quite
undecipherable to me, I would need to read the documentation before
having any idea what the class is doing.
