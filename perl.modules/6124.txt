Dear PAUSE maintainers,

I have developed a Table  Module for the project I am working on. I wanted
to contribute this module to CPAN, however I saw similar modules doing
almost identical things. However this "ALMOST" makes big difference. Here
are the differences
1. Sorting the data in the table
2. Download Button.
3. Change formats any way you want.
4. Inserting different kind objects (other than Tables).

I put my documentations into
http://users.rcn.com/seyhan
my name is Seyhan Ersoy
my e-mail is seyhan@rcn.com
my preferred user id for CPAN  is "SEYHAN"

I am also planning to contribute FormElements.pm module which converts CGI
form elements into objects where it can be used with Table, and more
functionality.

Please provide me your feedback whether is it worth to contribute this
module.

Thanks,
Seyhan Ersoy
