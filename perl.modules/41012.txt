This _is_ the comp.lang.perl.modules list, and I don't recall seeing 
Ekahau proposed here on clpm before, and a quick search (at least in the 
subject) doesn't turn up any results for Ekahau.

Positioning and GPS modules generally belong in Geo::

You should probably re-request this as Geo::Ekahau

Which other location modules did you see that had top level namespaces?
