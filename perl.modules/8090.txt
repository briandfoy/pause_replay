What does the G in GMIME stand for?  Is it an easily recognisable name
that people will know to look for, or is it (as it seems) somewhat
arbitrary and obscure?

Your earlier message says that this is an XS implementation, and that
it's faster than the existing MIME tools.  Is this its only (or main)
point of distinction?  If so, I'd go for a name like MIME::Fast::* or
something.  (Some people might suggest MIME::XS::* but we like to make
the name match the *features* not the specific *implementation*).
