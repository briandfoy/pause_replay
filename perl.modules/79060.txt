Is this specifically a hydrology sort of thing, or a sound sort of
thing? It seems to me that a module to calculate the speed of sound
through any medium would be nice, maybe with a name such as:

   Acoustics::Speed

The values for water could be set in various ways. You're going to need
to adjust them for temperature, pressure, salinity and bulk modulus.
Since three of those are variable, why not make the fourth a variable
too. If we got really crazy, we'd have to pull out all the tricky
oceanography formulas that I vaguely recall.
