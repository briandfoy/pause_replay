Hi Colin, Hi James,

Colin, I'm sending this mail to all e-mail addresses I could find. I
hope one still reaches you and I hope you're not flooded with copies of
this mail either.

James is volunteering to take over the module in case you are no longer
interested in maintaining it. In good faith, if you don't react within a
couple of weeks, we will assign James co-maintenance permissions so he
can upload new versions. Please note that this is a reversible action.
We're not taking away your primary maintainer status. Please let us know
whether you agree to James taking over maintenance of the module.

James, please have a look at
http://cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#takeover about the general idea
behind and process of taking over module maintenance. Waiting for a
reaction for some time is necessary in case Colin is on vacation or
otherwise hindered. You can, however, apply your fixes and improvements
and release new versions to CPAN already. They simply won't be indexed.
If and when you get assigned co-maintenance, you can issue a "Force
reindexing" via your pause.perl.org account to get the new versions indexed.

Best regards,
Steffen (for the PAUSE admins)
