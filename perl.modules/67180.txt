     why:

    CampaignMonitor is a Perl package that is a BASIC implementation of
    some of Campaign Monitor's API methods.

    Methods implemented: Client.GetLists
    Subscriber.AddAndResubscribeWithCustomFields
    Subscriber.AddWithCustomFields Subscriber.Unsubscribe
    Subscribers.GetIsSubscribed Subscribers.GetUnsubscribed

    This is my very first Perl module and should only be useful for
    starters. You've been warned :)
