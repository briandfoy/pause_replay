The email address below, mik@rule-of-ten.com, is no longer active.  I
thought I had switched all of the PAUSE information over to
mikfire@gmail.com but I have apparently missed something.

The problem is that I can think of no particular way you can be sure that
mik@rule-of-ten.com and mikfire@gmail.com are the same person and that,
indeed, I am him (even though I am).

Let me know if there is some way I can unlock my account that will be
relatively safe.

Thanks,
Mik

<br>
you should already have received a mail that informed you about a<br>
password leakage at <a href=3D"http://perlmonks.org" target=3D"_blank">perl=

<br>
As a consequence your password on pause was reset on Sat Aug 8 09:34:02<br>
2009 and you cannot use it anymore to login. To regain access to pause,<br>

This will mail a new access token to <a href=3D"mailto:mik@rule-of-ten.com"=
