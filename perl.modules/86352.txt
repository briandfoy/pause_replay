The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Run::Parts
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Interface to Debian's run-arts tool
  userid:      ABE (Axel Beckert)
  chapterid:   21 (File_Handle_Input_Output)
  communities:
    https://github.com/xtaran/run-parts

  similar:

  rationale:

    Our group has several perl-written applications which use run-parts
    to access configuration file directories, etc.

    One publicly available tool which uses run-parts already directly
    is https://github.com/elmar/aptitude-robot and another one which is
    planned to be extended by using run-parts is
    https://github.com/xtaran/unburden-home-dir

    The latter caused us to factor out interfacing with run-parts by
    writing this new module.

    At a later stage switching to a pure Perl reimplementation of
    run-parts (to be independent of the program run-parts) or a hybrid
    approach (pure Perl implemetnation and interface to the program
    run-parts with a common interface) are possible. But for now, the
    run-parts binary is needed and the module is just a Perl interface
    to it.

The resulting entry would be:

Run::
::Parts           cdpOp Interface to Debian's run-arts tool          ABE
