The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MooseX::MultiInitArg
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Attributes with aliases for constructor arg
  userid:      FRODWITH (Paul Driver)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    #moose on irc.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Well, there's no way to do this and I needed to do it, and it's a
    generic enough thing to do that it merits sharing with others.

    It lets you supply extra init_args in a

    has something => ( init_args => [qw(munge frobnicate)] )

    such that now you can set something in the constructor with either
    something, munge, or frobnicate. Handy dandy, and doesn't step on
    anyone's toes. Also, Steven approves. :)

The resulting entry would be:

MooseX::
::MultiInitArg    bdpOp Attributes with aliases for constructor arg  FRODWITH
