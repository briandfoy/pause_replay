From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

This module is clearly going to sprawl over time, so I would prefer you
gave it a top-level name in the same way e.g. Catalyst, Mojolicious have
done.

Framework:: isn't appropriate since 'Core' would suggest some sort of
privileged position within that namespace.

This is why the whole branded-top-level thing came about; there's just no
other way of doing it that doesn't cause confusion.
