The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Win32::GUIRobot::Easy
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: A module for automating GUI tasks
  userid:      ZOFFIX (Zoffix Znet)
  chapterid:   22 (Microsoft_Windows_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Win32::GUIRobot

  rationale:

    The module uses and simplifies the use of Win32::GUIRobot and adds
    support for interfacing with Windows clipboard. Instead of a
    functional interface of Win32::GUIRobot an object-oriented interface
    is provided which secludes the image loading of images that the
    robot will need to look for. Instead of using several functions for
    a particular automated GUI task, instructions are passed to one
    method in form of an arrayref which may be stored and reused.
    Personally, I wrote this module when I had a need to automate
    several GUI tasks in my application fast and my code would get large
    quickly and I would lack time to debug. Robot instructions include
    easily stuffing some text into the clipboard (pass a scalar ref as
    one of the element in the instructions arrayref), dragging the mouse
    (a simple hashref with "what button", "from where" and "to where" as
    an element of intructions arraref).

    The module has been uploaded and has decent documentation if you
    would like more information about it.
