The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Mines
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: mine finding game(Minesweeper,Gnome mines)
  userid:      MPECK (Martyn Peck)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The name space seems straight forward, unless I'm missing
    something. As for why the module it self: I was trying to see if
    there was a way to make an always solvable minesweeper game, where
    you'd never have to guess. But for that, I needed to have a set of
    games that couldn't be solved without guessing, and see if they have
    some commonality. So I had to write a program that could play a
    minesweeper like game as far as it could go and then save the result
    for me to examin. Of course that meant I need a game for it to play.
    Checking on CPAN, I couldn't find anything that could help me with
    that. So I wrote my own, and thought this would be a good think to
    release. Thank you
