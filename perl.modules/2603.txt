Hi there...

I would like to register the following modules:

Crypt::PGP5 - A comprehensive interface to PGP 5                - bdpO
Crypt::PGP6 - A comprehensive interface to PGP 6                - cdpO
Crypt::PGP  - Wrapper around Crypt::PGP5 and Crypt::PGP5        - cdpO
Crypt::GPG  - A comprehensive interface to GPG                  - cdpO

The Crypt::PGP5 module provides near complete access to PGP 5
functionality, including methods for encryption, decryption, signing,
signature verification, key generation, key export and import, and
most other key management functions.

Crypt::PGP5 is available from CPAN under authors/Ashish_Gulhati/. I
believe it provides a more comprehensive and stable interface to PGP
than any other module currently available for PGP access.

Crypt::PGP6 and Crypt::GPG are under development and will closely
mimic the object interface of Crypt::PGP5, so as to present a uniform
API to application programs. Crypt::PGP will be a wrapper that will
transparently use whichever PGP version happens to be available in the
execution environment.

I also want to register the following:

Persistence::Database::SQL - Persistent objects in SQL databases - adpO
Persistence::Object::Postgres - Object persistence in PostgreSQL - adpO
Persistence::Object::MySQL - Object persistence in MySQL         - cdpO

These implement object persistence in SQL databases, automatically
mapping object data to database tables, thereby alowing SQL queries on
the data. Alpha versions of the first two modules are also available
from CPAN under authors/Ashish_Gulhati/. Persistence::Object::MySQL is
under development, and it's likely there would be more later, like
Persistence::Object::Oracle, Persistence::Object::CSV, etc.

The Persistence::Database and Persistence::Object namespaces are
registered by Vipul Ved Prakash. I've discussed this with him and he
likes the new classes I'm adding. Their interface is very similar to
his Persistence::Object::Simple and Persistence::Database classes, and
would allow developers using those classes to start storing their
persistent objects in SQL databases with minimum changes to their
code.

Thanks

Ashish Gulhati
