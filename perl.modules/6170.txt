The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Image::Timeline
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Create GIF or PNG timelines
  userid:      KWILLIAMS (Ken Williams)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    (none)

  similar:
    (none)

  rationale:

    This is based on GD.pm, but fills a relatively small niche. I don't
    think anyone else has released anything else that does this, at
    least not that I could find. I put it in the Image:: namespace
    because when someone is looking for image-creation tools, they don't
    necessarily know to look in the GD:: namespace. If y'all feel
    strongly that it should be the other way, I don't mind changing.

The resulting entry would be:

Image::
::Timeline        bdpOp Create GIF or PNG timelines                  KWILLIAMS
