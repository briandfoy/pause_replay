Request to register new user

fullname: Chris Handwerker
  userid: CHANDWER
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://homebrewtechnology.org
     why:

    The module I wish to contribute can be found here:
    https://github.com/chandwer/Enterasys-NetSight

    I requested a user ID with the username "skunix" and noticed, on
    the email mirror, that I was granted the account however I never got
    an email with my password.

    I am assuming that I gave you an incorrect email address so here is
    a new application with a correct email address as well as a
    different username I would prefer over the last one I requested.

    Thanks, Chris
