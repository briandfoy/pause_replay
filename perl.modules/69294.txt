The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Form::Sensible
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Form UI module with multiple backends
  userid:      JAYK (Jay Kuri)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Mailing list, wiki.catalyzed.org

  similar:
    FormFu, HTML::Formhandler

  rationale:

    Form::Sensible is a module designed to provide a different way of
    interacting with Forms. Most Form related modules are specific to
    the interface, HTML, GUI, etc. Form sensible is intended to provide
    a framework for defining basic UI independent of how it is rendered.
    This, we feel, is a more sensible way of working with Forms, hence
    the name and the module.

    In Form::Sensible, Forms are defined in terms of the data that
    needs to be collected and then different renderer backends can
    present the request for information in a way that is appropriate for
    the interface type being used.

    Planned UI modules are: HTML (included) / Console (under
    development) / Telephone (soon to be under development) and
    eventually GUI (probably WxWidgets)

The resulting entry would be:

Form::
