Subject: Module submission Test::Fixme

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Fixme
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: check code for FIXMEs.
  userid:      EVDB (Edmund von der Burg)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    Devel::FIXME

  rationale:

    Test::Fixme provides a simple way to add a test file that checks
    for any 'FIXME's in the code and fails a test for every one it
    finds.

    The idea is that a developer can use a FIXME comment when coding
    and be sure that none have been forgotten when the module is tested.

    There is support for skipping the tests and for using different
    tags than FIXME which the user specifies.

  enteredon:   Tue May 17 16:15:43 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Fixme           Rdpfp check code for FIXMEs.                       EVDB
