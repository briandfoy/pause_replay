Hi,

I'm developing a set of classes that will allow easy access to the
Microsoft Live Framework set of webservices. The idea behind the Live
Framework is to provide a consistent, REST based, interface to the
full range of Live Services including Profile, Groups, Folders,
Contacts, Calendars, Photos and any custom data that developers add in
the future.

The only existing namespace that is related, is
"WebService::Windows::LiveID::Auth", which I can partly integrate
with.

WebService::Windows::Live::<Mesh/Calendar/etc.> starts to get long and
cumbersome, but is the most suitable - since it would allow for
WebService::Windows::Azure and others in future.

Additionally, is it even correct to label packages according to the
back end technology they are interacting with (WebService)? This would
allow for a namespace of simply Windows::Live::<> or even
WindowsLive::<>.

Thanks for any help you can provide, much appreciated!
