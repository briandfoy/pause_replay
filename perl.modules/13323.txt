Hi.

I've been doing some work recently on IRC and Jabber bots, and have
taken over maintenance and development of Bot::BasicBot from Mark
Fowler (MARKF). Since there are already one or two projects out there
based on this framework, I'm looking to tidy it up and release it
properly.

My details are as follows:

Name:	       Simon Batistoni
Email:	       simon@hitherto.net
Homepage:      http://hitherto.net
Preferred ID:  HITHERTO

Thanks,

Simon Batistoni
