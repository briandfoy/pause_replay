Greetings,

I am contacting you folks in an attempt to get a Perl module I am
developing on CPAN.  It is almost complete (devlopment V1.0).
Basically it is this, I installed the CGI::WML module with some
complaints, especially after having to get expat (XML parser)----this
was quite a hassle to a slacker like myself.  I'm writing a
'stoner-proof' module for WML (wireless markup language (subset of XML))
and with what I have so far, it's proven quite useful and easy to
use(note to self, I wrote it). But anyway, what I'm doing is trying to
follow in the footsteps of CGI.pm and make this very easy for all
concerned.  If you would be so kind as to allow me a login on PAUSE, I
would greatly appreciate it! I have no homepage visible to the outside
world, sorry.
A UID I would prefer to use is 'bhoran'.

I would like to refer to it as:
WAP::WML.0.1.tar.gz -- 'CGI and page(card) creation-Pure Perl'

DSLI = 'cdph'

There has not been much discussion on this at all, considering the
relative 'new-ness' of it.
If you folks are still hesitant, please get back to me and we can Cuss
and Discuss these things.
