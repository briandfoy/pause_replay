The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Baldrick
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: web app framework, cgi/mod_perl, user auth
  userid:      HUCKE (Matt Hucke)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://www.baldrickframework.org/

  rationale:

    The Baldrick Application Framework is a free and open-source
    library of Perl 5 modules to provide the functionality common to all
    non-trivial web applications: session management, URL-to-handler
    mapping, user loading, authentication and authorization, database
    querying, and template-based output generation.

    Baldrick currently consists of 22 modules.

    Baldrick was designed to be extensible and customizable, with the
    provided session, template processing, and user loader classes
    easily replaced with other classes (specified in a configuration
    file) that implement similar interfaces.

    Baldrick's focus is on making the user authentication, loading, and
    session tracking something that happens in the background.
    Application authors write request handlers -- subclasses of
    Baldrick::Dogsbody - that are dynamically loaded and invoked by the
    framework based on path mappings in a configuration file. When a
    request handler is invoked, the user is authenticated (or anonymous)
    and loaded, the configuration file parsed, the session initialised,
    the output template system ready - leaving the application authors
    free to concentrate on the business logic.

    NAMESPACE: Baldrick's modules are in the Baldrick::* namespace
    (Baldrick::App, Baldrick::Request, etc.). All Baldrick modules have
    the Baldrick:: prefix except for Baldrick.pm, a package that simply
    loads the other packages.

    I believe this is an appropriate namespace because the "Baldrick::"
    prefix is unlikely to conflict with any others, being a somewhat
    unusual name. As all classes within Baldrick are referred to with
    fully-qualified names (Baldrick::FileSession etc.), additional
    prefixes would result in increasingly unwieldy names.

    All future Baldrick library classes will be in the same namespace.

The resulting entry would be:

Baldrick          RdpOp web app framework, cgi/mod_perl, user auth   HUCKE
