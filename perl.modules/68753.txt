Given this is a showstopper bug that's forcing people to run patched
copies in production, it seems worth a point release to me.

If you're not using it anymore, *please* would you consider at least
granting co-maint on a temporary basis?

Catalyst is probably the largest downstream consumer of FCGI.pm these days
and t0m's the Catalyst 5.80 chainsaw delegate with responsibility for the
quality of the core dist - and our FastCGI engine is in the core dist.

So I'd really like to try having the most interested set of users working
to maintain and improve this code - if anything goes wrong with a release
you can rest assured we'll be told by our userbase extremely quickly.
