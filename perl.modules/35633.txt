Subject: Module submission List::MoreUtil

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       List::MoreUtil
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: More miscellaneous list utility functions
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.misc, RPI lily, coworkers

  similar:
    List::Util

  rationale:

    This module is a collection of useful list utility functions that
    I've developed over the years. Many have been useful to myself and
    to others in many ways.

    I have written to Graham Barr (maintainer of List::Util) and
    proposed that several of these be added to List::Util. He has
    declined, partly for reasons in the List::Util documentation (some
    of these functions are easy or even trivial to write), and some he
    felt simply didn't belong in List::Util.

    I have great respect for Graham Barr, and I respect his decision.
    However, I feel that these utilities really are useful, and ought to
    be made available to the Perl community in general. Some of the
    functions are simple on the inside, but the fact remains that they
    encapsulate useful functionality -- a wheel that does not need to be
    reinvented, and the interface makes it easy to read and use.

    For example, the any() function is three simple lines of code. But
    that doesn't change the fact that

    if (any {$_ == 5} @foo) # If any @foo is 5

    is clearer to read than

    my $test; $_ == 5 && ($test=1) foreach @foo; if ($test)

    or even

    if (grep {$_ == 5} @foo)

    Therefore, I respectfully request the module name List::MoreUtil.
    Thank you.

The resulting entry would be:
