Before I upload this to CPAN, I want to be sure I'm using a decent
module name.

Find the complete .pm file (sent with text/plain content-type header) at

    http://wickline.org/pause/CGI/SessionTicketCookie.pm

Also, Randal, since it's using your code and crediting you in several
places, have I done anything so silly that you would rather I *not*
upload it until fixed?


Two weeks of silence will be considered a "thumbs up" to upload. :)
