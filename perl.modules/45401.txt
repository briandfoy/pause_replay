Hello List,

I am looking at extending the functionality of the RPM::Specfile module 
to include loading of an existing specfile (and subpackage support, 
which is currently lacking).  After spending some time thinking about 
it, this could be placed in one of two places.

1) Modify existing RPM::Specfile to include subpackage support and 
loading/parsing of the spec file.

OR

2) Create a Parse::Specfile module that will allow for loading and 
parsing of the spec file.

 From my perspective it doesn't really matter.  I require this 
functionality for the RPM Development Environment 
(http://kaizen.macroelite.ca/rpmde2) and will be writing the necessary 
code regardless.  It would be nice to place it in a module so other 
people could benefit from it.

Any thoughts on appropriate namespace for this from the list?
