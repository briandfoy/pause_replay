Aha! This explains why several modules are "hidden" from PAUSE but
present on Search CPAN. A FAQ or a document just stating that would
be useful. If I may help..

As XSLoader is a core module that was CPAN-ized, I'm not really
supposed to modify it for gratuitous reasons. I took maintainership
of this module because nobody else wanted to :-)

I'll probably use that solution, as it's the one that need less
modifications: I'll just ship a generated XSLoader.pm with the
distribution and unlink it from Makefile.PL. Advantage being that
it doesn't touch any files being in core.


Thank you for your help
