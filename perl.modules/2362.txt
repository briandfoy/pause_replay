Description:

Primarily I am writing
security/encryption/steganography modules, all of
which are platform independent and require no
compiling and rely upon no external programs or
modules.  I am also working on a series of file
utility modules and a series of game modules.

The four modules that I currently have ready for
distribution are as follows:

Crypt::Beowulf (Rdpf)
An original, very fast encryption algorithm.

Crypt::Solitaire (Rdpf)
A simple encryption system, written by Bruce Schneier
(and based upon original perl code written by Ian
Goldberg) that is based upon a deck of cards.

Crypt::RC4 (Rdpf)
A perl implementation of the RC4 encryption algorithm.

Crypt::OTP (Rdpf)
An implementation of the One Time Pad encryption
method.
                     
All but the Crypt::OTP module have been listed with
Freshmeat.net for some time, and have been reasonably
popular, in terms of the number of downloads.  To
date, I have not received any feedback or comments
from users.

I believe I've covered all of the things listed on the
PAUSE page, but if I have forgotten anything or you
require additional information on anything, please let
me know.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Kurt Kincaid
