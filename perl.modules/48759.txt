Actually I agree, the problem is that I can't think of a better name
because I am rubbish at that part and I got no replies on
comp.lang.perl.modules.

I am open to suggestions (open call to anyone reading - suggestions to
comp.lang.perl.modules please) or I shall try again after I have come up
with something better.

Thanks for your kind reply,
Tim

inclined to say yes. 


But given all the others out there, do you think there might be an 
alternative that uses more specific terminology? 


That's not a criticism of the function of this module (god knows
there's 
enough otheres, and you've at least pleaded your case, which shows 
thought) just of the word "Framework".
