The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Pony::Object
  DSLIP:       Rdpp2
  description: tiny object system with privacy settings
  userid:      BUGOV (Георгий Бажуков)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:
    https://github.com/h15/pony-object

  similar:
    Moose Mo

  rationale:

    Hello!

    I was developed modules for my web-applications. It consists from
    database interfaces, web-forms (rendering, validation), etc. All of
    them uses base class Pony::Object and some more of Pony::* (locally
    I used Pony namespace). I can't imagine how to separate them or
    which base namespace I should use (Yes, I seen
    01modules.index.html). I plan to develope this set of modules, until
    it will not looks like high-level web-framework.

    I don't think, that renaming modules (in future) is good idea
    (perhaps I'm wrong).

    Current module set you can see here:
    https://github.com/h15/pony/tree/master/lib/Pony . Base module is
    here: https://github.com/h15/pony-object/tree/master/lib/Pony .

    Thank you!
