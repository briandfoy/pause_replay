ABOUT...

I am a co-author of the Games::Golf module, and would like access to able to upload new releases. 
A login would also be benefical for use with the RT.

You never know what I'll code... I'm young and free (also single ;), and must have plenty of
programming years ahead.  A typical geek (few non-computer geek friends), and a student with
stupid amounts of free time!

Greetings from Scotland.  Do you know Scotland != England?  Ever tasted haggis, or know what's in
it?  Or another question, drop an email in my inbox...

Thanks,

Jonathan Paton
