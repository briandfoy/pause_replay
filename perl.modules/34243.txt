The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Application::Pipeline
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Framework for Apps with Phases and Plugins
  userid:      HOWARS (Stephen Howard)
  chapterid:   20 (Control_Flow_Utilities)
  communities:
    CGI::Application Mail List, Module Review List

  similar:
    CGI::Application

  rationale:

    This module the superclass for WWW::Pipeline, a module intended to
    address several concerns brought up many times on the
    CGI::Application mailing list. It is intended as a near-identical
    replacement for C::A with some slight changes in terminology.
    Concerns it addresses:

    - Allowing easy access to service modules, such as CGI request
    parsing, session management, database handles, templating libraries,
    etc, without tightly coupling the application framework itself to a
    'preferred' module set. This is achieved through plugins.

    - Definition and management of a series of application phases that
    the program will go through to achieve its task. The ability to add
    tasks to these phases and specify whether they ought to occur at the
    beginning, middle, or end of that phase.
