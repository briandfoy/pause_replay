All,

I'm currently finishing up documentation on what will be my first  
publicly available Perl module, and I want to make sure that I'm  
using an appropriate namespace.

The module, which I tentatively named P2P::Transmission, offers a  
UNIX-socket based IPC interface to the Transmission BitTorrent client  
(http://www.transmissionbt.com).

Lots of Perl interfaces to other software create a new root namespace  
(i.e. Apache:: or Mysql::), but I don't want to use the  
Transmission:: namespace because of the collision possibility with  
theoretically possible modules such as Transmission::GearRatio. That  
said, the module doesn't implement an IPC:: or Net:: transport, so I  
decided to put this into P2P:: along with P2P::pDonkey (an eMule  
server).

Does anyone think this is a particularly good or bad idea? Any  
suggestions or advice would be appreciated.
