I was in the same spot when I uploaded my first distribution to CPAN. So
don't worry. I'd suggest the following steps:

a) Locally rename the module file.
b) Replace all occurrances of Fcntl_Lock with FcntlLock (Also in
Makefile.PL or Build.PL and related files. It's best to just grep for it.)
c) perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make dist
d) Upload the new distribution under the new name.

Now, e) depends on whether your module has been on CPAN for a longer
period of time or not. If it's been there for a while, removing it might
cause things to fail for users and we don't want that. If it's
relatively new, you can just delete it via pause.perl.org's "Delete
File" feature. If you'd rather not just delete it, you can do the following:

e1) Create a new distribution under the old name with a higher version
number than before.
e2) Put the word "DEPRECATED" prominently next to the module name (the
short description) and add a more elaborate deprecation warning which
points to the new name to the documentation and README.
e3) Upload the new deprecated distribution along with the actual new one.
e4) Delete the (very) old one.

In your case, it's probably sufficient to just delete the old
distribution and upload the one with the new name.

I have just registered the new namespace for you.

Best regards,
Steffen
