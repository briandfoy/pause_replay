The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Fusker
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Implementation of the Fusker URL syntax.
  userid:      SAINTMARK (Justin Michael Bauman)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    #perl on irc.perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Fusker is quickly becoming a major concept in content discovery on
    the World Wide Web. It began as an open source project, which was
    unfortunately abandoned with very few copies of the code made
    available. The heart of fusker is a simple syntax for embedding
    ranges in URLs which can then be expanded to create a list of
    similar URLs. Currently only a commercial, closed-source
    implementation of this concept and syntax exists. I wish to return
    fusker to the masses and to it's beginnings as a completely free
    implementation, both financially and intellectually. The URL syntax
    itself is very simple, however, used properly it provides a powerful
    method of exchanging a large number of pointers to documents on the
    web in a single URL. I want to use this namespace to provide an
    efficient implementation of the concepts involved, creating and
    expanding these URLs. As well as other future syntaxes related in
    concept. Also I would like to provide implementations of this
    concept both as a web program as well as examples of use in other
    applications.

The resulting entry would be:
