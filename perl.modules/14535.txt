The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Glob::Automount
  DSLIP:       bdpha
  description: Robust yet fast file globbing across autofs
  userid:      BBB (Rob Brown)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    [CVS]
    Root=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.roobik.com.:/usr/local/cvsroot/freeware
    Repositoy=File-Glob-Automount

  similar:
    File::Glob

  rationale:

    This module combines File::Glob::bsd_glob and Unix::ConfigFile's
    Unix::AutomountFile and Net::Ping to allow perl globbing to "work"
    across nodes within an automounted directory.

    1) Compatible with regular glob in that it behaves identically when
    globbing through directory structures that don't involve autofs
    partitions. (import ':globally' is safe.)

    2) Avoids the problem of getting empty or missing matches from a
    glob within a automounted directory when that mount point happens to
    be gone (off, down, or just timed out). Also fixes the opendir on
    such automount nodes.

    3) Avoids that very nasty "10 minute choke" or kernel lock that
    prevents you from being able to "kill -9" a process that accidently
    attempted to resolve a path or node whose root path contains an
    automount to a remote box that is offline or suddenly unreachable
    from the client box.

    4) Uses syncronous tcp SYN packets to detect remote reachability in
    order to achieve parallel timeouts for multiple down or inaccessible
    mount points to assist in determining the maximum availability
    statuses in the minimum amount of real time.

    This is already being using heavily in production. I just removed
    the proprietary stuff to donate this for the benefit of the open
    source comunity.

The resulting entry would be:

File::Glob::
