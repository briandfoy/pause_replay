Hi guys,

I tried to contact Hans in several ways including a recent use.perl.org pos=
ts
with no response either on use.perl.org or from the Dutch Perl mailing
list people
nor any sign from Hans himself.

Maybe you can also try to contact him and/or hand over co-maintenance to
me. (SZABGAB)

regards
  Gabor

Subject: Maintenance of Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate
HiTo: < <haje@toneel.demon.nl>


Hi Hans,

I was trying to use Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate for highlighting some o=
f
the files in Padre, the Perl IDE. I quickly encountered a bug that was repo=
rted
to RT a long time ago but as I can see you did not have time to upload a fi=
x.

I wonder if you could give maintainership of the package to me.
I'd put it in the repository of Padre where there are several developers wh=
o'll
be able to improve things and then I could upload fixes to CPAN.

Once you have more time you can take back the maintainership.

If you agree, please login to PAUSE and set me (SZABGAB) a
co-maintainer of all he files in the Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate
namespace.

regards
=A0 Gabor
