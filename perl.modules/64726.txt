The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Tournament::TableTennis
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Running table tennis tournaments
  userid:      MYRTSCHT (Richard Möhn)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    git://git.tuxfamily.org/gitroot/myrtsch/progrel.git

  similar:
    Games::Tournament::RoundRobin

  rationale:

    Since this module is created to be used for running tournaments
    (primarily for table tennis ones, but I will try to make it
    independent), I think the namespace is appropriate.

    The module is primarily designed to serve as a function container
    for the program "myrtscht" (included in the distribution), but there
    are also two functions that may be of common use.

    This module makes use of the Games::Tournament::RoundRobin module
    in order to compute the pairings of the participants.

  enteredby:   MYRTSCHT (Richard Möhn)
  enteredon:   Sun Mar  1 10:24:42 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Tournament::
::TableTennis     adpfp Running table tennis tournaments             MYRTSCHT
