Hey there.

First, the basics..

Name: Jason Leane
E-mail: alphamethyl@mac.com
Homepage: (server having 'difficulties' right now)
Preferred User ID: DRG

And what I'm planning to contribute... well, my first offering was going to
be a miscellaneous sorta module i've been working on, that takes care of a
lot of math functions just outside perl but not quite warranting POSIX, as
well as some commonplace network functions like DNS resolving, sending
e-mail, etc, without the user having to learn how to use a new module
interface for each of those.  I'm also planning on porting as many modules
as I can to Mac OS X (although I develop mostly on Mandrake, I use X a lot
and want to help make it easier to use).

Thanks for your consideration.
j
