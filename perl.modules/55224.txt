     why:

    A small collection of modules which together comprise a unix
    process management daemon I implemented while in my current position
    at a bank.

    In order for them to agree to open source this code, one
    requirement is that it is provided through CPAN.

    The system goes beyond the basic init.d style functions providing
    inittab and cron like features, along with email notification and
    monitoring and functionality to interface with tivoli watchdog
    monitoring.

    The main part of the code is an extensible case object that runs,
    controls and monitors the process instance, derived classes are also
    included in the package, each tailored to running certain tasks.
