The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       WWW::URLToys
  DSLIP:       adpfb
  description: Find links in HTML, download them to files
  userid:      JDRAGO (Joe Drago)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://urltoys.com/

  similar:

  rationale:

    URLToys is already a regular standalone program with a small
    community (urltoys.com), but as I rewrite the majority of the code,
    I'm moving the core portion to a Perl module for others to use.

    The choices were between Net::URLToys, HTTP::URLToys, and
    WWW::URLToys, since its a module that uses LWP to get HTML, parse
    it, and download files. Net:: seemed a little too generic, and
    HTTP:: seemed too specific (in case this supports FTP in the
    future). So since this intended to be used alongside of a browser,
    WWW::URLToys is the most appropriate name, IMO.

  enteredby:   JDRAGO (Joe Drago)
  enteredon:   Fri May  7 06:26:21 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

WWW::
::URLToys         adpfb Find links in HTML, download them to files   JDRAGO
