My name is Byrne Reese (byrne@majordojo.com) - I am the primary owner of the
SOAP::MIME module and a co-maintainer of the SOAP::Lite module. I am trying
to get the latest version of SOAP::Lite (v0.60) indexed and listed among the
modules here:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/SOAP/

But I can't seem to do so. I have uploaded the module and it is listed among
MY modules:

http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/SOAP/BYRNE/SOAP/SOAP-Lite-0.60.(tar.gz
|readme)

How do I get it added among the other SOAP-Lite releases?

I am guessing that it has something to do with permissions, because when I
click on "View Permissions" - it says "Sorry, there are no modules
registered belonging to BYRNE. Please note, only modules that are already
registered in the module list can be edited here. If you believe, this is a
bug, please contact modules@perl.org."

But that is certainly in error.

Help!
