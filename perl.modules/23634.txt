From: Philip.Newton@gmx.net ("Philip Newton")

Hello, I just wanted to upload two of my modules to CPAN. For one of 
them, I accidentally clicked on someone else's module instead.

That module is "Log-Log4perl-0.37.tar.gz [161253b; MSCHILLI, PNE]"

It should not belong to me (presumably it should belong to MSCHILLI 
only). Can you fix this for me, please? Do I have to do something? (For 
example, delete it from my CPAN directory?)

Apologies.

Cheers,
Philip
