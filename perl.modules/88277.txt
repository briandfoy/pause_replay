     why:

    My first contribution will be a module to segment text by using
    rules defined in a SRX file (SRX is a common XML format used by the
    translation tool industry). Segmentation refers to the process of
    organizing text into meaningful units. For example, you may want to
    segment unstructured text into an array of paragraphs, sentences, or
    words. I hope to submit other modules related to natural language
    processing.
