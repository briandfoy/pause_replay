Please watch your incoming mail after an upload. Reasons for failing
indexing are explained in a mail that is sent within an hour after the
upload. Coming one year later and asking is a *bit* late.

But the case is not lost. Go to PAUSE and click on 'Force Reindexing'.
There you can request a new indexer run for every single file you own
and you will get a new mail with the indexing report.

You can also scroll down the page you're citing above and you'll find
the obstacles:

  Gantry::Plugins::Static
  Gantry::Stash
  Gantry::Stash::Controller
  Gantry::Stash::View
  Gantry::Stash::View::Form

And you can look up those packages in CPAN/modules/06perms.txt and find

Gantry::Plugins::Static,PHILCROW,f
Gantry::Stash,PHILCROW,f
Gantry::Stash::Controller,PHILCROW,f
Gantry::Stash::View,PHILCROW,f
Gantry::Stash::View::Form,PHILCROW,f

Which shows me that the owner, PHILCROW, did not give you
co-maintainer status on these 5 modules. So you better get these
permissions and then do the re-indexing and then the "Unauthorized"
flags will go away.

Let me know if you need further assistance, Regards,
