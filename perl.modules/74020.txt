okay, i've browsed a little the "World Wide Web" list and i think the "CGI::" namespace would fitt better, right? First i though for "WWW::" but it seems to me that the most modules under this namespace are not for CGI/PSGI/FCGI and so on.

So what do you think about CGI::Route? CGI::Application::... is already taken for the complete Webframework.

Thank you and have a nice day.

Jan

p.s. i hope that webmailer will do the lineendings right...
