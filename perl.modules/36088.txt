Hi Christian, hi Maciej.

First of all, thanks for pointing this out, Christian :-) Duplicated
efforts really are a relatively big problem on the CPAN.

I had no idea somebody else was working on the subject. But yes, I think
unifying efforts is a good thing.

Which is a bit limited, not to mention unmaintained, which was part of
the reason why Lingua::Identify was started (there were other tools too,
but none of them were suitable for everything we wanted to do in our
project)

I would really like that to be Lingua::Identify, but that's just my
opinion O:-) Anyway, it's what I'm trying to do.

That would be great, of course, but if you do that we should talk about
it, in order not to be working on the same things (Lingua::Identify is
having a new version every other day; there was one today, albeit with
few changes in it)

Yes, I was noticing that, but also note that Lingua::Identify is a bit
unfinished, I'm still working on it and I have quite a "to do list" for
it (it's actually bigger than the one in the module).

I haven't had time to look at your module either, so I really don't know
what its strong points are.

Those would be questions better answered by somebody else rather than
me... anyone?

Likewise, :-)
