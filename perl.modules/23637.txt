OK, perhaps I should have entered something for a rationale.

This module lets you sort according to Klingon collation order. Some
Klingon letters are represented, in the conventional orthography, with
multi-letter graphemes(?) such as 'ng'. This is a letter of its own,
coming after 'n'; hence, 'ngan' sorts properly after 'nob' since 'ng' gt
'n'.

This module implements strcoll() and strxfrm() which are similar in
spirit to the C functions of the same name -- strcoll() is basically a
Klingon-aware version of strcmp() and strxfrm() can be used to
pre-process Klingon words into tokens which sort correctly if compared
with strcmp() (or Perl's "cmp" operator). The module also has a
strunxfrm() function which will reverse that transformation, since it's
lossless.

I picked "Collate" since the module's main purpose is to assist with
sorting or collation.

Cheers,
Philip
