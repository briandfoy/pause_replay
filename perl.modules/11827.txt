Win32-CtrlGUI-0.30 has been released.  Win32-CtrlGUI is a system for doing
GUI control based.  It uses Win32::Setupsup for the low level operations,
but adds a user-friendly (or friendlier) OO interface.  In addition to the
OO interface, there is an OO flow-control system that allows normal
flow-control constructs (looping, if-then-else, sequences, etc.) to be
constructed and executed.  There is a Tk debugger/observer that allows these
sequences to be observed as they execute.

The major changes since 0.21 are to provide support for interrogating list
and combo box widgets.  This support requires Win32::API and uses Win32 API
calls to send messages to the widgets.  It is not hyper-friendly, but it
does work!  It allows the user to query the widgets for the list of entries,
determine which entry or entries are selected, and to select an entry or
entries.
