The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Speedometer
  DSLIP:       Sdpfp
  description: It's an Easy interface to the Benchmark.pm.
  userid:      KPAWAR (Kiran Rajendrasa Pawar)
  chapterid:   8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Perl groups on LinkedIn.

  similar:
    Benchmark module is there, but this Speedometer is an easy interface
    to the Benchmark module to compare the performance of two Perl
    files. while Benchmark doesn't allow you to use Perl files directly
    this module does. All people have to use only one method i.e
    speedometer("file1","file2",optional paramater) . This module
    specifically works for comparison of the performance of two Perl
    files.

  rationale:

    I have given name Speedometer, as this module compare the
    performance of two Perl files. it is the Benchmark module who does
    the job in the Background.

    But Benchmark module doesn't allow to use Perl files directly as
    Speedometer.pm does. so this is an Easy interface to the Benchmark
    module.

The resulting entry would be:

Speedometer       Sdpfp It's an Easy interface to the Benchmark.pm.  KPAWAR
