I officially registered Net:STOMP two weeks ago (see
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2010-02/msg00012.html).

Although the co-existence of both modules (Net:STOMP and Net:Stomp) is
fine in most environments, it is problematic in others (e.g. Debian).
Some CPAN tools even break on this, for instance:
 - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Net-STOMP
   -> shows "Active bugs for Net-Stomp"
 - http://www.cpantesters.org/distro/N/Net-STOMP.html
   -> also includes Net::Stomp information

Fortunately, the Net:Stomp owner (Léon Brocard) kindly gave me
maintainership of the Net::Stomp namespace on CPAN so this problem is
being solved. Given the API difference, my preference is to mark
Net::Stomp as obsolete and keep only Net::STOMP in the future.

However, to prevent future problems, it would probably help to clearly
document that package names must be different in a case insensitive
way. It would also be good if PAUSE tools could detect/block such name
conflicts.

Cheers,

Lionel Cons
