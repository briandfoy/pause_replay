The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Debug::Fork::Tmux
  DSLIP:       bdppb
  description: Makes fork() in debugger to open a new Tmux
  userid:      VERESC (Peter Vereshagin)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://bugs.vereshagin.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Perl's standard debugger perl5db.pl requires pseudo-terminal
    device to debug the code where the fork() built-inm use to be found.

    Typically the problem solution is about an xterm, the X11 client.

    But it's a rare case when X11 is to be present/found on a server no
    matter if it's a development, test or a production one. Trivially
    it's not recommended to keep X11 or any kind of a GUI on a server
    except the cases when it is required for a particular task the
    server itself is running for.

    So the pseudo-terminal device isn't much about GUIs by its nature
    so the problem behind the bars of the perl5db.pl report ( see more
    detailed problem description at the PerlMonks thread ) is the
    consoles management. It's a kind of a tricky, for example, to start
    the next ssh session initiated from the machine serving as an sshd
    server for the existing session. Thus we kind of have to give a
    chance to the consoles management with a software capable to run on
    a server machine without as much dependencies as an xterm. This
    module is a try to pick the Tmux windows manager for such a task.
