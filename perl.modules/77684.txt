Hello,

I'm not sure who I should contact about this, but here goes:

I'm the I.T. Manager for Dyer & Associates, P.C. One of our former
employees posted some code to CPAN a while ago and this code contained
some sensitive data that belongs to some of our clients. Specifically,
these files:

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.11/t/problemdocs/problemdyerfile.pdf

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.12/t/problemdocs/problemdyerfile.pdf

http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/LEOCHARRE/PDF-OCR2-1.11/t/leodocs/tuition.pdf

The name of the employee in question is Leo Charre; I haven't been able
to contact him so I'm hoping that someone at cpan will be able to help
us get this file (and any others containing sensitive info) removed.

Please let me know what you can do to help us.

Thanks!
