I'd like to announce a new module for inclusion in the module list (it has
not been uploaded yet but that's just a matter of time ;^>

Name      DLSI Description
PApp::SQL Mmcr absolutely easy yet fast and powerful sql access

("M" because it is indeed well-tested for many years ;)

Rationale for selecting this (uncommon) name: This module is part of the
PApp module family, which suffers from a free-but-not-so-free license ;)
The biggest problem, however, is that PApp is a big monster module which
nobody wants to install just to get the SQL library contained in it.

Since PApp::SQL is so small and useful on its own, I now outsource it
using a free license, which makes it mucher easier to use it without the
full PApp module.

The biggest barrier that kept me from releasing it was that I didn't
want to release it under that name, but something more correct like
"DBIx::EzSQL".  However, there is a large body of code already using this
module and DBIx::EzSQL is the most ugly module name I saw in my life, so I
want to keep the name.

TIA,
