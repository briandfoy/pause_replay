Hallo,

I have caused a little bother here and apologise. I have just applied
for a new PAUSE account as I had lost the credentials for my old, but
unused, CPAN account. Reading further through the PAUSE pages I found a
link to the authors' whois page which listed my name, along with what
turned out to be my userid valid for requesting a password reset.

I have now logged in and will be uploading some stuff in due course.

Please cancel my request earlier today for a new account.

Again, my apologies.
