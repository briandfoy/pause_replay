Let's put aside the identity of the person for the moment.  Earlier you
said:

Perhaps you could elaborate more on your thoughts about the *role* of the
maintainer after the handover: what you see that person doing, what kinds
of decisions you think they will face, and so on.   Also, elaborate on your
criteria for a maintainer: what went into your selection process?

Remember, we're most interested in seeing your articulate what the DBIC
community can expect for the future.  The specific person is merely a
mechanism for that decision.

As for raising this in other forums, please show me where to join and start
the thread.  I'm happy to join and facilitate in whatever public forum you
think best to gauge community sentiment about the specifics of your plans.

Regards,
David
