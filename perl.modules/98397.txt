Request to register new user

fullname: Ayhan ULUSOY
  userid: TABULO
    mail: CENSORED

     why:

    Hi, This request is actually part of the process for changing my
    current pause id under which I have several modules. (BTW, if there
    is a way to this directly, I am all for it).

    There are a few reasons for wanting the id change which I won't
    dwell into here, but I can say that they mostly boil down to my
    reluctance of naming modules that contain an ID which closely
    matches my name; like most of the author-specific modules under
    <Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::*> and the like.

    I am aware that I do not have to follow those conventions, but that
    basically means more pollution.

    BTW, now that I am -finally- transitioning to dzil, I should be
    able to upload more stuff to CPAN; perhaps including some recent
    experiments related to <Moxie>, <MOP>, and <UNIVERSAL::Object>.

    Once the new ID is there, I intend to fan out the existing account
    by transferring the ownership of the existing modules to the new.

    Cheers!
