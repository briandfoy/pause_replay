pong?

Were you expecting a reply? Come *on* -- this was
blackhole^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hmodules@perl.org you sent the message to!
Where messages disappear in a space/time warp and pop up again three to
twenty weeks in the future!

Seriously, though; whom did you expect to reply? As for me, I feel
honoured and slightly scared[1] by the prospect. But since you also said

, I think you (also?) wanted someone who actually has the power to
decide such things to comment.

Cheers,
Philip

[1] Mostly because my CFT pool is not that much bigger than anyone
else's, and because I'm not really up on the case law here besides the
little bits and pieces that you pick up -- e.g. "Don't start a new
top-level namespace without good justification".
