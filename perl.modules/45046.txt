The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DB::Table
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Base class for relational table definitions.
  userid:      KITE (Bradley Derek Kite)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Not Yet, but email me bradley-cpan@kitefamily.co.uk

  similar:
    DBIx::Table

  rationale:

    DB::Table is a module which is to be used as a base-class for
    providing an interface to database table meta information, without
    being tied to a particular database.

    Its strict realm is the definition of tables (columns, data-types,
    sizes etc). It does not access the database, allow you to
    select/count on from the DB,or any thing else.

    DBIx::Table already exists, I am aware, however, it does not
    support all of the constructs that I wish to use and appears to be
    tied to a particular database (MySQL).

    I also plan to register DB::Table::Row which works with DB::Table
    in order to provide a database interface similar to ActiveRecord
    from the Ruby world.

The resulting entry would be:

DB::
::Table           adpOp Base class for relational table definitions. KITE
