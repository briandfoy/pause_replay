The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Sequence
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Perl extension dealing with mathematic seque
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Math::Symbolic

  rationale:

    Math::Sequence defines a class for simple mathematic sequences with
    a recursive definition such as "x_(n+1) = 1 / (x_n + 1)".

    Math::Sequence uses Math::Symbolic to parse and modify the
    recursive sequence definitions.

    Each Math::Sequence object is an iterator to iterate over the
    elements of the sequence starting at the first element (which was
    specified by the starting element, the second argument to the new()
    constructor). It offers facilities to cache all calculated elements
    and access any element directly.

    I am planning to write/release a more flexible module to deal with
    mathematically more complex sequences that can, for example access
    all previous sequence elements symbolically and defined any number
    of fixed (starting) elements. That module will extend (isa)
    Math::Sequence and will probably be called
    Math::Sequence::[Something]. Suggestions welcome.

The resulting entry would be:
