The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Kephra
  DSLIP:       bdphg
  description: crossplatform GUI Perl-Editor
  userid:      LICHTKIND (Herbert Breunung)
  chapterid:   25 (Bundles)
  communities:
    RT, http://sourceforge.net/projects/kephra ,
    http://board.perl-community.de/board/17/

  similar:
    Text::Editor::Vip

  rationale:

    I develop this "pure-Perl cross-platform CPAN-installable
    programmer's editor for multiple languages, designed along Perl's
    Paradigms" for 3 years and use it on the daily basis. now that I
    found a good name, the sources are consideraly clean and I'm
    preparing it to be CPAN installable (with lot help from ADAMK) its
    time to move here. If you want to know what the name means look at:
    http://kephra.sourceforge.net/site/en/home_news.shtml

    Now its a real good Text editor with stuff like file sessions,
    bookmarks, searchbar, lots of formating functions, line editing,
    autindention, bracehighlighting, bracenavigation, recent files menu,
    templates menu and lots of little usefull things. its very
    customizable, all menus and bars can easy manipulated throug yaml
    files, help and configs reachable through menu but config dialog is
    also on the way.

    Beside some technical problems (with recent WxPerl versions and
    internal local changing) the real thing is, that after the next
    major version, that most likely will come this yoear or closely
    after, there will be an plugin API and there are some folks wanting
    to write plugins(speak Kephra Moduls) and plug in things like PPI,
    PerlTidy and other things and it has the potential to become an
    vital part of the perl community.

The resulting entry would be:
