     why:

    Dear CPAN,

    My name is Son Nguyen. I'm a Software Engineer and I have been
    working on some projects used Perl. Now, I'm studying Plack toolkit
    and Catalyst framework.

    In the next time, I have intention to develop some useful Perl
    Modules. In addition, I want to contribute to Plack toolkit.
    These're why I would like to register PAUSE ID. Please help to
    create PAUSE ID for me.

    Thank you in advance! Son Nguyen
