The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::ConvexHull
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: Calculate convex hulls using Graham's scan
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module implements an algorithm that calculates the convex hull
    of a set of points. Alternative module names would be
    Algorithm::ConvexHull, Algorithm::GrahamsScan, Math::GrahamsScan.
    (Since Graham's Scan is the algorithm used.)

    As with many modules in Math::, this could equally well go to
    Algorithm::. I generally choose names for modules according to what
    they do. If the name of the algorithm is vital to the understanding
    of the module's purpose, I'd use Algorithm::[AlgoName]. Otherwise I
    rather use [Algorithm|Math]::[WhatThisModuleDoes]. This is an
    example of the latter naming scheme.

    The module's been on CPAN since the end of 2003, so I'd rather not
    change the name, but if I released it today, I'd place it in the
    Algorithm:: hierarchy. So I'm open for suggestions whether
    continuity or more appropriate hierarchy is more important in this
    case.

    (By the way, you missed one of my registrations. For
    Math::SymbolicX::Inline.
