The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::ApacheExtended
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Extended Apache Format config file parser
  userid:      MGRUBB (Michael Grubb)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    Apache::ConfigFile Apache::ConfigParser Config::ApacheFormat

  rationale:

    I first attempted to integrate my additions to Apache::ConfigFile,
    however the author of that module was attempting to merge, with
    Config::ApacheFormat, so I ported my changes (i.e. rewrote) to fit
    with Config::ApacheFormat. However, the author of
    Config::ApacheFormat was unwilling to accept the patches that added
    some extensions to the Apache config syntax. Apache::ConfigParser,
    did not fit my needs as it only parses Apache config files. Thus
    Config::ApacheExtended was born. I chose Config::ApacheExtended
    because, this module deals with configuration, and it handles files
    that are Extensions of the apache format. (I thought of
    Config::ApacheFormat::Extended, but I did not want to appear as
    though the Config::ApacheFormat and My module were related. (For
    several reasons, one being they are architecturally very different))
    I am of course open to better suited names.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
::ApacheExtended  bdpOp Extended Apache Format config file parser    MGRUBB
