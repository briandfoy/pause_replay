Although ISP use RADIUS, wouldn't this also be useful to people using
RADIUS in an enterprise setting? I don't see the ISP being the
attraction in the name. If people need to use a RADIUS module, they are
going to search for RADIUS. 

Since this is also specifically for FreeRADIUS, should the name just be
FreeRADIUS? 

If you want to build a Task:* or Bundle::* for ISPs, that's a different
thing. The building blocks, however, can stand on their own.
