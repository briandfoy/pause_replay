They all failed the same way. Only the subject line is now a bit
clearer.

You do not understand what the sentence means? It's about clobbering
the current working directory. If a user unpacks your zipfile anywhere
in the filesystem, he gets more files into the current directory than
necessary. One entry should be enough. If you want to be polite to
your users, you use 'make dist' and they can rely on the fact that
their working directory gets one, exactly one new entry for a
directory that is named like the file they unpack, just he
suffix stripped off.
