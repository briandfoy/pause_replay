The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SVN::Diff
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Extract Diffs from a subversion server
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Same idea as SVN::Log except with svn's diff command.

    There is SVN::Web::Diff but its part of the SVN web interface and
    I'd rather have a way to get the diff into a string to do with as
    need be in any project (not just an SVN::Web based site to view
    diff's) and all consistent with SVN's API.

    my $diff = SVN::Diff::retrieve($repos_url, $rev_a, $rev_b);

    my $diff = SVN::Diff::retrieve_as_html($repos_url, $rev_a, $rev_b[,
    $syntax_highlighter_config]);

    Thanks!
