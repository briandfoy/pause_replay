Subject: GraphViz::Data::Structure-0.05 ready

From: mcmahon@ibiblio.org (Joe McMahon)

The first public release (0.05) of GraphViz;:Data::Structure is now 
ready. It provides a class which can accurately and elegantly visualize 
a Perl data structure using GraphViz.

  # Visualise a structure and make a PNG graphic.
  GraphViz::Data::Strucure->new($structure)->graph->as_png;

You can select the colors you want to use for each data type, and all 
items are printed in
strict left-to-right order (arrays in increasing index order, hashes in 
alpahbetically-sorted
key order). GraphViz::Data::Structure automatically labels blessed items 
with their fully-qualified name, and can even discover CODE reference 
names and handle globs.

The only problem I have at present is detecting when a reference points 
to an array or hash element; I still see these only as scalar references.

Any suggestions as to anything else needed before it's uploaded to CPAN 
greatly appreciated.
