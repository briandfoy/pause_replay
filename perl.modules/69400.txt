The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Config::Strict
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Add strict typing to config management
  userid:      BLAKEW (Blake Willmarth)
  chapterid:   12 (Opt_Arg_Param_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Among the many ways to load and write configuration files I hadn't
    found one that struck a balance between being human-editable and
    having strict typing. After being encumbered with validation hell on
    a recent project I believe I've made a general enough way to merge
    configuration data with a strict-typing system to release a module.
    It borrows heavily from from Declare::Constraints::Simple (DCS) to
    assign code profiles to configuration parameters in a simple and
    flexible way. You can easily define your own constraints or stick
    with the defaults.

    In sum, Config::Strict is intended to streamline DCS integration
    with any configuration module that loads/writes configuration data.
    It also uses features in Moose to make it slightly more
    customizable.

The resulting entry would be:

Config::
