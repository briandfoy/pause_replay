The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SQL::SqlObject
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Simple OO DBI Wrapper
  userid:      CORWIN (Corwin Brust)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    efnet #perlhelp

  similar:
    DBI

  rationale:

    This module is really blotware, but it does make SQL interaction
    using DBI very simple.

    It putports to supply a simple interface which (with the use of the
    right driver wrapper) talk to most databases without code in
    dependant objects and scripts.

    Particularly handy, in the openion of the author, is
    cond_insert_select() which inserts a row into a table if it is not
    already there, and returns a given field, in any case.

    It was been sucessfully tested under RH Linux 5, 7.1 and under
    Windows 2000 Server. Included are two 'sample' subclasses one for
    DBD::Pg and one for ODBC. I intened to supply DQL::SqlObject::Sybase
    and SQL::SqlObject::SQLite, but I wanted to get the ball rolling
    ASAP to increase the odds that the next release will have any
    bugfixes necessary, we well as those additional wrappers

The resulting entry would be:

SQL::
::SqlObject       bdpOp Simple OO DBI Wrapper                        CORWIN
