The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DPKG::WebInfo
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Generates a webpage for a Debian package
  userid:      BUREADO (José Miguel Parrella Romero)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://debian.bureado.com.ve/ and briefly in QA/CM discussions in
    Debian

  similar:

  rationale:

    DPKG seems to fit the objective of this module. Some people argue
    that the Debian:: namespace is cleaner, and others might say that
    APT:: namespace is the correct one. Anyway, seems like DPKG:: is the
    stablished namespace in CPAN and people should stick to that at
    least by now. DPKG::WebInfo seems a good name since it provides
    methods to build webpages with information for Debian Packages.
    Current situation in Debian has contributed to a great number of
    developers in the need of someone who uploads their packages. This
    relationship needs to be standarized providing uniform ways to check
    the work of the sponsored developer. WebInfo has been tried by me
    and two sponsors for a while now, and seems to be improving
    communication between us (who hardly speak a common language), thus
    the utility of making it a Perl module. Also, there has been
    interest in building a complete list of packages using this module
    for localized distributions in Latin America.

The resulting entry would be:

DPKG::
