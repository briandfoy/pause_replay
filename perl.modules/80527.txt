     why:

    I am planning to contribute the SCSI protocol based error injecting
    tools like medium and parity error injecting tools. and also the
    Perl Performance profiling tools which helps to understand the
    bottle necks of a perl based application and many more .

    Tools that are helpful to analyse and report the performance of the
    VDS{Volume disk service}/VSS{Volume Shadow service} services
    provided by Microsoft .
