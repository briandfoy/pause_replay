I am VERESC @ CPAN.
I want to take over the Apache::Fake module.
The current maintainer is agree but too busy to do it by own.
Is it possible to take over module in such a situation?

I created a ticket about that and it's public:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=65086
SHopuld I initiate public discussion any other way? The http://use.perl.org is
down read-only for several months already...
