     why:

    Yesterday I went to a Perl Workshop where Brian De Foy and Larry
    Wall explained everything about CPAN and Perl 6. I'm a Java
    developer and wrote tap4j, now I am practicing Perl, specially with
    Test::More and would like to share my programs with other authors.
    Thank you in advance!
