     why:

    I'm thinking of quitting my full time job (PHP sadly) and start
    working with another language. Because Perl is one of the
    possibilities I'd like to explore having a PAUSE account would be a
    great way to learn how to work with CPAN and get a decent portfolio
    rocking. And of course people hopefully find the code useful and
    save themselves from re-inventing another wheel.
