Hmm.. Maybe Module::API is not the best name, but I'm slightly stumped
as to what would be better. Here are my thoughts:

What it does:
  The module lets you easily create ways for other code to access your
functionality, be that in the same process or over a network. In a
sense it is like an RPC. It deals with all the encoding of the data
and transporting it back and forth. It has some basic support for
session tokens so that state can be maintained. It also defines how
plugins should be written to process the actual API calls.

How it does it:
  Encoding is done via plugins, so if you don't like the ones provided
you can easily create your own. Transport is done internally if no
server is specified, or by HTTP requests (both blocking and
non-blocking). Once the request has been recieved another set of
plugins are searched through to find one that can handle the request
and the response is then returned.

Audience:
  The target audience for this module are developers. On its own the
module can do very little. Once it has been use as a base class though
it pretty much instantly lets you start writing the plugins to process
the requests.

Keywords:
  Client/Server, API, RPC

I think that the 'Module::*' namespace is correct. As to what it could
be called in that namespace I though 'API' was the simplest and so
went with that.

Any suggestions welcome, this initial release
(http://search.cpan.org/~evdb/Module-API-0.01/) is meant to shake out
problems like these.

Cheers,
  Edmund.

PS. I take it that once a name has been decided on I resubmit a
request for it on pause.perl.org?
