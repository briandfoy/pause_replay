From: mshelor@comcast.net (Mark Shelor)

I'm currently awaiting a response to my registration request for 
namespace (Digest::SHA).  The request included a rationale as well as 
pointers to discussions that took place on the comp.lang.perl.modules 
group.  This is my first module, so I'm not quite sure how things 
proceed at this point.  Assuming the request is approved, does the 
system automatically upload the module to server, or do I need to take 
further action(s)?

Thanks for your help.

Regards, Mark
