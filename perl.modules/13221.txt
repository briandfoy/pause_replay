The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::Commonwealth
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: A web-banking front-end
  userid:      DDICK (David Dick)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    http://melbourne.pm.org

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB

  rationale:

    The Module will provide an abstraction layer to allow programmers
    to focus on checking accounts, transferring money and paying bills
    without having to worry about the http requests that their actions
    require. There is nothing out there at the moment that does all
    this, but the closest is Simon Cozens' Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB, so
    I followed the existing namespace rules as close as possible.

  enteredon:   Thu Aug 15 09:30:13 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::
::Commonwealth    bdpOp A web-banking front-end                      DDICK
