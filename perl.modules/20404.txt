<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>90% of all sickness and =
disease 
  begins in an unclean Colon!</b></font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since "<b><font color=3D"#0=
06600">Death 
  begins in the colon</font></b>," your nutritional program should begin w=
ith 
  a good colon cleansing program.</font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Toxins and waste build up i=
n your 
  colon just like they do in the pipes of your home. Both demand immediate=
 attention 
  or the results can be disastrous!</font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No wonder <font color=3D"#=
FF0033">Colon 
  cancer is second only to lung cancer in terms of cancer deaths in the U.=
S., 
  claiming the lives of nearly 50,000 men and women annually</font>.</font=
></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your colon is one of the la=
rgest 
  muscles in your body and should be exercised regularly. Of course, physi=
cal 
  exercise is beneficial for the colon, but water and fiber is even MORE i=
mportant.</font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fiber is a bulking agent th=
at gives 
  the colon the resistance it needs in order to remain firm and active. If=
 the 
  colon is inactive, it will soon grow weak, just like any other muscle.</=
font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Colon inactivity may hinder=
 the movement 
  of waste material along the intestinal track to be eliminated from the b=
ody. 
  Eventually, this waste material builds up along the colon walls and prev=
ents 
  the absorption of water and electrolytes.</font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 98 degree's temperature,=
 the waste 
  material begins to rot and decay, sending toxins and poisons into the bl=
ood 
  stream and throughout the body.</font></p>
<p><font face=3D"Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Cleansing your colon is a =
30-day 
  process. Its also very economical at $51.50, for all three products US, =
and 
  $96.20 Canadian. You may be very surprised at some of the benefits you w=
ill 
  receive besides just losing 1-5 lbs of cr*p from your body and most of a=
ll, 
  brightening your future health.</font></p>
