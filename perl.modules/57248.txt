Does your new module fit into the API of Business::OnlinePayment? Would
it be a good idea to replace the current Payflow module? I like that
idea best if it makes sense. If you can't match the API, then I
wouldn't put it there.

Beyond that, a top-level Payflow should be okay.

Anyone else have any thoughts?
