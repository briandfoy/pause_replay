Hello Modlist Maintainers,

My registration request for Digest::SHA is almost 6 months old.  Is 
there a problem or a particular controversy that I'm not aware of?

The module is now relatively mature, and the user-base has grown, at 
least judging from the emails I receive.  So, it's odd that the module 
is still not registered.  The creation of the module was thoroughly 
discussed on Perl newsgroups, and I've been in regular correspondence 
with Gisle Aas, the author of the CPAN Digest:: module.  I don't believe 
that anything has been overlooked on my part, but please don't hesitate 
to contact me if such is not the case.

Regards, Mark
