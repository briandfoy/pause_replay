Subject: Module submission Lingua::JA::Moji
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Lingua::JA::Moji
  DSLIP:       cnpfp
  description: Convert Japanese characters
  userid:      BKB (Ben Bullock)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Not discussed anywhere, module has been sitting on my hard disc for
    a year.

  similar:
    Lingua::JA::Kana Lingua::JA::Romanize::Japanese
    Lingua::JA::Romaji::Valid Lingua::JA::Hepburn::Passport
    Data::Validate::Japanese

  rationale:

    This module replaces the piecemeal functionality of the
    above-listed existing CPAN modules for dealing with Japanese with a
    comprehensive solution handling conversion to and from Japanese
    characters.

    There are a lot of modules currently on CPAN for dealing with
    Japanese data but this one is much more hardcore; it deals with
    virtually every kind of variant character (for example, half-width
    characters and full-width characters), and all of the forms of
    romanization in just one module. The character conversion data is
    stored using File::ShareDir and loaded on demand.

    Obviously this should be under the Lingua::JA namespace. "Moji" is
    Japanese for "characters" or "letters" so I saved some space in the
    name by calling it Lingua::JA::Moji rather than
    Lingua::JA::CharacterConversion or something.

The resulting entry would be:

Lingua::JA::
::Moji            cnpfp Convert Japanese characters                  BKB
