Dear PAUSE,

This is Brian Ingerson <INGY@cpan.org>.

I want to register a PAUSE ID for a group of people known as the Seattle
Perl User's Group (SPUG). We are a Perl Monger affiliate located in
Seattle, WA USA.

Our group has decided to collaborate on some Perl module development. We
will vote on an initial project at our August meeting.

Our info is:

Name:          Seattle Perl User's Group
Email:         brian@ingerson.com
Homepage:      http://www.halcyon.com/spug/
Preferred ID:  SPUG
Contributions: To be decided...

I don't know what special considerations are required for registering a
group, but here are some I have thought of:

* Brian Ingerson (me) will be the keeper of the password, and will be
responsible for actual uploads.
* I want SPUG@cpan.org to forward to our mailing list (spug-list@pm.org).
* Our documentation will point to SPUG@cpan.org, so that suggestions and
bug reports will get sent to the whole list.
* After I receive the password, I'll change the account's public email
address to spug-list@pm.org.

* What would happen if someone requested a forgotten password? Would it get
sent to the list-address (bad) or to my private address (good)?

Thanks for your assistance.

Brian
