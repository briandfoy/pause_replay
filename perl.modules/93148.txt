Hi,

I think everyone here has overlooked the last two releases and that has =
caused confusion.
The patch is not needed. The issue is fixed since 0.03.

In general I have no objections against more co-maintainers and I accept =
all decisions from Florian. But I do not see any need for yet another =
maintainer.

To fix the threads.t test, I follow Harlan=E2=80=99s suggestion and =
release another version without this test.
