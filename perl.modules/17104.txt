Okay, so let's say I want to change it from Tib:: to Tibco::.  It's
already been pushed out to CPAN as Tib::Rv 0.02.  Can I rename the module
via PAUSE, or do I need to request the new Tibco namespace and just sort
of ignore the existing Tib::Rv?  Or maybe you can do some
behind-the-scenes trickery?

As for the keystrokes thing, I'm gonna layer on a bunch of factory
methods, so instead of doing:

my ( $rv ) = new Tibco::Rv;
my ( $timer ) = new Tibco::Rv::Timer(
   $Tibco::Rv::Queue::DEFAULT, 4, \&mycallback );


... you can do ...

my ( $rv ) = new Tibco::Rv;
my ( $timer ) = $rv->createTimer( 4, \&mycallback );
