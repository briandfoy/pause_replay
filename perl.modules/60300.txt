The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBI::HTML
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: A web frontend to DBI, finally
  userid:      XSAWYERX (Sawyer X)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    DBI provides a very clean and lean layer to databases and so we use
    it often in almost any database related (except Ties, even though
    there's Tie::DBI which has some overhead) and that's one of the
    reasons that DBI::Shell was created. It provides a clean shell
    interface to DBI which makes it possible to access it comfortably
    without programming.

    To make things short, I've come to realize that I'm in desperate
    need for a web interface to DBI. PHPers already have PHPmyadmin
    (which has got successful enough to be used for any services) but we
    need something like that for us - the developers. I started writing
    one, using Moose, and I reckon that other perlers (including a few a
    spoke to) would appreciate the existence of such a module.

    Besides, I write clean, strict, OO and I welcome anyone who wants
    to contribute to it.

The resulting entry would be:

DBI::
