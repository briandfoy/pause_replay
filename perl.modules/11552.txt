The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::Quote
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Quotes strings so perl can eval them correct
  userid:      YVES (Yves Orton)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Perlmonks

  similar:

  rationale:

    Many modules generate perl code (Data::Dumper Data::Dump to name
    just two) this module knows how to correctly quote strings for this
    purpose. In many ways I see it the opposite of Text::Balanced. Where
    Text::Balanced can extract quoted structures from strings, this
    module does the opposite.

    Features:

    1. quote_best -- determines the quoting symbol that results in the
    least backslashes in the text 2. quote_key -- knows which hash keys
    need quotes 3. quote -- can take an arbitrary scalar can quote it
    using a variety of means, including transforming it into a different
    representation (such as converting a binary string into a pack("H*")
    statement). 4. quote_regex -- knows how to correctly quote a qr// or
    other regex pattern.

    Derives from code contained in Data::Dump and Data::Dumper I wrote
    this while developing Data::BFDump (Which im about to make a
    namespace request for as well. :-)

The resulting entry would be:
