Yes, it is related to an earlier issue which is mentioned in the encapsulated 
message that is attached to the forwarded message. Maybe it was stripped by 
the mailing list or your mailer had problems reading it.

The encapsulated message was:

http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/2009/04/msg65500.html

I tried to email COLINK about Statistics-Descriptive, by sending an email to 
the email on http://search.cpan.org/~colink/ (which was another CPAN address) 
and got a bounce. Then I tried forwarding the message to colink@cpan.org , but 
got no reply.

Hi Colin!

I recently discovered http://search.cpan.org/dist/Statistics-Descriptive/ , 
and found it useful and used it for something. Thanks for maintaining it. I 
noticed there were no new releases in over 6 years, and that there are 9 bugs 
pending. Therefore, I decided to adopt it, since it proved useful to me.

I started working on it in a Subversion repository:

https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/web-cpan/Statistics-Descriptive/

I converted the build system to Module::Build, added the Module-Starter 
skeleton, and converted descr.t to use "use strict", "use warnings" and 
Test::More . Next, I plan to fix bugs.

In any case, please give me a co-maintainer status for Statistics-Descriptive, 
because I'd like to make new releases for it.

Regards,

        Shlomi Fish
