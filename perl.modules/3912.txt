If this is the wrong list to ask, let me know.  I can't find this addressed 
anywhere.

What happens when there's a module on CPAN that doesn't appear to be 
maintained anymore?  The module HTML::FromText has a few bugs and I've 
submitted patches to the author yet haven't received any response.  The 
last upload was Oct. 1999, so could that be an indication that the author 
isn't interested in maintaining it?  Does anyone know of a more direct way 
of finding this out?  Or picking up the maintenance of a module?
