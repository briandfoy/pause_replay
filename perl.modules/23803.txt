The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::RSS::JavaScript
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: serialize your RSS as JavaScript
  userid:      BRICAS (Brian Cassidy)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    XML::RSS

  rationale:

    From the module DESCRIPTION:

    Perhaps you use XML::RSS to generate RSS for consumption by RSS
    parsers. Perhaps you also get requests for how to use the RSS feed
    by people who have no idea how to parse XML, or write Perl programs
    for that matter.

    Enter XML::RSS::JavaScript, a simple subclass of XML::RSS which
    writes your RSS feed as a sequence of JavaScript print statements.
    This means you can then write the JavaScript to disk, and a users
    HTML can simply include it like so:

    <script language="JavaScript" src="/myfeed.js"></script>

    What's more the javascript emits HTML that can be fully styled with
    CSS.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::RSS::
::JavaScript      bdpOp serialize your RSS as JavaScript             BRICAS
