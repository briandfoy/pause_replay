The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Digest::Directory
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: cgi/cli digests of file/directory sets
  userid:      MGREAM (Matthew Gream)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    Dirgest is a compact suite of development modules and operational
    scripts that provide a comprehensive ability to work with digests of
    file and directory sets. The modules provide building blocks for
    developers, while the scripts are directly useful for local host and
    web site administration.

    Two modules are supplied: Digest::Directory::{BASE,API}.pm Two
    scripts are supplied: dirgest.{pl,cgi}

    Primary applications are security and integrity.

    The author uses this suite to verify correct replication of data
    from local host to non-CLI access remote web site, and then ongoing
    verification that web site content is consistent. The suite is also
    used to ensure integrity of local host (OpenBSD) installation.

    The most recent version is always available on CPAN or from the
    author (matthew.gream@pobox.com).

The resulting entry would be:

Digest::
::Directory       bdpOp cgi/cli digests of file/directory sets       MGREAM
