Yet i dont have any STANDARD MODULES on my own. But, i would like to
contribute in some way, like

1) involving in some projects and contribute my code according to the
   need been arised. 

2) Maintain the existing modules on behalf of the author and if he
   wish. 

3) Fix some bugs on behalf of unresponsive authors.

and something similar..
