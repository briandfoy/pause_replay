Thank you - no errors remain.

I think I have the meanings of "indexed" and "visible via
search.cpan.org" conflated.  Pages I had already found & read include

  http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html
  https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=pause_04about#conventions

The fact that search.cpan.org dist-version index pages[1] list
"Modules" and "Other Files" from examples/ in the 0.25 release, but
not 0.25_1325, did not help.

If you can find some time to be Lazier I would appreciate some
information about the linkage between CPAN and the search site(s)
linked from either of those pages above.

Otherwise, all problems are fixed.
Thank you for your help,
