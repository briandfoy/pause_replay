Dear PAUSE Admins,

Can you give me co-maint for OpenGL::Shader please? This was written by
Bob Free (BFREE), and last released in September 2007.

I emailed Bob on 10 Oct, he promised to look at bugs, but there was no
any reaction since. He didn't answered to any of my following emails,
(I attach all mails), as well as to my propose to give me co-maintaining.

I've cc'd Bob on this email.

I have created github repo with the sources [1], and only yesterday I
read neilbowers's blog [2], and found the module sources gitpan in
cloned into [3] and re-applied by changes. That's more correct way.

My changes fix the RT-issue [4]; I have tested it on Linux
(ATI/opensource drivers) and on Windows (ATI/proprietary driver and
nVidia/proprietary driver) and it works well. 

If I get co-maint, I'll release my fixed version, and also add
metadata for the repo and license type, and tidy up the Changes file,
following the Questhub quests.

My PAUSE id is DMOL.

Hello Bob,

I have tested about 1 month my changes on Linux and Windows hosts, and
they work OK.

Let me again offer my help in co-maintaining the module. If you are
too busy, or not interested in maintaining it at all, the you can 

a. login to pause.perl.org
b. click on "Change permissions", select module and specify me (cpan id: DMOL)
as co-maintainer. 

... or, just confirm with reply, that you aren't interested in further 
module maintaining, and I'll forward it to cpan authorities for further 
actions...

Hello Bob,

I have actually tried and the provided code works well on Linux as well
as Windows. You can use it and release new OpenGL::Shader distribution.

On the other hand I would like to change interface a little bit:
a. It should die() if compilation/linkage fail
b. Otherwise it should return all messages, which returns back video
driver. The messages could be useful, because driver will return useful
warning-messages.

Hello Bob,

Good to know!

Meanwhile I have created github repository with it [1], and started
fixing the sources for the problem (see [2]). 

In short, your current code works well for me on Linux with open-source 
ATI-drivers/Mesa, but fail on Windows with proprietary drivers. 

The problem is: proprietary drivers report something like "OK, Fragment 
Shader has been successfully compiled", while open-source code just 
says nothing. The code in OpenGL::Shader::Objects treats any message 
as fatal. 

Hinc illae lacrimae :)

I haven't still checked whether my fixes are OK for Windows. I'll notify
you.

I haven’t maintained it in years… but I’ll see if I can get back into
it.

I’ll look into the bug - thanks! - Bob

Hello Bob, 

I would like to thank you for you OpenGL::Shader module. Do you still
maintain it? If so, I have met bug, which is specified at [1] with 
a patch, but there seems a better solution [2]. 

If you are not interested in maintaining, may be you could transfer
maintainer-rights for me?
