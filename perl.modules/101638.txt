From: mst@shadowcat.co.uk (Matt S Trout)

Just clean it up to all be PHRED.

I'm fairly sure I wrote most of the code (that's where 'prefetch' first
appeared ;) which sort of gives me moral authority to say that, and PHRED
is more likely to ever release it again than I am.

If I ever release an ORM again presumably it'll be my third attempt and I'll
regret my life choices shortly thereafter.

I’m tidying up distributions that have shared first-come ownership, since PAUSE tries now to not let this happen — it maintains the permissions profile on the lead module, regardless of who releases (in the past the releaser would get first-come on newly added modules).
