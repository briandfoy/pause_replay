The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Maplat
  DSLIP:       MdpO2
  description: Web-based Framework with background workers
  userid:      CAVAC (Rene Schickbauer)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    Linuxdays, computer congresses, currently writing a book

  similar:
    Catalyst

  rationale:

    Maplat is a mature in-house webbased framework with background
    workers developed for Magna Powertrain. It currently powers multiple
    production systems.

    I managed to get the company to open source it (i'm the main
    developer).

    There are currently about 20-40 MaplatModules and HelperModules
    that i can opensource over the next few weeks/months, comprising of
    the basis of the Maplat framework. I should be able to upload a
    fully functional (and mostly documented) version this week.

    The Maplat namespace will hold at least three major branches: The
    Webgui Framework Maplat::Web, the Worker Framework Maplat::Worker
    and the common helper modules Maplat::Helpers. We are currently also
    working on other subsystems (like an auto-updating system and a
    chipcard server/proxy/client system) that we hope to release to the
    public within a year or so.

    As the code is already in production use with the Maplat::
    namespace and it IS a fully grown project (that will continue to
    grow in the foreseeable future as my employer is paying me to do
    just that) i'm inclined to use it's own root namespace, same as
    Catalyst does. There is also a second developer working part-time on
    the framework, he may start to work on it full-time next year.

    Given the current rate of development, it is likely that the open
    sourced part of the software will reach 70-100 modules within two
    years.

The resulting entry would be:

Maplat            MdpO2 Web-based Framework with background workers  CAVAC
