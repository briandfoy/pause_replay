Maybe he meant something like this:
http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg08649.html ?

But that was someone applying for one PAUSE ID with two names and two
email addresses behind it. Kurt answered in
http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg08948.html and said
one email address only, please; subsequently, that person re-registered
with one name and one address (and got the user ID CHATEAU, IIRC).

Cheers,
Philip
