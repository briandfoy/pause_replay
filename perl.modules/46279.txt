The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Time::Normalize
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Standardize date/time input values.
  userid:      ROODE (Eric J. Roode)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    RPI lily

  similar:
    None that I can find.

  rationale:

    This module is nothing spectacular. It just implements several
    functions that I have found myself writing and rewriting (and
    retesting and redebugging) repeatedly over the years.

    It standardizes/normalizes date/time components in a variety of
    input formats, so that the programmer can then use them without
    further error checking or formatting. It also includes some utility
    functions, such as is_leap (is the specified year a leap year?) or
    mon_name (the name of the nth month of the year in the current
    locale).

    This module doesn't do any date computations, comparisons, or I/O.
    It simply fills the gap between reading input values and using them.

    Thank you, Eric Roode
