     why:

    A perl module that constructs nested data structures from the
    XML::LibXML interface. The recursive instantiation is specified by
    XPath expressions; data structures are automatically created as
    hashes or arrays, or by a helper supplied through the data structure
    specification.

    Dependancies:

    1. A set of classes for structuring error data with emphasis on
    recovery, classification of errors, and tagging by intended
    audience.

    2. A package collecting helpers or variations on map.

    I do not consider these ready for the main cpan index, but I intend
    to revise them as needed until they are.

    I have a few other packages that I want to upload, but I think this
    is a good set to start with.
