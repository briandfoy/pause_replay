Subject: Module submission Class::User::DBI

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Class::User::DBI
  DSLIP:       SdpOp
  description: Manage user credentials and roles
  userid:      DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:
    PerlMonks CB. Also uploaded to GitHub

  similar:
    Authen::Passphrase

  rationale:

    There are many user credentials modules on CPAN, but they seem to
    deal mostly with OS logins. This module aims to provide a general
    solution that is well suited to web applications. The user object is
    stored in a database using a DBIx::Connector. Passphrase hashing and
    validation is provided by Authen::Passphrase::SaltedSHA512. There
    are also facilities for IP whitelisting per user, and user roles
    that can be used for authorizations.

    The namespace was chosen to reflect that this is a class that
    encapsulates a 'user' entity, and that the object is
    database-oriented. The naming was discussed with several individuals
    at PerlMonks (Corion, and others).

  enteredby:   DAVIDO (David J. Oswald)
  enteredon:   Sun Jun 10 06:34:27 2012 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Class::User::
::DBI             SdpOp Manage user credentials and roles            DAVIDO
