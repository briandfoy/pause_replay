Hello,

I have prepared Perl-RPM-1.50 (unofficial) release, and I am looking for
a way to upload it on CPAN.  Unfortunately, the original Perl-RPM
author, Randy J. Ray, was not quite willing to pass Perl-RPM maintenance
to me (which was discussed last year, also on modules@perl mailing list).

Now I argue that my effort is perfectly reasonable and sane.  The code
has not been updated for almost 5 years.  In fact, it cannot be even
compiled with (not-so-)recent rpm versions.

Here is the changelog entry for Perl-RPM-1.50.
I hope it is self-explaining and actually convincing.

 Revision history for Perl extension RPM.

+1.50	Fri Apr 20 2007
+
+	Maintenance taken over by Alexey Tourbin <at@altlinux.org>.  This
+	is not quite an official release but I hope I can upload it to CPAN.
+
+	This release has been tested on ALT Linux Sisyphus (rpm-4.0.4) and
+	Fedora Core 6 (rpm-4.4.2).
+
+	The version has been bumped up to 1.50 to match RPM.pm $VERSION.
+
+	This release includes about 100 changes from the previous version
+	0.40, which was released almost 5 years ago.  All known bugs and
+	memory leaks has been fixed; the code has been updated for recent
+	rpm-4.4 versions [rt.cpan.org #3930, #8710], as well as cleaned up
+	and simplified.
+
+	Detailed list of changes since version 0.40 is available at
+	http://git.altlinux.org/people/at/packages/?p=3Dperl-RPM.git;a=3Dsummary
+
+	The most important changes are as follows.
+
+	Many memory leaks have been fixed, including lack of headerFree()
+	in rpmdb_FETCH().  New file t/09_leaks.t implements tests for memory
+	leaks (requires Devel::Leak module).  [rt.cpan.org #12120]
+
+	RPM::Database caching layer was dropped, because of unacceptable
+	memory usage for database traversal.  However, due to Berkeley DB
+	caching facilities, which is used by RPM, the overall performance
+	seems much smoother.
+
+	RPM::Header caching layer was also dropped, due to many
+	inconsistencies which arise from the "cache by tag name" approach.
+	(For example, it was possible to assign different values for EPOCH
+	and SERIAL rpm header tags, which actually alias each other.)
+	However, ad-hoc cache for NAME, VERSION, and RELEASE tags has been
+	kept, along with SEGV bugfix.  [rt.cpan.org #14489]
+
+	XS code has been simplified by implementing RPM::Header and
+	RPM::Database object boxing (and unboxing) completely with typemap.
+
+	Conversion between RPM tag names to their numeric values is now
+	also handled with typemap.
+
+	Fixed wrong rpmError() usage, which expects printf-like format
+	string and arguments, not just plain string.
+
+	Implemented RPM::evrcmp(a,b) to compare [Epoch:]Version[-Release]
+	specification strings, possibly against RPM::Header objects.
+
+	Fixed wrong RPM_INT*_TYPE conversion in rpmhdr_STORE(), which
+	made RPM::evrcmp() implementation possible.
+
+	Update RPM::Constants for new rpm, based on perl-RPM-43.patch
+	from PLD Linux Distribution.
+
