Hey Friend,

I just read another message from "Our New Homes Opportunity".

I figured you'd like to hear from some other people about this crazy opportunity.

Here goes...

****************************************************************

I am going to close on my first house and I already have a lease purchase buyer who is going to buy it in six months and I will net $10,000.  NPL has done everything for me!

Linda P., New York, NY

****************************************************************

Pretty cool, huh?

But I've got some bad news...you see Friend, the NPL program is a "program", not a "course".  So what that means is they can only service a few people at a time and to tell you the truth, we only have 16 - scratch that, 15 - spots left as of today.

So Friend, if you want to get in on all the action, just head on over to http://www.homebusinessrealestate.com

That's all for now!

Thanks,

Lou
