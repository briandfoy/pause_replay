Thanks, Martyn, I see that Matthew Simon Ryan Cavalletto has applied
to take over Class::Methodmaker a long time ago:

I also see that you have already uploaded a new version, but this is
not going to be indexed, so I'd like to officially pass the namespace
over to either of you two. I'm sure this would be for the benefit of
the module and in Peter's sense. Any preferences between you two?
