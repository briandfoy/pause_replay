Hi All

Someone beat me to it.

Hi Neil

I always copy these types of emails to the list. I strongly recommend 
you do to.

This does not include trying to read the original author, but when it 
comes time to contact the list, you should IMHO include relevant 
extracts of emails to said author.

As for Winifred, I know a woman of that name, so I would also have 
assumed Winfried was female, although a name like Siegfried (sp?) - 
which I believe is male - would make me unsure.
