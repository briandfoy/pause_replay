Subject: Module submission Tie::Plural::Scalar

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Tie::Plural::Scalar
  DSLIP:       bdprp
  description: Singular or plural variant based on counter
  userid:      LALLIP (Paul D. Lalli)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    lily @RPI, comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Tie::Plural Lingua::EN::Inflect

  rationale:

    Tie::Plural is a great module for creating plural variants of a
    given value as needed. However, it is cumbersome if one wanted to
    print several statements all involving the same value and counter.
    This module allows the user to initialize a variable to its
    singular, plural, and zero values, along with associating it with a
    counter, exactly once. From there, whenever the variable is read,
    the counter variable is polled.

    Linga::EN::Inflect is a wonderful module, but is very bloated if
    all the user wants to do is choose the correct plurality variant, as
    it does this and so much more.

    The namespace choice is based on the fact that it has the same
    intent as Mr. Roode's Tie::Plural, but uses tied Scalars rather than
    a tied Hash. I am open to other suggestions.

  enteredon:   Tue Dec  6 15:10:38 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Tie::Plural::
::Scalar          bdprp Singular or plural variant based on counter  LALLIP
