The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::RVP
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Interface to Microsoft Exchange messenger
  userid:      DBROBINS (David Robins)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org

  similar:
    Net::AIM etc., but none for this protocol

  rationale:

    RVP (Rendez-Vous Protocol) is the name of the protocol used by
    Microsoft Exchange instant messenger (see
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnmes2k/html/rvp.asp, which,
    while not horrible, is incomplete and some packet captures were
    required to fill in the gaps). Note that RVP is not the same as (or
    even all that similar to) the MSN protocol.

    I have developed some modules (whose structure and organization I
    have posted about on module-authors) that can connect to an RVP
    server, chat, receive messages, etc., plus a primitive client that
    uses them.

    This belongs in Net:: because it is an interface to a network
    protocol, and other similar protocols e.g. AIM, Goofey, Jabber,
    Oscar are represented here.

  enteredon:   Sun Jan 11 09:00:46 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::RVP             RdpOp Interface to Microsoft Exchange messenger    DBROBINS
