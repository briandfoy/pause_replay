Sorry for the manual submission, but when clicking the submit button at
https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=apply_mod
nothing happens. My IE6.0.26 (w2k) doesn't seem to even try to submit the 
form. If it did anyway... well :)

These are the values I tried to submit:


OpenDirectory::Category

11

b m p O p

Match text to OpenDirectory/dmoz categories

Mailing list, name to be determined by the namespace

WWW::Search::OpenDirectory


OpenDirectory::Category is a set of classes to match text/urls against the 
OpenDirectory/dmoz.org categories, without access to the http://dmoz.org/ 
web site. You throw it a URL and get back a number of OpenDirectory 
categories where it belongs.

One thing I still have trouble with is the namespace. I asked for opinions 
on PerlMonks
some time ago:
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=165912

After having thought long and hard about this one more time (and having 
tried out four different sets of names) I finally ended up with

OpenDirectory::Category
OpenDirectory::Category::Matcher::Word
OpenDirectory::Category::MatchResult

for the most important classes.

That way I don't hog the entire OpenDirectory name, and I still get 
OpenDirectory::Category (which I need).

It might belong in Search::, but I don't know.

It does not belong in WWW::, because this is not a web thing. Sure, the 
OpenDirectory contents happen to be central to http://dmoz.org/ but that's 
not the point. And the module doesn't access the web site when it 
categorizes data.

As for OpenDirectory vs DMOZ, well the module to search http://dmoz.org/ is 
called WWW::Search::OpenDirectory.

Another thing: the module contains a lot of data used when matching: 35M, 
the gzipped file is about 10M. Is this a problem? Should it be flagged 
somehow? (I mention it in the README file.)
