Hi!

I have some perl modules in use use here at the Cambridge
Astronomical Survey Unit, Institute of Astronomy,
University of Cambridge, that may be of wider use.

Initially, I have four small PERL-only modules that encapsulate celestial
equatorial coordinates in astronomy.  These handle translation between the
many different representations of these coordinates, including sexagesimal
notation, and interoperate with Astro::SLA (already on CPAN) for the higher
mathematical functions.

Later, I may be able to release a set of modules (working title "GQ") that
wrap relational databases to make an extensible OO interface to the DBs.
These work with the DBI/DBD modules.

The CPAN ID G-RIXON would suit me.

I don't have a personal home-page, but my group has pages at
http://archive.ast.cam.ac.uk/ in which material are links to CGIs using the
code I would release to CPAN.

Best regards,
Guy
