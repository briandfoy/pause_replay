So PDF::API3 isn't an option? :)

If you want a name that explains how this module is different to existing PDF 
modules,

PDF::NoDeps
PDF::OnePM
or
PDF::ForPerlApp

would be accurate. But all those options seem a bit obscure to me. If you want 
a name that describes what it does, something like

PDF::EasyCreate
PDF::NoFrills
or
PDF::CreateDirect

could work. If you want something that alludes to the style of the module,

PDF::Stream

describes how it works internally (ie all the content goes in one PDF stream 
object), and how the public interface is structured, assuming that the 
potential user has a working knowledge of the internals of PDF documents 
(unlikely).

Any suggestions from your end?

Regards,

Mark Howe
