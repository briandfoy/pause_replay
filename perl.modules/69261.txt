Mr. Poddar,

Once again, I am attempting to reach you via CPAN alias, published email
address, and contact form on your personal website regarding RTx::BecomeUser's 
incompatability with modern RT.

Please review the unofficial 1.10_3 upload in my CPAN account (currently on
its way to the mirrors) and incorporate the necessary changes to make the
module functional with 3.8, as well as other features at your discretion.
Otherwise, could I please be granted commit bits via PAUSE so that others may
have access to this working version?

P.S. For public records of previous discussion please see
