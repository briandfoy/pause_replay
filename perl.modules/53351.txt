This module is already owned by an existing author. You will not to 
contact them to obtain permission.

If you CANNOT contact the author, then this list handles allocations 
from there.

We ask you make a number of attempts over a number of weeks, and if you 
cannot contact the author, please come back to this list and we'll fix it.
