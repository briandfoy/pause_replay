Subject: perl.org 's - FINAL REQUEST for a Back Link From - www.

To: "Modules" <modules@perl.org>

THIS IS A FINAL REQUEST FOR BACKLINK TO www.NewJerseyHomeInspection.com

Dear Modules,

Once before I asked you to consider adding a back link to my web site
http://www.NewJerseyHomeInspection.com from your web site because 
visitors to my site may be interested in the information your web site 
provides.

I would like to place a link to your site along with a description from 
my web site.  

My link pages are too new to have page rank. Since my home page is a 
PR4 the page rank of my link pages is sure to rise during the next 
update.

If you would like to swap links please reply to this email with your:
Title text:
URL:
and Description:

Should you have any other cross-promotion ideas, let me know.

During the next few weeks I will be dropping all the listings that are 
not providing me with back links so the number of links off each page 
will drop to a very small quantity.

I would appreciate if you placed a link back to my site:

Title: New Jersey Home Inspection NJ
URL to Link to: http://www.NewJerseyHomeInspection.com
Description: New Jersey Home Inspection Directory where you can find an 
inspector for the home you are planning to buy in New Jersey

Michael Del Greco, President, NewJerseyHomeInspection
