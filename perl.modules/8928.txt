Moin,

On 26-Nov-01 Tim Bunce tried to scribble about:

But it is essential "/dev/bollocks". I know that there is "Device::" but I
think it is misnamed (too long and the devices are /dev/something, not
/device/something). 

The module doesn't have anything to do with business, except that the
language might be called "business related". But whats not business
related, then? And then, Language::Bollocks or Random::Bollocks, or
Text::Bollocks, or Bollocks::Texts or even Math::String::Bollocks (subclass
of Math::String) etc would be all candiates, but IMHO none would fit
properly.

Maybe the short description text is a bit misleading - I took the
"theme" over from the original's authors description/website. If it would
read:

        description: Emulates /dev/bollocks in pure perl

the name would be more clear. Does this make (non)sense?

!? 42? ;)
