Planned contribution: A subclass of Business::OnlinePayment to enable
interfacing with Cardstream online payment service
(Business::OnlinePayment::Cardstream). (Already written)

Current status: bdpO

Justification for submission: Business::OnlinePayment requires processor
specific subclasses such as Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet, we feel
this is an adequate place for a Cardstream equivilent.

Thankyou
Craig Belcham
