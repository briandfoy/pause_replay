The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Tournament::RoundRobin
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Round-Robin Tournament Pairings
  userid:      DRBEAN (Dr Bean)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    module-authors@perl.org, modules@perl.org

  similar:

  rationale:

    Following Adam Kennedy's suggestion of the name,
    Games::Tournament::RoundRobin, at
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/47169, I am resubmitting
    the application at http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.modules/47162
    again under that name.

    A round-robin tournament is a series of matches of the members of a
    league, where every member of the league meets every other member
    the same number of times. See
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament

    An algorithm to do this is: Represent the league members as (Inf, 1
    .. 2n-1), then in round i, i can be paired with Inf, and a can meet
    b, where a+b = 2i (mod 2n-1).

  enteredby:   DRBEAN (Dr Bean)
  enteredon:   Sat Feb  4 09:13:09 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Tournament::
::RoundRobin      adpOp Round-Robin Tournament Pairings              DRBEAN
