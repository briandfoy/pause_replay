The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Health::Devices
  DSLIP:       idpfp
  description: Drivers for Interacting with Health Devices
  userid:      OWEN (Owen DeLong)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    None found

  rationale:

    I am currently working on modules to talk to various LifeScan brand
    Glucometers (blood glucose meters used by diabetics and others). I
    also intend to implement modules for Scales, Sphygmomanometers
    (blood pressure monitors), and possibly other devices.

    I do not want exclusive domain over the whole hierarchy, but I
    would like to have a published clear definition of the intended
    hierarchy in the hopes of providing maximum usability and
    extensibility for others to contribute non-conflicting modules.

    My thinking is
    Health::Devices::<type>::<brand>::<series>[::<model>]

    Where the API interface would be use
    Health::Devices::<type>::<brand>::<series> and any use of [::model]
    would be an internal and automatic (or semi-automatic) load carried
    out by the <series> module.

    <type> would indicate the type of device (e.g. thermometer,
    sphygmomanometer, scale, glucometer) <brand> would indicate the
    manufacturer (e.g. LifeScan, Bayer, etc.) <series> would indicate
    the group of devices (e.g. LifeScan::OneTouch) <model> would be the
    specific model within the series (e.g. LifeScan::OneTouch::Ultra2,
    LifeScan::OneTouch::UltraMini)

    Finally, I'm not absolutely certain about chapter 4, but I think
    that makes more sense than 23. Ideally, a chapter for things that
    talk to hardware would be preferred.

The resulting entry would be:
