Hi 
Can I help with your current IT or Software Engineering requirements at your
company? How about any offshore development? Do you need help with any
off-site /on-site projects?
We have consultants that are strong as Project Manager, QA Analyst, Web
Developers, DBA's, Systems Administrators ... etc. 
CGT Consulting is a high-tech consulting and placement firm with expertise
in the areas of ERP (PeopleSoft, SAP, Oracle), CRM, web-based applications
and content management, wireless technology and Software Engineering. We
currently service a broad range of clients from businesses with basic
programming/networking needs, to Aerospace Companies in RF Electronic
Warfare and Digital Engineering. Our strength lies in the staff we work
with. In addition to our in-house consultants, CGT has access to over
800,000 candidates in the U.S. and 200,000 internationally. Paired with our
corporate philosophy of cost-conscious consulting, CGT is the natural choice
for all your IT needs. How can I help with your current requirements?
We can take on responsibility for development / maintenance of projects too.
These can be developed at your location or our development centers either in
S. California or N. California.
We also have two offshore development centers, where we develop projects for
our clients at substantially lower costs. We can bid on Projects, on a fixed
price basis, with a guaranteed time frame for completion. Rates can be as
low as $15/hr, based on the complexity of the project and the skills
involved. How can I help you in lowering your software developments costs at
your company?
How can I help you in your IT / Software Engineering arena?
Thank you.
