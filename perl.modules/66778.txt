The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PDL::Stats
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: statistics modules with non-PDL user guide
  userid:      MAGGIEXYZ (Maggie J. Xiong)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Statistics::Basic Statistics::Descriptive Statistics::Regression

  rationale:

    This is a collection of statistics modules in Perl Data Language,
    with a quick-start guide for non-PDL people.

    They make perldl--the simple shell for PDL--work like a teenie
    weenie R, but with PDL threading--"the fast (and automagic)
    vectorised iteration of 'elementary operations' over arbitrary
    slices of multidimensional data"--on procedures including t-test,
    ordinary least squares regression, and kmeans.

    Of course, they also work in perl scripts.

    ASFAIK, this is the first comprehensive statistics package in
    native Perl/PDL.

The resulting entry would be:

PDL::
::Stats           adpOp statistics modules with non-PDL user guide   MAGGIEXYZ
