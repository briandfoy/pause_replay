Subject: Ownership of Tie::Syslog

Hi,

I'm Damien Krotkine ( pause ID : DAMS ), and I'd like to take
ownership of Tie::Syslog. This module is simple, yet it suffers from a
lot of issues :

- latest release was in 2002
- it was designed against a very old version of Sys::Syslog, and
doesn't support new APIs and features
- it contains very problematic bugs, including in its test, so that
its test will almost never pass at install-time
- it violates the usage rules of Sys::Syslog
- it has 2 bugs opened 2 years ago, still not fixed.

I'd like to take ownership of it to be able to release a new version
that fixes the most urgent issue ( misuse of setlogsock ). I'd like to
put the code on github, and use Dist::Zilla for easier release
process.

That's about it. Let me know if that's OK with you

Thanks,
dams
