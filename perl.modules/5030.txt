Lazy	Rdpr		provides "lazy" scalars, arrays and hashes	JENDA

A module for simulating lazines in perl. It provides scalars, arrays
and hashes that are ``lazy'', that is their value is computed only
if necessary and at most once.

  use Lazy '$variablename' => \&function [, $store_options];

The first time you access the variable, the code gets executed and the
result is saved for later as well as returned to you. Next accesses
will use this value without executing anything. 

You may specify what will happen if you try to reset the variable. You
may either change the value or the code. Or get a "Modification of a 
read-only value attempted" error message.

You may find the docs at http://jenda.krynicky.cz/perl/Lazy.pm.html
and the module itself at 
http://jenda.krynicky.cz/perl/Lazy-0.5.tar.gz

The module is actualy around for some time already and since it's
being used by Win32::FileOp it is installed on many Win32 boxes
already (probably without the programmers' notice so it doesn't matter
THAT much).

Should I rename the module and how?

I wonder  why  does  the whole  chemical  industry 
ignore software bugs. We'd be eager to pay fortune 
for a working insecticide.
