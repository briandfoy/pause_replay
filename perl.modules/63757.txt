Subject: Module submission Mac::Finder::DSStore

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mac::Finder::DSStore
  DSLIP:       bdphp
  description: Read and write Mac Finder .DS_Store files
  userid:      WIML (Wim Lewis)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Macintosh Finder keeps a bunch of information in .DS_Store
    files, which have a fairly complicated format, and it's useful to be
    able to produce or alter them mechanically. There's nothing else in
    the Mac::Finder namespace, but since the Finder is pretty much the
    only consumer of these files, the name Mac::Finder::DSStore makes
    more sense to me than simply Mac::DSStore.

  enteredby:   WIML (Wim Lewis)
  enteredon:   Thu Dec 25 00:08:33 2008 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mac::Finder::
::DSStore         bdphp Read and write Mac Finder .DS_Store files    WIML
