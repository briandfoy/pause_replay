Request to register new user

fullname: Nate Jones
  userid: NDJ
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://endot.org/
     why:

    I have several applications written in Perl that I would like to
    publish on CPAN so that they can be easily installed. The first one
    is https://github.com/justone/dfm, but more will follow.
