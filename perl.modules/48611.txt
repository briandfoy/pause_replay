Hi list,

I would like to put two modules on CPAN:
Tk::InheritanceTree is a Tk::Toplevel-derived Tk-widget displaying a 
graphical representation of the inheritance tree for a class/module-name 
entered into a Entry-field. The Nodes, representing classnames in this 
view have bindings to open a  Tk::MethodList Window.
Tk::MethodList Is a Tk::Toplevel-derived widget. It displays all 
subroutine-names, that are present in the symbol-table for a given 
class/package and all of its parent-classes.
MethodList opens a second window if a subroutine-name is clicked. This 
window will display the sourcecode for the subroutine if it can be found  .
If anyone would suggest a different naming, please let me know.
Btw, my spellchecker suggests Tk::Methodist ;)

Christoph
