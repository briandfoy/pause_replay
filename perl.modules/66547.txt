PAUSE ID: MARTINELL
Module: Template::Plugin::WikiCreole
File: Template-Plugin-WikiCreole-0.01.tar.gz
Full path: $CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MARTINELL/Template-Plugin- 
WikiCreole-0.01.tar.gz

On Wednesday evening I uploaded the file, but I have not seen it  
appear in the index.

I have received several emails from "Perl Authors Upload Server" and  
"PUASE" indicating the file has been uploaded and there is a new  
module "Template::Plugin::WikiCreole"

Last night I tried a reindex to see if I could get it work.  But still  
it does not appear.

Chatting with Paul Fenwick I know that the indexer is working, as his  
autodie files have indexed.

I would presume, therefor, there that there is a problem with my  
module. I am not sure what as it does pass its unit tests, install and  
run as I would expect.
