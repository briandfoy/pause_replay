I'm writing a set of modules that deal with scripture (bible)
specifications and standards, as well as a few for interfacing with
things from the Sword project (http://www.crosswire.org/sword), and
I'm perplexed about a namespace.

I want it to be short, something like
Religion::Christianity::Bible::Spec::GBF is not appealing.

I'm think about a top level Bible::*.  I know that there are other
folks who consider the bible to be something else entirely than a
Christian bible, so I'm also thinking along the lines of Scripture::*.

Any thoughts would be welcome.
