     why:

    Private Module used to bring connectivity to several different
    databases under one roof. The intention of creating a CPAN module is
    so that my module will have DBD driver dependencies, thus making it
    much simpler to install via CPAN.pm. Only a handful of people will
    need to use this module, although it could come in handy in several
    situations.
