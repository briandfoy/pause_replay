Randy is contactable and he said that, if I send him a tar file, he can
upload it to CPAN.  However, I ask for explicit maintenance transfer.
Perhaps I'm happier with 1.49_01 development release.

There's one more issue I whould like to resolve before the release is
finally out.  The Perl-RPM code seems to be licensed under the Artistic
license (see README).  I don't know whether this was intentional or not,
but I think it is good idea to explicitly relicence the code "under the
same terms as Perl itslef", which is either GPL or Artistic.  This will
probably provide better compatibility for linkage with librpm, which is
under GPL/LPGL.
