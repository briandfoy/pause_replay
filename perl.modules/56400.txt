Perhaps you deleted the files from cpan accidentally? They're still
available form backpan:

http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/D/DD/DDUMONT/

Perhaps you can re-upload the newest ::File with a higher version
number? It should then be available from CPAN again.

I'm removing the namespace from the deletion list.

Best regards,
Steffen
