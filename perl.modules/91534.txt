The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       yEd::Document
  DSLIP:       bdpO2
  description: pure perl API to create yEd-loadable docs
  userid:      FINCHI (Heiko Finzel)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    XML::LibXML - since the yEd graphml is a XML based document type

  rationale:

    I was searching for a ready to use module to create yEd documents
    out of perl to automate some graphical documentation tasks (platform
    and network overviews). Since I found nothing but many other people
    searching for such a module and the typical approach was to use
    XML::Simple or any other XML lib to create the graphml structure
    from scratch, I decided to create a package where people won't have
    to bother with XML, but use the yEd typical terms like nodes, edges
    and labels in abstracted from its XML representation.

    I wanted to share this implementation to help out all the others
    searching for an easy way to create yEd Documents from perl.

    Making the implementation abstract from the fact that a XML
    structure underlies the whole thing I decided it won't feel natural
    to include it to the XML namespace, so using the namespace yEd
    (where hopefully there will be some further features an classes be
    provided in the future to wrap common tasks in the usage of my
    package and / or allow more yEd standard features to be supported).

The resulting entry would be:

yEd::
::Document        bdpO2 pure perl API to create yEd-loadable docs    FINCHI
