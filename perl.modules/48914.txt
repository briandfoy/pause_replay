The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::DTD
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Parse and process an XML DTD
  userid:      WOHL (Brendt Wohlberg)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Not yet known

  similar:
    XML::DTDParser XML::ParseDTD SGML::DTDParse

  rationale:

    XML::DTD is the most obvious namespace choice, and is currently
    unused. This model has some functionality in common with
    XML::DTDParser, XML::ParseDTD, and SGML::DTDParse, including the
    ability to write an XML representation of the DTD which is
    transformed via XSLT to HTML or Docbook documentation, but handles
    some of these tasks differently, and provides additional features
    such as the ability to construct a DFA for content model validation.
    While these differences could, with significant effort, be added to
    one of the currently registered modules, work on XML::DTD started
    some time ago (before some of the currently available modules were
    registered), and this is no longer a practical consideration. In
    addition to the XML::DTD module, the package contains a number of
    modules within that namespace (e.g. XML::DTD::Element) and a support
    module XML::Output, the name of which is not currently used.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::DTD             bdpOg Parse and process an XML DTD                 WOHL
