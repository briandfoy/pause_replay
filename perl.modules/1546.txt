You might need to learn to work with case sensitive filesystems. If a
module's name is WWW::Search::AlltheWeb, then the file that contains
it, must be WWW/Search/AlltheWeb.pm, not alltheweb.pm.

Moreover, it would be a nice idea to use 'make dist' for constructing
the distribution file. In general it is good practise to untar a file
into its own directory and not into the current directory. 'make dist'
helps you to get that right.

I'm not sure if there are more problems with your packages, but these
two spring into my eyes.
