The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DBIx::Tiny
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Tiny and fast DB wrapper/mapper
  userid:      TECHCODE (Aleksandar Petrović)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Will be discussed on perlmonks.org

  similar:
    Class::DBI, DBIx::Class ...

  rationale:

    Introduction ===== Tiny and fast DB abstraction that's trying to
    give you 80% of the stuff you usually need, while not making you
    jump hoops for the remaining 20%.

    Achieved by removing most of the repetitive and boring stuff you do
    when dealing with DB, assuming sane and common defaults that you can
    easily override, and using safe practices (placeholders, prepare,
    execute).

    Not taking you away from the underlying DB/SQL, yet allowing you to
    mix it with some of the popular SQL generators if that's your thing.

    Totally usable in plain OOP way (no ORM mandatory) - hence not
    forcing you to map your databases and tables to objects. But
    allowing you to easily group and "relate" databases and tables to
    Perl code (modules) that work on that data. =====

    I already have rough code that's usable - but needs some API
    refinement and a bit more documentation.

    Thanks, Alex.
