Quoting Tim Bunce:
: The Devel::* namespace is intended for modules that are not used
: as part of the normal operation of a script.

It's not too late for massive renaming, but it must happen quickly.
I'm already at the final stage of releasing new modules that use
Devel::Datum.

There are already 3 internal projects in my company that use Devel::Datum,
one of them being already in production.

Please suggest a new namespace prefix.

Raphael

P.S: When Christophe and I asked for the namespace, nobody reacted.  I'm
not using this as an argument, only as a post-scriptum, because I know
people are busy, and that such practicess (reserving a namespace for
a purpose) are important, and must be honoured by responsible people.
