I am writing a user management module and I'm not sure
what namespace it fits in.

It is a module very similar to HTTPD::UserAdmin but is
intended to be independent of the server and even the
platform.  It's main purpose is to provide a simple,
multipurpose system to a programer to allow her/him to
manage users in their applications.

The primary interface is OO and some of the 'public'
methods are:
login(),
isLoggedIn(),
logout(),
addUser(),
deleteUser(),
getUserInfo(),
saveUserInfo(),
setPasswd(),
error()

I was thinking of CGI::User although this module is
not  at all limited to web development.  Any
suggestions?

I will be more than happy to answer any questions
about the module or provide any one with the code
(although it's still under development).

Thanking you for all your advice and support,

Sidharth Malhotra.
