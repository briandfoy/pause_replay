Subject: Module submission Date::Calc::Util
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, stbey@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Date::Calc::Util
  DSLIP:       Rdhfp
  description: Shortcuts users always wanted in Date::Calc
  userid:      STBEY (Steffen Beyer)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    sb@engelschall.com

  similar:
    Date::Calc

  rationale:

    "Date::Calc::Util" contains a selection of subroutines that people
    have expressed would be nice to have in L<Date::Calc(3)>, but the
    usage would not really be high or the routine not efficient enough
    to warrant including them in L<Date::Calc(3)>, and the size so small
    such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.

  enteredby:   STBEY (Steffen Beyer)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug 21 18:48:00 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Date::Calc::
::Util            Rdhfp Shortcuts users always wanted in Date::Calc  STBEY
