     why:

    I'm reading Intermediate Perl and their number one thing to do was
    check in with you guys, so here I am. I have an idea for an
    automated dynamic music generator, amoung other things, like GUI for
    engineering and astrophysical calculations, online community web
    design, data gathering and analysis (sociological, psychological,
    and political), and maybe some manufacturing, electrical
    engineering, and robotics.
