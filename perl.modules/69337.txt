Subject: Module submission Test::Varnish

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Varnish
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Test assertions against a varnish instance
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:
    Test::Apache2

  rationale:

    Varnish (http://varnish.projects.linpro.no) is a high-performance
    caching proxy.

    Test::Varnish is a concept module, basically test code I wrote when
    trying to validate varnish configurations before deploying.

    This module can verify if a varnish instance is behaving according
    to the specifications, that is, if a resource is being cached by
    Varnish or not.

  enteredby:   COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  enteredon:   Mon Jan 11 23:14:51 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Varnish         bdpfp Test assertions against a varnish instance   COSIMO
