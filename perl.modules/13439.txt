The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Searcher::Similars
  DSLIP:       Mdpfp
  description: pick out suspicious duplicate files
  userid:      SUNTONG (Tong Sun)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    http://xpt.sourceforge.net/

  similar:
    File::Find

  rationale:

    Duplicated files finders are useful to everybody. They will help to
    keep the system clean and tidy. The problem with current duplicated
    files finders is that they are too strict. For example, if the file
    name is changed a little bit, it will not be found as duplication
    any more.

    This module makes more aggressive guessing, with user controllable
    suggestion levels. It is ready to use for end users. It will be
    especially useful for people who download lots of files from
    different sites.

    The package name has been discussed with module controller before,
    was actually suggested by module controller.

The resulting entry would be:

File::Searcher::
::Similars        Mdpfp pick out suspicious duplicate files          SUNTONG
