Hi Shlomi,

The usual procedure to take over a module invovles you publicly
announcing your intent in some place that most people will see, such as
use.perl, and some of the admins trying to contact the author. 

If, after a couple of weeks the author does not respond (or responds
that he doesn't mind the transfer), we can add you as a co-maintainer.

However, Allen Holman has uploaded a new version today, I think he's
still interested in working on the module. I can't say why he hasn't
responded to you, but realize that sometimes mail gets lost. Perhaps
you can try again.  You might consider being a bit less aggressive,
though :)
