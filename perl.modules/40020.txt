The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Oracle::Reporter
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Create HTML, CSV and XML from Oracle table
  userid:      GEOTIGER (Geo Tiger)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    We often need to quickly develop an user interface to allow users
    to create their reports out of Oracle tables. This class will create
    a web interface for users to create, save, and retrieve reports. It
    will output the reports in various formats including HTML, CSV, and
    XML.

  enteredby:   GEOTIGER (Geo Tiger)
  enteredon:   Fri Apr 29 14:09:27 2005 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Oracle::
::Reporter        cdpOp Create HTML, CSV and XML from Oracle table   GEOTIGER
