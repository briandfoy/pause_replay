The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Convert::Transcribe
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Transcribe texts in natural languages.
  userid:      TWID (Thomas Widmann)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Mentioned on c.l.p.m., but there were no follow-ups.

  similar:
    Convert::Translit

  rationale:

    The existing module Convert::Translit is more or less an extended
    tr/// -- it performs a one-to-one mapping, but very efficiently.

    Convert::Transcribe, on the other hand, is meant for transcription
    of natural languages, where it is common to have rules such as
    "transcribe Russian 'e' as 'ye' word-initially and after vowels, and
    by 'e' in all other positions". It is rather slow, but convenient.

    Convert::Transcribe creates Perl code based on the user's
    transcription definition, and this code can then either be eval'ed
    or passed to the user (thus enabling optimisation).

    I believe the Convert:: namespace is appropriate as the
    functionality of the two modules are so similar.

    It is hoped it will be useful for people who need to transcribe
    things but who would rather not write a series of Perl regexps
    themselves.

  enteredon:   Fri Apr  4 15:39:00 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Convert::
::Transcribe      bdpOp Transcribe texts in natural languages.       TWID
