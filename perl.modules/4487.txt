My first finished module for public consumption (that doesn't belong to
work) is as follows
Name				DSLI	Description
Date::Tolkien::Shire 	RupO	J.R.R. Tolkien's hobbit calendar

The module converts a date from epoch time to hobbit calendar and back and
back again, as well as all your comparison operators for the shire dates.
Also includes a method to print a formatted string giving the date and the
historical events from that day in history (where all historical events are
taken from the Great Years of the War of the Ring (Shire Calendar
1418-1422).  The module is pure perl and is oo.

Thanks
Tom
