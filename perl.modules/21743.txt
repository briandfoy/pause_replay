The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Math::Symbolic
  DSLIP:       cdphp
  description: Symbolic calculations and derivatives
  userid:      SMUELLER (Steffen Müller)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Quoting the README:

    Math::Symbolic is intended to offer symbolic calculation
    capabilities to the Perl programmer without using external (and
    commercial) libraries and/or applications. [...] Partial derivatives
    of logarithms, exponentiations, and arithmetic terms (*,/,+,- and
    unary minus as well as variables and constants) work rather well
    albeit slowly). Simplification of algebraic terms is severely
    limited at this time. [...]

    I think the module should be on the list because I have yet to find
    a related module in there. I plan to continue developing the module
    and upgrade its status from "pre-alpha" to "Released" at some point.
    In the meantime, I'd love to get some feedback from users and
    hackers alike which being included in the module list would help
    with.

The resulting entry would be:

Math::
