The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SymObj
  DSLIP:       Rdpfo
  description: An easy way to create symbol-tables and obj.
  userid:      SDAODEN (Steffen "Daode" Nurpmeso)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    http://sourceforge.net/p/ssymobj/code/

  similar:
    Object::Accessor

  rationale:

    Well, if there were one of Object:: or Devel:: then i could imagine
    those as a parent namespace.

    Uniqueness .. ooops, i looked around in the v5.14.2 source and
    found Object::Accessor. But this is a different approach, for mine
    this one creates a class with ctor and read/write array/hash
    accessors a/h:

    package X; BEGIN { SymObj::sym_create(0, { '@_a' => undef, '%_h' =>
    undef }); }

    So it's definitely something else, differently. But hey, in fact i
    don't know, it was a quick internal hack that now has grown to a
    perl(1) module that is perhaps useful for others.

    P.S.: i'm in doubt, the project is called S-SymObj, it's only the
    module and class that is named SymObj.pm/::. Is this S-SymObj, or
    plain SymObj? I'm open to suggestions and support in respect to this
    before i'll mess things up! Thanks.

The resulting entry would be:

SymObj            Rdpfo An easy way to create symbol-tables and obj. SDAODEN
