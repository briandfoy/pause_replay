Brad,

while trying to catch up with pending registrations I looked into your
directory and found BYOURTH/Math.SimpleInterest.0.03.ZIP which
containes

Archive:  /home/ftp/pub/CPAN/authors/id/B/BY/BYOURTH/Math.SimpleInterest.0.03.ZIP
  inflating: Perl/site/lib/Math/SimpleInterest/test.pl  
  inflating: Perl/site/lib/Math/SimpleInterest/Makefile.PL

  inflating: Perl/site/lib/Math/SimpleInterest/Changes  


Would it be possible for you to package your module in the usual way,
that is:

- with a Makefile.PL in a directory named as uniquely as possible,
  that would be Math.SimpleInterest.0.03

- with an extension of "zip" (not "ZIP")

- a manifest that's actually called "MANIFEST"

- a readme that's actually called "README"

You will probably be delighted by trying out what 'make dist' can do
for you to have as little trouble as possible at getting this done.

Thanks & Regards,
