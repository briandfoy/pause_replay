The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Scalar::Vec::Util
  DSLIP:       Rdhfp
  description: Utility routines for vec strings.
  userid:      VPIT (Vincent Pit)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    You can contact me on FreeNode or MAGnet (vincent or Prof_Vince)

  similar:
    Bit::Vector

  rationale:

    This module provides XS code for some common bitwise operations on
    vec strings (such as copying, filling or testing bits). I first
    wanted to put it in the Bit:: namespace, but Scalar::Vec:: was more
    precise afterall. Moreover, it shows that the module doesn't want to
    reimplement bit vectors but just to expand functionality of the core
    implementation. 'Util' is quite general but it's the spirit of this
    module too.

The resulting entry would be:

Scalar::Vec::
::Util            Rdhfp Utility routines for vec strings.            VPIT
