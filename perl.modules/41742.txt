Hi there,
	I maintain Bio::Affymetrix, a set of modules for parsing big files that 
come out of a big machine (less vagueness available on request). I'm 
writing some test scripts for the various types of files this produces. 
So far I have been bundling in some sample files with the distribution.

Unfortunately the sample files are bigger than all of the code for 
parsing them. As I'm adding more tests, I find that the probable tarball 
that I'm asking people to download is very big, and only a small portion 
is actually useful to the user once they've got past make test.

Have you any suggestions? Do I just not ship any tests? I can try and 
ship smaller sample files, but even then the sample files are still much 
bigger than the code. I can ship fake sample files that I've made 
myself, but then it's not much of a test.

Thanks,
	David
