contribution:
  Several modules in a bundle to implement SOAP (Simple Object Access
Protocol), an XML/HTTP wire protocol that was recently introduced. These
modules allow Perl hashes (and eventually blessed object references) to be
serialized into SOAP streams and sent over HTTP (or SMTP, or whatever
transport folks get around to adding - I've got HTTP support right now). The
parser relies on XML::Parser::Expat, and there is one module designed to
interface very tightly with mod_perl (SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Apache). The
SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Client module depends on LWP.

Bundle::SOAP   cmpO  SOAP/Perl language mapping                    ??

There are currently 14 modules in the bundle (if you need one line
descriptions for all 14 I can certainly provide them, please let me know -
I'm a newbie to the CPAN contributor world :-).

SOAP
  ::Defs.pm
  ::Dispatcher.pm
  ::Envelope.pm
  ::EnvelopeMaker.pm
  ::GenericInputStream.pm
  ::GenericHashSerializer.pm
  ::GenericScalarSerializer.pm
  ::OutputStream.pm
  ::Packager.pm
  ::Parser.pm
  ::TypeMapper.pm

SOAP::Transport::HTTP
  ::Apache.pm
  ::Client.pm
  ::Server.pm

Various versions of this code has been released, discussed, and used by lots
of folks on the SOAP mailing list (there are about 725 folks subscribed as
of today). To visit the mailing list, go to http://discuss.develop.com and
ask for the SOAP list server.

Please let me know how to proceed. CPAN is the logical place to distribute
these bits, and I think lots of folks will find them useful. Hopefully
others will contribute to their development as well (I've been the sole
author so far, and I'd LOVE some help :-)
