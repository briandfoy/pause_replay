Subject: taking over maintenance when maintainer is not responding

Hi,

lately I was trying to overtake maintenance for Mail::Folder from Kevin
Johnson as William suggested in this list. However, Kevin so far did not
respond to any of my mails that I sent within the last five weeks.
Question now is what to do. I am sure that anyone seeking support for
his module will encounter the same fate which makes Mail::Folder plain
unmaintained. The fact that the Perl community did not hear anything
from Kevin for the last four years also points to that.

I know it is probably a little crucial to just pass maintenance over to
me without the original author knowing about it. I'd like to know what
the PAUSE-guys think about this matter and whether I should perhaps keep
trying to contact the author (but then, how long?).

Regards,
Tassilo
