I am enhancing one of my CPAN modules and have a need to convert
state/province codes to there full name and vice versa.
I have found a module that does all this, Geography::States.
Unfortunately, it only exists in the user's home directory, ABIGAL.
There is no name space for Geography. 

Has this category not been approved? There is also overlap with the
Locale name space. There is a module called Locale::US but it only
works for US and is not easily extended. Perhaps Locale::States would
be a better name for Geography::States.

I would appreciate some feedback, as I don't like referencing modules 
that are hard for people to find.
