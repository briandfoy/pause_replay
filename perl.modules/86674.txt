Hi Casey,

There's a really long-standing bug in File::Pid that causes it to break
at runtime with Perl versions 5.12 and newer (possibly 5.10 and newer).
Details are in this ticket, filed in April 2006:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18960

There's a one-line patch in the comments, posted in February 2011; could
you possibly apply it please?

Thanks and regards,
Denny
