Hey Guys!

I think this is a wonderful idea.  In fact this was one of the reasons I
chose to base Net::AIM on the  Net::IRC module.  I wanted to build
upon work that was already done. Also I've used, customized and  made
minor contributions to Net::IRC. I tried to just rewrite the Connection
class.  This way people who have Net::IRC scripts should be able to easily
port them to also use Net::AIM or perhaps use them both by simply changing
the ::Connection.

Anyway something like Net::IM sounds like a great idea or unifying
everything like was mentioned earlier.  How do we want to start and
coordinate everything?

Oh, and btw I'm in Lawrence about 4 days a week.

:a)
