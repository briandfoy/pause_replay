The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Homology::InterologWalk
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Retrieve putative PPIs through Interologs
  userid:      GGALLONE (Giuseppe Gallone)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules, Bioperl-l mailing list, ensembl-dev mailing
    list, intact-developers mailing list

  similar:

  rationale:

    A common activity in computational biology is to mine
    protein-protein interactions from publicly available databases in
    order to build Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) datasets. In many
    instances, however, the number of experimentally obtained annotated
    PPIs is very scarce and it would be helpful to enrich the
    experimental dataset with high-quality, computationally-inferred
    PPIs. Such computationally-obtained dataset can extend, support or
    enrich experimental PPI datasets, and are of crucial importance in
    high-throughput gene prioritization studies, i.e. to drive
    hypotheses and restrict the dimensionality of many gene functional
    discovery problems. The present Perl Module,
    Bio::Homology::InterologWalk, is aimed at building putative PPI
    datasets on the basis of a number of comparative biology paradigms:
    the module implements a collection of computational biology
    algorithms based on the concept of "orthology projection". If
    interacting proteins A and B in organism X have orthologs A' and B'
    in organism Y, under certain conditions one can assume that the
    interaction will be conserved in organism Y, i.e. the A-B
    interaction can be "projected through the orthologies" to obtain a
    putative A'-B' interaction. The pair of interactions (A-B) and
    (A'-B') are named "Interologs".

    Bio::Homology::InterologWalk collects, analyses and collates gene
    orthology data provided by the Ensembl Consortium (www.ensembl.org)
    as well as PPI data provided by EBI Intact
    (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/). It provides the user with the
    possibility of rating the quality and reliability of the putative
    interactions collected, by means of confidence scores, and
    optionally outputs network representations of the datasets,
    compatible with the biological network representation standard,
    Cytoscape.

    The module namespace choice has been discussed on the Bioperl
    mailing list, and has been deemed sound and approved by experts in
    the bioperl community.

    No similar projects have been found to exist.
