Dear=2C

I am Dr=2E Jerry Gana=2C Personal Assistant to Alhaji Rewani Lukeman=2C the
Presidential Adviser on Petroleum Matters=2E My message to you is based 
on some money that floated into the Government treasury due to the recent 
boom in the International Oil Market=2E

The Federal Government of Nigeria budgeted US$18=2E00 per barrel in last 
Year budget=2C but the price was changed in the international oil market where 
a barrel was sold between US$28-US$35=2E00=2E We recorded Excess gain=2C 
and all these could not be accounted for=2C hence some executive members 
in the Petroleum Ministry decided to take away the sum of 
US$18=2C532=2C700=2E00=2C =28Eighteen Million Five Hundred and Thirty Two 
Thousand Seven Hundred United States Dollars=29 to an offshore 
account of a foreign National or company=2E

Please we are not contacting you because we cannot do this business 
on our own successfully=2C but because we are not allowed to operate 
foreign accounts as civil servants=2C that is why we are looking for a 
foreigner we can use and knowing fully well that as a white man=2C the 
movement of the fund will raise no doubt that is why we have 
decided to contact you=2E

If you are interested to assist us=2C please let me have your personal
telephone=2C fax and email address=2C so that I can furnish you with further 
details on the modalities of the transfer of the fund into your bank account=2E 
Please you are advised to keep this matter to your self=2C as we do not want 
it to be exposed in order not to jeopardize our chances of succeeding=2E 
Let it be known to you that this transaction is hundred percent risks free 
and your security has been well taken care off=2E If you are interested in this 
transaction=2C call me immediately through my private telephone 
number 234-80-330 44202 or send me a email 
to jjerrygana=5Fcontact002=40soon=2Ecom for further clarifications=2E
