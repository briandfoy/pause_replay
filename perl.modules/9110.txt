Crap. [1]

Ok, then if it's going to stay there has to be a way for quicker
resolution of flubs than going through this list.  I've currently got
four indexing/ownership problems with no responses from this list:

    Ima::DBI
    URI::Find
    base
    fields

and TELS has two

    Math::BigInt
    Math::BigFloat

and not for lack of posting here.  I'm sure there are lots of others.

Perhaps a simple PAUSE form where you can say "I own the cannonical
version of Foo::Bar".  This puts your next version of Foo::Bar on
02packages instead of someone else's and emails all other authors of
Foo::Bar that you've done so.

It lets CPAN authors resolve indexing mistakes and ownership transfer
mistakes faster and amongst themselves.  I think CPAN authors are
responsible enough to handle that.


[1] That's the first form of crap with the implied "my idea is".
