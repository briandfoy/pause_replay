The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filesys::DfPortable
  DSLIP:       Rdhfp
  description: Portable way to obtain filesystem info.
  userid:      IGUTHRIE (Ian Guthrie)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    none

  similar:
    Filesys::Df Win32::AdminMisc

  rationale:

    Currently there is a module to obtain information about Unix
    filesystems (Filesys::Df), and a module to obtain information about
    filesystems on Windows (Win32::AdminMisc). There is no module which
    offers a portable way to obtain filesystem information from both
    Unix and Windows systems.

    I currently own Filesys::Df, Filesys::Statvfs, and Filesys::Statfs.
    Since I have been keeping track of these over the years I have
    noticed that people keep requesting a module that will work on both
    Windows and Unix systems. Filesys::DfPortable does exactly this.

    The module should work with all versions of Windows (95 and up),
    all flavors of Unix, Mac OS X (Darwin, Tiger, etc), and Cygwin. This
    should cover the majority of systems Perl is used on.

    For maximum portability the module uses XS to call
    GetDiskFreeSpaceA() or GetDiskFreeSpaceEX() if it is a Windows
    version, and statvfs() or statfs() if it is a flavor of Unix.

    DESCRIPTION This module provides a portable way to obtain
    filesystem disk space information. The module should work with all
    versions of Windows (95 and up),all flavors of Unix, Cygwin, and Mac
    OS X (Darwin, Tiger, etc). dfportable() requires a directory
    argument that represents the filesystem you want to query. There is
    also an optional block size argument so the you can tailor the size
    of the values returned. The default for blocksize is 1, this will
    cause the function to return the values in bytes. If you never use
    the block size argument then you can think of anyinstance of
    "blocks" in this document to really mean "bytes". The values
    returned are as followed: blocks = Total blocks for the filesystem.
    bfree = Total blocks free on the filesystem. bavail = Total blocks
    available to the user executing the Perl application. This can be
    different than bfree if you have per-user quotas on the filesystem,
    or if the super user has a reserved amount. bavail can also be a
    negative value because of this. If the dfportable() call fails for
    any reason, it will return undef and set $!. This will probably
    happen if you do anything crazy like try to get the disk space for
    /proc, or if you pass an invalid filesystem argument, or if there is
    an internal error. dfportable() will croak() if you pass it a
    undefined value.

The resulting entry would be:

Filesys::
