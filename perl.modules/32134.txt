     why:

    Right now, I've just got a simple module to edit the /etc/hosts
    file. It seems silly, but there don't appear to be any modules to
    read /etc/hosts .

    Future modules would tend to be systems administration-related. I
    try to follow conventions as much as possible and endeavor to submit
    modules only when there is an unfilled need.

    I would rate myself as an "adept/hacker" on Tom Christiansen's
    "Seven Steps to Perl Mastery." Please contact me if you need more
    information.
