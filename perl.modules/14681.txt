Hullo,

I have got some code which I would like to contribute to the CPAN.

NAME => 'James Hugman'
EMAIL => 'jameshugman@email.com'
CPANID => 'JHUG'

My working title has been AI::GP, a module for genetic programming. It also does Genetic algorithms (as a subset of gp).

The module provides a framework to randomize and breed genotypes; more than one species is possible, and genotypes can be combined easily to make complex phenotypes. The design goal  has been: you look after the phenotype and I'll look after the genotype.

If possible, I would like to keep the name as AI::GP, but I can change it. Some alternatives may be AI::GeneticProgramming or AI::Genetic::Programming.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Many thanks, and regards,

James Hugman
