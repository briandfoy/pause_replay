Hi Neil,

I've now taken some time to review the code. You suggestion to drop the dis=
tribution altogether is  ok for me, as I do not recall even having written =
it (1996... 20 years ago!).
Thank you,

Yves

Hi Yves,

I=92m one of the PAUSE admins. I=92m still working on resolving conflicts c=
aused by PAUSE now considering CPAN package names case insensitively. This =
has left us with some situations where people are owners of namespaces prev=
iously considered distinct, and now considered the same.

You have ownership of packages =93Any=94 and =93Debug=94, which are part of=
 your llg distribution. These now clash with =93any=94 and =93DEBUG=94, whi=
ch are owned by other people. Your =93llg=94 distribution was last released=
 in 1996, and doesn=92t follow a lot of modern CPAN conventions.

The best way to resolve this would be to move these modules into the LLg na=
mespace. Or if you=92re not doing Perl these days, we could just drop the d=
istribution from CPAN, as it hasn=92t been installable on a good number of =
recent Perl releases:

	http://matrix.cpantesters.org/?dist=3Dllg+1.07

After either of these, I could then drop your permissions on the Any and De=
bug namespaces, resolving the conflict.

I=92m happy to do either of these steps for you, if you=92d like, as I=92m =
working through cases like this. PAUSE doesn=92t let situations like this o=
ccur any more, so I=92m trying to resolve all existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
