Hi Dave,

quoting your entire message in case Kartik doesn't see it on modules@:

That's entirely fair and sensible from my point of view as a PAUSE 
admin. It means my job's done and Kartik and you (& the other person to 
approach you) are left to discuss further developments amongst 
yourselves. This is more a matter of access to some VCS repository than 
a matter of who releases to CPAN.

The PAUSE admins really only need to come in either to fix broken 
permissions, transfer permissions in cases of maintainers gone totally 
missing, or mediation in case of strong disagreement.

Thanks to both of you for volunteering your time for writing and 
maintaining SDL_Perl!

Best regards,
Steffen
