Why do you think this was necessary?

For future cases a very good idea, but for already regulated cases it
might be better to keep the state they are in. AFAIK all the dead have
good custody at the moment.

I don't know about mail loops, I foremost care about the respect we
owe them.

Good ideas these too but we should let individuals who choose a
different style of custody do as they see fit. Unless, of course, they
are doing more harm than good.

Let's pond a little on the ideas before taking measures. At the moment
I think it would be best to revert the actions and reinstate Andy
Lester because he has done no wrong afaik. Maybe it was while you were
away? I seem to recall that Andy had taken over Nick's and Iain's
modules with the promise to "do the right thing" with them.
