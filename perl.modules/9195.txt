The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RedHat::Kickstart
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Generates RedHat Kickstart files
  userid:      PATRICK (Patrick Devine)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl

  similar:
    none yet

  rationale:

    This is a resubmit for the RedHat::Kickstart name space. I've
    posted it here before but no one accepted or rejected it.
    Previously, I had submitted it as System::Config but it was deemed
    that that was too generic, so I've gone to the other extreme.

  enteredby:   PATRICK (Patrick Devine)
  enteredon:   Tue Dec 11 02:52:38 2001 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RedHat::
::Kickstart       RdpOa Generates RedHat Kickstart files             PATRICK
