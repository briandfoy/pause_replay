     why:

    I work for an analytical company and a lot of my creations aren't
    needed or valued by the company so I thought I would release some
    over time to the world in case anyone is interested. I thought I'd
    start with a lightweight, object oriented, less problematic, and
    less "featured" version of Win32::Process called
    Win32::SimpleProcess that allowed me to keep the remainder of the
    hair I haven't already pulled out.

    kudos to CPAN

    Ted
