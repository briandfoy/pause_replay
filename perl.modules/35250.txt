Oh, the aesthetic doesn't refer to that I like how the module
looks or even necessarily how the resulting graph layout looks.
It refers to the idea behind the module: you give it 
"aesthetic criteria" like "nodes not close together", 
"eges short", "parents to the left of their children" with
a weight, and then it tries to find a layout satisfying the
aesthetic criteria you specified. It also has an extension
interface so you can define your own aesthetic forces.

It's based on aglo, http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/aglo/
(and aglo means "aesthetic graph layout, I just rearranged the
words a bit).
