We are students for electric engineering.
We have been asked for our project to make a diagram block for
a gui software.(2 solutions).

Now we need to choose and write module names for the diagram blocks.
modules that are common for few blocks together.

We would like to know how we write shortly and discritibly modules for
this task. for example some blocks are:...save...reporting...data edit...and 
more.

maybe somthing like:inputs, outputs,operations...

Please send me an example for task like this if you have any?
(together with theie digran blocks).

Thank's
Doron and Itamar.
