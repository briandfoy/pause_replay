     why:

    As a Perl developer and scrum master I am interested in becoming
    more involved in the Perl community. Myself, and my team are
    frequently making use of modules such as Moose, Dancer, Mojolicious,
    etc and plan to contribute when the opportunity arises.

    Also, I will be attending a CPAN workshop with brian d foy (thanks
    to Houston Perl Mongers) on July 31st 2014 and hope to have a PAUSE
    account in time for that. Thank you for your consideration!
