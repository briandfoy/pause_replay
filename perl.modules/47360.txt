The symantec namespace (unless it already exists or you expect to add a 
bunch of other modules) is probably unnecesary. In addition, if 
PCAnywhere every gets sold it becomes a problem.

Also, if the file type identifiers are pretty clear to most people that 
understand PCAnywhere, then probably just the file types would do.

So perhaps PCAnywhere::CHF/BHF/CIF  (if you plan to later write more 
complex PCAnywhere-related module that go beyond ONLY working with the 
files) or perhaps Parse::PCAnywhere::CHF/BHF/CIF if you just want to 
deal with the files and only the files.
