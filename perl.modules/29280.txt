The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Graphics::ColorObject
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: transform colors between color spaces
  userid:      AIZVORSKI (Alex Izvorski)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:

  similar:
    Image::Colorimetry

  rationale:

    Graphics::ColorObject is a module that does color-space
    conversions, for example between RGB, HSV, and CMYK, but also much
    more complex ones like NTSC-RGB to PAL-RGB, or daylight to
    fluorescent light. I've just completed a rewrite that adds some
    major new features, in particular support for the CIE (Commission
    Internationale d'Eclairage) perceptually-linear color spaces, and
    support for the different standard RGB spaces. The number of
    supported color spaces is now up to 27, with accurate conversion
    possible from any one of them to any other one. I think that as the
    largest (and most complex ;) color-handling module out there, it
    belongs on the list, especially since the list already has a
    placeholder for that functionality (Image::Colorimetry).

    BTW I'm open to any suggestions for a better name. Using "Object"
    in the name is arguably bad practice. Some other possible names
    would be "Graphics::Colorspace" which has been mentioned on this
    mailing list before; or "Graphics::ColorTransform". However, perhaps
    simply "Graphics::Color" would be best, because the instances of it
    you make with new() are just colors, not spaces or transforms, and
    you can actually say $c = new Graphics::Color("orange");

    This module has actually been around for a fairly long time
    (originally called Color::Object since March 2001, and
    Graphics::ColorObject since January 2003), but somehow it hasn't
    made it into the module list yet. Earlier versions up to 0.3a2 were
    written by AREIBENS (thanks!!).

    Related modules: Image::Colorimetry by JONO which is in the
    modulelist would appear to do many of the same things, but it is not
    actually available in CPAN and I'm not sure it's ever been released
    (status cpdO, i.e. under construction). There are a few other
    modules that do simple color conversions between just a couple of
    spaces, usually RGB and HSV (e.g. Graphics::RGBManipulate,
    Imager::Color, and Color::Calc)

The resulting entry would be:

Graphics::
