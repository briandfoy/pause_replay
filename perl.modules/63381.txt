Subject: Module submission Bloom::Filter::XS

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bloom::Filter::XS
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: A fast Bloom filter implementation
  userid:      AXIAK (Michael Axiak)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    It's forked from Bloom::Faster. I haven't been able to contact the
    authors, and it's different enough that it deserves a fork

  rationale:

    I never liked Bloom::Faster. Bloom::Filter is a good name for a
    Bloom filter module, but this one uses XS, so it makes logical sense
    to call it Bloom::Filter::XS. Much in the same vein as JSON::XS,
    Heap::Simple::XS, and many other modules.

    This module is nearly a rewrite of Bloom::Faster. A list of
    features that distinguish it from Bloom::Faster: - Supports 64-bit
    machines - Developed by a person whose email address will not die
    tomorrow. - Supports filters in shared memory - Supports
    writing/reading the filter to disk - Supports writing/reading the
    filter to a PERL string.

    It's been in use where I work for a little over 3 months now, and
    it'd be nice to have it in CPAN so that others can use it and we can
    upgrade it on our boxes along with the other modules.

The resulting entry would be:

Bloom::Filter::
::XS              bdhOp A fast Bloom filter implementation           AXIAK
