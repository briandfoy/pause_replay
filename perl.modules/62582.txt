The better idea is to change their email adress, then they can use the
lost password mechanism to re-introduce themselves to the system. The
problem with this is "only" that you have no prove that the user
asking is not authenticated and you must find your own rules of thumb
when to believe what they say. One interesting data point is the "last
time logged in" entry in the database which you can see by visiting
the user's credentials page. Users who have recently logged in most
probably have not lost their password:)

Which is only useful for those that seem unreachable, not for those
who have no password.
