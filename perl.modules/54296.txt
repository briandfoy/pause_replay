     why:

    I plan to contribute a set of modules which will make it easier for
    users to create html content, without actually writing any html. The
    usage will be similar to GTK, with a set of widgets that work for
    any browser (from basic ones like buttons and entries, to trees and
    iconboxes). The whole project uses the prototype and scriptaculous
    javascript libraries, and provides an easy way to set up ajax calls.
    It'll be called IWL (the Internet Widget Library).
