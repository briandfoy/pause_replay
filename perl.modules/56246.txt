Hi Oliver,

I was just going to try to contact Karl Ward one last time before giving
you co-maintainer status, but in the process of finding Karl's CPAN ID,
I noticed that he had just released a new version of the module on
September 8th.

Can we regard this issue as resolved?

Best regards,
Steffen Müller
