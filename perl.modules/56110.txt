Doesn't exist. A find (over a backpan?) only shows us the
distributions but we do not know which modules are in them.

What would you reindex? Everything? This would probably cause more
grief. I'm pretty sure we do have distributions that shall not be
reindexed.

Very nice script and a good start but what do you propose as a next
step? There are plenty of things in there that need individual
treatment.

My current thinking is we should take the list produced by your script
and harvest the low hanging fruits manually. But if you see a pattern
how we can proceed programmatically, let me know. Maybe we could write
mails to the owners and tell them if they'd veto such and such
deletions and if they do not veto within a certain time we actually
delete the items. What would you imagine?
