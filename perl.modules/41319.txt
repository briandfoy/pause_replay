Class::Frame    Rdphp    Class template with default constructor and =
accessors autogenerated    DENYSV

This module is a base skeleton class that automatically generate default =
constructor ( constructor accepts
class member names and init values ) and accessors for its subclasses. =
Its more handy than Class::Struct
in a way it doesn't require user to determine field type; handles all =
members in a same manner ( store scalar or
refrence to anything (object, array, etc)); can assign instance class =
members default values based on class declaration
automatically if no initial values supplied; allows to set member value =
to undef if it is needed.

I wrote this module for one of my projects and think that it might come =
usefull for Perl community
