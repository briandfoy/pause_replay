I agree that there shouldn't be this many old distributions on CPAN, but 
as far as I am concerned, I'm reluctant to delete them since the 
uploader can at all times do so via the PAUSE interface. I don't know 
whether he's unreachable or whether you have some kind of agreement with 
Adam or anything, but have you tried asking Sebastian to remove the old 
Catalyst's?

Best regards,
Steffen
