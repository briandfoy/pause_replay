But it is as close as you get without duplicating code from another
namespace. I could include a `while (<STDIN>) {}` loop if that would make 
you feel better about the namespace ;)

As I argued earlier IPC:: doesn't seem right so the namespace this would
belong is Shell:: . I can think of using something like Shell::JobControl,
but not of much else. Also as I stated earlier there are a lot of
precedents of including modules in the Shell:: namespace that do not as
such provide a shell, but provide functionality normally asociated with
shells. I think Shell::Jobs fits this category perfectly.

I asked for suggestions on various mailinglists, so far I haven't heard
any suggestion for another name; so maybe this name isn't perfect, but
unless I hear something better, I'm going to stick with it.
