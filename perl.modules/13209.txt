The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::Find::Rule
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Alternative interface to File::Find
  userid:      RCLAMP (Richard Clamp)
  chapterid:   10 (File_Names_Systems_Locking)
  communities:
    irc (rhizomatic #london.pm), use.perl.org
    (http://use.perl.org/~richardc/journal/6467)

  similar:
    File::Find - File::Find::Rule is a wrapper hoping to provide a
    simpler interface to locating files

  rationale:

    File::Find::Rule builds on the functionality of File::Find.

    It seems to usefully scratch the itch of others for a less obtuse
    interface for finding files - people really have issues with the
    form of callback File::Find requires you write.

  enteredon:   Wed Aug 14 22:36:10 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

File::Find::
::Rule            Rdphp Alternative interface to File::Find          RCLAMP
