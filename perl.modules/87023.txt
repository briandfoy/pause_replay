Hi David,

Thanks for the clarification. I've updated my blog post.
I've also updated the mechanism used to generate my adoption list, to =
take ADOPTME, HANDOFF and NEEDHELP into account: =

I've informed the small number of authors, and a couple have said =
they'll update their permissions.

Can one of the PAUSE admins add ADOPTME to the following please - they =
are part of Nick Ing-Simmons's dists but don't have ADOPTME on them:

          Tk::HTML
          Tk::HTML::Form
          Tk::HTML::Handler
          Tk::UserAgent
          Tk::Web
          Tk::Scope

Cheers,
Neil
