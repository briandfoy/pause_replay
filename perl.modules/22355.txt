Hello,

  I am interested in building a perl-based LDAP account system and I was
wondering what I might call it if I were to upload the final version to
CPAN?

  This system will use the Net::LDAP perl packages for LDAP functionality
and will have a portion that can be embedded into apache (via mod_perl)
for web administration.

  I am sorry if this email is not appropriate for this addres but please
let me know if it is or not.

Thank you,

-Tim
