The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Astro::Catalog
  DSLIP:       bdpOg
  description: Generic astronomical catalogue object
  userid:      AALLAN (Alasdair Allan)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    Astro:DSS Astro::ADS

  rationale:

    The Astro::Catalog module is a generic, object-orientated,
    astronomical catalogue. Subclasses provides access to the USNO-A2
    and Guide Star Catalogues hosted online at the ESO/ECF-ST archive
    site, it also provides read/write access to ARK CLUSTER format
    catalogue files.

    Due to it generic and extensible nature it is easily subclassed to
    provide access to other catalogue sources, for instance access to
    the Hipparchos and Tycho-2 catalogues could be easily added.
    Additonally the Catalog class itself is fairly vital for moving
    information about a stellar object around inside an OO perl program.

    The module is related to my own Astro::DSS and Astro::ADS modules
    which also give access to online astronomical databases. Neither of
    these are "catalogues" as such however, the Deep Sky Survey is just
    that, an imaging survey and the ADS is a publications archive, hence
    the new namespace.

    The module has already been released on Freshmeat and amougst the
    astronomical community interested in such things and has proved
    popular.
