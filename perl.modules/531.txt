I'm CCing this to ABIGAIL. One of the reasons why the module list
exists is that people can register ideas and plans early and avoid
duplication of effort. A consequence of that is that I cannot just
assign this namespace to you without asking the one who registered it
earlier.

May I ask you two to find an agreement about the namespace you can
both live with? Thanks!

Supposedly it's called Mail::SMIME?
