Hi there.  The current CPAN release of DBD-PgPP is 0.04, which has some
severe bugs.  One of them is in RT:

  http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=2535

This bug is marked 'Critical', and was created 5 months ago.  I've also
found several others:

  * All booleans are returned as values that Perl considers true
  * Empty strings in query results throw an exception
  * Trying to execute a prepared handle repeatedly throws an exception
  * In some cases, long messages sent by the server cause an infinite loop

At the end of July I sent reports of two of these bugs, including tests and
fixes, to the current maintainer (also CCed here).  Unfortunately, I haven't
had a response.

I've written tests and fixes for all of these bugs, and I'm ready to apply
for a PAUSE id, and to release a 0.05 version of DBD-PgPP which fixes them.
However, I thought it would be best to check with modules@perl.org first --
especially since DBD::PgPP is in the module list.

Any thoughts?
