The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Model::Poser
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Parsing and Manipulation of Poser files
  userid:      DODGER (Seán Cannon)
  chapterid:   18 (Images_Pixmaps_Bitmaps)
  communities:
    http://www.renderosity.com/messages.ez?ForumID=12356

  similar:

  rationale:

    First of all, I'm requesting a new top level namespace be created
    because the function and functionality of this module (as well as
    others that would fit into this namespace) have not yet been
    spproached to my knowledge. In the same way that Image::Magick paved
    its own place simply by dealing with a subject no one else had done
    much with, so shall this module attempt to bring the power of Perl
    to 3D modellers, starting with Poser and Wavefront OBJect file
    formats (these being the easiest to parse, as they are text-based)

    I'm recommending 3DModel as the top level namespace because 'Model'
    is too vague and '3D' is too broad (i.e., 3D might also encompass
    rendering engines and such and not be directly applicable to
    editing, creating, parsing and manipulating 3D models themselves).
    However, the PAUSE form will not allow me to recommend 3DModel as
    the top level, so I've filled in the above form with Model. I don't
    see any reason a number should not be used.

    As for the second level namespace, Poser is the name of a home 3D
    Animation program by Curious Labs and formerly by Metacreations. Two
    primary types of files are used by this program: Wavefront OBJ files
    (which I am intending to write a parser for at a later date and
    which future versions of this module will interact with), and Poser
    files which come in several different types. Of the latter, there
    are several mostly sorted by intended use -- the program itself will
    treat them identically except for small variatins based on where
    they were loaded from (for instance, an .HR2 hair file will load any
    prop the same as a .PP2 prop file, the only difference being that a
    .HR2 will remove the last .HR2 prop loaded and parented to the
    currently selected figure first). PP2 prop files and CR2 Figure
    files are treated identically when loaded.

    There's only one real difference in loading of these files (which
    depends on which of two general groups of files a file belongs to):
    There are Pose files and Load Files. Pose files (hands, faces,
    poses) apply to the currently selected figure and change properties
    of that figure on load, while Load files (figures, props, hair,
    cameras, lights and scenes) load new geometries or other actors into
    the scene.

    The syntax for the two types of files are identical, and a number
    of exploitations fo the code's looseness have been discovered and
    acted on by enterprising content developers to allow Poser to do
    things it was never really designed to do.

    This module would be able to read, modify, manipulate, and even
    create new Poser documents, as well as allowing for some additional
    sub-filetypes such as material libraries (which do not exist for
    Poser 4).

    It should be noted that Poser Pro Pack (essentially Poser 4.5) and
    Poser 5 do have a built-in Python interpreter. If anyone would like
    to work with me to make this module easily accessible to Python via
    some sort of interface, I'd be happy to talk to you. I don't know a
    thing about Python myself, so I don't know of its limitations or
    capabilities.

    The module is in development at a pre-release state of this time.
    It's slow going due to some frustrating inconsistencies in the
    syntax of Poser's markup language (incosistend block definition,
    inconsistent statement terminators). However, I've recently had a
    bit of a breakthrough and I am finally getting it to read Poser
    markup into a data structure and I can finally start getting
    somewhere B^)
