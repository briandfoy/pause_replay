     why:

    Hello, I have being using PERL since 1995. I'm an system
    integrator. I have partially implemented a workflow engine based on
    Wfmc 2.0 (http://www.wfmc.org/) using PERL. I notice that although
    there is a CPAN module on workflow, the XML file that describe the
    workflow is not a well known industrial standard. There are visual
    tools that can be used to generate Wfmc workflow description files.
    So I think it might be useful to share my experiences to those who
    do similar things like me.
