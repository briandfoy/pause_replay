So ... could we have some sort of standard response for this that can be
sent, which ends with "if you still want one, please reply to this and we'll
set you up" ?

I don't want to restrict them particularly but I also don't see a lot of
point creating accounts that will sit there looking bare and empty and sad
and lonely and probably result in a second request if the user ever actually
really needs one because they've forgotten about it entirely ...
