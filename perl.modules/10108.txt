Go to https://pause.perl.org/ , log in with your username and password,
and then choose "Apply for namespace registration" in the menu on the
left. Fill in the details of your module, click on "Submit to
modules@perl.org" at the bottom, and wait.

It may take some time for the module to be approved (maybe a week, maybe
six months); during that time, you can upload the module to CPAN but it
will not appear in the module list and you will not be able to edit the
module's metadata. Please wait.

Cheers,
Philip
