Wow, that's bad. I'm sorry, I was in a bit of hurry when I wrote that. 
It should have read:

The top level hierarchy "Number::" was chosen because there is 
precedence of remotely related modules in that namespace. I decided on 
"WithError" after thinking about what people would look for if they 
needed the functionality provided by the module. Using "Number::Error" 
would not convey as much that you "attach" errors to numbers, but rather 
that you deal with errors only.

The only real nitpick I have with that namespace is that it does more 
than just stick errors on numbers. It can do (correct!) scientific 
rounding and first and foremost correct error propagation in 
calculations without the user even thinking about it.

I'm sorry for the confusion.
