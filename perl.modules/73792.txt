Alan, thank you for stepping up and volunteering.  That's very
generous and a great way to honor Randy's memory.

As a procedural note, I would encourage you to post about your
intentions in various public forums (e.g. blog about it on
blogs.perl.org or on your own blog, post on Perl Monks, email
module-authors list, etc.) and see if anyone else feels strongly about
it like you do.  (This is the same thing that we'd ask of you if an
author were alive but not-responding.)  Assuming that no one objects,
please post back here in a week or two with a summary of your efforts
and we'll see about making the change.

-- David
