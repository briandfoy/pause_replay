I've reviewed the code in Agent.pm and I suppose the indexer didn't
like the fact that $VERSION evals to ".":

$VERSION =3D "$MAJORVERSION.$MINORVERSION$MICROVERSION";

The point here is that MakeMaker's take on finding the right version
number is by evaling this single line, not the lines before and after,
so concludes that it is ".".
