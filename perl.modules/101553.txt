I'm happy to allow anybody to take ownership of any of my CPAN modules.  I
am not doing much Perl lately and am unlikely to spend much if any time on
any of them any time soon.

Thanks,
Tye

<div dir=3D"auto">Hi,<br>
<br>
I=E2=80=99m one of the PAUSE admins, and I=E2=80=99m working on resolving d=

<br>
MJD did the first 5 releases, then NEDKONZ did 6 releases, and then TYEMQ d=

<br>
Curiously, we=E2=80=99re now in the situation where ANDREWC has first-come =
on Algorithm::Diff, and NEDKONZ and TYEMQ both have co-maint.<br>
<br>
But ANDREWC has never done a release of Algorithm-Diff; he has Algorithm::D=
iff::Apply, so I=E2=80=99m wondering Andrew, at some point did you include =
Algorithm::Diff in one of your releases?<br>
<br>
Algorithm::DiffOld was included in earlier releases of Algorithm-Diff, and =
still appears in the CPAN Index, because NEDKONZ has old releases in his au=
thor directory. I think we can get rid of this =E2=80=94 see below.<br>
<br>
Algorithm::Diff::_impl has first-come assigned to TYEMQ, and was included i=

<li>Transfer first-come on Algorithm::Diff from ANDREWC to TYEMQ.</li>
<li>If NEDKONZ still wants co-maint on this distribution, then add co-maint=

<li>I note as well that Algorithm::Diff could do with a bit of attention. T=
ye: If you don=E2=80=99t have the time or inclination to maintain it, would=
 you be happy for me to try and find an appropriate maintainer? There are q=
