Subject: Switching Maint/Co-maint on Catalyst::Plugin::Server::XMLRPC

Greetings,

I've been the co-maintainer of Catalyst::Plugin::Server::XMLRPC
for as long as it's been around; Michiel and I started this
project when we both worked at the same company many years ago.

Unfortunately, Michiel's not around anymore to do the maintenance
and I'd like for Jose to be able to contribute with uploads.

Could you please switch myself (KANE) to maintainer and MICHIEL
to co-maint?

Thanks,
