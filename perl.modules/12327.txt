The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RCS::Stat
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Development statistics from RCS files
  userid:      BENNIE (Phillip Pollard)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Mailing list (if interest is there)

  similar:

  rationale:

    Parses RCS files directly to trace code ownership over time. From
    that further statistics such as code churn, commit rates, and
    developer input can be measured.

    While there are other RCS modules in CPAN (RCS, RCS::Agent, and
    VCS::RCS::Parser), they do not do the work of tracking the code to
    produce statistics. Nor would it make sense for them to.

  enteredby:   BENNIE (Phillip Pollard)
  enteredon:   Tue Jun 25 17:35:55 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RCS::
::Stat            adpOa Development statistics from RCS files        BENNIE
