From: michael@shoebox.net (Michael Fowler)

I just completed a module that parses (and I use the term loosely) symbols
from a Perl script.  What it basically does is read in a specified file,
evals the file inside a specific namespace, then examines the namespace for
symbols and extracts the various things (or datatypes, if you prefer) into a
hash.
 
The only defined function (the module is used procedurally) is parse(),
exported as parse_perl_config(), which takes a list of key-value pairs as
its argument.
 
Currently I'm calling the module Parse::PerlConfig.  I notice the Parse::
hierarchy is taken up entirely by parser generators, and I'm beginning to
wonder about the appropriateness of the name.  Would Config::Perl be better?
 
It can be obtained at
"http://shoebox.net/software/archive/Parse-PerlConfig-0.01.tar.gz".

I recently posted a similar message to comp.lang.perl.modules and my local
Perl Mongers Group (anchorage.pm), but got no feedback regarding the module. 
I don't know if this is because people are unintersted, or if perhaps my
terminology is confusing.  However, I would still like to upload this to
CPAN, as I find it very useful, and I hope others might as well.
