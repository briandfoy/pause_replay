Hi James,

I=E2=80=99m emailing you wearing my PAUSE admin hat: I=E2=80=99m working =
on resolving conflicts caused by PAUSE now considering package names =
case insensitively. This has left us with some situations where two or =
more people are owners of namespaces previously considered distinct, and =
now considered the same.

You have ownership of gcc::node, which is part of your Introspector =
distribution. This now clashes with GCC::Node, which is owned by AWIN =
and part of the GCC-TranslationUnit distribution.

The best way to fix this would be to release a new version of =
Introspector, with the gcc:: modules changed to Introspector::gcc:: =
names. We could then drop the permissions on the gcc:: namespaces, which =
would resolve the conflict. Would you be happy to make these changes? If =
you don=E2=80=99t want to spend the time making these changes, would you =
be happy for me to get co-maint and release an updated version of =
Introspector?

PAUSE doesn=E2=80=99t let conflicts like this occur any more =E2=80=94 =
I=E2=80=99m tidying up the existing cases.

Cheers,
Neil
