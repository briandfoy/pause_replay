I prefer names that give away what they do. I bet that YARM isn't going
to mean anything to anyone. Perhaps your name could describe how your
particular scheme is different than the others.

I'm also not sure how routing has anything to do with HTTP. Looking at
your code, it looks like you are a level above HTTP actually. Once you
are in the application and deciding what to do based on the URL (or
other info), you aren't in HTTP land anymore.
