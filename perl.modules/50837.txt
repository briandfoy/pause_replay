From: cpan@ali.as (Adam Kennedy)

Unless anyone objects, I'd like to create a LOCAL user in the database 
specifically to reserve a CPAN author ID for use by systems that locally 
modify their CPAN repository, or do other tasks where any name they pick 
pick get taken in future by another author.

This allows an arbitrary number of local modified systems to manipulate 
or otherwise do things without all of them having to create real CPAN 
ids just to reserve them.
