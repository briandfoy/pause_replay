The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA
  DSLIP:       adhOp
  description: Digital Signature Algorithm using OpenSSL
  userid:      TJMATHER (T.J. Mather)
  chapterid:   14 (Security_and_Encryption)
  communities:

  similar:
    Crypt::DSA

  rationale:

    Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA provides an alternative to Crypt::DSA based on
    the openssl library. There are two advantages over Crypt::DSA -
    first, since it is just a thin XS wrapper around OpenSSL, it should
    be faster since almost all the code is C. Second, it is much easier
    to install, especially if you already have openssl installed. I was
    not able to get Crypt::DSA to install, because I couldn't get the
    Pari library to compile.

The resulting entry would be:

Crypt::OpenSSL::
::DSA             adhOp Digital Signature Algorithm using OpenSSL    TJMATHER
