Hi,

A few days ago I submitted a pull request against LZAP's version of this
module on Github since he's the last known maintainer.

This morning I got a message from him stating that he was no longer the
maintainer, and that if I was interested I should clone it on CPAN and
upload a new version.

Interestingly, he deleted his repo shortly afterwards, so now I feel a
bit like I'm left with a hot potatoe. :-)

So anyway, I wasn't aware the CPAN did the clone thing (and I'm still
not), so I just did it the old fashioned way. What do I need to do to
get this up?

Regards,
Rick
