The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::MicroMason
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Simplified HTML::Mason Templating
  userid:      EVO (M, Simon Cavalletto)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Posted to mason-users list and comp.lang.perl.modules.

  similar:
    HTML::Mason

  rationale:

    The HTML::Mason module provides a useful syntax for dynamic text
    template interpretation (sometimes called embedded scripting): plain
    text (or HTML) containing occasional chunks of Perl code whose
    results are interpolated into the text when the template is
    "executed."

    However, HTML::Mason also provides a full-featured web application
    framework, and sometimes I'd like to use this capability without
    configuring a full Mason installation.

    You may well be thinking "yet another dynamic templating module?
    Sheesh!" And you'd have a good point. There certainly are a variety
    of templating toolkits on CPAN already.

    Nonetheless, I think this module occupies a useful niche: it
    provides a reasonable subset of HTML::Mason syntax in a very
    light-weight fashion. MicroMason uses one eval per parse, converts
    the template to an cacheable unblessed subroutine ref, eschews
    method calls, and contains just 70-ish lines of Perl.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
