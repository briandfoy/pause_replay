Description: DBI driver DBD::JDBC
Module description: bdoO  DBI proxy driver for JDBC

Questions about this module, including a question about the
suitability of the name, were posted to dbi-dev. This module is
also going to be distributed by a database vendor as their DBI
module (for various and sundry reasons including the lack of a
desire on anyone's part to rewrite a SQL parser for this non-SQL
database when there already was one in the JDBC driver).
