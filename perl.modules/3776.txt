Hi all,

I would like to ask to create the Speech top level name space.
We have speech recognizers and synthesizers, and would like
to put them in a coherent space.


Speech
  Speech::Synthesizer
     Speech::Synthesizer::Festival
  Speech::Recognizer
     Speech::Recognizer::Sphinx

and possibly
  Speech::Synthesizer::Interface
  Speech::Recognizer::Interface

in a way similar to DBI/DBD.  Any feedback on this would
be most welcome!  We'll want to have several different
recognizers and synthesizers in there, though, and 
different implementations of the interface.  For instance,
there would be a CMU place for Sphinx bindings to Perl,
but Cepstral may provide bindings under a different name.

This is actually the case right now -- Cepstral, LLC 
(me, Alan, and dhd) want to provide an interface to 
Sphinx that we can't call "Sphinx" due to license 
restrictions.  CMU wants to hold the name "Sphinx" as
it applies to anything sphinx-related, so Cepstral
can't use it.  So CMU would like to have a stub module
there so that no one else will release bindings called
"Sphinx" for the Sphinx engine, but Cepstral wants to
release the (already written) bindings for the speech
recognition engine to Perl.

Furthermore, we'd like to put out good Perl bindings
for Festival, FestVox, and the Edinburgh Speech Tools.

Asking for your help naming these things,
