Here's what Rob Kinyon emailed me after granting me permission for Tree:

Record update in the PAUSE modules database:

        modid: [Tree]
        statd: [R]
        stats: [m]
        statl: [p]
        stati: [O]
        statp: [p]
  description: [A tree datastructure]
       userid: [RSAVAGE] was [RKINYON]
    chapterid: [6]
     mlstatus: [list]

Data entered by Rob Kinyon (RKINYON).
Please check if they are correct.

Here's what Stevan Little emailed me after same with Tree::Binary:

You should be all good (see PAUSE output below).

Keep in mind however that the Tree::Binary it is complaining about (and 
the one I gave you permissions for) is actually this 
(https://www.metacpan.org/module/Tree::Binary) and not the one in Tree 
itself.

This was something Rob and I never really sorted out, ultimately the 
Tree one was supposed to replace the Tree::Binary one, but the Tree one 
was never complete enough to replace Tree::Binary.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of Tree::Binary::Search::Node.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of Tree::Binary::Visitor::Base.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of 
Tree::Binary::Visitor::BreadthFirstTraversal.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of Tree::Binary::Visitor::InOrderTraversal.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of 
Tree::Binary::Visitor::PostOrderTraversal.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of Tree::Binary::Visitor::PreOrderTraversal.

Added RSAVAGE to co-maintainers of Tree::Binary::VisitorFactory.

Firstly, it is not our intention to remove anyone from maint, just to 
add me.

So, if the same is done with Tree::Persist, that would be fine.

(4) The 2 modules called Tree::Binary, one within the Tree distro and 
the one within the Tree::Binary distro, will be fixed by me renaming the 
one in the Tree distro to Tree::Binary2, and changing various docs to 
explain.

Sure. There's no hurry :-).
