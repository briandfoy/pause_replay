I see, and I'm sorry to hear that.

Thanks.

OK. My plans for the module for the near future are:

1. Improve the Kwalitee and Quality of the distribution by adding README, 
t/pod.t, t/pod-coverage.t, etc.

2. Convert the PathFinder namespace ("package PathFinder;" in 
lib/XML/SemanticDiff.pm) to XML::SemanticDiff::PathFinder. That should be a 
minor change but will contribute to the distribution's namespace-purity.

3. Convert PathFinder to use object slots instead of global (but defined 
with "my") variables. This will be done by using closures that will pass 
$self (the controlling object instance) there. This is a relatively major 
architectural change - it won't change the algorithm, but will make the code 
more modular.

It will remain the same.

I sure hope you get better. Good medicine.
