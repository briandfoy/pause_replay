ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD 7.4M

Forgive my intrusion, if this message comes to you as a surprise, and if it might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this channel.

I am Mr. Godwin Ngozi, The Chairman, Contract Award Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS) with Headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria. I got your information when I was searching for a reliable, honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with. We wish to transfer the sum of SD7,400,000.00 (Seven Million Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) into your personal or company's bank account. This fund is a residue of the over-invoiced contract bills awarded by us for the supply of hard/softwares, pharmaceuticals / medical items, light and heavy duty vehicles, appeals and other administrative logistics e.t.c. for the ECOMOG in Sierras-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed-off..As the Chairman of CAC, I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the organisation. We arranged and over-invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from different countries during the crisis. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa. This is borneout of our belief in the non-stable and spurious political nature of this Sub-region. The original contractors have been duly paid by the (Central Bank of Nigeria) through our Disbursing Units abroad. This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice. We intend to pay out this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account. This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership in your country. It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 20% of the entire sum as compensation, 70% will be held on trust for us while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course of the transaction. This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days, if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation. 

You should provide the followings: 
1. Your Full Name & Contacts Address.
2. Your Banking Details.
3. Your Private Telephone & Fax Numbers.

Upon the receipt of these information, the documents and approval with the texts will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded to the organisation for ratification and subsequent payment. As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS, we solicit for your Unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business.

We hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable business life afterward. 

There are no risks involved. 

With regards,
Mr. Godwin Ngozi
