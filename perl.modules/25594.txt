The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RDF::Scutter
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Spiders for the Semantic Web
  userid:      MORTENF (Morten Frederiksen)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    http://rdfweb.org/mailman/listinfo/rdfweb-dev
    irc://irc.freenode.net#foaf

  similar:

  rationale:

    The RDF::Scutter package will provide a way for developers and even
    experienced users to easily write a spider for the Semantic Web.

    It is currently based on RDF::Redland, which provides RDF/XML
    parsing and storage. However, it is the intention to keep the
    integration at a level where other RDF libaries could be
    substituted.

    The namespace would also hold RDF::Scutter::Filter and
    RDF::Scutter::Consumer, to facilitate the usage of various different
    document types. Additional packages in these two namespaces would
    provide actual implementations, hopefully in a decentralized manner,
    with developers being able to easily submit e.g.
    RDF::Scutter::Filter::JPegExif and RDF::Scutter::Consumer::OPML.

    Current scutter implementations are mostly based on a wide array of
    privately crafted scripts, all of which only partially support the
    generally agreed upon requirements for a scutter, see
    http://rdfweb.org/topic/ScutterSpec , e.g. support for
    ETag/Last-Modified and robots.txt.

    It is the intention with this namespace and package complex to ease
    the task of writing a scutter substantially, hopefully leaving
    developers to focus on the collected data instead of the collecting
    process, and eventually leading the way towards a network of
    independent scutters that collaborate on spidering the Semantic Web.

The resulting entry would be:

RDF::
::Scutter         adpOp Spiders for the Semantic Web                 MORTENF
