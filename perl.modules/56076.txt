That's great, but I was wrong. What I'd also need is a list of all 
uploaded modules. Just the list of the PAUSE indexed ones (02...) 
doesn't help :/. The good news is that these would be uncovered by 
cleaning out the old registrations. They'd just be a reindexing away.

Anyhow. I'll append the hack I used to get the number of 736 registered 
namespaces without uploads by the registrant. That's shorter than 
including the list :)

Best regards,
Steffen
