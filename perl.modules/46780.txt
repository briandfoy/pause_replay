To whom it concerns,

Currently I have 2 registered name-spaces, "Rosetta" and 
"SQL::Routine", which I have decided to merge into one, "Rosetta".

The SQL::Routine module won't disappear, but is being renamed to 
Rosetta::Model, will be part of the core "Rosetta" name space, and 
will be distributed with "Rosetta".

Therefore, "SQL::Routine" no longer needs to have its own registered 
name-space, so I confirm my edit of the SQL::Routine meta-data to 
have it deleted from the database as a registered name space.

Since SQL::Routine never got past alpha status, and currently has no 
user base that I know of, I see no reason to delay or not perform 
this deletion.

If you want the rationale for the rename, see the following two posts:

Thank you. -- Darren Duncan
