No idea yet, probably Convert::DVB::somethings or so. But that is of no
concern really as this has time until such a module (-family) evolves,
which might or might not be near, but has nothing to do with the current
question.

Well, if you know better, then it must be true. It's just that I cannot
imagine that the Linux-DVB driver API will ever be non-linux specific...

This is fine. I won't stop other people from either writing their own
non-os-specific dvb processing modules nor from adding such modules by
sending me patches.

This has, of course, nothing to do with the fatc that Linux::DVB is and
ever will be linux-specific.

You are confused, though, the Linux namespace already exists and
contains a lot of moduels that are linux-specific, sich as Linux::LVM,
Linux::TunTap etc.

Although some functionality might, if warranted, later become a
non-linux-specific module, this module is and ever will be highly
linux-specific. And even if many of these modules acre for services thate
xist similarly on other operating systems, it simply makes no sense to
make them generic, as they refer to an _OS-specific API_.

According to your logic, we would rename Win32::MIDI to Audio::MIDI or
similar, just because, in the future, it might be anticipated that some
win32 midi modules might become general use, or because wine exists that
can (probably) emulate that API.

I seriously doubt that this is a service to anybody, as people would try
to install such a generic module only to find out that you need wine and
the windows header files (and maybe specific drivers for windows, which
wine doesn't support anyways), and would quickly be frustrated by a lousy
naming scheme.

This is true. However, can you point me to the relevant DVB documents that
describe and standardize the Linux-DVB API? I think you cannot.

You confuse the people that designed the Linux-DVB API with the people who
create the DVB standards board. You *misinterpret* the quote you made. If I
were to argue like you do, I could just as well argue that every TV set is
supposed to run Linux. Heck, that would be great, but it simply doesn't
reflect reality and cannot be rad out of that quote...

You also insist on "the broader topic", but nothing stops people from
creating DVB::* or Convetr::DVB::* or whatever modules that care for DVB
encoding.

Even I might do it at one point. But these modules will _not_ be
linux-specific, and therefore would probably not go under the Linux
hierarchy.

I think you are an exception, though. I don't know many people who equate
Linux-DVB and DVB without at least doing some further research...
