The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       SCORM::Package
  DSLIP:       idpOp
  description: Perl interface to SCORM XML Packages
  userid:      LGODDARD (Lee Goddard)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    BBC Digital Curriculum

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm currently working in a team developing the British
    public/private sector online learning service, the Digital
    Curriculum.

    It is all SCORM based, and my side of it is the loading of SCORM
    packages into the BBC's environment, naturally in Perl.

    We are using standard SCORM, so it seems natural enough to use
    virgin SCORM::* namespace; but at the moment, I don't think I'll be
    providing anything other than package reading/writing, so
    SCORM::Package seems logical.

    Any thoughts?

The resulting entry would be:

SCORM::
