     why:

    In a converstation that was CCed to modules@perl.org, Andreas J
    König agreed that I would take over CGI::Lite.

    (Yes, I know "Smylers" isn't what it says on my birth certificate
    -- and I've read the archived thread on 'Chocolate Boy' -- but it
    isn't my 'internet alias' or anything like that. It's what I'm known
    as in the real world too -- I've been called it for years before I
    heard of the net, it's what I introduce myself as to neighbours or
    people in bars. As such, it's what I'm called and it would seem
    silly for my author page on search.cpan.org to display a name by
    which most people don't know me.)
