The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       DataCube
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: OLAP cubing in pure Perl
  userid:      DAVEGMX (Dave Williams)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    project codenamed blackbear refers to a pure perl data cubing
    engine. It is high performance, and works well on data sets with
    billions of records. The goal is nothing less than a revolution in
    the way we approach data and OLAP cubes. As my friend Damien likes
    to say, Blackbear goes beyond cube deployment; it makes them
    "programmable". I seek to put the power of data cubing firmly in
    your hands.

The resulting entry would be:

DataCube          adpOp OLAP cubing in pure Perl                     DAVEGMX
