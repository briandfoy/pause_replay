The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::DNSBL::Client
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Module for efficiently querying DNSBLs
  userid:      DSKOLL (David F. Skoll)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::RBL::Client Net::Blacklist::Client Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon

  rationale:

    Net::RBL::Client and Net::Blacklist::Client both have hard-coded
    DNSBL lists. Net::DNSBL::MultiDaemon is a very heavyweight solution.

    We needed a lightweight library that can efficiently query multiple
    DNSBLs. It must allow initiation of a query in one method, and
    retrieval of results in a separate method so the called can do work
    in between (if desired). And it also needs to handle IPv4 and IPv6,
    as well as DNSBLs whose returned A records encode meanings, either
    as bit-masks or specific A values.

    Net::DNSBL::Client meets all of the above requirements.

  enteredby:   DSKOLL (David F. Skoll)
  enteredon:   Fri Feb 19 03:51:41 2010 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Net::DNSBL::
::Client          RdpOp Module for efficiently querying DNSBLs       DSKOLL
