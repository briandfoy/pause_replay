The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::Random
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: Generate random programs with BNF syntax
  userid:      WSNYDER (Wilson Snyder)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    www.veripool.com/verilator.html

  similar:

  rationale:

    There are many random packages, but none that make generation of
    random *programs* or text very easy.

    This package allows you to specify in a BNF like way what the
    different choices are, then based on weights follow that BNF to
    generate random programs.

    This will start as a generic extraction from a bunch of standalone
    scripts that do similar things.

  enteredby:   WSNYDER (Wilson Snyder)
  enteredon:   Tue Feb 28 21:03:31 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::Random          cdpOp Generate random programs with BNF syntax     WSNYDER
