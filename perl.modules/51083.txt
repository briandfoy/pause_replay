Subject: Module submission TAMeb::Admin

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       TAMeb::Admin
  DSLIP:       bdhOa
  description: OO interface to TAM
  userid:      MIKFIRE (Michael Firestone)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    TAM::Admin

  rationale:

    The product is formally known as Tivoli Access Manager for
    e-Business. It is usually just called TAM. This module provides an
    interface into the Administration APIs.

    There is already a module named TAM::Admin available. It is not a
    complete implementation of the APIs nor is it particularly OO. I
    have asked the owner of that namespace to either allow me to have it
    or combine our projects. He has done neither.

    Therefore, I am asking for a new namespace

The resulting entry would be:

TAMeb::
::Admin           bdhOa OO interface to TAM                          MIKFIRE
