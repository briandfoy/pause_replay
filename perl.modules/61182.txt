Since I know that Rafael is enjoying the advantages of having forked, and I 
know that Nicholas is exceptionally busy,  I'm happy to post to 
modules@perl.org when progress occurs here.  Knowing that I need pumpking 
approval is the main thing I wanted to confirm.

I'll keep making dev releases in the meantime.  My personal milestone is to 
ensure autodie has an official release by OSCON (21st July), because that 
will give me a chance to demo it at tutorials and lightning talks.

Cheerio,

	Paul
