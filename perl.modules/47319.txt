We didn't hear from him either, so it's certainly in the best to make
you co-maint now.

At least it doesn't look like a bug to me. On module names more
strictness, on distribution names less. Note that CPAN.pm is stricter
than search.cpan.org, but the reason is just rather the intent to
avoid complexity.

It's done. You can now either upload a new version or re-index your
latest through the PAUSE menu.
