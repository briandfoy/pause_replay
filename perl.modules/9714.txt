That's true, but it might work in the same way that "Win32" does. There,
of course, is no Windows 32 product, but rather a family of them that can
be described as Win32. Mac OS X is clearly a big break with what preceded
it, and presumably Mac OS XI (or whatever it will be) will evolve from
what we have now, rather than be another fundamental break. For lack of a
better generic name for this new family of Mac systems, MacOSX might have
to do -- though I'd be interested in better suggestions. Aqua? Darwin?
