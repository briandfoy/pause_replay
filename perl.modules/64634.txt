The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RDF::RDFa::Parser
  DSLIP:       bdpOo
  description: Parser for RDFa in XHTML
  userid:      TOBYINK (Toby Inkster)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    (I tried registering this a month or so ago, but nothing seems to
    have happened, so trying again...)

    There is already an RDF::* namespace, this module just adds a
    second-level namespace.

    RDFa is a serialisation of RDF - it makes sense for RDFa to have a
    second-level namespace within RDF as it is probable that RDFa writer
    modules will be uploaded at some point, and it would be useful to
    group them within a namespace.

  enteredby:   TOBYINK (Toby Inkster)
  enteredon:   Thu Feb 19 23:03:49 2009 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RDF::RDFa::
::Parser          bdpOo Parser for RDFa in XHTML                     TOBYINK
