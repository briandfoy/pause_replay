The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       aLid
  DSLIP:       Rdpng
  description: Automatic Logging Intrusion Detection system
  userid:      MARTIRE (andrea.martire)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    University of Calabria

  similar:
    CGI::IDS

  rationale:

    aLid stands for Automatic Logging Intrusion Detection system. I
    have developed this program for my thesis at University of Calabria.
    It's based on log analysis; It can block or redeem hosts detected.
    It use iptables. It is made up of scripts that intercept 5 type of
    port scanning, a component for detecting single event and stateful
    event (many event in sequence), a component for monitoring arp
    activity and control couple Ip/Mac address. It have a manual (POD
    syntax) in english and in italian.

    I think it is a good job and I want share this with cpan community.
