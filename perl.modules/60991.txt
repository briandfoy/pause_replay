Is it really implementing more taint checks, or just being paranoid?

That is, will it complain about problems that don't involve tainted
data?

Also, on the PERL5SHELL issue, maybe that's something that Perl should
already do. What does p5p think? :)

I'm not sure that the Taint::More name is the best, but I can't think
of a better one tight now.
