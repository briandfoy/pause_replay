The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MP3::M3U::Parser
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Perl extension for parsing m3u mp3 lists.
  userid:      BURAK (Burak Gürsoy)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Mailinglists, newsgroups, chatrooms, CVS repository

  similar:
    MP3::M3U

  rationale:

    My module just parses the M3U song list. It does not check the
    existence of the songs.

    It parses one list or all the lists in a directory. The parsed data
    is a complex structure like:

    $parsed = { CDNAME => [['ID3 NAME','SECONDS','FULLPATH']]]};

    It parses EXTINF lines (where MP3::M3U just ignores them) in a
    playlist to get the 'ID3 NAME' and 'SECONDS' data, if it does not
    exist they will be empty.

    Also there are some methods to get some info of the songs like:
    total_time, total_songs, average_time etc...

    Also I've added an export() method to show the parsed data in a
    visual context (html) it can also export the data to a xml file for
    using in other applications.

    Also there is a basic case-insensitive search option to filter the
    parsing.

    So, it is totally different (and has more options) than the
    MP3::M3U module and I want to name it MP3::M3U::Parser (I think that
    there is not a problem since there are billions of pod parsers doing
    the same thing :)).

The resulting entry would be:

MP3::M3U::
::Parser          bdpOp Perl extension for parsing m3u mp3 lists.    BURAK
