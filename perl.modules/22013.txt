Hi,

I registered a new module namespace recently (Win32-UTCFileTime, 
user-id: SHAY) and have since uploaded two versions of that module. 
 Both have been indexed OK, but when I login to PAUSE and go to "Edit 
Module Metadata" I find that this module is not in my list.  Should it be?

The text at the top of that page says:

"The select box shows all the modules that have been registered for user 
SHAY officially via modules@perl.org, i.e. that are included (or about 
to be included) in the module list. If you are missing certain pieces, 
please let modules@perl.org know"

Well, I've registered it officially, so presumably it will be included 
in the module list one day, but I note that the list hasn't been updated 
for nearly a year!  Can I not edit the metadata until it is actually in 
the module list?  The above seems to suggest that I'll be able to edit 
it as soon as it is registered, even if it is not yet listed.

Thanks,

Steve
