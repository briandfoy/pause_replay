Hello

I have visited your site and I was wandering if you
would be interested in some real-time tools to show
stock quotes or other information on your site.

Please visit http://www.stockapplets.com to see part 
of the applets we have for sale

- real-time stocks ticker
- real-time stocks watchlist
- news ticker
- fx cross-rate applet

For these tools, we do not provide any data, we only offer 
specification for the feed they use and also for some
we offer scripts to get data from yahoo financial.

Regards, Gigel Chiazna
