Subject: Module submission Geo::PostalAddress

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Geo::PostalAddress
  DSLIP:       adpOb
  description: Country-specific postal address management
  userid:      PAUAMMA (M. Lavondes)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Lingua::EN::AddressParse.pm

  rationale:

    This module attempts to provide a country-specific (or
    country-localisable) and language-independent framework for handling
    postal addresses. Unlike Lingua::EN::AddressParse, it doesn't embed
    language-specific information beyond "use locale"-enabled regexes,
    so Lingua:: makes little sense as the root for this module. When
    trying to figure out a suitable root namespace, I initially selected
    Locale::, but was told that Geo:: is probably better.

    Also, some countries may require specific extensions to the
    framework, which I feel would best go under Geo::PostalAddress::
    using the 2-letter ISO 3166 country code as the module name. For
    that reason, I'd like to register both Geo::PostalAddress.pm and
    Geo::PostalAddress::.

    Note that I requested category 13, Internationalization Locale,
    even though other Geo:: modules are under 6 (Data Type Utilities) or
    23 (Miscellaneous Modules), as it seems to me that 13 fits the
    purpose of Geo::PostalAddress.pm better. However, I'm not going to
    insist on it, and I hereby grant PAUSE maintainers permission to
    move it to 23 if that's the only thing keeping my request from being
    granted.

The resulting entry would be:

Geo::
::PostalAddress   adpOb Country-specific postal address management   PAUAMMA
