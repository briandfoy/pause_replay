The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       RTF::Reader
  DSLIP:       adpOa
  description: Implements an RTF reader as per RTF Spec 1.7
  userid:      SARGIE (Peter Sergeant)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:

  similar:
    RTF::Parser RTF::Tokenizer

  rationale:

    This module will build on RTF::Tokenizer, which currently just
    provides a very low-level interface to RTF, to create a class that
    helps people create RTF readers. RTF::Parser sort of sits between
    the two, but has no documentation, and appears abandoned.

  enteredby:   SARGIE (Peter Sergeant)
  enteredon:   Tue Mar 11 09:16:27 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

RTF::
::Reader          adpOa Implements an RTF reader as per RTF Spec 1.7 SARGIE
