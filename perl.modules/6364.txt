The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Audio::MPEG
  DSLIP:       adhhg
  description: Encode/Decode MPEG Audio (MP3)
  userid:      PTIMOF (Peter Timofejew)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    Real::Encode MPEG::MP3Play

  rationale:

    The module I've written is an XS wrapper for decoding and encoding
    MPEG audio (a.k.a. MP3) files, with a detailed level of control
    (decoding/encoding returns back to Perl execution space after every
    MP3 frame to allow all sorts of interesting applications). It's an
    interface into the MAD (MPEG Audio Decoder) and LAME (Lame Ain't MP3
    Encoder) libraries available elsewhere (the README has instructions
    on how to install these external libraries). The execution speed is
    quite good, and it was developed (in part) to allow real-time
    streaming (decoding/encoding on the fly). Supports audio resampling
    as well (both for decoding and encoding).

    Although I am proposing that this module go into Audio::MPEG, I've
    noticed some controversy over using this namespace in the archives.
    It makes sense to me for it to go here, but if the rest of the gang
    prefer it goes into MP3::Audio or something like that, I'd go along
    with that.

    Assuming for the moment that it will be Audio::MPEG, I have created
    3 namespaces underneath: Audio::MPEG::Encode, ::Decode, and
    ::Output. I could re-write the interface to be a single object, with
    methods to encode, decode, or output, but I prefer the approach I
    currently have.

    If you wish to see the interface, I have the manpage online at
    http://timofejew.com/audiompeg/manpage.html

    In any case, I shall defer to the wisdom of the list... :-)

The resulting entry would be:

Audio::
::MPEG            adhhg Encode/Decode MPEG Audio (MP3)               PTIMOF
