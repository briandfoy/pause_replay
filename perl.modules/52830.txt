The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Device::PLC
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Programmable Logic Controllers interface
  userid:      COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I'm starting to develop and release a set of classes that should
    allow to communicate with networked (and/or serial line connected)
    PLC devices, through modbus protocol. Idea would be to also add a
    Device::PLC::Protocol::Modbus, or Protocol::Modbus class to be used
    in conjunction with Device::PLC, so one can develop a new protocol
    but use the underlying functionality provided by Device::PLC...

    It seems nothing showed up on CPAN yet for this type of tasks.

  enteredby:   COSIMO (Cosimo Streppone)
  enteredon:   Tue Jan 30 10:11:53 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Device::
::PLC             bdpOp Programmable Logic Controllers interface     COSIMO
