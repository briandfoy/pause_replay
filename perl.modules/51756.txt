Subject: Module submission Statistics::SDT
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, rgarton@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Statistics::SDT
  DSLIP:       bnpOp
  description: Signal detection theory measures
  userid:      RGARTON (rgarton)
  chapterid:   6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    nil

  similar:
    Statistics::ROC

  rationale:

    The module implements signal detection theory (SDT) algorithms of
    sensitivity and response bias, largely on the basis of those
    prescribed by Stanislaw & Todorov (1999), Behavior Research and
    Methods. In this article, it is noted that applications of SDT
    algorithms are only available in FORTRAN and BASIC, and commercial
    statistical software. A Perl implementation would seem to be
    necessary.

The resulting entry would be:

Statistics::
::SDT             bnpOp Signal detection theory measures             RGARTON
