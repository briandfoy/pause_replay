The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::Roguelike::World
  DSLIP:       bdhOp
  description: Roguelike Utilities for Perl
  userid:      EARONESTY (Erik Aronesty)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    rec.games.roguelike.development

  similar:

  rationale:

    Asked around and some people seemed to agree that the
    Games::Roguelike area was the right place for these modules.

    Games::Roguelike::World - (container for areas)
    Games::Roguelike::Area - (map/drawing object, item container)
    Games::Roguelike::Item - (non-moving object, item container)
    Games::Roguelike::Mob - (possibly moving object, item container)

    This form only allows me to register 1, so I'm registering the most
    "important" one.

    Games::Roguelike::Console and related modules
    (Games::Roguelike::Console::ANSI, etc.) are useful outside
    roguelikes but i think aren't quite general purpose enough to be
    called "Term::Console".

The resulting entry would be:

Games::Roguelike::
::World           bdhOp Roguelike Utilities for Perl                 EARONESTY
