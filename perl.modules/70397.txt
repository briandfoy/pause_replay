Subject: Module submission Net::WPAD
Reply-To: modules@perl.org

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::WPAD
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: perform WPAD protocol, both DHCP and DNS
  userid:      MACKENNA (Craig MacKenna)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    perlmonks, module-authors@perl.org, possibly others

  similar:

  rationale:

    'Net::WPAD' was a suggestion on module-authors@perl.org. The module
    executes the DHCP and DNS parts of the protocol outlined in
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Proxy_Autodiscovery_Protocol and
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-wrec-wpad-01

    Currently the code exists as a script that prints anything it
    finds, which will be disseminated on perlmonks.org and perhaps a
    perl mailing list or two. The question to be answered is whether
    this protocol is worth running on "enterprise" networks connected to
    the Internet via proxy servers. Before such dissemination it seemed
    appropriate to nail the name down.

    If the answer comes out "no" the author will throw the name back
    like an unwanted fish :-)

The resulting entry would be:
