The License line on that page is taken from the META.yml file, which  
you do not have in your distribution. ExtUtils::MakeMaker can make  
that for you or you can write it yourself. Or use a module like  
Module::Install

As for a description on http://search.cpan.org/~dzhuo/. That would  
appear if you had a module Google::Checkout. It would take the short  
description from the NAME section of that POD.

If Google::Checkout::General::GCO is your main module, then your  
distribution really should be called Google-Checkout-General-GCO so  
that it would not be confused with a Google-Checkout distribution for  
a Google::Checkout module.

On the other hand, I agree with Adam about adding a "loader" module  
Google::Checkout and registering that.
