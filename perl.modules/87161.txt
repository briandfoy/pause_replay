I had ADOPTME give up primary maintainership without transferring it. 

However, in general I don't think we should ever have to do this for
ADOPTME me. When people take over a module, they should drop
co-maintainer permissions for ADOPTME or the PAUSE admin should give up
ADOPTME maintainership when transferring primary maintainership.
