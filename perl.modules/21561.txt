Actually what you can do is have your regression test report "skipped
test on this platform".  This is done by having your test script
output "1..0" instead of "1..N" where N is the actual number of tests
it performs.

In other words, the test script can test if the prerequisites are in
place, and if so, then output "1..N"; otherwise, output "1..0" and
exit.  This way it should pass the automated tests and CPAN.pm but
during an actual manual install, you can do the actual tests.

To do the actual tests, you can ask the user questions the way
"libnet" does, or make the user fill in certain environment variables
the way DBD::Oracle does.
