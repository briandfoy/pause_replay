The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PIX::Walker
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Process Cisco PIX configs and ACLs
  userid:      LIFO (Jason Morriss)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:
    I have not found any 'PIX' related modules.

  rationale:

    I have not found any other Cisco PIX related modules on CPAN that
    are similar in design or function to my PIX::Walker module. This
    idea currently stems from my need to look at Cisco PIX access-lists
    to find where IPs+Ports are matching within a ruleset (and where
    they could potentially match).

    I plan on adding more functionality and other modules within this
    namespace such as PIX::Classmap to deal with class-maps or
    PIX::Config for creating full-fledged configurations based on
    templates.

  enteredby:   LIFO (Jason Morriss)
  enteredon:   Wed Jun  7 17:04:32 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

PIX::
::Walker          bdpOp Process Cisco PIX configs and ACLs           LIFO
