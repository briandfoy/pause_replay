Subject: PAUSE ID request (NONZERO; Nic Sandfield)

Request to register new user

fullname: Nic Sandfield
  userid: NONZERO
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: http://larig.wordpress.com/
     why:

    I have been trying for a few months to recover my existing account
    (NICZERO). I would really much rather keep that ID, but with an
    email account that's able to receive messages from PAUSE. I received
    the original 'Welcome' message, but have received none of the
    'Forgotten password' messages. It would be ideal if you can change
    the email address of NICZERO to the one given here. If you need
    proof that we are the same person, you could email the NICZERO
    address from a non-PAUSE address and I will reply confirming what I
    say here. Thanks for your help.
