The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Locale::Maketext::Utils
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Add Utility methods to Locale::Maketext objs
  userid:      DMUEY (Daniel Muey)
  chapterid:   13 (Internationalization_Locale)
  communities:

  similar:
    Locale::Maketext

  rationale:

    I found myself adding the same bunch of methods to Locale::Maketext
    when languagifying a project.

    So I decided to make this module to make development easier, no I
    simply change:

    use Locale::Maketext; use base 'Locale::Maketext';

    to

    use Locale::Maketext::Utils; use base 'Locale::Maketext::Utils';

    and it all works exactly the same but with some additional methods.

    Methods that let you append to a Lexicon, set handlers for lookup
    of missing keys, logging if that fails, and auto handling that is
    inline with those two, among others.

The resulting entry would be:

Locale::Maketext::
::Utils           RdpOp Add Utility methods to Locale::Maketext objs DMUEY
