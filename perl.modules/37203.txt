The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Test::MockRandom
  DSLIP:       Rdphp
  description: Override randoms with non-random behavior
  userid:      DAGOLDEN (David Golden)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    Perlmonks, comp.perl.modules

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module is designed to override "rand" in various ways to
    facilitate writing tests of modules which generate, manipulate, or
    depend upon random numbers. Calls to "rand" instead return values
    from a pre-set list of seed values. This resemble Test::MockObject
    in the way that it mimics system behavior, but is more specific to
    "rand" behavior and helps in overriding the built-in "rand"
    correctly (which is a tricky thing to do if one isn't comfortable
    with symbol table manipulation).

The resulting entry would be:

Test::
::MockRandom      Rdphp Override randoms with non-random behavior    DAGOLDEN
