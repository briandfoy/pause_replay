The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Games::EverQuest::LogLineParser
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Parses lines from the EverQuest log file.
  userid:      FOOBLE (fooble)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    in-game (EverQuest)

  similar:

  rationale:

    I believe the naming of this module follows CPAN convention. As it
    is related to processing the output file of a game (EverQuest), it
    seemed that it should be in the Games::EverQuest name space. And
    since it is for the specific purpose of parsing lines from the log
    file, LogLineParser seemed the most appropriate base name.

  enteredby:   FOOBLE (fooble)
  enteredon:   Wed Nov 12 03:39:14 2003 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Games::EverQuest::
::LogLineParser   adpfp Parses lines from the EverQuest log file.    FOOBLE
