Subject: Module submission Text::FixEOL

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::FixEOL
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Canonicalizes mixed convention EOL/EOF
  userid:      SNOWHARE (Benjamin Franz)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    PerlIO::eol Encode::Newlines

  rationale:

    PerlIO::eol is only suited for dealing with data being manipulated
    via filehandles and does not work with pre-5.8 installations. It is
    also dependant on XS which reduces its portability.

    Encode::Newlines is pure Perl, but also does not work with pre-5.8
    installs since it uses the 5.8+ Encode framework.

    Neither documents their specific behavior in dealing with mixed EOL
    conventions very well, handles EOF stripping or last line EOL
    canonicalizations, or can handle canonicalizations to targeted
    platforms.

    I believe it belongs in the Text namespace vice Encode because
    Encode is normally used for modules working within the 5.8+ Encode
    framework.

The resulting entry would be:

Text::
