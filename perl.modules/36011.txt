Subject: Module submission IPC::Filter

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPC::Filter
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: filter data through an external process
  userid:      ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    IPC::Open2

  rationale:

    Filtering data through an external process and capturing the result
    in the same process that provided the input is a surprisingly
    complex task. Conventionally, partial solutions are coded inline;
    often they then fail under unexpected circumstances. This is exactly
    the kind of thing that should be done properly, once and for all, in
    a module. Apparently no one has already done this on CPAN.

    IPC::Open2 is obviously related, being the usual substrate for ad
    hoc implementations of filtering. It's much lower level than what
    this module implements.

  enteredby:   ZEFRAM (Andrew Main (Zefram))
  enteredon:   Fri Oct 29 20:44:34 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IPC::
::Filter          Rdpfp filter data through an external process      ZEFRAM
