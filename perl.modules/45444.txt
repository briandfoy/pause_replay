Math:: is normal.

::GramSchmidt might be prefered if you think there's a good chance of 
someone else wanting to write a module for a different type of 
orthonormalisation. If not, and Gram-Schmidt is the obvious way to do 
orthonormalisation, then the current name is fine.

Do you want to change, or keep this?
