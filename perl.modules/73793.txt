That's because I meanwhile ask _before_ doing any work. I did it another
way when I was new and many of the effort was for wastebin after that.
In this special case my new $job offers me a task where I could do
"case study" for long awaited Proc::ProcessTable fix and I decided to
take the chance.

I'm sorry that I don't have a web-site where my tasks for the next
weeks/months are listed - it's on TODO-list (probably after ExtUtils::XBuilder).

Can you please prove whether https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63342
is because of your changes and answer the ticket accordingly?

Not really - because of this the time pressure increased. I'm even not sure
what module should get highest priority ofter next SQL::Statement/DBI
release, but this action forces me to L::MU and this might disappoint
people like Merijn (Tux) who's waiting for reworked P::PT since nearly a
year now.

> Sorry for the confusion.

I was more confused about the silence - even if you know how to contact
me in IRC or via mail - and of the silence of the CPAN admin who added
your ID to the co-maint list. I didn't know that it's allowed that this is the
same person.

Anyway - I vote for changing the workflow: CPAN admins should not be
allowed to add themself as a secondary.

I'm fine with everything else of this chaos so far :)

Best,
Jens
