The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       PerlPoint::Package
  DSLIP:       MmpOa
  description: Presentation slide / doc generator framework
  userid:      JSTENZEL (Jochen Stenzel)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perlpoint@perl.org (see
    http://archive.develooper.com/perlpoint@perl.org/),
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/perlpoint/

  similar:
    PPresenter, Tk::SlideShow, SlideShow, XML::Handler::AxPoint, sdf

  rationale:

    PerlPoint is available on CPAN for years now, I just realized that
    it is not registered yet. It is also made a sourceforge project.

    Namespace choice ----------------

    PerlPoint and its name were originally designed by Tom
    Christiansen. When we decided to publish our new implementation and
    got his permission to use the name, there was no "Presentation" root
    namespace, so we decided just to use the tools/language name for it.
    (Similar to PPresenter and SlideShow.) Even if there would have been
    such a category, PerlPoint would not perfectly fit in as it is not
    only designed to generate presentation slides but can be used for
    various purposes.

    PerlPoint was presented to the German Perl Workshop 2001 and YAPC
    2001 and became the Workshop's officially recommended slide
    generator software. In 2001, PerlPoint won a Workshop award for best
    utility. In 2002, the PerlPoint application PerlPointCD was used to
    produce the Workshop CD.

    As the name and tool are well established now, I ask to register
    the root namespace PerlPoint.

    PerlPoint intro ---------------

    PerlPoint allows to generate presentation slides, documentations,
    handouts, training materials etc. in various formats from one or
    more text files in an easy to learn, easy to extend, paragraph
    oriented language. It supports unlimited document nesting and makes
    it easy to maintain a document a distributed way, which means to
    compose it from partial documents (which may be used standalone as
    well). By embedding Perl code it is possible to "write" slides/docs
    automatically while the source is processed. More common, it is
    possible to write PerlPoint "applications".

    For further informations and details online see the YAPC 2001
    proceedings(http://www.yapc.org/Europe/2001/proceedings/15/doc/,
    various *-slides/frame_set.html pages there, article at
    PP-Article/frame_set.html).

    Relation to other modules (as listed above)
    -------------------------------------------

    In short: PerlPoint is partially similar in purpose, but supports
    various output formats. Therefore it might be used as a common
    frontend of ones preferred presenter as well as a document
    processor.

    In more detail: PerlPoint was designed to support *various*
    presentation formats. This means that there is no "PerlPoint
    presentation format" (although HTML is the traditional and currently
    most supported slide format).

    So like the tools/modules listed above, PerlPoint can be used to
    generate slides.

    Different to them (as I know), it is not fixed to a certain output
    format, backends can be written for various formats, including the
    input formats of the listed tools. (A PPresenter backend already
    exists.) So it well cooperates with other tools.

    While some of the tools prefer XML or Perl as their input format,
    which are powerful but need special knowledge, PerlPoint tries to
    provide an interface language that is very easy to start with, very
    close to writing a simple text like this.

    PerlPoint::Package ------------------

    Do I need to register every module of the PerlPoint toolset?
    Currently there are two distributions with various modules: the
    PerlPoint::Package module which provides the frontend parser, a
    framework to write backends and a reference backend to SDF, and
    PerlPoint::Converters by Lorenz Domke (LDOMKE) with converters to
    HTML and LaTeX.

    If it is possible, please register the PerlPoint::Converters
    package as well (Lorenz is not informed of this request but I'm sure
    he will agree ;-).

    Please let me know if I need to register not only the packages but
    also every single module within.

    Greetings and thanks in advance
