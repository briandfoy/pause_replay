I notice you aren't the author of either ::AsForm or ::FromForm.

Have you spoken to both these authors on what they think about your 
module? They may have feedback or contributions, and/or could possibly 
both deprecate in favour of yours.

Just checking, because of the significance that will likely be placed on 
the name as the "main" form module for Class::DBI.
