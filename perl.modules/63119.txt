Request to register new user

fullname: Barry Walsh
  userid: DRAEGTUN
    mail: CENSORED
homepage: transfixedbutnotdead.com
     why:

    * XML builder (ala Builder on Ruby & Groovy) * HTML renderer like
    Seaside (smalltalk web framework). Uses above XML builder. * Market
    research tools... including cross tabulations & data format
    converters.

    I have been using Perl for over 13 years now.... so got lots of
    stuff lying around which I would like to dust down & package up and
    put on CPAN.

    One of my long term plans is to produce an opensource Market
    Research framework... which it and all its parts would be on CPAN.
