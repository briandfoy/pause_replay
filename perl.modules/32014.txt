The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OGDL
  DSLIP:       ampOo
  description: Ordered Graph Data Language
  userid:      HZHOU (Hui Zhou)
  chapterid:    6 (Data_Type_Utilities)
  communities:
    ogdl-core@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:

  rationale:

    OGDL is a structured textual format that represents information in
    the form of graphs, where the nodes are strings and the arcs or
    edges are spaces or indentation. In the basic specification, it uses
    spaces and indentation to structure hierarchial data. It maintains
    both the simplicity and readability.

    The modules that deal with OGDL streams needs an OGDL name space.

  enteredby:   HZHOU (Hui Zhou)
  enteredon:   Tue May 18 20:56:51 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

OGDL              ampOo Ordered Graph Data Language                  HZHOU
