:( I'm all against and here is why:

1) I'll need to edit all the files to reflect the change in 3 distros:
WWW::DoingItWrongCom::RandImage,
POE::Component::WWW::DoingItWrongCom::RandImage
and also I already started on
POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::DoingItWrongCom::RandImage
version.

2) The description for POE::Component::WWWW::DoingItWrongCom::RandImage
will not fit into 44 character limit .oO( always fightin' that limit)

3) I can't think of a word besides "random" that would associate with
"Rand"

4) There is rand() function which returns a "random" number, not only in
Perl but other languages as. And I bet http://doingitwrong.com uses
it to present random image each time on their homepage  :)

5) It's the whole four characters more to type _each time_ 
you need the module (2 for use; and 2 for new()) :)

I know all this may sound as a cop-out but I just don't see
the reason to change all the files (see #1) because IMO
::RandImage is pretty clear.
