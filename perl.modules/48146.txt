An easy but fail-safe route would be to allow modules to be specified
in the dependcies (as it is the case now) as well as in the new
'build-depencies'. So the conventional approach would use all of them,
while a program designed to make the distinction can subtract the
build-depencies from the real dependencies.

Much better would be to distill the dependencies automatically as part
of the "Perl Build.PL" phase.
