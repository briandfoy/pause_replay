Subject: Getting an UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE with BioPerl-db
Date: Sun, 8 Feb 2009 09:26:53 -0600
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.930.3)
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: cjfields@illinois.edu (Chris Fields)

I am planning on releasing a few BioPerl-related distributions on CPAN  
and noticed that one (BioPerl-db 1.5.9_1) has a module indicating a  
namespace clash:

Bio::DB::CacheServer::SeqDB

However, I can't find anything other than via search.cpan.org with  
authorname BIRNEY (from 2001) for bioperl-db; and that should be as a  
co-maintainer (the primary for that module should be BIOPERLML).  All  
other modules for this distribution seem fine, so maybe that one was  
missed for some reason?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
