From: rjray@blackperl.com (Randy J Ray)

I've mentioned in e-mails several times over the past few years that I mean
to relenquish any hold I may have on VCS::* or anything related. When I left
U S WEST in Denver to move to California, I was no longer able to work on
the stuff I planned to have go into there (other tasks were higher priority).
So any such namespace that is (still) being held for me should be considered
up for grabs.
