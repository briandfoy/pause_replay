The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       IPTables::Rules
  DSLIP:       cdpfp
  description: iptables simple functions for perl firewall
  userid:      CML (celmorlauren limited)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I am a system administrator who looks after the iptables based
    firewall, the scripts are written in Perl for simplicity the module
    IPTables::Rules is intended to contain simple exported functions to
    ease the writing of firewall scripts, and a few simple basic
    standard firewall rules, also a function that reads the
    /etc/mail/access file looking for Connect:#### ERROR"550 DROP
    SPAMMER and adds #### to a rule that drops the connection. It also
    has a simple command line interface to add problem spammers to the
    /etc/mail/access file and to the current rules.

  enteredby:   CML (celmorlauren limited)
  enteredon:   Fri Aug  3 12:07:32 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

IPTables::
::Rules           cdpfp iptables simple functions for perl firewall  CML
