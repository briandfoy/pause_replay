Dear modules@perl.org readers,

it's been quite a while ago when I last wrote to the modules list. Reason is
that when I last did, it was said there would be a new infrastructure for
managing the modules list forthcoming in the then-near future (eg. within a
few years, which would be up to now).

Back then, the modules list was semi-responsive with a downwards trend.
Since it doesn't look like there will be another infrastructure, I'd like to
contribute to maintaining the modules list since it's a pretty important
document, in my opinion. If you would like me to do so, please tell me how.
(I.e. just lurk and respond to module registrations if I think the choice of
namespace is bad, should I have some means of actually accepting
registrations?)

On a somewhat unrelated matter, I'd like to inquire about the host of
Math::Symbolic extensions on CPAN. They're not currently registered with the
modules list (except Math::Symbolic, of course). I'd send a registration
request for each of them when I find the time, but I wonder whether it would
be a good idea to create a sub-category for them such as, for example,
http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Commercial_Software_Interfaces/NexTrieve. I
don't know whether this is implemented via the module list or via
search.cpan.org. I'd like some input as to wether this would be a good idea
in the case at hand.

I haven't requested help on the namespace choice of these extension modules
since they could hardly collide with other namespaces. (Them being in
Math::Symbolic::Custom:: and Math::SymbolicX:: and all.) Try searching for
Math::Symbolic and Math::SymbolicX for a list of related modules.

Steffen
