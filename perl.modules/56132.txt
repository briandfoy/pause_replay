     why:

    In China there're two primary ISPs,one is China TEL,another is
    China CNC.Due to the bad policy here,the internet connection between
    these two ISPs is very slow. I once worked and still be working in
    China large websites like Sina,Netease etc.For us we need to make
    two suites of services for the same application,like webmail
    systems,one for CNC users,one for TEL users. So we maintained the IP
    database for both TEL and CNC.When request is coming from CNC
    network,we redirect it to CNC servers.Otherwise redirect it to TEL
    servers. I searched and didn't find CPAN has that a module which can
    do the IP ISP querying.That's to say,we may need such a module like,

    my $cnisp = Package->new; print $cnisp->ip_isp('11.22.33.44');

    It would return 'tel' or 'cnc' or other isp based on the given IP
    argument. So I'm glad to write a module to do that for CPAN.
