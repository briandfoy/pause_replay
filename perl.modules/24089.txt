Me again :)

I have a modulue, currently named MuttAliases for lack of a
better idea, which needs a proper name.

It takes a list of mutt alias files, and then does expansions
(converting an alias to a name and email address) and reverse
expansions (converting an email address back to a name).

Could you suggest an appropriate namespace for this file?  Other
than Mutt::Aliases, which creates a new root namespace which I
understand is Generall Bad Form, I have no ideas.


Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Ricky
