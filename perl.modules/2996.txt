a description of what you're planning to contribute
A very light CGI module

for modules a description in module list format (DSLI entry, which is: 
Development stage, Support level, Language used, Interface style (see the 
modulelist), and a 44 character description).
CGI::Thin	bdpf	CGI form parsing without the fluff

It would be very nice, if you could also send a note about where you have 
discussed some or all parts of your contribution publicly, and if there was 
at least a little bit of interest.

There are 4 "competitors", cgilib.pm, CGI.pm, CGI_Lite.pm, 
CGI/Minimal.pm.  But they are all too heavy.  This module does the one 
thing that is really needed, read the form data.  I have discussed it with 
the Philly perl mongers and have not yet created enemies.
