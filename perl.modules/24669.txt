The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       FindBin::libs
  DSLIP:       bdppp
  description: Locate ./lib dir's along $FindBin::Bin
  userid:      LEMBARK (Steven Lembark)
  chapterid:    3 (Development_Support)
  communities:

  similar:
    FindBin

  rationale:

    It is convienent to have a standard list of directories searched
    for Perl modules. FindBin gives one reasonable way to locate them:
    walk up $FindBin::Bin looking for "lib" direcotries and "use lib"
    them. By searching up from the bottom of $Bin the more local lib's
    are added first (e.g., for modules in development subdir's).

    The basic code was developed for a recent project I worked on and
    saved a lot of shuffling around during development and deploying the
    code.

    Putting it under FindBin seems reasonable since it is an outgrowth
    of FindBin to being with.

The resulting entry would be:

FindBin::
::libs            bdppp Locate ./lib dir's along $FindBin::Bin       LEMBARK
