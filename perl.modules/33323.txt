The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Mail::Maildir
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Maildir/Maildir++ folder level interface
  userid:      ZEROALTI (Edward L. Abrams)
  chapterid:   19 (Mail_and_Usenet_News)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    Mail::Box

  rationale:

    The namespace is suggested by the existing Mail root, and the sub
    Folder is taken by a somewhat out of date multi-folder type package.
    Maildir is a namespace that is evocative of the function of the
    module, as well as the fact that the package makes no claims to
    synergy with other mail folder types.

    Mail::Maildir would be a useful perl package independently of
    Mail::Box, primarily because it need not be as heavy as that larger
    package for basic Maildir management functions. Perhaps I also
    believe that the general strategy of having the actual filesystem
    level abstraction in separate, independent packages, and the Reader
    implementation somewhere else that can consume those separate,
    independent packages, is a sound one.

  enteredby:   ZEROALTI (Edward L. Abrams)
  enteredon:   Thu Jul  1 20:59:38 2004 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Mail::
::Maildir         RdpOp Maildir/Maildir++ folder level interface     ZEROALTI
