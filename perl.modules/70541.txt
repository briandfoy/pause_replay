Cool.  Mine is on github too!

I can't take a look for a couple of hours - gotta finish some locking

Do you use instant messaging at all?  I'm:

XMPP: brong@fastmail.fm
MSN: brong@fastmail.fm
Yahoo: retsem

I can also be talked in to using IRC or Skype, but I don't leave them
turned on all the time.
