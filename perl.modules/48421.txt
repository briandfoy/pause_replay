That's  not good enough. You should put the relevant info in the
subject line so the recipient doesn't delete it without looking at it. 

You really do have to try your best to contact the author, and the
first step is getting him to read your email. If he doesn't even open
it, he's nto going to see your "ATTN" lines.
