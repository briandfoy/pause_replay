The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::TCPClientServerFramework
  DSLIP:       iupOp
  description: Easy TCP/IP clients and servers via OO
  userid:      MNAGUIB (Mina Naguib)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:
    #perl on Efnet, comp.lang.perl.misc, comp.lang.perl.modules and
    possible an anon CVS once I setup one

  similar:
    I'fe done some cursory searching and couldn't find any

  rationale:

    Every time I needed to write a client/server pair for 2 programs to
    talk to each other it was a copy and paste operation of a couple of
    hacked subroutines from my previous projects, which is not the way
    it should be.

    I'm proposing to write 1 module that could easily be used on both
    the client and the server to facilitate getting started on an IPC
    project, specifically TCP/IP based.

    Programmers using it will be able to concentrate on the high-level
    protocol and responding to data instead of the transport and parsing
    and defragmenting etc.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
