The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Perl::Always
  DSLIP:       Sdpfp
  description: It is part of Perl module tutorial
  userid:      TAINT (C Hutchinson)
  chapterid:   3 (Development_Support)
  communities:
    All of the above

  similar:

  rationale:

    This is part of Perl advocacy campaign. This module is a module
    that would-be module maintainers/developers will build as part of
    Acme::Sex. Acme::Sex is a tutorial. That explains the complete
    protocol as it pertains to the development, and continued
    maintenance of any project they look to build, and register on CPAN.
    It involves complete instructions for registering with PAUSE. The
    responsibilities, and questions would-be maintainers need to ask
    themselves, prior to making the commitment. It is a complete guide.
    That involves actually creating a module from scratch --
    Perl::Always, the module this request seeks to gain a namespace for.
    The module (Perl::Always) is only the example. But as it is an
    integral part of the tutorial, I seek to obtain this namespace
    purely for the furthering of Perls' popularity. This module, in
    fact, is a requirement of the Acme::Sex module/tutorial. The first
    use statement is: use Perl::Always or die; While I recognize that
    Perl as a root namespace could/would seem/be quite broad. The
    contents of this module explains all the things that make Perl so
    great. With pointers to this tutorial, and many other attributes.
    This tutorial, and it's example module (Perl::Always) are very
    important to me. The other modules of this type are relatively
    incomplete. I have spent an enormous amount of time on this one. As
    I see that it would quite possibly become the defacto go-to, for
    beginning module developers, and usher the many projects on the web
    into CPAN, where they belong. Thank you for all your time, and
    consideration in this matter. Sincerely, Chris Hutchinson
