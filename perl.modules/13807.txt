The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Template
  DSLIP:       cdpOp
  description: An X(HT)ML document processing framework.
  userid:      EMRYS (Jonathan Waxman)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    Suggestions would be appreciated...

  similar:
    HTML::Template, Template

  rationale:

    This set of modules is a highly configurable and fully modular
    X(HT)ML document/template processing framework designed specifically
    for creating web sites and web applications. The basic framework
    provides document parsing, caching, complex template variables and
    functions, and support for user defined tags using XML namespace
    conventions. This project is sort of like Template Toolkit in XML
    spefically for making web sites (in fact, some of the design is
    based on tt2's). As far as I know, there are no Perl modules that
    provide exactly what this set of modules provide, at least not to
    the extent that this does. Note, this is not like AxKit, which aims
    to be an XML conversion application. XML::Template is, instead, a
    fully XML template framework.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
