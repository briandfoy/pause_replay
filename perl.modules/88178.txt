The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       File::RandomGenerator
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Generate random files and dirs.
  userid:      GRAVATTJ (John Gravatt)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I encountered a need to generate some random files with random
    subdirs/files. I started out looking for an existing module, but
    found none with this functionality. Then I was going to roll it in
    with the module I am working on, but decided I didn't want to have
    to rewrite or copy'n'paste it sometime in the future. Additionally,
    I thought it made sense to share it on cpan because it appears to be
    a gap.

    I am requesting File::RandomGenerator namespace because it was the
    most intuitive one I could come with up.

The resulting entry would be:

File::
::RandomGenerator adpOp Generate random files and dirs.              GRAVATTJ
