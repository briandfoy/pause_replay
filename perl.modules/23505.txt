The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::Subnets
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: functions for large scale subnetting
  userid:      SRI (Sebastian Riedel)
  chapterid:    5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::IP::Match

  rationale:

    Why not Net::IP::Match?

    1. Net::IP::Match is an unflexible perl source filter with an
    unusual interface, Net::Subnets is object oriented and quite simple.

    2. Net::IP::Match works fast for a few subnets but they have to be
    hardcoded, Net::Subnets works fine for even a million dynamically
    loaded subnets.

    3. I have planned some more subnetting related features for future
    releases.

    Why not name it Net::IP::Subnets?

    In fact the first version was named so, but I talked to a lot
    people and all expected it to be Net::Subnets, so I decided that
    there is no reason not to rename it. In addition it enables me to
    add subnetting features that are not IP related, if there are any?
    :]

The resulting entry would be:

Net::
::Subnets         bdpOp functions for large scale subnetting         SRI
