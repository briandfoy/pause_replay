The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Parallel::Application
  DSLIP:       adhhp
  description: Framework for distributed parallelization
  userid:      CHOLT (Carson Holt)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Parallel::Application institutes a framework on parallel
    applications similar to the way CGI::Application institutes a
    framework on web-apps. Programs written using Parallel::Application
    can be executed under multiple parallelization schemes (MPI, forks,
    and EC2 cloud) without having to redesign a separate application for
    each, resulting in highly portable applications that can run on
    systems as complex as computer clusters or as simple as a laptop.
    Parallel::Application hides much of the messiness of dealing with
    MPI, forks, and EC2 by providing a unified set of methods that will
    produce consistent predictable behavior for each parallelization
    scheme.

The resulting entry would be:

Parallel::
::Application     adhhp Framework for distributed parallelization    CHOLT
