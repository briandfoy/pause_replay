     why:

    I have written a couple modules that I think could be potentially
    useful. One is a wrapper design pattern that binds the API's for
    Net::FTP and Net::SSH::Perl into a common interface. I have not
    designed any tests for this library although most of the coding is
    finished for this. I have also not determined what namespace I will
    be looking to use for this. My idea for this came when I was working
    on some HIPAA compliance bits in the health care industry where
    ARPA's FTP protocol is still heavily in use.

    A current copy can be fetched at:

    My second idea came about after sitting in on Gabor Szabo's QA
    automation class at YAPC::NA in Chicago this year where he discussed
    "stubbing" packages that produce output in order to capture them. I
    noticed there is already a Test::Output but mine is a bit different;
    I'm hoping to call my package Test::Out but I am flexible when it
    comes to namespace.
