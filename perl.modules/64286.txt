     why:

    I've been using perl off an on for many years. I currently use it
    at my place of work and would like the opportunity to help the
    community.

    I've used many modules have frequently come across bugs that I've
    fixed for my own use as well as inconsistencies in documentation.
    I'm also working on a library to create mock objects not unlike
    Test::MockObject.
