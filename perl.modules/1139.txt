To Whom it May Concern,

I would like to contribute a script to the CPAN scripts area, and so I
would like to register for a PAUSE user-ID in accordance with the
instructions at "http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html".

Name:			Neil Hoggarth
Email Address:		njh@kernighan.demon.co.uk
Homepage:		http://www.physiol.ox.ac.uk/~njh/
Preferred user-ID:	HOGGARTH

Description of contribution: Online RFC repositories typically contain a
text file produced by the RFC Editor, rfc-index.txt, which lists the RFCs
currently in existence. My script, "rfcindex" reads the plain text index
file and outputs an HTML index file (which includes hyperlinks to the text
of the RFCs themselves and for the cross references within the index). The
script, documentation, and example HTML output are available from
http://www.kernighan.demon.co.uk/software/.

Concerning public discussion of and interest in the contribution: I made a
Freshmeat announcement earlier in the month. Apparently several hundred
people were interested enough to download the script or request more
information (http://freshmeat.net/news/2000/02/06/949859260.html). I had
one email one email the following day, which I include below. This is
positive, if rather short!

(I have no affiliation with the sender, other than the fact that we happen
to share the same ISP.)
