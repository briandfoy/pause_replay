That's not what I'm getting at.  CPAN is (to an extent) a peer-reviewed forum,
and in being so I'm loathe to upload something that no one sees any practical
use for.  *Especially* if someone else has a better use for the same
namespace, I don't want to be squatting in the way.

You're most welcome, I don't say that lightly.  The Perl community is by far
the best developer community out there.

I do have mailing lists, but while everyone agrees it's useful, no one really
cares what it's called.  It's going to be used in one form or another by my
Curses::* kludges, but I purposely left it generic since it seemed that others
might get some value from it as well, but don't need or want my other crap.

Believe me, I am doing so, and I'll end up putting this under Curses::Widgets
if it doesn't get accepted by you.  As I mentioned above, though, *any*
widget, curses or otherwise, that uses fixed width fonts could benefit from
this, there's nothing specific in it that pertains to my somewhat warped vision
of a widgets framework.  I suspect that if I put it under my widget namespace,
though, no one using another widget framework will look at it twice, since
that namespace implies adoption of the framework as a whole.

I have no quarrels with the advice I've gotten from this list, it's the lack
of responsiveness in general, and that would seem to indicate a scaling
problem.  Again, the *one* response I got back I replied to, along with a few
other suggestions for the namespace that may address the voiced concerns.  But
I recieved *nothing* from that, no mention if the other suggestions were
better, no mention if a better explanation from me of the purpose of the
modules made the original name made sense, nothing.  Nor did I recieve any
responses to any of the other e-mails I sent out, at least until this one.

In other words, I'd be happy to take/discuss the advice, but you guys have
tended lately to send one barrage out and drop the conversation on the floor.
It's like starting a conversation with a blind man, then quietly walking away
while he's in the middle of a sentence.

You have been very helpful on those cases, and I appreciate that greatly.  In
fact, your approval on the Parse::PlainConfig took me by surprise since I
thought I had indicated that I would just move the active development into the
Config::* namespace as per brian's suggestion.

I am, but only to an extent.  I'm trying to keep things as atomic and flexible
as possible.  Curses::Widgets should be able to be used by itself,
Curses::Forms extends it, as does Curses::Application.  Like those, these
modules are intended to be used by whoever needs the functionality, but
without requiring the developer to buy into a whole framework, or a ridiculous
list of dependencies.

If, however, you'd prefer me to stay in the Curses::* sandbox, I will.  In the
end, all I want is a definitive yes or no.  All ideas are not good ideas, and
I expect to be shot down when I'm being dense.  Without trying to sound
demanding, this forum is supposed to be the place where we ask these
questions, and I was expecting an answer.
