Yes, I want to continue with the namespace. I uploaded PGForth1.1 in =
1999 to the incoming directory, but it got corrupted, the problem was =
never solved. So I decided now to upload a new Version, PGForth1.2. I =
uploaded it now to ftp://pause.perl.org/incoming

Please put it to http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Language_Interfaces

Thanks
Peter
