The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Wiki::Gateway
  DSLIP:       cmpfp
  description: API for interaction with wikis
  userid:      BSHANKS (Bayle Shanks)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    http://interwiki.sourceforge.net/,
    interwiki-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net

  similar:
    WWW-Wikipedia, WWW-Mediawiki-Client

  rationale:

    Namespace choice:

    I believe that this module, and other "wiki utility" modules,
    belong in Wiki:: rather than CGI::Wiki because they do not
    necessarily involve CGI. Wiki::Gateway, for example, is not itself
    CGI, and is intended to communicate with a variety of wiki engines
    (including Tomcat-based & ASP-based engines), rather than just
    CGI-based ones. Hence, one would not expect a potential user of this
    module to look for it under "CGI".

    In addition, the world of "wiki", wiki-specific software, and wiki
    developers, is rather expansive, so I think it merits an
    easy-to-refer to namespace on par with MIME, Apache, Jabber, VRML,
    etc. While wiki is not a protocol, it is a "world of its own" and
    there are all sorts of wiki-specific software projects, with widely
    varying goals and functionality (i.e. beyond wiki engine CGI
    scripts), just like there are all sorts of Jabber-related projects.

    Related modules:

    WWW-Wikipedia, WWW-Mediawiki-Client are similar to this project in
    that they both include functionality for remote interaction with a
    wiki engine. However, they are focused on the Mediawiki engine,
    whereas the raison d'etre of Wiki::Gateway is to present ONE unified
    API/library which handles interaction with many wiki engine types. I
    am not aware of any other Perl module providing the functionality
    that Wiki::Gateway seeks to provide.

The resulting entry would be:

Wiki::
::Gateway         cmpfp API for interaction with wikis               BSHANKS
