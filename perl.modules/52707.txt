Right. That's why I was working on something new rather than trying to 
contribute to something existing. I have a particular area in which I'm 
building applications and what I have seems to be (at least the 
beginning of) something that fits what I need, and hopefully others can 
find it useful as well.

...and that's kind of my point. While POE seems extremely cool, it 
solves a particular problem area I'm not focused on and has requirements 
that I don't have. And, yes, the O/RM layer is synchronous. :)

Right, or, to put it another way, frameworks make use of ideas like 
Inversion of Control (IoC containers - 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control).

That's what I was thinking as well, but even these kinds of modules need 
to be categorized within the CPAN directory, don't they? I'm just not 
sure which category to select when I submit the namespace registration form.

Thanks for your reply, Adam!
