Hello, all, and first of all: thanks for your time in reading this.

I am aware that this proposal treads close on many of the stated rules =
of module naming for CPAN, but I still think it's worth considering, =
because of its purpose and use.  The synopsis is basically, a module =
that would make:

  perl -mr -ne 'print if /foo/' *

behave the same as:

  grep -r foo *

(and to do so in the most sensible way possible).  Certainly, the uses =
of providing such a facility go far beyond simple greps... but the added =
functionality of being able to do things like directory-recursive =
searches, or search-and-replaces, etc... well, I think that's a =
significant addition to the power of perl, at the small cost of an =
unfortunately named module.

For the more complete back-story, you could look at =
http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=3D334305 and the discussion =
that began it, http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=3D334027 (I am =
the user by the nick name "etcshadow" in these posts).

Also, just as I posed to the perlmonks in the above discussion, I'd also =
be happy to make it named "R" instead of "r".  I'd *rather* go with "r", =
and the argument could be made that it is as much a pragma-like module =
as, say, lib.  Besides that, the chances of namespace collision rely on =
the notion that someday someone decides that perl needs to be able to =
"use r" and "no r", and have that mean anything at all (and, on top of =
that, that the need to "use r" is more important than the need to be =
able to specify a file tree on the command line more easily than with =
"find -print0 | xargs -0 perl ...").

At any rate, I defer to your collective judgment.

Thanks very much.
