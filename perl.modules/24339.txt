The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       X11::WM::Sawfish
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Lisp RPC for Sawfish Window Manager
  userid:      AGRICOCB (Craig B. Agricola)
  chapterid:    8 (User_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:
    X11::Fvwm Eesh

  rationale:

    I've written a module to implement the two RPC interfaces to the
    Sawfish window manager for X windows. It's broken into three
    modules. X11::WM::Sawfish is the base class from which
    X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX and X11::WM::Sawfish::XProp are derived. The
    two derived classes each handle one of the two protocols for RPC,
    and the base class constructor creates one of the two derived
    classes depending on which is able to sucessfully connect.

    As mentioned in a previous mail to modules@perl.org, I'd like to
    group modules relating to interfacing with Window Managers for X11
    together to make them easier to find. The other option would be to
    spell out X11::WindowManager::Sawfish, but I think that X11::WM is
    pretty obvious.

    I've received no responses to my original request for comment on
    the proposed namespace, so here is the official request. I'll be
    uploading the module after submitting this request with the
    assumption that the namespace I've chosen is non-controversial
    enough to be accepted.

    Thanks, -Craig
