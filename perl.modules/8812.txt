a short description of what I'm planning to contribute: All sorts of
modules.  Predominantly pure Perl.  Mostly to do with providing slick
interfaces to things that aren't exactly hard to do in Perl but which
there's really no point everyone doing.

First contribution is a module to provide the apply BLOCK LIST
function as decribed in a thread in comp.lang.perl.misc some time
back:

    apply BLOCK LIST

    Similar to map in that it evaluates BLOCK setting $_ to each
    element of LIST in turn.  apply returns a list made up of the
    values of $_ after BLOCK has been evaluated.  In a scalar context
    the last element is returned.  Unlike map and grep the elements
    of LIST are not altered.

	@foo = apply { s/\s+/ /g } @bar; # canonicalise whitespace

    This function is nothing more than syntactic sugar for people who find
    the following syntax unpalatable.

	for (@foo = @bar) { s/\s+/ /g }


There's a few other odds and ends in there too.

I'll probably also be contributing some CGI/XML/Database stuff.
