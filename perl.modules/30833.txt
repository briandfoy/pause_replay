Subject: Module submission XML::Smart

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       XML::Smart
  DSLIP:       SdpOp
  description: A smart, easy and powerful way for XML.
  userid:      GMPASSOS (Graciliano Monteiro Passos)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    perlmonks.com

  similar:
    XML::Simple

  rationale:

    I just time to register the baby.

    Well, XML::Smart is in extensive use and is common to see
    references to it as an option in replacement of XML::Simple. But the
    main purpose of it is not to do a race with XML::Simple, is just a
    tool that integrates everything that is needed to load and create
    XML data, including parsers for different approaches, like wild XML
    and HTML, and other resources to generated XML files and manipulate
    or walk through the XML tree. But everything without the user need
    to really know all the XML roles, it just need to know Perl.

The resulting entry would be:

XML::
::Smart           SdpOp A smart, easy and powerful way for XML.      GMPASSOS
