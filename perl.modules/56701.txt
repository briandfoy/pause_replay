Hi All,

Some months ago I was adviced that (because the author was non-responsive=
 to communication) that I would be able to take-over the namespace: Authe=
n::NTLM

I was told that I should fix, re-package, and upload to pause.... which I=
 did, over a month ago. I also sent an email here (modules@cpan.org) lett=
ing you know I'd done it.  =20
the fixed package is here: http://search.cpan.org/~buzz/

I still don't "own" the name-space, and my corrected version still doesn'=
t show-up on a CPAN search as the 'correct' version.   =20
(searching for NTLM or Authen::NTLM  only brings the broken 1.02 version)

Please fix and/or advice what else I need to do.

Thanks,
Buzz  =20
