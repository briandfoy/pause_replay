hm, no. sorry i wasnt clear enough. i wasnt asking if i
should replace the name Properties, i was asking whether it
should go in the main namespace, or under something like
Data::.

good idea. although the whole point of writing the class was
to manage name/value pair files in the manner im used to
when programming in java. and im not really interested in
hearing 'we dont need another one', cos perl is all about
doing things the way each individual prefers, not about The
Mechanisms Officially Accepted By The Kremlin or some shit.

perhaps it would, but im not willing to bind that tightly to
a single data structure. it works quite well as is, thanks.

cute. altho that will be _your_ module, not mine, cos i dont
anticipate writing anything that looks like that. ive
already got a class written that meets my goals with the
interface i prefer. thats what im interested in adding to
cpan.
