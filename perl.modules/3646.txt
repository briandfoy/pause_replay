Hello

I would like to place a script on cpan. It is called 'shroud' and 
serves to shroud, or obfuscate, the source code of a perl script. 
It is to used to 'protect' the intellectual property contained
in the source code of commercial perl scripts. I think it will
prove useful to other commercial perl developers.

The software is described on our web site at:

http://www.craic.com/resources/tech_notes/tech_note_2.html

Perhaps the most appropriate category for the script that I can
see in the scripts branch of cpan is Unix/System_administration
but it really should be in a 'programming utilities' branch.

My name is Robert Jones   jones@craic.com
A suitable userID for CPAN might be 'CRAIC'
Our homepage is http://www.craic.com

I hope that you will find this script a suitable addition to your
wonderful resource.

Best regards

--Rob Jones
