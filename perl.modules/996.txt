Hi,

Following recent discussion on p5p, I'm about ready to upload the first
iteration of my hopefully-to-become-standard object exception stuff,
hence I need an ID...

Name:	Pete Jordan

Email:	pjordan1@email.mot.com and pete@horus.cix.co.uk - if you can
organise to CC mail to both addresses, I would be grateful. The first is
my work email where, for the time being at least, I'll be doing most
development. However, as contractor skmu, I may move on at short notice
and I'd like records of any correspondence at home in any case.

URL:	http://www.cix.co.uk/~skydancer/ is a good starting point.

UserID:	PJORDAN

Exception::	cdpO  A standard base exception object class
::Basic		cdpO  A subclass that should cover most requirements
::Try		cdph  eval encapsulation - try () except {} etc.
::Default	cdcO  Patch to make die/croak() create exception objects

I appreciate that Exception is already in use, but the only live module
therein appears to be Exception::Cxx which seems pretty much orthogonal
with what I'm doing.

See threads with subjects "__DIE__ and exception hooks" and "A common
base exception object for Perl - RFC" in p5p.

Pete
