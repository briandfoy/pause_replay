     why:

    I have a collection of small modules that I have developed for for
    projects which I don't feel have already been covered. At least not
    in a way that fitted with what I was trying to achieve. I would like
    to put these in the public domain. Examples include SMTP sending
    utilising CRAM-MD5 authentication, simple manipulation of .htaccess,
    .htpasswd files, Google Analytics API interface.
