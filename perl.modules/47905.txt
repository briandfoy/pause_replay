Hi Brian,

Frankly I am swamped with the day job, and would be happy to pass this onto
a willing volounteer. My time spent dabbling with code is somewhat limited
these days.
Thanks

Hi Dave,

A patch for Net::SMTP::Multipart showed up on the Perl Modules list,
and I notice that you haven't released a new version in quite a while.
Would you still like to maintain this module or could someone take over
maintenance?

Thanks,
