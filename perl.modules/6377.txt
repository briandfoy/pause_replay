We're just calling it the Mason Tracker.

Its definitely not part of Mason.  Simply an app that uses Mason.

Last time I proposed a namespace that was simply the name of my app
(Alzabo::) one of the people on the modules list objected.

I'm familiar with the guidelines.  If there's no objections I think we're
going to use Apps::Tracker.  That way other apps can share that top level
namespace (Apps::*) and not worry about stepping on other modules.

We could, alternatively, use Tracker.  I like that cause its less typing.
