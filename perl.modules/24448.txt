Well, I guess, although im unconvinced. It seems to me that Data::Stream by
itself conveys serialization, which is all that dumping is. The fact that it
suggests IO Streams is just a nice coincidental byproduct.

I suppose Im also a little adverse to names like this just because of the
wise guy factor "What, it takes a dump in a stream?" . Maybe that isnt a
particularly relevent but still. (I encountered this already with BFDump and
im a little keen to avoid it this time round. Names are important :-)

Here are my personal criteria for a name for the module:
1. it avoids wise guy names.
2. its short enough that its not a PITA for -M usage.
3. its in the Data:: name space.
4. Id like it to denote that it streams (as in writes to a stream)
5. Id like it to denote that it serializes
6. Id like it to leave room so that it allows for formats other than perl.

So I was thinking

Data::Stream
    for the current release,  with it being a wrapper into

  Data::Stream::Perl
  Data::Stream::XML
  Data::Stream::YAML
  Data::Stream::Binary

or whatever once I have other versions.

Anyway,  i'm interested to see if you still stand by your view or if you
have alternate suggestions based on the above. Im not totally sold on
Data::Stream, but so far its the best of what ive seen and heard.

Cheers,
Yves
