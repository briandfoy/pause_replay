Hi,

Jochen Wiedmann transferred ownership of SQL::Statement to me almost a 
year ago, yet CPAN.pm and the modules list still point to him as the 
owner.  Needless to say, this causes many problems for users seeking to 
download the latest release.  Please change the ownership to JZUCKER or 
let me know what Jochen or I needs to do to alter this situation.

Thanks!
