The two-character ISO language specifier is used with the general 
category to indicate locale-specific modules.

For example, Lingua::EN::FooBar is a language module, for the English 
language, that foo bars.

Likewise, Lingua::DE::FooBar would be the equivalent, probably with the 
same API for German.

Specifically note Finance::Bank::DE::DeutcheBank

Of most interest to you I suspect would be the Business::DE namespace.

That said, within that namespace, it would probably be a good idea to 
keep at least the abstract and maybe a single paragraph in English to 
give the rest of the world at least a basic idea about the module.

=pod

=head1 NAME

Business::DE::Steuer - A collection of German Tax-related modules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Business::DE::Steuer(Tax) provides a collection of modules that help to 
calculate various German taxes. As this module is really only of any use 
to locals, the remainder of this documentation will only be provided in 
German.

Business::DE::Steuer liefert eine Ansammlung Module, die helfen, 
verschiedene deutsche Steuern zu errechnen.

etc

=head1 MODULES

Business::DE::Steuer::Korperschaft - ...

...

=cut

Note that I've left the top-level headings in English. This is because 
some build systems will scan your pod to look for details.

I also have no idea if that break up of Körperschaftssteuer is going to 
work (as it is even more backwards than it is for English, which at 
least has seperate works).

I'm not sure how amenable the CPAN itself would be to having

Business::DE::Steuer
Business::DE::Korperschaftsteuer
Business::DE::Gewerbesteuer
etc
etc

If it possible to split and reverse to create the subnamespaces, please 
do so. And please keep to plain English-locale word characters.

And of course, wherever it is possible to split of generic 
locale-neutral components, please do so.

And if you have any additional questions about specific modules, ask us.
