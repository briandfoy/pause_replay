Argh!  I missed the upload window, so still can't use this account.
Any chance someone could send me a GPG-encrypted password?  My key
(which was used to sign this message) can be found at
http://www.abstractfactory.org/gpg_key.html, as well as having been
entered at http://www.keyserver.net/.

I hope that wouldn't be too much of a hassle; AFAIK it would be more
secure than sending me the url to change my password, and I don't know
whether I will get my mail in time next time, either.
