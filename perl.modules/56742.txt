Somewhat. It's an error in that the registration is valid (and will
stay). However, you registered those namespaces but never actually
uploaded an implementation of them. That would have meant there is a
file named lib/CORBA/Python.pm (lib/CORBA/XPIDL.pm) or just Python.pm
with at least a "package CORBA::Python;" (or ...XPIDL; respectively)
statement inside. Lacking this, the CORBA-Python distribution is not
installable via "cpan CORBA::Python" since it's not indexed under that
name. If you look at your search.cpan.org author page, you'll find that
the link for these two registrations under "Registered Modules" is dead
because the indexer couldn't find an implementation for the namespaces.

Now, there is two things you can do: Ignore this, which is just fine, or
include an almost-empty* placeholder module in the next release so it
can be indexed.

Best regards,
Steffen

* almost-empty means that it needs at least the package statement and a
true return value. Plus possibly any documentation you would like to
have in there.
