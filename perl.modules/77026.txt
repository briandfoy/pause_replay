The  files will disappear from CPAN if you've scheduled them for
deletion. 

Can you tell us which file shouldn't be there so the right people can
do the necessary surgery? If you don't want that to be public, you can
email me directly.

Can you tell us how you accidently uploaded them? Were you using a
particular tool or did you just choose the wrong file to upload, and so
on. I'm just curious.

Thanks,
