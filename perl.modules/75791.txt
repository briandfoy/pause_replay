Subject: Module submission Algorithm::NINumber::UK

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Algorithm::NINumber::UK
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interface to UK NI Number.
  userid:      MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    I had initially requested for Algorithm::NIN which was refused and
    asked to add the country code. Later I requested for
    Algorithm::NIN::UK, which again got refused because NIN wasn't very
    clear. I then suggested either Algorithm::NINumber::UK or
    Algorithm::NationalInsuranceNumber::UK. But never got any response
    unfortunately. Therefore submitting fresh request so that it catches
    the eyes of PAUSE admins.

  enteredby:   MANWAR (Mohammad S Anwar)
  enteredon:   Mon Apr 25 00:02:48 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Algorithm::NINumber::
::UK              bdpOp Interface to UK NI Number.                   MANWAR
