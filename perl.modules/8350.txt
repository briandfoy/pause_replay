Perhaps I'm a control freak or something (OK, I *know* I'm a control
freak) but I'm concerned that we can add a namespace with a single
click, even if there hasn't been adequate discussion.  That is, silence
is considered to be assent, and can lead to namespace creation, but in 
fact that silence could just mean that everyone's busy with other work, 
or people put it in their "too hard" basket, or something.  And it's
pretty hard to revoke or change a namespace once it's in there.

I want to see a list of "here's what hasn't been discussed yet" so I can
go through and send email to most of them with "This looks fine" or
sometimes "This looks dodgy for these reasons, please fix".  Only after
a "this looks fine" should the namespace actually be approved.

Sure, it's extra work, but with a good system in place I could have it
send out form letters easily.
