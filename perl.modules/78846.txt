Subject: Module submission Business::CyberSource::Report

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Business::CyberSource::Report
  DSLIP:       RdpOa
  description: Interface to CyberSource's reports
  userid:      AUBERTG (Guillaume Aubert)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The Business::CyberSource namespace already exists, so it makes
    sense to put this under Business::CyberSource as it is an API for
    the same company.

    However, the reports API that CyberSource makes available is
    independent from their payment processing webservice, so in my
    opinion it warrants having this be a separate package
    Business::CyberSource::Report potentially maintained by a different
    person.

  enteredby:   AUBERTG (Guillaume Aubert)
  enteredon:   Fri Dec 16 04:47:37 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Business::CyberSource::
::Report          RdpOa Interface to CyberSource's reports           AUBERTG
