The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Community
  DSLIP:       bmpOp
  description: Represent & work with biological communities
  userid:      FANGLY (Florent Angly)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    BioPerl mailing list

  similar:
    None

  rationale:

    The Bio-Community distribution is part of the BioPerl project and
    is written using Moose. The goals of Bio-Community are to provide
    objects to represent communities of organisms and modules to perform
    various operations on them: reading/writing them in different file
    formats, calculating relative or absolute abundance, estimating
    alpha, beta or gamma diversity, etc. To my knowledge, no other Perl
    modules provide these features.

    The code is developed at https://github.com/bioperl/Bio-Community .
    While Bio-Community is in an early state, it already proves useful.
    I would like to release its first version (0.1.0) to generate
    community interest and get other developers interested in extending
    it further.

    The root Bio namespace is currently used by modules for biologists,
    while Bio::Community is so far vacant and seems suitable for the
    intended purpose.

  enteredby:   FANGLY (Florent Angly)
  enteredon:   Wed Oct 30 22:49:26 2013 UTC

The resulting entry would be:

Bio::
::Community       bmpOp Represent & work with biological communities FANGLY
