The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Carp::Proxy
  DSLIP:       RdpOp
  description: Diagnostic Delegation
  userid:      THAIRMAN (Paul Liebert)
  chapterid:   2 (Language_Extensions)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    Providing detailed error messages, especially if they make an
    attempt at diagnosis, is extra work for developers. I have found
    that rich messages pay dividends by making life better for end users
    and for maintainers. As a developer I find that thinking about how I
    would provide diagnosis is also a helpful mindset during
    development.

    Let's make it easier to produce nice error messages.

    Carp::Proxy is a function factory that makes replacements for
    warn(), die(), confess() etc. The replacements all call a user
    defined subroutine to perform message composition, but provide it
    with a utility object that makes the job easier.

    Carp itself is in Language Extensions along with other
    error/warning modules, so I think this is where it belongs.

The resulting entry would be:

Carp::
::Proxy           RdpOp Diagnostic Delegation                        THAIRMAN
