Dan,

    I'm sorry for your inconvenience, but please remember that CPAN is
an entirely volunteer effort.  If the Comprehensive PHP Archive
Network responds more quickly to your requests, please let us know so
that we can learn from them.

    1/2 :^)

    - one of the incredibly busy (and occasionally cranky) volunteers
who helps maintain CPAN (but, unfortunately, not one who can update
the modules list for you).
