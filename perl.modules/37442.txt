Well, so far that seems to be what most people like.  I originally had
"class.pm".  No one has come up with suggestions that people seem to
really be happy with.

alias.pm does not work as there is already an Alias.pm on the CPAN. 
Perl on a case-insensitive file system will happily "use"  a file with
the wrong case in the name (though it will choke when you reference the
package name in the code after that.)

That doesn't easily allow for:

  use alias 'Namespace::Preferred::Customer';

In my experience using this module (well, a variation that  I used
extensively at my former company (whose already given me permission to
duplicate this)), this  syntax is the common case.

There's another aspect to the syntax which  I didn't show which makes
some of the problems more clear:

  # import also accepts a scalar if you have only one item
  use aka 'Long::Package::Name::For::Customer',
      as => 'Cust', import => [qw/foo bar/];

I allow for importing, but I need  to make it very clear what is the
import list and what is the name we're aliasing to (if not the default
alias of the last part of the package name).  Since this is  for OO
classes, this is usually not a problem.

Cheers,
Ovid
