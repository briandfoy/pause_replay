The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Bio::Filter
  DSLIP:       idpfo
  description: Filters collection for bioinformatic tools
  userid:      ACPGUEDES (Aureliano Coelho Proenca Guedes)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    https://github.com/acpguedes/Bio--Filter.git

  similar:

  rationale:

    Collection of tools for filtering information from long lists of
    results commonly generated by bioinformatics programs.

    In CPAN, we know the BioPerl, a collection of tools (modules) to
    easy development of Perl scripts to bioinformatic.

    Bioinformatics developer know that the list size of results from
    bioinformatic tools may be too long and with results that we don't
    need to nothing.

    Let's to make easy filter a bioinformatics list results using the
    Perl language purpose.

    Yes, I'd know that exist tools a lot in BioPerl to doing that, but
    let's to join all here, and make a simple, easy and wearable tools
    inside here.

    We will give preference to tools exportable routines with clear and
    direct documentation.
