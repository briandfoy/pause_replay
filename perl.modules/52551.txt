The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       VEGAS
  DSLIP:       Rdpfg
  description: Help develop card-based games
  userid:      HAHAFAHA (Leonid Grinberg)
  chapterid:   24 (Commercial_Software_Interfaces)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    This module allows the creation of card games. It allows the
    developer to worry about the game he is writing, and not about the
    mechanics of the cards themselves. This is useful to lots of people
    because its applications are so extensive -- almost anything can be
    written using it. The functions are not at all complicated, but
    having a module to group them will allow them to eventually grow and
    become more complete, in order to help the developers.

  enteredby:   HAHAFAHA (Leonid Grinberg)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 11 04:33:17 2007 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

VEGAS             Rdpfg Help develop card-based games                HAHAFAHA
