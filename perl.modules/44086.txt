Hello!

I plan to contribute new perl module to cpan.org.
The module is Perl library that implements object-relational mapping.
Its features are much similar to those of Java's Hibernate library,
but interface is much different and easier to use. Also you can think
of it as of (more powerful) alternative to Class-DBI.
All operations with database are generalized and collected in separate
layer which can use DBI but not limited to it.

Existing features (version 0.9):
  * Inheritance of persistent objects
  * No SQL statement writings needed
  * Full-featured search of objects in DB using perl expressions
  * Objects statistics (utilizes GROUP BY)
  * Foreign keys emulation
  * One-to-many and many-to-many links between objects
  * Use objects of custom classes as properties of persistent object
  * Automatic methods for get and set object properties
  * Support for MySQL database

Features planned for release 1.0:
  * Transaction support
  * Support other than MySQL databases

I propose to use namespace 'ORM' (Object Relational Mapper)
for my library as it is commonly used definition for such
class of software.

Please let me know if it is not possible to use
that namespace and if it not reflects its usage features.
