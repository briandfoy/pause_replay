Hi brian and other modules dwellers,

unfortunately, I haven't been able to spends as much time on namespace
issues as I should have. (Sorry, brian) Nevertheless, that's not going
to get any better in the next couple of weeks as I'll be on an extended
business trip to Argentina with spotty net access and tight schedules.

Best regards,
Steffen
