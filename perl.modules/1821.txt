Hi,

sorry for being nasty, but I have already requested this three or four
times.
Please change the names RPC::pServer and RPC::pClient in the module list
to RPC::PlServer and RPC::PlClient. The former are *really* outdated,
but I keep getting questions on them, due to the module list.
(Note that I cannot change the module names in the WWW frontend, but
I guess that's intentional?)

And, while you are on that: It would be nice, if you could create a
directory "old"
and move the pRPC files to that location.


Thanks,

Jochen
