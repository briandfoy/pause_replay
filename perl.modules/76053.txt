The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Finance::Bank::US::ShareBuilder
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Interact with ShareBuilder accounts
  userid:      SSEVERIN (Steven N. Severinghaus)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    Bzr repository not yet published

  similar:
    Finance::Bank::US::INGDirect

  rationale:

    No module is available on CPAN that provides equivalent
    functionality. This module provides access to your ShareBuilder
    investment account data in a structured format. It is a relatively
    low-level module that I expect will have quite a few uses--for
    example, setting up transaction notifications, archiving and
    aggregating data, and generally automating some of the tedium of
    keeping up with investments.

    I expect to be responsive to bug reports and am looking forward to
    expanding the functionality of the module.

  enteredby:   SSEVERIN (Steven N. Severinghaus)
  enteredon:   Thu May 12 18:49:35 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Finance::Bank::US::
::ShareBuilder    bdpOp Interact with ShareBuilder accounts          SSEVERIN
