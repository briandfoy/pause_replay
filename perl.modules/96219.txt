While maintaining that I am essentially an outsider in this discussion, I
was CC-ed so I will reply. I read both of the indicated comment differently
than you do I think.

Matt does affirm a role for you here, but he also asserts his role as
organizer.

Earlier in the thread, David specifically says that this is not the venue
to be designated BDFL. Any future comment to the effect that you are later
on must imply "if so designated in a proper venue".
I agree with him. While yes I think it would have been helpful if the
intention made at the time of the transfer of first-come to you were in a
more public forum than IRC logs, I also think that comments halfway down a
BPO posting isn't a great place to assert BDFL-ness.

(BTW, I'm not sure if I'm actually on this list so if it bounces could
someone please forward it? I am only actually participating on the DBIC
list, I didn't expect the discussion to migrate back here).
