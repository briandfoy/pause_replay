Hi-

Any luck getting ahold of the current maintainers of Compress::Bzip2?  
It's been a couple of weeks now, since the last email.  I'm waiting for 
the ownership to transfer to me before I upload any new stuff, cause if 
you aren't going to transfer the ownership I should make up a new name 
and let the Compress:Bzip2 line die.  Upload the fixes under the new 
name.  Compress::Bzlib?

thanks,
cpan id "ARJAY"
