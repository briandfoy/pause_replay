The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Apache::AutoLogin
  DSLIP:       bnpfa
  description: auto login for basic authentication
  userid:      MMWEBER (Marcel Weber)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:
    debian-security, mod_perl mailinglist

  similar:

  rationale:

    Apache::AutoLogin was designed to allow automatic login onto
    websites which are using basic authentication. It fetches the
    credentials that are sent by the client and stores them in an client
    side cookie, which is aes256 encrypted. Later logons will be made
    using the credentials that are stored in the cookie. The client
    won't even know, that it has to authenticate (no more plaintext
    credentials are sent and no more annoying popups).

    The module is completely independent of the underlying
    authentication mecanism. As long you are using basic authentication
    it will work (tested with auth_ldap and auth_pam).

The resulting entry would be:

Apache::
::AutoLogin       bnpfa auto login for basic authentication          MMWEBER
