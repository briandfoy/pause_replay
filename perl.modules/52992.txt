     why:

    I have developed a module that performs mass pattern-matching and
    grouping via user-specified configuration file written in XML. This
    simple XML file specifies criteria in the form of regexes that
    dictate what user-supplied data will be associated with a specified
    group. The user supplies a string to the appropriate method, and the
    user is returned all matches. A "match" is defined via regular
    expressions wrapped in <inclusion> and <exclusion> tags, to specify
    what should be included or excluded respectively.

    This module also supports back-references that are very similar to
    Perl's memory variables such that group/pattern names can be
    dynamically generated based on the contents of the match. In effect,
    a user can group items under a pattern name that won't be determined
    until the actual matching occurs.

    This module has particular application to network management where
    hundreds and often thousands of devices need to be categorized into
    many groups. The ability to rapidly categorize and group devices in
    network management is useful for reporting, delegating
    responsibility, and classification.
