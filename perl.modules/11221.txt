The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Text::PCL::Basic
  DSLIP:       Rdpfp
  description: Create PCL for printing plain text files
  userid:      PRL (Phil R Lawrence)
  chapterid:   11 (String_Lang_Text_Proc)
  communities:
    comp.lang.perl.modules

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This module will provide PCL strings that cause your printer to
    print a plain text file with *exactly* the right font -- i.e. the
    exact font needed to fill the page with as many fixed width
    characters across and down as you specify.

    Why is this good?

    If you are creating plain text reports you need not be constrained
    to specific width and height layouts. You need 133x67 characters
    instead of 132x66? No problem. You need 350x200 characters? No
    problem. (Magnifying glass not included.) You can choose any
    combination of width and lines per page.

    My number one usage of this module: printing source code for a good
    read-through. Have you ever tried to print source code from Notepad?
    What a brain dead program... you end up with a huge, unusable font.
    It's not much better to print from a program where you can choose
    the font either. Too much trial and error. By using this module the
    printer can use *exactly* the right font to fit your widest line
    without wrapping, leaving blocks visually intact.

    Why is this module called Text::PCL::Basic? Because it does nothing
    fancy with PCL. It's just a straightforward way to layout a
    fixed-width page.
