This is not true.  Check:

   http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/E/EL/ELIZABETH/

and you will see all of the registered modules listed.

Please take off all Nextrieve* modules from the registered modules 
list.  The product for which these Perl modules provided glue, is no 
more.  And I have no intent to support Nextrieve in any way, shape or 
form.

If by any chance, there is still a nextrieve user out there, they 
should go to Backpan and get the last version of the modules there. 
I also have no problem with anyone taking over these modules.  But I 
think registration of these modules is overkill.
