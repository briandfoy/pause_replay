The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Filter::Swears
  DSLIP:       bdpOp
  description: Filter out words or phrases from strings.
  userid:      PAUL (Paul Wilson)
  chapterid:    2 (Perl_Core_Modules)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    The namespace Filter::Swears is very clear and obvious and it
    relates accurately to the purpose of the module.

    Although the fitered words do not necessarily have to be swear
    words, the module was originally created with this intention and so
    gives people a clear understanding of what the module can do for
    them.

  enteredby:   PAUL (Paul Wilson)
  enteredon:   Sat May  4 11:20:59 2002 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

Filter::
::Swears          bdpOp Filter out words or phrases from strings.    PAUL
