Hello,

I want to release a module to CPAN in the next few days and register
it. However in the past my naming choices have been frowned upon : )

The module lets you process several HTTP::Requests at once, and
retrieve the responses as they come back (assume that the module is
called HTTP::Queue ):

my $q =3D HTTP::Queue->new;

# Feed in an array of HTTP::Request objects
$q->add( @http_requests );

while( $q->total_count ) {
  my $res =3D $q->next_response;

  if ( ! $res ) {
    sleep 1;
    next;
  }

  # Do some processing of the response, which is a HTTP::Response object
  ...
}


This module was originally written to be used by some code that spent
most of its time waiting for a web pages to download and then very
little time processing those pages. It takes the requests, creates a
IO::Select object, sends the requests in a non blocking manner and
then manages the select lists retrieving the responses as they come
back. The order that they are returned in is the order that they are
recieved in, not the order they are added in.

The module allows you to do the following:

 * process several HTTP requests at once
 * start an HTTP request, do something else, retrieve the response.

As it can only work over HTTP the 'HTTP::' name space would seem best.
These are what I consider to be possible names (in preference order):

HTTP::Queue
HTTP::Parallel
HTTP::Background
HTTP::SelectList


Your thoughts would be much appreciated.

Cheers,
  Edmund.
