Could please explain a stupid user like me,
what's the difference to Mail::Mailer which is able to send mail
via sendmail, mail and smtp.

In addition, for me, there's a big difference between smtp and sendmail.
sendmail is a typical unix program, while
smtp is an internet protocol.
I hope you won't mix it.


Greetings,
Andrea
