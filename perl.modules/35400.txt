I think we can make an exception in this case.  We don't like it,
but we don't always get our way.  You've tried to work within
PAUSE precendent and it just hasn't worked for you for reasons
neither of us control.

So, in this case, tell us what you want and I or someone else will
approve them.  BBC or BBCKENT are fine in this case.

Sorry for the hassle, and thanks for your understanding.
