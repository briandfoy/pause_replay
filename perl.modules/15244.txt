I changed it in the module docs (will release in a few days after I 
incorporate the additions suggested by David. I'm feeling a bit sick 
so it'll probably take about two weeks to get to it.)

I can't change the module metadata, the module is probably still 
owned by MJD to some extent, "Pause\Edit Module Metadata" doesn't 
list the module.

Thanks, Jenda
