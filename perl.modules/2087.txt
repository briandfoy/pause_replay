MQL, Music Query Language, is a set of modules helping to access a
syndicated music database. This ranges from discographic information
about album/song releases to 'emotioneered' data, i.e. subjective
assessment of music, popularity of albums. This is addressing
developers of user frontends (MP3 players, playlist generators, ...)
but also for B2B applications.

As the top-level 'Music' seems to be under discussion right now,
I could imagine that

Name           DSLI  Description                                  Info
-------------  ----  -------------------------------------------- -----
Music::MQL     Sdcf  Music Query Language, syndicate              DRRHO
Net::MQL       Sdcf  Music Query Language, protocol               DRRHO

would fit neatly. As MQL is much more than a protocol (there happens
quite a bit at the client side), Net::MQL alone would probably be a 
suboptimal place.
