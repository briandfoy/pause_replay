It is a "swiss army knife module" that is presently used in several 
released modules. If you are old enough to remember the "radio" show 
Captain Midnight, he had a magic decoder ring .... thus the name for 
the module. Module is currently used by several other released 
modules and contains special methods that use a combination of 
various hash/crypt/encode/decode methods implemented by "some" other 
modules. CapnMidNite contains some specialized methods that are not 
implemented elsewhere. All of the code is written in C to be compact 
and fast.

No, they are inter-related. Some individual methods can already be 
found in other modules but are used withing CapnMidNite in a manner 
that would not be as efficient if the external modules were used 
instead.
