(RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD ONE HUNDRED
AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS   

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars) from a Prime
Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look
for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable  and fit to provide either an existing bank
account  or  to set up a new  Bank a/c  immediately to
receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to 
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important business
trusting in  you and believing  in God that you  will
never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr, Oscar Cereal,the Auditor General of prime
banks, during the course of our auditing  I
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated 
on this account again, after going through some old 
files in the records I discovered that the owner of
the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money
is floating and  if I do not
remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. the owner of this account is  Mr.  Allan P.
Seaman, a foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he
died,  since 1993. and  no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Allan
P. Seaman   until his death was the manager  Diamond
Safari  [pty]. SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account, 

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a
safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and
the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Allan P. Seaman is 
a foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved
into a foreign a/c 

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together   I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer,  I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take
urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax
number including the full details of the account to be
used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding
agreement that will  bind us together  before
transferring the money to any account of  your choice
where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your
country for withdrawal, sharing and  investments.

I need your full co-operation to make
this work fine. because the management is ready to
approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you  are  capable  and will meet up with
instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never, 
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this
money to any foreigner's reliable account which you
can provide with assurance that this money will be
intact pending our physical arrival in your country
for
sharing. The bank official will  destroy all documents
of transaction
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to
any place and to build confidence  you can  come
immediately  to discuss with me face to face after
which I will make this remittance in 
your presence and three of us will fly to your country
at least two days ahead of the money going into the
account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and
foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.    

Yours truly

Mr, Oscar Cereal
