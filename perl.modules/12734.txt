The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       CGI::Htauth
  DSLIP:       adpfp
  description: Authentication and encryption for http
  userid:      PJB (Peter Billam)
  chapterid:   15 (World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI)
  communities:

  similar:

  rationale:

    CGI::Htauth offers a variety of authentication mechanisms to the
    CGI programmer. The main subroutine is &authenticate($config) simple
    router configuration, with different authentication modes to be
    offered to different IP addresses or ranges. Possible modes include
    allow, deny, password and challenge-response. CGI::Htauth uses
    Crypt::Tea, CGI::FormBuilder and CGI.pm. From a JavaScript browser,
    The user is authenticated by encrypting a random challenge, so the
    password is never transmitted, and subsequent traffic in both
    directions is encrypted. Timeouts are handled and there are built-in
    buttons for logout and password changing.

The resulting entry would be:

CGI::
