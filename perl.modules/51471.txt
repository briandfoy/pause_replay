I have given up permissions, but it did not ask me about who I should  
transfer to.


cc'ing in modules@perl.org

   - I clicked on "Pass primary maintainership status to somebody  
else (giving it up at the same time)*

   - I selected all my modules

   - I hit submitt, expecting to get a prompt about who I should  
transfer to

   - I didn't get any prompt for this and I now I can't do anything as I
don't have any modules registered to me.


Apologies - I seem to have done something wrong. Can this be fixed -  
I think the primary
maintainer/person should be BIOPERLML
