Subject: Module submission Sys::Configtest

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Sys::Configtest
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: System configuration related unit tests
  userid:      IANK (Ian Kilgore)
  chapterid:   4 (Operating_System_Interfaces)
  communities:
    perlmonks (node 623228)

  similar:
    Test::File::Contents File::Grep

  rationale:

    Sys::Configtest provides functions to help test system
    configuration, such as installed packages or config files. It was
    built for use in a cfengine staging environment, however it is not
    tied to cfengine (or any configuration management tool).

    I chose the Sys:: namespace rather than Test:: because while it
    implements a Test:: like interface (it's based on
    Test::Module::Builder), it does not actually test perl /code/. It
    instead tests configuration files and installed packages.

    Test::File::Contents provides some functions similar to
    file_contains() in my module, but it focuses solely on files,
    whereas Sys::Configtest tests files, packages, and eventually other
    aspects of system configuration, such as directories, links, network
    interfaces, etc.

    File::Grep provides grep-like functions to test the contents of
    files. It is much the same situation as Test::File::Contents, in
    that it focuses solely on searching through files. (Also, unlike
    Test::File::Contents, it does not do unit tests).

The resulting entry would be:

Sys::
::Configtest      bdpfp System configuration related unit tests      IANK
