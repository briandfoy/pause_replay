Since today (rev. 241) PAUSE has a new feature:

Admins can put messages for individual users into the database and
these users will *always* have the message(s) on all pages they visit
near the top of the page.

This message board is a convenient way to contact users that cannot be
reached by email anymore. I have already posted messages to NOBULL and
AREIBENS because their secret email addresses bounce.

Messages do not expire ever, they need to be deleted once they are
outdated, preferably by the admin who wrote the message, but other
admins can jump in if needed. But the receipients cannot delete the
messages.

So the PAUSE has two new pages in the admin menu: post a message,
delete messages.

Messages are limited to 255 characters to keep the annoyance to the
users low.

For better transparence I have, at the same time, improved on the
"switch user" feature. When you click "Select User/Action" and do
something on behalf of a user, the status widget on the top right
always shows both your name and email and the other user's name and
email. And it also shows the pending messages from the message board
*for the other user*.

Coincidentally, the "Delete messages" page has already prepared links
to these pages, just to keep potentially useful clicking paths short.
If you want to see this in action, the quickest way is to post a
message to yourself.

Enjoy,
