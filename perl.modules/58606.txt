Sorry about the typo.

Well, that precedence is just as valid and I was actually aware of two 
of those modules. Changing the namespace of an established module, 
however, isn't possible (and not desireable either). Perhaps I should 
have stuck to the "clarity" argument. :)

Unless one of the other PAUSE admins objects, I'll register it for you 
in a few days at the latest. You can safely upload to PAUSE using that 
namespace (or any other) at any time. The namespace registrations aren't 
tied to the right to upload any modules but make the module show up in 
the modules list and encourage getting advice.

Cheers,
Steffen
