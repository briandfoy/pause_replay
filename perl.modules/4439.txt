The above is a very tentative name.

Anyway, I'm about to start work on a generic argument validation module.
The module will allow you to validate arguments passed to you
methods/functions to any arbitrary level of pickiness that you desire.

It seems like this would be generically useful, particularly during
development of larger projects (I'm going to arrange some sort of magic
switch so that you can make the validation a no-op for production).

The names I've come up with are various mixture of Param(s), Arg(s)
followed by Validate, Validator, Check, Checker and so on.

It also occurs to me that perhaps this module belongs in the Devel::
namespace since it is arguably a development support module.

Anyway, I'm not too picky.  What are your ideas?
