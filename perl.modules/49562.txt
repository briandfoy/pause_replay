The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Net::TCP::PtyServer
  DSLIP:       bdpfp
  description: Server up pseudo-TTYs over incoming TELNET
  userid:      RJLEE (Robert J Lee)
  chapterid:   16 (Server_and_Daemon_Utilities)
  communities:

  similar:
    Net::TCP Net::PTY

  rationale:

    Net::TCP::PtyServer is analogous to the existing Net::TCP::Server,
    although it serves PTYs rather than raw network sockets.

    This is a utility module that would be useful for networked
    curses-based interfaces, such as terminal servers, configuration
    utilities or online text-based games (MUDs, MUCKs etc).

    I wrote this module because writing an interface to use TELNET is
    not an easy task for someone who does not have both low-level
    terminal experience, and multi-threaded socket-level networking
    experience. Even with Net::TCP and Net::PTY I found I needed to do a
    lot of tweaking to get it to work properly, and the risks of
    fork-bombing or using vast amounts of CPU time would put off many
    novice coders.

    This module should be listed in the repository because, from the
    perspective of a new perl programmer, it takes a daunting task and
    makes it simple.

The resulting entry would be:

Net::TCP::
