You can leave your hat on, modules!

I am VERESC @ CPAN.
While implementing a new feature for the FCGI::Spawn, the mod_perl emulation, I
found the Apache::Fake very useful for this.
There are some drawbacks that avoid me to use it for that without any
warnings. As a result I have several subs for Apache::Fake's packages redefined
at:
http://gitweb.vereshagin.org/FCGI-Spawn/blob/HEAD:/FCGI-Spawn/Spawn/ModPerl.pm
as well as spome features like mod_perl2 emulation support.
But even with those things added with warnings from Perl, I still need to patch
the new() sub which is too long to be rewritten in a separate module file. THis
adds independency from the Apache::ConfigFile, too. Although I believe it
should be made optional inside the Apache::Fake. The patch is:
http://gitweb.vereshagin.org/FCGI-Spawn/blob/HEAD:/contrib/cpan/Apache.Fake.pm.fcgi.spawn.patch

I tried to reach the author by e-mail. Here is the result of the SMTP session about the message below:
===

===

And I made the new ticket being aware that 2 previous tickets with pretty
obvious patches were likely to be ignored for 3+ years: 
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Apache-Fake
my one is:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=58091

I'd like to reach the author and know his opinion about my wishes on
Apache::Fake. But anyway I want to take it over, as there is no much hope to
find Jorg.

Thank you.

I've seen the future J??rg <= it is motto.

I have some questions by your permission.
I can save them on https://rt.cpan.org as a reminder.

But commonly I use to talk by person to keep public places more clean.

1. I can not see ConfigFile-1.23.tar.gz at CPAN home directory. It is claimed
as not supported, isn't it any good to switch to something else?
2. I need some general-purpose dummy httpd.conf to work with. I can not read this config:
===
  <Location />
    <Directory />
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler Apache
    </Directory
  </Location>
===

without this patch:

        &$addContext;
 
        my $ctx2 = $ctx;

        &$addContext;
 
        $loc = '/';

the first line in question is because there is no server name yet in question
at the init moment, e. g., when the mod_perl's startup.pl happens.
the second is about even when $ctx can be created it can not be compared as a
scalar as there is no 'nomethod' method for it. Here is why I worry:

I'm implementing mod_perl imitation feature for FCGI::Spawn . I'm abused with
Apache::Fake's 'config reading' mandatory feature. I'd like to avoid it at all
as most CGI-like mod_perl applications just use Apache::Request only.
I mean with Apache::Fake at least Buzilla.org and WebGUI.org should work
without any patching.

Is it possible to take Apache::Fake on FCGI::Spawn's board this way? As a best
thing I'd prefer splitting the httpd.conf reading into separate methods so I
could replace them with derived class.

Thank you!

oh and... which line outputs the 'Content-type: text/plain' header from the new
method? just see no one on a 'grep plain'.
