Subject: Module submission OpenOffice::UNO

The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       OpenOffice::UNO
  DSLIP:       cd+Ol
  description: OpenOffice.org perlUNO Bridge
  userid:      JOEYATES (Joe Yates)
  chapterid:   5 (Networking_Devices_IPC)
  communities:

  similar:
    OpenOffice::OODoc OpenOffice::OOBuilder

  rationale:

    This is the perl side of the perlUNO bridge to OpenOffice.org
    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/perluno).

    The project, which has been dormant for 2 years, is the perl
    equivalent of pyUNO, which has been under active development.

    Initially, the perl module was called perlUNO, which is now
    considered unsuitable.

    This namespace is both more logical and easier to find.

  enteredby:   JOEYATES (Joe Yates)
  enteredon:   Thu Jan 26 08:57:04 2006 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

OpenOffice::
::UNO             cd+Ol OpenOffice.org perlUNO Bridge                JOEYATES
