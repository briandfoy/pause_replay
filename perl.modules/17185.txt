the only thing i see there is that Tim suggested a name.  i do not 
see any decision or plurality.

i'm was not suggesting that you dump it from CPAN, but that we try to
work together to reduce parallel development and duplication of effort.
i typically suggest that when i see someone submit a module that is
very similar to another one.  however, i think you have made it clear
that you do not want to do that.

i don't think Parse is the right name---it only describes part of 
your module, since you also write the structure back to a file.
indeed, you could use your module for its intended task without 
ever parsing anything.  furthermore, this sort of task does not fit
in with most of the other modules in Parse::*.

the task seems much more suited to either the Config:: or
ConfigReader:: namespaces, and that is where i think you should
register it.
