Seconded!

While that is correct, we must make clear that there are two
incarnations of the module list: the abstract module list that lives
in the database and the published module list which is stalled.
Apparently you mean the database instance because the stalled one is,
ahem, stalled.

I think, one thing that has changed is that the whole PAUSE code is
now publicly available in an SVN repository.

https://pause.perl.org:5460/svn/pause/trunk/

Or as a tarball from

ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/PAUSE-code/
