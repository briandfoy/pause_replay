The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       Project::Gantt
  DSLIP:       adpOp
  description: Gantt charts for project management
  userid:      AWESTHOLM (Alexander Christian Westholm)
  chapterid:   23 (Miscellaneous_Modules)
  communities:
    modules@perl.org

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    In addition to indexing of my Project::Gantt module, which uses
    Image::Magick to create Gantt charts, I propose the creation of the
    Project root namespace. This namespace would provide a home for
    Project management utilities. In addition to the module I have just
    uploaded, I have several other ideas for modules that would belong
    under this namespace.

    The module itself, Project::Gantt, is a simple, flexible way to
    generate Gantt charts. It has the capability to apply skins to the
    charts, so users can customize many aspects of the charts they
    generate. The charts themselves can be drawn by hour, day or month.

    If there are any questions about this project, or the proposed
    namespace, I will be out of the country (without computer) for 11
    days starting Thursday the 5th, so please accept my apologies for
    delayed responses.

The resulting entry would be:

Project::
