Hello,

I emailed Rafael Sevilla, author id DIDO, regarding
his SHA-256, which I found to have a bug in it. I
tried to contact him using the email address listed
in PAUSE, but it seems that he no longer uses it.
Here's my email to him. I'd like to replace his
module with my own implementation.

Best regards,

JCDUQUE

Hello Rafael,

I'd like to tell you that I compared your
SHA-256 with a Windows program called HashCalc
as well as with the implementation found in
http://www.aarongifford.com/computers/sha.html
and I definitely saw some discrepancies. I have
reimplemented SHA-256 in Perl using the code from
aarongifford.com but I'm hoping that you could
fix your implementation first to avoid duplication
of work. I'll upload my own implementation if you
cannot fix your module. Thanks

Julius
