Subject: Proposed module Net::Metaweb

From: hds@caffeineconcepts.com (Hayden Stainsby)

I would like to propose a new Perl module / namespace.

Metaweb a database-ish data-store "with a focus on organizing and  
managing complex data structures."[1] The only online example to date  
is Freebase (www.freebase.com).

Queries are made through an HTTP api using JSON objects. I am writing  
a module to simplify this process and provide error handling.

I am proposing the Net::Metaweb namespace as the querying structure  
of a metaweb doesn't conform to the flow normally seen in a DBI  
driver, there is not preparation of queries in the normal sense and  
both queries and results are returned in tree structures, not table  
like. I aim to provide an interface to a networked system, not a  
database.

Freebase is currently in alpha, and invitations have to be requested  
(and can take some time to come through), but are available to  
anyone. While this module will only be of use to people with freebase  
accounts currently, once the site moves to beta anyone will be able  
to access the information there.

This said, any comments, queries suggestions welcome.
