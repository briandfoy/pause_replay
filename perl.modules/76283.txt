Subject: Module submission MySQL::Replication
Reply-To: modules@perl.org
To: modules@perl.org, alfie@cpan.org
Approved: news@nntp.perl.org
From: upload@pause.perl.org ("Perl Authors Upload Server")


The following module was proposed for inclusion in the Module List:

  modid:       MySQL::Replication
  DSLIP:       bdpOa
  description: Decentralised full-participation replication
  userid:      ALFIE (Alfie John)
  chapterid:   7 (Database_Interfaces)
  communities:
    Currently internal to Opera

  similar:
    none

  rationale:

    This namespace will hold the MySQL replication modules I am
    currently working on which allow:

    - full participation (e.g. many write masters) - decentralized (no
    single-write master, no central hub master, no ring) - caching

    We are currently testing internally. I'm still got a bit more work
    with the test scripts, but I should be able to release within the
    next couple of weeks.

  enteredby:   ALFIE (Alfie John)
  enteredon:   Tue May 31 11:09:00 2011 GMT

The resulting entry would be:

MySQL::
::Replication     bdpOa Decentralised full-participation replication ALFIE
