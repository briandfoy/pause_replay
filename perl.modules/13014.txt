Now http://introspector.sourceforge.net/

Since it's "Interface to the GCC Compiler" and the abstract says

"The Introspector's scope was originally just the GCC C compiler,
but will be expanded to include the extraction of  meta-data from
different compilers and interpreters.

The programs meta-data will be provided as a Perl/C#/(XML/RDF/DAML)/SQL
or plain old C/C++ interface.

We will build tools to allow this meta-data to be processed by
various GUI tools, Graph Layout Tools like VCG, Diagram Editors
like DIA, and Editors like EMACS."

then I'd suggest you think bigger and go for a Introspector::foo
name where 'foo' represents what this module currently does. And/or
split it into several modules. I'm sure they'll be more along the way...

Tim.
