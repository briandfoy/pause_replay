<P align=justify>Look, this woman slept with 6 guys simultaneously (probably 
more) and lied to all of them. One of her "boyfriends" found out when he found a 
half-empty tube of k-y jelly in her room! she admitted in the nerve interview 
that she's had an abortion and it's "no big deal".&nbsp; While walking and 
talking to us on her cell phone in Georgetown, Cutler spotted a piece of 
currency on the ground. "I just found a hundred-dollar bill!" she exclaimed. 
"It's my lucky day!" We'll say.</P>
