Hi,

I would like to register as a developer for Perl modules to be made
available on CPAN.

Ready for immediate deployment is function named 'println' - this one
has bugged me for ages.  Later I will have an RPC module and possibly a
module for Amtrak (UK) similar to those such as Business::FedEx.  1D and
2D barcode validation may also possible.

Regards

Andrew McGregor
