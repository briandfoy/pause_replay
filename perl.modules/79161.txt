Welcome!

The important thing is that you upload a unique archive name.  So if
you previously uploaded "Foo-0.1.tar.gz", you can then upload
"Foo-0.2.tar.gz" and it will get indexed.  It's a good practice to
keep your module and distribution version numbers the same. (c.f.
http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/308/packages-modules-and-distributions/)

It's up to you whether or not to remove the old distribution.  Many
people just leave old modules there in case someone wants to compare a
new module to an old one.  (E.g. search.cpan.org lets you see a diff
between distribution releases)  Other people remove their old
distribution files periodically to keep CPAN "cleaner" (and smaller)
c.f. http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=3D204997

I'll send you a email off-list and see if it bounces or if you get it.
 If you don't get a separate email from me within a day, let me know
and I'll follow up with the other admins who handle email.
