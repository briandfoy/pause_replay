I just noted that Devel::StackTrace has something it uses internally
called StackTraceFrame (as the trace is really a set of frame objects that

Devel::StackTraceFrame.  Does that seem acceptable?

I'll add a prominent section about try/catch and where to find it to
Exception::Class.  Hopefully that'll help.
