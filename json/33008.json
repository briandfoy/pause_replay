      "why" : "A configuration file reader module that uses a grammar from\n    Parse::RecDescent. The grammar is large enough to encompass almost\n    every type of config. It can even read multiple styles into the same\n    hash tree.\n\n    I was thinking of calling it Config::Magic (Config::Auto is taken).\n    It's done (though I'm the only one who has tested it), and I'll\n    upload it as soon as I'm approved unless I hear that I should wait.\n    I wrote it because I wasn't satisfied with the flexibility of any of\n    the config packages I could find in CPAN.\n\n    Example input: Section 1 { [Section 4] #Comment style #1 //Comment\n    style #2 ;Comment style #3 Monkey:1 Monkey=>2 Monkey:=3 <Section 2>\n    Foo = Bar Baz { Bip:1 Pants==5 } </Section> <Tasty Cheese=\"3\" />\n    <Section 5> Foo=Bippity,boppity,boo </Section> } Output (from\n    Data::Dumper - fit into space) $VAR1 = { 'Section 1' => { 'Tasty' =>\n    { 'Cheese' => '3' }, 'Section' => [ { 'Foo ' => 'Bar', 'Baz' => {\n    'Bip' => '1', 'Pants' => '5' }, '2' => {} }, { 'Foo' => [ 'Bippity',\n    'boppity', 'boo' ], '5' => {} } ], 'Section 4' => { 'Monkey' => [\n    '1', '2', '3' ] } } };",
