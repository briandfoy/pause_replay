The basic\n    idea is identical to Test::Exception.\n\n    There had been a little Discussion on perl.qa. The name Test::Warn\n    seems to be O.K., as Test::Warning is a serious concurrent. I\n    decided me to take the short version as it is similar clear what it\n    does and quite shorter.\n\n    The basic functionality is expressed in the function\n\n    warns_ok BLOCK TEST_NAME.\n\n    and an equivalent to check that the BLOCK didn't warn us.\n\n    Chromatic gave the hint to include some testing functionality for\n    the carp method. Adrian Howard had the idea to include a warns_like\n    method. There had not been a final convention how to call the\n    doesnt-warn-method. no_warns_ok - my first suggestion is a little\n    bit awkward, warns_nok - suggested by Chromatic isn't really better.\n    Another idea was no_warning but I didn't liked it very much as it is\n    too similar to the statement 'no warnings;' I also thought to a name\n    like doesnt_warn with or without a finishing _ok. But it doesn't\n    follow the other names and I prefer to have a suffix like ok, like,\n    is, like the well known functions from Test::More as I'd like to\n    indicate to the reader that it is a test routine. (and\n    doesnt_warn_ok seems to be very long).\n\n    However, as I couldn't find any real good name, I think I return to\n    the original idea no_warns_ok and keep open for any former\n    suggestions.\n\n    So the interface would look like:\n\n    warns_ok BLOCK TEST_NAME\n\n    warns_like BLOCK REGEXP TEST_NAME\n\n    no_warns_ok BLOCK TEST_NAME\n\n    and the same stuff for carp and cluck."
