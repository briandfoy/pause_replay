They both also provide wrong (IMHO)\n    levels of abstraction: IPChains too low, Fwctl too high.\n\n    My module would provide an interface to add new filter en masse,\n    referring to whole arrays of (for example) source IP addresses or\n    destination addresses, to compile the rules into the low-level\n    chains representation, and to output the result in the form of a\n    shell script. It would not hide concepts such as IP addresses and\n    ports under vague abstractions like \"services\"."
