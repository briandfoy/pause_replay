      "why" : "I'm currently writing a set of modules that facilitate the creation\n    of modular scripts and daemons by providing an singleton class that\n    registers modules and events and a base class for the modules. The\n    modules will provide autoload of the program modules and dependency\n    handling. Perhaps I will also write a module managing command line\n    arguments.\n\n    Another module provides some easy to use, basic functions to run a\n    script as a daemon (detach, status, kill) on POSIX-style systems.\n    However, I'm not shure whether this is something \"new enough\" - it's\n    less functional but simpler to use as the modules I found on\n    cpan.org. The same applies to a simple interface to GnuPG (a module\n    which provides a function to crypt, decrypt and to verify and modify\n    the passphrase, relies on GnuPG::interface). (The last two modules\n    can be reviewed on http://technik.juz-kirchheim.de/en, the package\n    names are still very suboptimal).\n\n    Baltasar",
