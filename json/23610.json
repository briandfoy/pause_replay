In my place of employment and\n    is being given back.\n\n    Term::Progressbar does a similar thing except it requires the\n    knowledge of the full field of data for percentage style estimates\n    of completition. This module is to only indicate that processing is\n    continuing to occur and the rate of occurance.\n\n    In many cases the amount of data we are processing makes\n    pre-scanning the data for size rather pointless and\n    Term::Progressbar is unsatisfactory. In some open-ended processes\n    that occur on data that is till being generated or received, it is\n    just not possible Thusly, Term::Activity."
