It will allow users to\n    cut up the DMOZ file into top or sub-level categories, drastically\n    reducing the difficulty of managing and using the data for their\n    personal websites.\n\n    I feel that the module should fall under the root category Parse as\n    the main purpose of the module is to parse the DMOZ content file,\n    and DmozRDF accurately and concisely describes what the module will\n    parse.\n\n    Thankyou for considering my module."
