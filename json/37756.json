      "rationale" : "Test::MockDBI is a module for testing DBI interfaces by mocking-up\n    the DBI with Test::MockObject::Extends. It is a testing module, so\n    it belongs in Test::. It uses Test::MockObject, but does not\n    subclass Test::MockObject (HAS-A Test::MockObject), so MockDBI is\n    probably the right choice for the second-level name, as it is a\n    testing module that mocks the DBI.\n\n    Test::MockDBI allows you to modify the DBI's behavior however you\n    choose by creating rules for the DBI's behavior, where the rules can\n    be sensitive to what SQL is being processed and what DBI testing\n    mode(s) you choose. This is an improvement over DBD::Mock or\n    DBI::trace(), as you can change the behavior as well as never having\n    to hit an actual database (unless you want to).\n\n    The advantage of using Test::MockObject::Extends for testing the\n    DBI with Test::MockDBI is that Test::MockDBI can be used to test\n    programs that use DBI without changing the base code of the program\n    -- the Test::MockDBI code can be added without the rest of the\n    program even having to know about Test::MockDBI (very handy for us\n    consultants).\n\n    Test::MockDBI is listed as alpha, because although the code I have\n    written so far is probably beta or release quality, I have not\n    mocked-up the whole DBI interface yet -- just the pieces I needed."
