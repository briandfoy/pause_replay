It is intended as a near-identical\n    replacement for C::A with some slight changes in terminology.\n    Concerns it addresses:\n\n    - Allowing easy access to service modules, such as CGI request\n    parsing, session management, database handles, templating libraries,\n    etc, without tightly coupling the application framework itself to a\n    'preferred' module set. This is achieved through plugins.\n\n    - Definition and management of a series of application phases that\n    the program will go through to achieve its task. The ability to add\n    tasks to these phases and specify whether they ought to occur at the\n    beginning, middle, or end of that phase."
