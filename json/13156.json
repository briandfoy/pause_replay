The module was also at one\n    time stored and documented at: http://internetalchemy.org/ocs/perl/,\n    but now it is gone as well. I am not aware of any existing ways to\n    parse OCS feeds with perl, although sites such as moreover.com,\n    syndic8.com and 10.am still provide (some free, I believe) OCS\n    feeds.\n\n    http://internetalchemy.org/ocs/ for more information on the OCS\n    standard."
