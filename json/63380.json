The included interfaces allow the admin to define\n    individual Catalyst controllers as either visible or invisible\n    resources which are grouped within applications (named after\n    Controller modules), enabling the system to generate personal\n    portals for all users, displaying only the links to which they have\n    access.\n\n    Access is controlled through a combination of \"application roles\",\n    \"application resources\", and \"user groups\". Application names become\n    navigation headers, and application resources are links (unless they\n    are marked \"not visible\"). The included methods for creating the\n    navigation sum all possible controllers for all of a given userâs\n    groups (which are mapped to the application roles, which are mapped\n    to the application resources.)\n\n    All data are managed within included Catalyst controllers (which\n    rely on included Perl6-style objects). A default \"Portal\"\n    application is pre-defined with standard portal features: login,\n    logout, password reset, manage profile, and home. An additional\n    \"Sample\" application is included with more examples, including\n    \"anonymous\" access and AJAX."
