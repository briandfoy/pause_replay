The specific impetus for development is to avoid using\n    suidperl in a web server based application, where end users are\n    submitting jobs via web forms, and we really don't want the jobs all\n    coming from the apache user, which would break the queuing system.\n    The jobs are to be submitted via the Queue::* modules (under\n    development, should be uploaded in short order) for distributed\n    resource management (the *other* DRM, this is the good one) such as\n    Open GridEngine, Platform LSF, and the DRMAA tools (eventually)."
