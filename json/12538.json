Once\n    defined, sentences may be tested against the languages to determine\n    if they are valid.\n\n    I also propose the GEB root namespace as a namespace for all\n    \"Godel, Escher, Bach\" related modules. I intend to implement as many\n    of the illustrative examples that I can as I progress through the\n    book, and others may wish to do the same, or even explore related\n    ideas in interesting ways.\n\n    For example, one of my colleagues has already started on a\n    typogenetics module, which would be named GEB::Typogenetics."
