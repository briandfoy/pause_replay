More spcificly the module was developed to use with a\n    Net::BGP based routeserver.\n\n    I thought of:the following prefixes:\n\n    Data:: (Like existing Data::ACL) Decision:: (Like existing\n    Decision::ACL) Net::BGP:: (Some modules will be specialized to the\n    Net::BGP module) Net:: (Its main use will be networking stuff)\n\n    The suffix or name of the module:\n\n    AccessList (Most features is about this) RouteMap (It's a RouteMap\n    as well) Policy (It's the focus and covers both AccessLists and\n    RouteMap) ACL (Access-Control-List, Used elsewhere, and shorter)\n\n    I seatled for the Net:: prefix since the focus is on matching\n    network and routing data - and not spcificly BGP.\n\n    I seatled for the ACL suffix since it's a uften used term and used\n    in other module names. The policy/route-map functions are just more\n    complex ACLs with side-effects."
