Why another one? two main\n    reasons: first, I thing the design of my module makes it very\n    flexible yet still easy to use (with others - select one...). Second\n    - it is i18n aware to the bare bones. Besides - TIMTOWTDI. And\n    unlike some, I've given a lot of time to documentiong properly.\n\n    2) Its parent class - a thin N-ary tree that does little but does\n    it well, and supplies the feature of unique numbers for each node\n    and for each tree.\n\n    3) A derivative of #2 - a module that reads and keeps updated a DB\n    table containing information of such a tree.",
