The Runge-Kutta\n    algorithms are the general-purpose workhorse in this field. This\n    module has been designed to be robust and easy to use, and should be\n    helpful in solving systems of differential equations which arise\n    within a Perl context, such as economic, financial, demographic or\n    ecological modelling, mechanical or process dynamics, etc. Three\n    main algorithms are offered. rk2 is Heun's 2nd-order Runge-Kutta\n    algorithm, which is relatively imprecise, rk4 is Merson's algorithm,\n    and rk4_auto uses the step-doubling method to adjust the step-size\n    of rk4 automatically to achieve a specified precision. I've put some\n    new work into the timestep selection stuff in rk4_auto, greatly\n    improving robustness and convergence."
