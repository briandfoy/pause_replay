The error functions are unique and\n    are added for convenience. The logging function is similar to\n    Log::ErrLogger but it has templating options which will come in\n    handy when I get around to expanding this to log into SQL databases,\n    etc; There is also a service naming component which makes it easy to\n    have this one class log errors for many different components of a\n    larger app while continuing to differentiate (transparently) where\n    the errors came from. A modified version of this has been battle\n    tested at Brown University."
