A CPAN search for Time::Format under that\n    author's name, or any other of the first-come modules registered\n    under that name, comes up blank. Also, an email I sent to\n    pgollucci@cpan.org is so far unanswered.\n\n    My Time::Format module implements an easy-to-use and (at least as\n    important!) easy-to-remember time/date formatting system. No awkward\n    % codes like strftime or Date::Manip's UnixDate. (I personally can\n    never remember %A vs %B or %d vs %e in strftime....)\n\n    The interface is a tied hash (although a function interface is also\n    provided). This makes it easy to interpolate dates and times\n    directly into strings (eg log message timestamps or database queries\n    or updates) where they are needed.\n\n    A tied-hash and function interface is also provided for strftime\n    and UnixDate, for convenience and for features that Time::Format\n    doesn't natively provide. I believe this is a very useful module\n    that could (and should) become widely used, perhaps even become a\n    standard module some day.\n\n    Thanks, Eric Roode"
