Many have been useful to myself and\n    to others in many ways.\n\n    I have written to Graham Barr (maintainer of List::Util) and\n    proposed that several of these be added to List::Util. He has\n    declined, partly for reasons in the List::Util documentation (some\n    of these functions are easy or even trivial to write), and some he\n    felt simply didn't belong in List::Util.\n\n    I have great respect for Graham Barr, and I respect his decision.\n    However, I feel that these utilities really are useful, and ought to\n    be made available to the Perl community in general. Some of the\n    functions are simple on the inside, but the fact remains that they\n    encapsulate useful functionality -- a wheel that does not need to be\n    reinvented, and the interface makes it easy to read and use.\n\n    For example, the any() function is three simple lines of code. But\n    that doesn't change the fact that\n\n    if (any {$_ == 5} @foo) # If any @foo is 5\n\n    is clearer to read than\n\n    my $test; $_ == 5 && ($test=1) foreach @foo; if ($test)\n\n    or even\n\n    if (grep {$_ == 5} @foo)\n\n    Therefore, I respectfully request the module name List::MoreUtil.\n    Thank you."
