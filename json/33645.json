      "why" : "I've been working on a tied hash class that allows the iterator for\n    'each' to be localized or redefined. The primary use is to allow\n    multiple concurrent 'each' requests on the same hash to return\n    key/value pairs as though each had its own separate iterator.\n    Currently it requires the use of scoping to isolate iterators, but\n    I'll be adding accessor methods and an iterator pool so that\n    multiple iterators can be selected.\n\n    I would also like to work on a more flexible parser module for the\n    NOAA weather site.\n\n    And of course, more to come...\n\n    I'm known on http://www.perlmonks.org as 'davido'",
