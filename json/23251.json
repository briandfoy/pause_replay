When a script is invoked by Clicking on a perl script file\n    icon or within the Start-Run dialog box, the script runs in a DOS\n    windows which closes as soon as the script terminates. The user does\n    not have sufficient time to view any output. The pause function\n    halts the script until the user presses a key.
