As I could imagine that it is perhaps interesting\n    for someone else, I'll also want to provide in CPAN.\n\n    The most advantages are the generalization possibilities for the\n    rules (number of players, size of boards, scoring, time penalties,\n    who's allowed to answer or select categories, ...) and the\n    possibility to create Mementos to store the current play standing\n    without breaking the hiding principle (it also provides the\n    possibility to take back an action).\n\n    The only real problem I see with this name is that Jeopardy could\n    be a trademark. As I don't have any commercial aspects, I'm brave\n    enough to reserve the namespace :-))"
