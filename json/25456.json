I don't know why they use it, but they do. (I think it\n    had something to do with mileage calculations being easier) To quote\n    a few definitions of what V+H is: V & H MILEAGE: A representation of\n    the vertical and horizontal mileage between two points based on a\n    geometrically computed approximation of the actual airline miles\n    between two points. Carriers (Telephone Companies) normally keep a\n    set of V & H coordinates in the local offices. V & H COORDINATES:\n    The Vertical and horizontal grid points used to determine\n    straight-line mileage between locations. And this information is\n    normally used for mileage-sensitive product pricing.\n    http://216.239.39.104/search?q=cache:O40BKdrQkTIJ:autodin.net/alp/Glossary/v_glossary.htm+V+and+H+telephone+coordinates&hl=en&ie=UTF-8\n    http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/coordsys/gif/vandh.gif\n    Explains how the system works graphically."
