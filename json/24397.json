In\n    fact, these modules are required. Markup::Tree is a unified way to\n    access Markup documents in a clean, easy and intuitive fashion.\n\n    The last of the modules, Content, is currently being written based\n    on the previous two modules. The intent of Markup::Content is to\n    extract HTML content from static pages or websites. A\n    proof-of-concept can be found at:\n    http://www.sf.net/projects/content-x\n\n    I wouldn't mind putting this under another namespace, except I\n    don't know what it would fit under :(. I couldn't find any other\n    modules that unify markup.\n\n    Any comments, questions, or otherwise can be sent to:\n    xlacklusterx@hotmail.com.\n\n    Thanks for your consideration :)"
