      "rationale" : "Term::Size works fine on UNIX/Linux systems to determine the\n    terminal height and width when one of the standard file descriptors\n    is actually connected to a terminal. But there are important cases,\n    such as when filtering VI's buffer through a shell command (as in\n    :1,$! sort), when those file descriptors are temporarily connected\n    to files, causing Term::Size's technique to fail. Another problem is\n    the UNIX specifity of the module's approach, which prevents it from\n    working on other systems.\n\n    This module applies a number of heuristics in an attempt to guess\n    the correct terminal dimensions in those currently unsupported\n    cases.\n\n    For example, if no standard I/O channel is connected to a terminal,\n    my module scans the process table to see if there's a parent process\n    that's an interactive editor (like VI),and if so, it then examines\n    the environment for variables (e.g., the POSIX shell's COLUMNS,\n    which can track window size changes) that can give a good idea of\n    the width.\n\n    This allows commands like the following to properly format text for\n    the correct screen width --\n\n    :1,$! fmt_comment\n\n    (That's my own script, based on Text::Autoformat, that reformats\n    Perl (or shell or AWK) comments for the appropriate screen width;\n    I'll be releasing that along with this module.)"
