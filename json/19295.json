We\n    had been able to use HTTP::Date to gain a RFC822 compliant date-time\n    and handle it as a email date-time. But now we should not. It seems\n    that there is no RFC2822 compliant date-time generator at CPAN. Then\n    I have decided to try to make it.\n\n    It is a very simple module. I think that it may be better to be\n    absorbed to another email utility module in the future. I will\n    appreciate cooperating with perl people.\n\n    Thanks! :)"
