It\n    simply checks each filename against the advices given in\n    perlport/\"Files and Filesystems\". The module name was chosen to\n    reflect its aim.\n\n    AFAIK, there no other module on the CPAN that checks the\n    portability of a module or a distribution. Test::File from brian d\n    foy and Test::Files from Philip Crow test other aspects (comparing\n    files, checking their size). Test::Portability::Files checks that\n    the names won't create problems, for example like the one caused by\n    the HEAD program from LWP on Mac OS X systems.\n\n    The module is placed in the Test::Portability sub-namespace, which\n    could/should be used to test other potential portability problems as\n    described in perlport.\n\n    Thanks in advance"
