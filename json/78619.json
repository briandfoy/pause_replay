I've got a problem\n    while using URI or Rose::URI.\n\n    When I process URL addresses automatically (e.g. through\n    webspider), they often can't deal with damaged fragments of a URL\n    and I cannot find a way to validate their correctness. Even if I add\n    the implementation of validation to URL and/or Rose::URI the problem\n    still won't be solved, as they parse the addresses differently â\n    they are URI-oriented and should be best redone from scratch, which\n    is pointless. These modules are great for URI addresses.\n\n    I've got a module with a number of tests ready and it works well\n    for URL addresses. That's why I suggest setting up a new namespace,\n    e.g. URLprocessor or URL.\n\n    Also, my aim is not to compete with other developers - I recommend\n    them in the documentation of my module anyway.\n\n    If anything is wrong with the namespace that I suggested, please\n    let me know, as I am new to CPAN. I would really appreciate your\n    help.\n\n    Best regards, Paul"
