      "rationale" : "Tk::MinMaxScale is a composite widget \"using\" two Scale, one for a\n    minimum value, the other for a maximum value, intended to get a\n    \"min-max\" range narrower than the \"from-to\" range of the two\n    Scale(s). The namespace was discussed on ptk@lists.Stanford.EDU this\n    month (october 2002): Tk::Scale::Interval was rejected because\n    !ISA(Scale). Tk::Interval was rejected because \"Interval\" sounds\n    like \"time\" and not \"range of values\". Tk::Range was rejected\n    because the widget do not define a \"range\" of values, but the bounds\n    of such a range. Tk::MinMaxScale was first suggested by Dominique\n    Dumont, and approved by \"Jack\" who added \"You know what you will be\n    getting, just from the package name. i.e. A scale which handles\n    minimums and maximums\". Fortunately, MinMaxScale was the name I\n    baptized first this module. Future : - do the same with two sliders\n    in the same groove, instead of using two Scale(s). - add\n    include/exclude properties, like [min, max], ]min, max], [min, max[,\n    ]min, max["
