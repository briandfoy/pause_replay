I believe it to be an easier way to do\n    XUnit-style testing, and it is contained in one standalone module in\n    contrast to Test::Unit's nearly 40 modules. It is also relatively\n    small in size, which could allow a module author to easily include\n    the module with her code instead of requiring the user to install it\n    just for testing.\n\n    It can run in conjunction with Test::Harness (via 'make test') or\n    stand-alone."
