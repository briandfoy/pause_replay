      "rationale" : "Hello,\n\n    This submission overrides that made in\n    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg14734.html as I'd\n    not realized that the XML::Simple namespace was already being used -\n    sorry.\n\n    To re(re)cap, this is a resubmission with a new name, based on\n    previous discussions\n    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg14811.html and\n    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg13839.html) of a\n    pure perl, object-oriented API that provides classes for XML\n    documents, elements and nodes and allows you to generate, parse and\n    manipulate XML documents.\n\n    XML::Mini is a \"stand-alone\" module in that it does not require\n    additional libraries or even a compiler to install and is, in my\n    opinion, flexible and easy to use. A project site was created\n    (http://minixml.psychogenic.com) where you can find detailed\n    information on the interface. Developer response has so far been\n    positive.\n\n    The module is\n\n    simple: The API is easy to learn and use. While providing a number\n    of classes in the package and offering XML generation and parsing\n    functionality, users only need to interact with 2 of those classes.\n\n    independent: The package is small and has no external dependencies\n    or requirements. You can therefore easily install it on any host,\n    for instance in the case of a web server to which you only have FTP\n    access - just upload it and begin using the module in your CGIs.\n\n    portable: All modules are written in pure Perl, ensuring maximum\n    portability.\n\n    I've run a quick script using the latest version of the module,\n    which simply reads in a (large) XML file (which you can find at\n    http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.xml - it is the XML\n    specification ) and parses it. I then request the document be\n    stringified. This is a good test of the parsing abilities as the XML\n    is completely decomposed then recreated. You can find the resulting\n    output attached to message\n    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg13887.html\n\n    Regards,\n\n    Pat Deegan, http://www.psychogenic.com"
