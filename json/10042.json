Shoephone communication can be a crossplatform\n    method for monitoring, management, or any distributed computing.\n    There will be a set of 5 perl modules, used for security, client &\n    server functionality, job dispatching, and log processing. Although\n    Shoephone uses the SOAP module, it differs because the SOAP\n    communication protocol is transparent, only used as a multiplatform\n    base communication. The name \"Shoephone\" is descriptive of it's\n    function. Like the shoe phone in the Get Smart television show, it\n    is a means for secure communication. We will make a Shoephone Bundle\n    upon completion."
