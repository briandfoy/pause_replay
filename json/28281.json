Within the Perl community, digest versions\n    of mailing lists are offered by such sponsors as Active State,\n    Sourceforge, Yahoo! Groups and London.pm. However, you do not have\n    to be interested in Perl to make use of Mail::Digest::Tools. Mail\n    from any of the thousands of Yahoo! Groups, for example, may be\n    processed with this module.\n\n    Given the module's objective, the rationale for choice of namespace\n    should be fairly evident. The secondary level namespace 'Digest' is\n    provided to allow for future development of other approaches to this\n    problem. However, should you believe that this module should be\n    farther down in the directory tree, I would be willing to consider\n    suggestions for a tertiary level namespace as well.\n\n    I have been developing and using the code for this module for over\n    three years and so it is really more mature than 'alpha'. I have\n    written over 20 pages of documentation, but a test suite remains to\n    be done."
