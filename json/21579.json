Grants are best effort. In others\n    words, if you show up every day and keep a dairy to prove that you\n    are not cross-charging and working on what you should be working on,\n    you will get paid.\n\n    Do not ask for a contact. For a contact, if you do not produce per\n    a written specification in accordance with 490A, you will not get\n    paid or only partially paid.\n\n    DOD does have great source of steady income: taxes and printing\n    press."
