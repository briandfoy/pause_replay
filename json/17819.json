He never\n    formally registered the name space, though.\n\n    Since JOCHEN doesn't have the time to maintain the module, and\n    since he no more have access to an SMSC, he has agreed to me taking\n    it over. (I'm currently co-maintainer of Net::EMI.pm)\n\n    I propose to name the new module Net::EMI::Client.pm to make it\n    possible to implement Net::EMI::Server or some such in the future.\n    (Client and server functionality will be very different and should\n    be separated. A common 'library' module will exist for shared\n    functionality.)"
