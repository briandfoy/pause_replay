The\n    current maintainer of POE::Component::IRC also didn't think it was\n    IRC-centric. Richard Soderberg suggested on IRC that it be called\n    Text::Conversation, and at least one responder on module-authors\n    agreed that it sounded good. That's why I'm requesting it go there.\n\n    While the efficacy of a modules list has been debated a lot\n    recently, I think this module should appear in it (provided it still\n    exists) because there's nothing else like it. The name also doesn't\n    evoke the module's threading nature, so having the description\n    somewhere prominent will help people find it.\n\n    Thanks!"
