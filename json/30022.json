As it imposes some way of doing things and has not\n    been tested along with modules from the \"Thread\" namespace, I think\n    it should be placed in its own namespace, so has to not pollute\n    \"Thread\".\n\n    If there is a better alternative, I'll be glad to update the module\n    and include it in an existing namespace.\n\n    Thanks."
