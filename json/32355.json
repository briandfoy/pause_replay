      "rationale" : "Crypt::YAPassGen allows you to generate pronounceable passwords\n    using a frequency file extracted from a dictionary of words. This\n    module was inspired by Crypt::PassGen written by Tim Jenness. I\n    started writing this module a couple of years ago, because I wasn't\n    able to make Crypt::PassGen work with an Italian frequency file. I\n    then lost it on my hard drive and when I found it a few days ago I\n    decided to write some tests and documentation to release it on CPAN.\n    This module also offers a different OO interface and a few more\n    options than Crypt::PassGen, that's why it exists. The namespace is\n    choosen because there are already various modules doing the same\n    tasks so this is Yet Another take on the same problem, TIMTOWTDI.\n    You may grab a copy from\n    http://giuliomotta.com/perl/Crypt-YAPassGen-0.01.tar.gz Cheers,\n    Giulio Motta"
