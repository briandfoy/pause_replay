As such, the\n    package comes with several parsers for biologically related\n    databases. Thus the Bio:: prefix.\n\n    'ConnectDots' refers to the proccess which the module achieves:\n    connecting identifiers across multiple databases. This software\n    allows databases to be joined on common identifiers, and then be\n    queried for translations where those databases align.\n\n    The approach used is unique in that it provides a small query\n    language to join databases and extract translations. The query\n    language is general, thus eliminating the need for custom parsing\n    for each outcome.\n\n    This type of software does not currently exist on CPAN thus I\n    believe it to be a worthy submission."
