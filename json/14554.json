It has an open architecture for the database file too.\n\n    CPAN has a similar module (Geo::IP), but it's not FREE, because it\n    doesn't come with the database and you need to buy it! It's very\n    slow (if you use the PurePerl version) or you need to use a DLL (not\n    open source)!!!!! The database file is very big (1MB) and has a\n    crazy architecture to the user don't see the content!!!! :-/\n\n    My module is more simple, but with the same resources, fast and the\n    users are free to do what they want with it!\n\n    I can't deal with the developer of Geo::IP to make it like\n    Geo::IPfree or to work with him, since my architecture make the\n    moudle 100% free and the developer of Geo::IP showed that he don't\n    want this.\n\n    ... Well, my module is done and I want to publish it ;-)\n\n    Graciliano M. P."
