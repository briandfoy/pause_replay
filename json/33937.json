This namespace would provide a home for\n    Project management utilities. In addition to the module I have just\n    uploaded, I have several other ideas for modules that would belong\n    under this namespace.\n\n    The module itself, Project::Gantt, is a simple, flexible way to\n    generate Gantt charts. It has the capability to apply skins to the\n    charts, so users can customize many aspects of the charts they\n    generate. The charts themselves can be drawn by hour, day or month.\n\n    If there are any questions about this project, or the proposed\n    namespace, I will be out of the country (without computer) for 11\n    days starting Thursday the 5th, so please accept my apologies for\n    delayed responses."
