Perhaps you also get requests for how to use the RSS feed\n    by people who have no idea how to parse XML, or write Perl programs\n    for that matter.\n\n    Enter XML::RSS::JavaScript, a simple subclass of XML::RSS which\n    writes your RSS feed as a sequence of JavaScript print statements.\n    This means you can then write the JavaScript to disk, and a users\n    HTML can simply include it like so:\n\n    <script language=\"JavaScript\" src=\"/myfeed.js\"></script>\n\n    What's more the javascript emits HTML that can be fully styled with\n    CSS."
