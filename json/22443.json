The module supports:\n\n    * Automated accessor method generation; Four types of accessor are\n    supported: string, boolean, counter and object; * Default values\n    assignment; * Implement of abstract methods; * Build-in data-type\n    generation (like `struct')\n\n    I learned a lot from Peter Seibel's `Class::MethodMaker', with a\n    slightly different interface, little improvement of perfomance, and\n    a self exported function `struct' behaves like `Class::Struct'.\n\n    This is a part of `WMO Framework', a web application Framework I've\n    used for several project, I would like to contribute other part of\n    this framework to CPAN later (after I got enough time to insert pod\n    into the source code).",
