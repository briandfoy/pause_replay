It's implementation is based on reverse engineering\n    conducted by the NMEdit project.\n\n    I believe this will be the first module to implement a third party\n    hardware synthetizer interface.\n\n    First releases will concentrate on Patch file format modifications,\n    programmatically modify the machine's patches by providing an Object\n    oriented interface to it. Subsequent releases will bring a MIDI\n    implementation to modify and alter patches \"live on the wire\". This\n    will prove very useful in sound research and modular synthesis\n    research as we will be able to apply mathematical algorithms to\n    patch structures.\n\n    The namespace name was chosen based on the actual machine name."
