      "why" : "Planning to contribute Unicode related modules for languages spoken\n    in India. These modules allow one to compose Unicode text strings in\n    the targetted languages using the standard QWERT keyboard employing\n    a phonotic transliterarion aproach. Transliteration is quite\n    appropriate and popular method for encoding Indian languages. The\n    modules being contributed provide for reversing the unicode strings\n    back to printable qwerty keyboard characters to the maximum extent\n    possible (most times 100%) Using these modules it will become easy\n    to compose and publish web pages in Indian languages. For examnple\n    HTML::Mason can employed to transliterate relevent portions of the\n    web page into Indian language fonts. I believe these modules can\n    make a good impact on Indian web publishing community because they\n    provide a way to quickly deliver content in multiple Indian\n    languages with the same phonotic source code text. Of course\n    different portions of a web page can display different fonts Indian\n    or otherwise without any problem.",
