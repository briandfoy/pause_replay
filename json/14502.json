Lingua::RU::Charset and Convert::Cyrillic (also\n    more generic Convert::Translit and\n    iconv-based-don't-remember-the-name) convert between Cyrillic\n    charsets, but they only do one-to-one translation (simple\n    tr/.../.../). Lingua::RU::Charset can convert to \"translit\" - it's\n    one-to-many lossy convertion (tr/.../.../ and few s/./.../g). As\n    cyrillic-translit conversion is lossy, translit-cyrillic conversion\n    is ambiguous, so this module uses Hidden Markov Model to choose a\n    most probable cyrillic original. Here's \"uniqueness of approach\" -\n    this is the only charset conversion module (though, russian\n    \"translit\" is not technically a charset), that is not a set of tr///\n    and s/// commands (and cannot be rewritten as such)."
