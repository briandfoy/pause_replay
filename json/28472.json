It allows users to turn off a set of\n    HTML *features* instead of individual HTML tags, abstracting away\n    the tiresome and error-prone task of deciding exactly which HTML\n    tags are acceptable. Furthermore, the module cleans cross-site\n    scripting vulnerabilities from CSS if requested and automatically\n    fixes many common HTML mistakes (such as missing end tags and\n    missing ALT tags on images). Detoxifier has been designed for XHTML,\n    unlike most HTML filtering programs, and it actually converts all\n    incarnations of HTML that HTML::Parser recognizes to XHTML 1.0.\n\n    HTML::Detoxifier has been successfully tested and deployed on\n    metajournal.net."
