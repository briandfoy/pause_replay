It\n    is a hardware control device, it does not really fit into\n    Device::Plasmatronics like that of a Serial Port and Parallel Port,\n    but then again maybe that is where it should be.\n\n    The Plasmatronics Regulator is a device which controls the flow of\n    power from charging devices (eg: Solar, Wind or Generators) into\n    Batteries. It monitors the state of charge of the battery and\n    current use etc.\n\n    It has a complex interface via a serial port which just allows you\n    to read and write locations in memory on the device.\n\n    Thus this module provides the proper abstraction to that device and\n    should work with all Plasmatronic regulators.\n\n    Scott"
