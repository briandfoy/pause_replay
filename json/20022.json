A\n    key's disposition is a measurement of its relative predominance and\n    freshness when tallied. This is a good way to infer favorites or\n    other leadership-oriented facts from a historical data stream.\n\n    At any time, keys can be culled by freshness or by their current\n    ranking, or both. With these approaches, dispositions can be weighed\n    over the whole historical record, rather than providing a simplistic\n    \"top events in the last N events\" rolling count.\n\n    This module will also be used by future integrated CPAN\n    module/bundle submissions."
