Right now, to\n    indicate temporary failure they use cryptic 'exit 75' statment. More\n    clear and verbose would be 'exit EX_TEMPFAIL'.\n\n    Selection of Sys:: prefix is quite strightforward, as exit codes\n    are part of system interface, and name of the module - 'Exits' -\n    both reflects fact, that it about exit codes, and also, it refers to\n    it's origin - sysexits.[hc] files.\n\n    An alternative to this would be Sendmail::SysExits, as interaction\n    with sendmail is the most frequent usage of this interface."
