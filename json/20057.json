The Math::ES module provides another\n    tool for non-linear (\"genetic\") optimization procedures, as e.g. in\n    parameterization.\n\n    Almost everybody knows GAs, genetic algorithms, but Evolution\n    Strategies (ES) are rather unknown, although they have been\n    developped simulataneously. So this modules follows two intentions:\n    provide users with another optimizer tool and make the idea of ES\n    more public.\n\n    The module is in oo-style; it allows multiple populations with\n    migration and mixing, elitism, cross over, mutation, two selection\n    schemes and self adapting step widths.\n\n    So much for the uniqueness ..."
