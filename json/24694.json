I wrote a\n    simple module to read BDF (bitmap distribution format) font files.\n\n    The module is very simple, nothing noteworthy, written because I\n    could not find anything already in existence to do it. It provides a\n    base for anyone who wants to do anything with these files, however.\n\n    This module only reads BDF files, no writing, nor\n    manipulation/conversion of font data.\n\n    Thanks!"
