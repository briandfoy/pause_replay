As there are many such devices on the\n    market, I think that having an MP3::Player branch ought to encompass\n    all sorts of interfaces to any of these devices. My motivation was\n    to generate a list of mp3s and have that list downloaded to my\n    PocketConcert everytime I got tired of the current list. Perl is the\n    perfect tool for this. I chose MP3::Player::PktConcert because I\n    don't want to imply that I work for Intel, or have any association\n    with Intel other than the fact that I buy their products.\n    PocketConcert is trademarked, and I'm just another perl hacker. Plus\n    it's less characters to type. Unfortunately it's also hard to find\n    with search engines; hopefully the meta-data will suffice. Thanks,\n    and power to the camel!"
