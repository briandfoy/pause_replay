Especially in\n    \"Old Europe\" there are several countries with a \"Postbank\" so it\n    would be better to name the modules Finance::Bank::<ISO\n    COUNTRY>::<INSTITUTE>.\n\n    I would like to do that for my upcoming module that supports German\n    SpardaBank because there is at least in Austria a same called bank\n    without any technical relationship with the German one.\n\n    It would be nice to have a naming standard for that Bank modules.\n\n    regards, Roland"
