Most of them are found in 'artpacks'. See\n    http://www.acheron.org/articles/index.cfm?fuseaction=dsp_article&article=20000519180111H\n    for information on 'artpacks' and 'the art scene.' However, there\n    are no perl modules to read this data.\n\n    I also plan to release a File::Find::Rule module to allow easy\n    searches, based on this metadata, through large sets of files."
