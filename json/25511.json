However I do believe that the\n    goals of HTML::SimpleTemplate are sufficiently different to merit\n    having a seperate existence.\n\n    In summary, HTML::SimpleTemplate is limited in functionality\n    compared to HTML::Template but addresses the needs of some\n    developers in a more convenient manner."
