      "rationale" : "This module converts personal data to/from codice fiscale. Codice\n    fiscale is in Italy something like a social security number in US,\n    but it has lots of differences. First of all codice fiscale should\n    be used only for financial matters. Second, you can calculate a\n    codice fiscale for a person given his surname, name, date of birth,\n    sex and a special code for the town where he was born. There are\n    exceptions (about 1 in 15000) where two people have really similar\n    personal data which would result in identical codice fiscale. An\n    example of codice fiscale is WLLLRY87T18Z404B (for Larry Wall, born\n    on 1987-12-18 (Perl's birthday) in USA). BTW, calculating a codice\n    fiscale is a really recurring task for italian programmers (or\n    anybody who has to deal with italians) and tons of scripts exist\n    already on the net. This module will try to organize the production\n    and reverse engineering of a codice fiscale in a clear and rational\n    way. The namespace String::CodiceFiscale is chosen because codice\n    fiscale is a string of 16 characters."
