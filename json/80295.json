It consists from\n    database interfaces, web-forms (rendering, validation), etc. All of\n    them uses base class Pony::Object and some more of Pony::* (locally\n    I used Pony namespace). I can't imagine how to separate them or\n    which base namespace I should use (Yes, I seen\n    01modules.index.html). I plan to develope this set of modules, until\n    it will not looks like high-level web-framework.\n\n    I don't think, that renaming modules (in future) is good idea\n    (perhaps I'm wrong).\n\n    Current module set you can see here:\n    https://github.com/h15/pony/tree/master/lib/Pony . Base module is\n    here: https://github.com/h15/pony-object/tree/master/lib/Pony .\n\n    Thank you!"
