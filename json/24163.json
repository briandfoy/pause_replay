For example,\n    it could be used to create a graphic of your Mon-Friday 9-5\n    schedule, with your meetings and appointments listed and color\n    coded. The days and hours shown can be customized, and events for\n    specific days and times can be labelled, and colored.\n\n    It requires Image::Magick.\n\n    The namespace Image::Schedule follows the apparent reasoning of\n    other modules within Image. \"Schedule\" describes the type of image\n    that can be created (similar to how \"Image::Thumbnail\" and\n    \"Image::Worldmap\" are descriptive of the types of images they\n    create)."
