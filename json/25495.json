      "why" : "HTML::SimpleTemplate, a module similar in functionality to\n    HTML::Template but with significantly different design goals.\n\n    While HTML::Template is very effective at displaying whole pages,\n    it is somewhat heavyweight and consequently not optimal for\n    displaying pages which must be formed from repeated calls to many\n    seperate templates.\n\n    This is particularly the case when writing content management\n    systems - it is very difficult to express the conditional display\n    logic of these systems with HTML::Template, and conversely, very\n    easy to express it in Perl itself.\n\n    HTML::SimpleTemplate is specifically targetted at occasions where\n    many (perhaps dozens) of seperate template calls will be used to\n    construct one page; it is not necessary to create a new object for\n    each template and the syntax is deliberately convenient both on the\n    Perl side and in HTML.\n\n    I enjoy HTML::Template and appreciate the work that has gone into\n    it; I do use it and will do so again. However I do believe that the\n    goals of HTML::SimpleTemplate are sufficiently different to merit\n    having a seperate existence.\n\n    NOTE: I am not entirely happy with placing this module in the\n    HTML:: namespace as it is completly agnostic as to the type of\n    content it displays - for instance, plain text, CSV or XML (or even\n    executable/perl!) would all be possible.",
