      "why" : "=head1 What is WebRobot\n\n    WebRobot is a data driven http client heavily based on L<LWP|LWP>.\n    It can be used\n\n    =over\n\n    =item\n\n    for automating http requests\n\n    =item\n\n    for a kind of web based unit tests\n\n    =item\n\n    for (limited) stress tests of web servers\n\n    =item\n\n    for analyzing http communication\n\n    =back\n\n    =head1 How to use it\n\n    =over\n\n    =item\n\n    You define your requests in an XML file, possibly with additional\n    information like a description or an assertion. This is called to be\n    a test plan.\n\n    =item\n\n    You configure WebRobot (proxies, authentification, ...) with a\n    simple properties file.\n\n    =item\n\n    You run L<webrobot.pl> with your test plan and configuration file.\n\n    =item\n\n    You inspect the output in text or html form depending on the output\n    filters in use.\n\n    =back\n\n    =head1 Some features\n\n    =over\n\n    =item\n\n    The test plan format is XML. The plan to be processed includes a\n    list of http/https request. POST requests will be feeded with data.\n\n    =item\n\n    Display of http request/response header.\n\n    =item\n\n    Assertions for http responses: Some predicates and boolean\n    operators (extendable).\n\n    =item\n\n    Multiple requests out of a single one, eg. additionally request the\n    images and frames (extendable).\n\n    =item\n\n    Linkchecker included (a special module for <i>multiple\n    request</i>). Predicates and boolean operators for the links to be\n    used.\n\n    =item\n\n    Output listeners (extendable): HTML, Text, Test::Harness\n\n    =item\n\n    Property file for the client configuration (proxy, basic\n    authentification, timeout, ...)\n\n    =item\n\n    Cookie behaviour control (on, off, clear)\n\n    =item\n\n    Including test plans: A plan can include any other plans.\n\n    =item\n\n    Plans are parameter enabled (names). The names are set by the\n    calling plan or the config file.\n\n    =item\n\n    Single client instance emulating multiple users (deterministic\n    access).\n\n    =item\n\n    Multiple client instances for load test (unix like operating\n    systems only).\n\n    =item\n\n    Sending mail when the execution of the plan is terminated.\n\n    =back\n\n    =head1 BUGS\n\n    Most bug descriptions are annotated at the desired place. However,\n    there should really be more tests.\n\n    =head1 SEE ALSO\n\n    L<pod/Config.pod>\n\n    L<pod/OutputListeners.pod>\n\n    L<pod/Recur.pod>\n\n    L<pod/Testplan.pod>\n\n    =cut",
