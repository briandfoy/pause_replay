      "rationale" : "Data::Stream is a total rewrite of Data::BFDump. The name change is\n    due to a completely new interface, and the addition of functionality\n    which streams the output to a filehandle instead of constructing it\n    in memory and then returning the total dump, (and user complaints\n    that BFDump is annoying to type :-). This means that the memory\n    overhead of dumping using Data::Stream is signifigantly lower than\n    any of the other perl serializers.\n\n    Data::Stream does a breadth first traversal of the object being\n    dumped, but this pass is for analysis only. A second depth first\n    pass is required to actually output the structure. This two pass\n    approach means that Data::Stream can correctly handle a number of\n    edge cases that none of the other existing serialization modules\n    currently can. Extra effort was put into ensuring that structures\n    with readonly and aliased elements are dumped correctly.\n\n    Other module names I considered were Data::Streamer\n    Data::Dumper::Streamer and Data::Serialize and also preserving the\n    BFDump name. After discussions with various people from Perlmonks\n    the consensus was that Data::Stream was the preferred choice.\n\n    regards yves"
