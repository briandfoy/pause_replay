By\n    using Inline::Java, I have solved the key problem Ant was meant to\n    solve: launching too many Java Virtual Machines for compiling. Using\n    Java::Build::JVM you have exactly one JVM for compiling.\n\n    I had previously requested a different name for this module, but\n    never received confirmation. I like this name better."
