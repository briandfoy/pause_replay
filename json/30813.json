      "rationale" : "This module is an interface to the Adaptive Technology LED signs\n    and messageboards including the BetaBrite sign which is commonly\n    available and in widespread use.\n\n    It implements Adaptive's sign protocol fully, and it can\n    communicate with single signs over RS-232 or sign networks connected\n    via RS-485. Win32 is supported as well as Unix/Linux TTY serial\n    ports.\n\n    The module includes a number of other convenience features for\n    programming signs including a simple markup language suited to the\n    signs' capabilities, bitmap constructors, and other interesting and\n    useless features such as 90-degree rotated text.\n\n    The module is finished, mature, and well tested for several years;\n    however, it has not ever been prepared for upload to CPAN. Althoug\n    the ProLite module for other brand signs is in the root namespace, I\n    chose the Device:: namespace because it seemed more appropriate than\n    cluttering root. Mabye ProLite should move at some point?\n\n    Thanks for your consideration."
