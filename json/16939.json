      "rationale" : "MMDS is a powerful text transformation system. Using plain text as\n    input, it can be used to produce professionally typeset documents in\n    PostScript and PDF using the LaTeX typesetting system. With the same\n    input, it can also produce HTML for web pages, presentation slides,\n    and more. MMDS differs from other tools in that it tries to infer\n    the desired markup from the document, instead of requiring the user\n    to insert all kinds of cryptic instructions.\n\n    MMDS is a major revision of the Squirrel Document System, a.k.a.\n    mh_doc, that I wrote in 1993-1995. It has been in production since\n    then, but was never released to the public.\n\n    MMDS has been reworked to the Perl5 modules model, and is mostly\n    plugin based. Additional input formats (e.g., POD, XML) can be added\n    seamlessly, and output formats (e.g., XML, OOo) as well. It is\n    envisioned that several modules will be added to the MMDS::\n    hierarchy in the near future.\n\n    For (some) more information:\n    http://www.squirrel.nl/mmds/intro/index.html."
