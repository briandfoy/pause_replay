So I implemented it on my\n    own.\n\n    This implementation does not use the \"reference\" library and thus\n    has slightly different features, but should be compatible. (The\n    reference library has no license and such cannot be used by others\n    currently).\n\n    As for the name: there are two choices: Digest:: and Crypt:: for\n    the namespace, and Crypt::Hashcash works fine, but I think one might\n    expect Hashcashes to be under the Digests namespace, as the hashcash\n    tokens are quite similar to digests. So, while Crspt::Hashcash\n    works, Digest::Hashcash works better (for me)."
