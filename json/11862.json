Is intended to simplify image generation\n    based on text data.\n\n    Imager::font::freetype2 is biased towards generation of images for\n    web publication. FONT::FT2 is intended to be used by typesetting\n    applications and drawing applications like Gimp::Perl and Sodipodi.\n    Also, FONT::FT2 is planned to support Postscript output (it already\n    supports text and xpm output) for generation of printed pages for\n    labels, banners, notices, and silk screening. Included in the\n    examples are scripts for generating Gnome Mahjongg tilesets.\n\n    FONT::FT2 was written and functional before I knew of\n    Imager::font::freetype2."
