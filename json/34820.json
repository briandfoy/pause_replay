The most obvious work is to translate the files to\n    other languages, such as Perl or PIR.\n\n    The module belongs in Language::, because it is an interface to a\n    language (Z-code), rather than a way to play games.\n\n    Games::Rezrov is a Perl module that creates an instance of the\n    Z-machine and runs Z-code files, aka an interpreter. Language::Zcode\n    (which stole lots of code from Games::Rezrov for the parsing and\n    Perl Z-machine implementation) is for manipulating Z-code, not\n    specifically for playing the games."
