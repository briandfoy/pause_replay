Moreover, it seems unlikely that a three letters\n    capitalized acronym like this one could clash with future root names\n    as there are 26^3 = 17576 other 3 letters combinations. At last, GFL\n    is actively developped since 2 years and is likely to gain a large\n    fame as a \"swiss-knife\" for image importation."
