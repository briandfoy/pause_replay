      "rationale" : "Authen::Captcha provides an object oriented interface to captcha\n    file creations. A Captcha is a program that can generate and grade\n    tests that: - most humans can pass. - current computer programs\n    can't pass Basically, it attempts to authenticate a human element to\n    a transaction.\n\n    There are several captcha implementations in perl floating around\n    the net, but I haven't found any on CPAN. Further, those I found\n    were not structured into easy to use modules, but rather require'd\n    into scripts, and were often tailored to specific applications (ex.\n    web forms).\n\n    Authen::Captcha includes code from one GPL'd implementation\n    (HumanTest 1.0) in an OO perl module which can be used with a\n    variety of applications.\n\n    The most common form of captcha is an image file containing\n    distorted text, which humans are adept at reading, and computers\n    (generally) do a poor job. This module currently implements that\n    method. We plan to add other methods, such as distorted sound files,\n    and plain text riddles."
