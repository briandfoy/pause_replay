There are other\n    tree modules too, outside of the Tree::* namespace, but they are\n    usually specifc to their particular usage. I actually go into more\n    detail in the module documentation as to how this compares to other\n    tree implementations (only in version 0.14 which I just uploaded, it\n    should be there before too long)."
