(Data::UUID also exists, but not in the module list.)\n    I think collecting ID generators together into a single part of the\n    namespace is worthwhile. I suggest Data::ID:: for this purpose;\n    String::ID:: is another possibility.\n\n    Aside from Exim message IDs being quite a neat type of unique ID\n    (they're rather concise), making the generator of general use,\n    programs that interact particularly closely with Exim may need this.\n    My need for Exim message ID generation is in a mail handling system\n    that uses Exim a lot, and uses Exim message IDs for indexing, but\n    also generates some messages that are not touched by Exim. It's also\n    not unreasonable to stick messages directly into Exim's spool\n    without telling Exim; for this one needs to generate a message ID.\n    With so many potential uses, I believe that an Exim message ID\n    generator should be included in the module list."
