This module will be different from\n    others as this will be distributing only to paid servers, hence\n    there is reliability . Also this will perform the additional task of\n    getting the delivery report also. NOTE:This combined functions is\n    not given in even by the paid Service providers in their API's\n    distributes. As this will be easy to use as compared to that given\n    by paid SMS providers themselves hence i expect a great use of this.\n\n    NOTE: IF possible please give me a root namespace called 'API' as i\n    also intend to add other APIs to the script as well. eg. API::SMS\n    for SMS and API::etc for other API of other purposes which i\n    develop."
