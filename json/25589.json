Once completed, it will\n    feature a set of classes and functions that implement a web spider,\n    content filters and consumers.\n\n    It is based on primarily RDF::Redland (not subclassed), which is\n    being used as a parser and persistent storage of triples. The\n    suggested package namespace is RDF::Scutter, with additional\n    packages RDF::Scutter::Filter and RDF::Scutter::Consumer.",
