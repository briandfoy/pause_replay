This makes it easy to write CGI or commandline\n    scripts that connect to a database with the appropriate permissions,\n    without having to request this information from the user or hardcode\n    the information into scripts or modules. Since it resides in\n    separate text files, the login information is protected by OS-level\n    permissions, and is easily managed by users themselves, with the\n    assistance of some included scripts. It also has several additional\n    benefits, which I would be happy to expand on, if you like.",
