And they probably did the\n    leaderboard by hand.\n\n    This module aim to provide an easy way to prepare Perl golf\n    contest, by writing a little configuration file and writing the test\n    programs as .t files.\n\n    The included scripts will do all the work of testing a player's\n    individual entries, and doing all the hard scoring and testing stuff\n    for the judge. Methods to compute statistics, leaderboards are also\n    provided.\n\n    A GUI is also planned."
