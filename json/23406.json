First, it allows for inaccurate specification\n    of bitmasks (i.e. allowing the use of constants authorized for a\n    given situation in other situations where the constant does not\n    accurately describe the bitmask in question), causing potential\n    problems in code maintenance. Second, it provides no easy way to\n    break a bitmask back into its constituent constants. Third, it\n    relies upon the user to do all of the bitmask manipulation. Many\n    module users do not have a solid understanding of the bitwise\n    operations necessary to do the manipulation properly, which can lead\n    to bugs in code.\n\n    This module attempts to address all of those concerns."
