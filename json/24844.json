For\n    'Interval2Prefix', I have not been able to come up with anything\n    that more clearly explains the function. The usage of '2' instead of\n    'To' is a question of taste, but I'm perfectly willing to change\n    this, should it come to that.\n\n    My own combing of CPAN, plus the discussion on module-authors@\n    suggests that no implementations of this algorithm is present on\n    CPAN yet.\n\n    It is my implession that this algorithm is *not* trivial, and\n    difficult to get right, so it might come in handy for others in the\n    same situation."
