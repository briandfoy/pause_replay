CGI::ModManager - A module\n    designed to modularize large application developement, mainly so\n    that large, community developed, programs can be edited and\n    contributed to easily. DATE::LocalDate - An alternative to the Data\n    module, which simply returns additional (to localtime()), pertinant,\n    information concerning the date. DB::FlatFile - An easy to use\n    interface for manipulating text files like a database - also\n    includes the ability to have distributed databases. RIT::SIS and\n    RIT::SIS::Account - Modules used to interface with the student\n    information system at the Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\n    As you can see, I have at least something to contribute initially -\n    not to mention the additional projects that I will work on as an\n    active member of the Perl community.",
