His\n    last update of it was in 1999, and since then, UPS has pretty\n    drastically changed their system, such that it doesn't work anymore.\n\n    After requesting msolomon's permission to just upload a new version\n    of Business::UPS to use the namespace the current one is in, I\n    didn't receive a response, so I chose a new namespace for it, which\n    I think is a good one.\n\n    It has the same functionality and syntax of Business::UPS, and it\n    is essentially, a newer version of it, just in a different\n    namespace."
