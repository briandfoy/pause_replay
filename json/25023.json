I'm planning to contribute an application\n    building framework (consisting of several modules).\n\n    It delivers the following services to its users on a mostly opaque\n    way: - A plugin based configuration file service + Comand line\n    option handler + built-in Java-like property file parser + built-in\n    Windows-like ini file parser + Loader for String, URL and File\n    access - A plugin based bridge to logging facilities (e.g. Log4Perl)\n    - Daemonizing - Usage and help - ...\n\n    Lazy Application::Framework users only have to derive from\n    Application::Frame and to implement a run method. More committed\n    users can use one or more of the above-mentioned services or they\n    are invited to implement their own PlugIns ...\n\n    TODOs - Documentation ;-) - MakeMaker tuning / Bundling - Testing\n\n    My schedule is to complete version 0.1 after Christmas.\n\n    hfu,\n\n    Sebastian",
