RULI provides an easy-to-use interface for querying DNS\n    SRV resource records. The goal is to promote the wide deployment of\n    SRV-cognizant software. RULI aims to fully support SRV-related\n    standards.\n\n    Further info:\n\n    RULI - Resolver User Layer Interface http://www.nongnu.org/ruli/",
