The module supports\n    inheritance of state information and methods so classes of wizards\n    may be created. This module doesn't itself drive the application.\n    The application uses it as a consultant to figure out what to do\n    next.\n\n    This module is used by but does not require the Gestiannna web\n    application framework, thus its name. Feel free to suggest a\n    different, perhaps more-descriptive name.\n\n    The StateMachine namespace is needed because there is no good fit\n    elsewhere, and the module does implement the core of a statemachine\n    (though it is driven by the app instead of it driving the app, at\n    some level)."
