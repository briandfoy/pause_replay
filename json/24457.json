Not much knowledge is needed for making simple graphics,\n    as all (of the 60) various properties have useful default values.\n\n    Xyplot heavily depends on (and requires) the package EPS. An Xyplot\n    object is a child of an EPS object and inherits all its properties.\n    Beyond, any Postscript command can be given as a method name (which\n    is translated into Postscript via AUTOLOAD). Thus, any Graphics or\n    Texts can be added to a diagram (like legends, explanations etc.)"
