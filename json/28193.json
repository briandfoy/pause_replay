In particular, the API could\n    be better, and the docs are not yet strong. :-) However, I'd like to\n    put it in CPAN before I forget entirely how to do that (!).\n\n    To that end, I ask you:\n\n    *** is it appropriate to put this functionality in\n    Data::Mining::AssociationRules ?\n\n    I looked in some other spots (e.g., Algorithms) and nothing felt\n    quite right. Moreover, I can imagine Data::Mining::TemporalSequences\n    or other things, so maybe there's room for growth there."
