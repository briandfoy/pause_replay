While Statistics::useR is based\n    on embeding R using C code, it does have more interactions between R\n    and Perl. But it is function oriented instead of object oriented.\n    And hence, you can't pass the R object to a class (or module,\n    perhaps). As a result, you end up with many R interpreters as you\n    used it in your own packages. This package is based on\n    Statistics::useR, but provide an OO interface. As a side effect, it\n    can use the technique of AUTOLOAD to automatically import R\n    functions to Perl without the worry of namespace collision. And it's\n    more extendable then Statistics::useR."
