In India the calender traditional is luni-solar and\n    various flovors of tcalenders exist. Mostly they are classified as\n    Amanta and Purnimanta depending on whether the calendrical month of\n    the religious calender starts with the dark half or the bright half\n    of the Moon's month long journey aroud the zodiac. Calculation of\n    festival and other important days differ depending on the region,\n    religious groups and variations on the disputed 'ayanamsa' value and\n    a hoard of other things including the Era. This module serves as a\n    base class and individual calendrical modules can be added in due\n    course of time. The official Indian calendar is not so complicated\n    but by nature, it is not the religious calender and is not\n    extensively employed for civil purposes. Even to errect the official\n    Indian calender, services from the base class is still very much\n    needed."
