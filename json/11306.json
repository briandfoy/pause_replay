It is unique\n    in lighter weight in that the output is much denser and more terse\n    that of Data::JavaScript, at the expense of being less robust.\n\n    DESCRIPTION This module was inspired by the Data::JavaScript\n    manpage, which while incredibly versatile, seems rather brute force\n    and inelegant for certain forms of data. Specifically a series of\n    objects of the same class, which it seems is a likely use for this\n    kind of feature. So this module was created to provide a lightweight\n    means of producing configurable, clean and compact output."
