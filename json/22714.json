The purpose of the module is to send/construct emails with HTML\n    2. I subclass HTML::Parser\n\n    I wrote this module from scratch due to MIME::Lite::HTML\n    limitations namely:\n\n    1. only supports gif and jpeg (this module should support all\n    mimetypes that perl knows of) 2. Actually parses the HTML in order\n    to replace the url only where it is supposed to and not in text\n    nodes. 3. It's relatively small and lightweight 4. Because I believe\n    MIME::Lite::HTML's approach in inherently flawed (point 2 can't be\n    solved without an almost complete rewrite)\n\n    I plan on implementing some kind of persistence in order to make\n    the process os generating custom messages more lightweight.\n\n    It's still beta"
