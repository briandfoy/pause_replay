I looked through\n    the Crypt, Data, Convert namespaces and the closest fit was Convert.\n    Althoguh I am not too hapyp with that.\n\n    So I'd be happy to hear about better names.\n\n    What does this module do:\n\n    Take some data, split it into n parts, and create m new ones and\n    put all of these into a set. Then, any n parts of this set taken\n    togetehr can be used to restore the original data blocks as well as\n    the additional ones.\n\n    Freenet for example uses this to upload larger files by e.g.\n    partiitoning a file into e.g. 100 blocks and uploadign 100 data\n    blocks + 50 fec blocks. If a user wnats to download the file she\n    tries to get any 100 of these 150 blocks, which are enough to a)\n    decode the original file and b) \"heal\" freenet by re-uploading the\n    parts that couldn't be found.\n\n    I hope somebody has _the_ perfect existing (or future) namespace\n    that I can use other than Convert. Or tell me that Convetr, indeed,\n    is the right thing for a libarry that encodes/decodes these\n    additional error correction blocks.\n\n    Thanks (please CC:, as I am not on the list)."
