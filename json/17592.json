LoadLeveler is a batch job scheduling application for clusters\n    of servers.\n\n    I believe it should have its own namespace because it interfaces to\n    a large highly specialised commercial software system and as such\n    fits in well with the top level namespaces granted to other\n    commercial interface programs.\n\n    At the moment access is only to the Data Access API but further\n    nested modules are planned to provide access to the Query, Submit,\n    Workload Management, Error and Checkpoint APIs."
