      "rationale" : "The module \"SessionID.pm\" or \"Authen::SessionID\" is a nice module\n    for all programmers who want to develope user areas where the user\n    has to login and then has the chance to do anything specific. there\n    are many solutions available for the problem of authenticating a\n    user. Many services use cookies or http-authentication which both\n    are features of specific browsers respectively the options the user\n    set in his browser. The SessionID module takes another, not\n    browser-related way: by logging in the user gets a unique sessionid\n    which does not contain his username neither his password. the\n    sessionid module creates an entry in a small database which contains\n    the username, the sessionid, the current time and the minutes after\n    which the user has to be logged out if his is inactive. every script\n    that is within the logged-in-area can extract the username off the\n    sessionid by using a function of the SessionID module. The database\n    entry is deleted if the user logs out."
