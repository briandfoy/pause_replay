Aside from providing\n    customisation functions, NCustom provides a configuration file that\n    contains preset configuration data for several possible SOHO\n    set-ups. The possible set-ups are indexed by \"N\". \"N\" being the\n    number of separate servers the SOHO is able to dedicate to network\n    infrastructure.\n\n    Then if customisation scripts use \"N\", they help people with only\n    one firewall/gateway/webserver/dnsserver host, as well as those with\n    more machines.\n\n    The inspiration for preset configurations came from IPCOP and K12.\n\n    *end*"
