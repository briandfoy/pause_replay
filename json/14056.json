      "rationale" : "The modules in the Net::FreeDB2* name space provide a clean OO\n    interface to FreeDB/CDDB. It's structure is inspired by the\n    Net::LDAP modules (Graham Barr).\n\n    I know of the following name spaces to be related to FreeDB/CDDB: -\n    CDDB - Net::CDDB - FreeDB - Net::FreeDB - Audio::CD - CDDB::File -\n    WebService::FreeDB - Net::CDDBScan\n\n    However, IMHO, my approach is rather clean and yields to less code\n    for FreeDB/CDDB database access. Also, in Perl there's more than one\n    way to do it.\n\n    FYI I include the Net::FreeDB2* name space history: 1) The\n    Net::FreeDB2* modules were first developed as CDDB*. When\n    development was finished, I realized CDDB was already in use (Rocco\n    Caputo). 2) FreeDB was the next alternative as FreeDB is not\n    registered at PAUSE. Indeed, I did rename CDDB to FreeDB (renaming\n    is resource intensive). Then I found that there is already a FreeDB\n    module out there (B. W. Fitzpatrick, J.I. van Hemert and Richard\n    Martin). 3) Net::FreeDB was again the next alternative. I did not\n    check it out at PAUSE but did do the renaming after which I\n    discovered Net::FreeDB was already in use (David Shultz). 4) Then I\n    did some research and found the following related modules/name\n    spaces in use: CDDB, Net::CDDB, FreeDB, Net::FreeDB, Audio::CD ,\n    CDDB::File, WebService::FreeDB and Net::CDDBScan. 5) I checked them\n    all out leaving the withdraw option open. 6) My conclusion is that\n    Net::FreeDB2* is complementary to the already available modules. 7)\n    Next time I'll check out PAUSE first."
