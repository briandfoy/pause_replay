It doesn't\n    support general sorting functions though.\n\n    For these reasons it's also substantially faster (about 3 times)\n\n    Here's a simple example if the elements are just the keys:\n\n    use Heap::Number;\n\n    my $heap = Heap::Number->new; $heap->insert($_) for @array; print\n    $heap->extract_min, \"\\n\" for 1..$heap->count;\n\n    Here's another example sorting a hash based object (providing a\n    print method) by some key:\n\n    use Heap::Number::Hash;\n\n    my $heap = Heap::Number::Hash->new(key_name => \"foo\");\n    $heap->insert($_) for @objects; extract_min->print, \"\\n\" for\n    1..$heap->count;\n\n    Simple, fast."
