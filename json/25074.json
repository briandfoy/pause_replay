This was discussed on the\n    modules list. I can provide the email I received from him as\n    reference if necessary or I am sure he can be contacted.\n\n    The reason for this module is to provide an interface to the\n    statfs() system call for systems that do not have statvfs(). Certain\n    versions of BSD do not have statvfs (and MAC OSX etc).\n\n    In the next month I wish to tie Filesys::Statfs into the\n    Filesys::Df module so that it can be built with either\n    Filesys::Statfs or Filesys::Statvfs depending on the OS. This should\n    give the user a seemless exp regardless of what system call is\n    supported.\n\n    I will go ahead and upload the module tonight that doesnt have ties\n    yet to Filesys::Df.\n\n    Thanks, Ian Guthrie"
