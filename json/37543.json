The module has been on CPAN since 2000 I think.\n\n    The module is another template processing module with a somewhat\n    unique feature that makes it very easy to associate tag names with\n    arbitrary Perl subroutines.\n\n    The module looks for HTML-like tags whose names begin with \"#\":\n\n    <#TAGNAME attribute1 attribute2=\"value\" attribute3=\"blah blah\">\n\n    Tags may be be nested:\n\n    <#TAG1 value=\"<#TAG2 attribute=\"foo\">\">\n\n    Tag names can be tied to a string or to a CODE reference.\n\n    When the parser encounters a registered tag name that is tied to a\n    CODE reference it excutes the subroutine passing the name/value\n    pairs of the tag attributes to the subroutine and replaces the tag\n    in the output with whatever the subroutine returns.\n\n    Because the parser passes the attributes to the subroutine it is\n    fairly easy for the template writer to pass data to the subroutine\n    that generates the content."
