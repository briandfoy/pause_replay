      "rationale" : "The module is alike to the many online payment processing modules\n    already in existance under Business::OnlinePayment in that it\n    provides a framework to manage the handling of the data to be used\n    in the payment process.\n\n    The module needs to be ::WorldPay::Junior rather than just\n    ::WorldPay as it is only applicable to one of the available four\n    WorldPay payment methods. While two of the WorldPay offered methods\n    are irrelevant (one is for java and the other for COM) the other one\n    could legitimately be handled via a perl module and it is very\n    different.\n\n    I have searched extensively and cannot find any instance of a perl\n    module to manage WorldPay transactions hence this submission."
