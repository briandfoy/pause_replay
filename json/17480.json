It conforms to the standards set\n    forth in the NetPacket.pm module, and works with NetPacket::Ethernet\n    as required.\n\n    Basically, it's another NetPacket component to add to the other\n    protocols that NetPacket already handles.\n\n    Note: This package required NetPacket::Ethernet version 0.04 .\n    Currently the version of NetPacket::Ethernet maintained by Tim\n    Potter (whom I've been unable to contact via email) does not support\n    802.3 packet decoding, and as a result will not properly decode the\n    ethernet portion of the packet. I've updated NetPacket::Ethernet in\n    my CPAN directory (and bumped the version to 0.04). Does anyone know\n    how to get ahold of Tim?"
