      "why" : "The first module I will contribute is a Perl extension for the\n    representation and simulation of biochemical reaction networks.\n    There are submodules for Substrates, Reactions and Networks and a\n    few tools how to manipulate them and an automatic mfile (Matlab)\n    generator. I used the module in my PhD thesis to analyze structural\n    features of metabolic systems (see\n    http://dochost.rz.hu-berlin.de/dissertationen/ebenhoeh-oliver-2003-04-01/)\n    and I think that the module might be usefule to researchers in the\n    field of system's biology. I called the module Bio::Metabolic, the\n    developing site is on sourceforge.net. Project name: bio-metabolic\n\n    I have other modules I consider worth sharing: One is an extension\n    to call Matlab from PERL, another is a module implementing highly\n    configurable evolutionary algorithms.",
