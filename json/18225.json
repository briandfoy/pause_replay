With this\n    approach, one must retain the entire data history, costing memory.\n    (see Press et al ref in pod).\n\n    In the other extreme, one must make intuitive guesses about the\n    averages, updating preliminary statistics once for each data point.\n    With this approach, one saves memory at the cost of increased risk\n    of roundoff error.\n\n    All existing CPAN modules for simple 2-dimensional least-squares\n    fall in the first extreme, while this module falls in the second.\n    Both have their uses..."
