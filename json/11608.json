The\n    module does nothing that cannot be achieved by using wget/curl/LWP,\n    XML::RSS and XML::LibXSLT alone, but it provides a very simple\n    interface for doing this.\n\n    I don't know if Tools is the best name for the module, but it\n    belongs in the XML::RSS space I think. I'd be happy to use another\n    name if a better one could be though of.\n\n    I have tried to contact the maintainers of XML::RSS to see if they\n    mind, but so far have had no response.\n\n    See http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=164033 to see my\n    overview, the module, and comments so far recieved."
