It is simple in its approach. The\n    BarChart object can be thought of as a widget placed on an\n    Image::Magick canvas. As of yet, it does not deal with the area\n    surrounding the graph, such as labeling of axes, and generation of\n    keys. It merely provides a convenient, simple way to create graphs\n    of data and stick them anywhere inside an Image::Magick canvas. That\n    being said, it aims to be fairly flexible in how it does this, and\n    makes most all of its potential parameters configurable. Of course,\n    since simplicity is the goal, you can create super-simple charts\n    using almost no options."
