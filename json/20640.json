      "rationale" : "Net::Z3950::AsyncZ adds a layer of asynchronous support for the\n    Net::Z3950 module through the use of multiple forked processes. This\n    approach enables it to handle queries to a large numbers of servers\n    in a single session. While asynchronous access is theoretically\n    possible with Net:Z3950, Net:Z3950 presents difficulties in\n    practice. Net::Z3950::AsyncZ also deals with the problems presented\n    by Z39.50 servers that fail to respond properly and therefore cause\n    Net::Z3950 to hang.\n\n    Users will also find that it provides a useful front end to\n    Net::Z3950, by providing convenient facilities to process and format\n    Z39.50 records.\n\n    I announced Net::Z3950::AsyncZ on the Net::Z3950 mailing list, and\n    it is currently in use; it has received support from Mike Taylor,\n    author of Net:Z3950, who asked me to include it under Net::Z3950."
