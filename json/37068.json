This module handles all the paging and\n    sorting functionality required by HTML::ReportWriter. It can be used\n    stand-alone as well.\n\n    The related modules don't quite do what mine does, in that none of\n    them seem to be a complete solution that handles both paging and\n    sorting, nor do they handle all the components of paging/sorting.\n\n    For example, they may draw the HTML, but won't generate the SQL\n    clause to limit the result set. By not handling that aspect of\n    paging, they add complexity to the task of the developer who is\n    using their module."
