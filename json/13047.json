This mimetic file then\n    looks and behaves like a normal file, and can be stored, used or\n    emailed without attracting attention. Although this could be\n    considered a steganography program, it implements a very very\n    trivial steganography. A lot of steganography programs use smarter\n    methods, but they can hide only few informations in big files. I\n    wrote this module because it can be used to hide big files behind\n    little ones; obviously a gif larger than 5MB could be souspicious,\n    but a doc or a pdf with the same size should not attract attention.\n    The Mimetic namespace is needed because the module has submodules\n    that rule encryption algorithms."
