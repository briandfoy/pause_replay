But\n    its universality (it is for reading AND writing) makes it slow.\n\n    I have to read and to work with the content of many files about 1\n    to 10 MB in a reasonably short time. The access will be random and\n    the file is to be opend in readonly mode.\n\n    Using the Benchmark-modul it shows, that the lighter module\n    Array::LineReader is faster than the universal utility Tie::File."
