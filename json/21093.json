It could\n    also be more generally described as dealing with sets of 1d or 2d\n    arrays, but the model is more specifically useful for benchmark\n    result processing.\n\n    This module should be listed in the CPAN module list because many\n    people do benchmarking and must do a great deal of manual data\n    manipulation before being able to publish the results. This module\n    enables a great deal of automation of benchmarking and result\n    analysis. I am currently using it in this way with iozone."
