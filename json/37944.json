C<part> (which can\n    be expanded to many things, but I prefer \"partition\") allows you to\n    divide the contents of a list between several result arrayrefs based\n    on the return value of a block. It's a more general version of the\n    \"multi-grep\" people occasionally implement.\n\n    While superficially similar to the functions in List::Util, the\n    functions in this module aren't trivially implementable in terms of\n    C<reduce>, and probably wouldn't be used as commonly as the\n    functions in that module. I felt it more responsible to simply name\n    the module after its function, rather than call it\n    List::EvenMoreUtil or something.\n\n    List::Part has existed as an unregistered CPAN module for over a\n    year now; I'd simply like it to appear on the module list so that\n    potential users can find it more easily."
