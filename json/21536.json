Objective is to use the largest\n    possible font size to enable readability. Splits text lines\n    approximately in half but tries to split at a punctuation point if\n    possible. Splits a verse (a set of lines) approximately in half but\n    again at a punctuation point if possible. The idea being to reduce\n    the number of words displayed in both vertical and horizontal\n    directions but without introducing breaks at inappropriate points.\n\n    So for example:\n\n    Let us go then, you and I When the evening is spread out against\n    the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through\n    certain half-deserted streets,\n\n    becomes (with suitable centering)\n\n    Let us go then, you and I When the evening is spread out against\n    the sky\n\n    Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go through certain\n    half-deserted streets,\n\n    The exist wrap/split/format modules are pitched around text\n    justification for normal text and not poetry/song lyrics. In\n    particular with poetry and song lyrics while it is ok(ish) to add\n    additional line breaks all existing breaks must be honoured."
