It does not support the\n    (often) complex threading models that other BEEP implementations\n    have. Because of this, it does not directly support some of the use\n    cases that BEEP is known to handle (specifically highly-multiplexed\n    or peer-to-peer appliations).\n\n    As far as I could tell, there are no other Perl BEEP\n    implementations of any sort."
