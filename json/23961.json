It would\n    require major surgery of the underlying C code to get them to accept\n    bit-strings (which is useful for cryptanalysis). Also, Digest::SHA\n    supports all NIST algorithms in FIPS PUB 180-2, whereas the current\n    modules focus on particular subsets.\n\n    Responses on comp.lang.perl.modules indicate that the Digest::\n    space is the most appropriate one for this module, and that\n    Digest::SHA would be the most appropriate name since the module\n    covers all algorithms and input types described in the SHA standard.\n    For reference, the thread in which this was discussed is \"RFD:\n    SHA-1/256/384/512 Bitwise Implementation\"."
