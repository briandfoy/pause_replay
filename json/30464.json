It provides features\n    including mixing of source files into a single output file,\n    soundcard output on Win32 and Linux, an IPC mechanism and more -\n    development continues.\n\n    This module provides an OO Perl language binding for the AMaMP\n    audio engine, providing methods to start the engine with a given\n    instruction file and exchange messages with it.\n\n    The name Audio::AMaMP was chosen on the basis that:- - It's an\n    audio engine, it won't branch into any other area (e.g. video, etc)\n    so Audio seems like the most sensible root level namespace. - It's\n    unlikely that there will be another open source audio project called\n    AMaMP, so using the initials rather than the full name of the\n    project (Audio Mixing and Manipulation Project) is most likely safe."
