At this moment there aren't\n    module, which has similar (similar project was ePortal by Sergey\n    Rusakov, but has less functionality and is probably abadoned).\n    Adding any messages, plugins or any elements are very simple so\n    resonable name is CMS (Common Message System). I've already try to\n    register namespace, but there wasn't any answer at all.\n\n    Ps. PHP support will be added in the next version (it is made by\n    'serialize()' function from php). Sorry, for my English."
