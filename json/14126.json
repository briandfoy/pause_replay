The OCS Directory\n    format is an XML format designed to enable channel listings to be\n    constructed for use by portal sites, client based headline software\n    and other similar applications.\n\n    There used to be a module for parsing OCS files out on the main OCS\n    site (http://internetalchemy.org/ocs/) but it has not been\n    maintained in over a year and has become defunct, hence my creation\n    of this module."
