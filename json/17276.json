Date::Time is close, but\n    not nearly as functional. The mathemagical nature of my\n    implementation makes it extremely useful when comparing dates or\n    iterating over certain periods (e.g. to create a calendar or search\n    across a certain time period in a log file).\n\n    I tried submitting this about 2 years back. I was told to check\n    into someone else's work so as not to risk having too many\n    implementations. To be honest, I was bummed that my work appeared to\n    be all for nothing and I just let it drop. Well, two years later,\n    I'm still finding mine useful and still not seeing the other guy's\n    work in the archive.\n\n    So, here it is again :-) I promise to not be so silly this time."
