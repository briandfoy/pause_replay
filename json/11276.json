To achive this, it mainly uses a\n    hash containing filenames and their corresponding directories.\n\n    I used this module for a script analyzing a big tree of source\n    modules. After introducing this modul, the process of locating the\n    scattered include files was notably faster than before. (The include\n    statements of the modules didn't contain directory informations.)\n\n    File::Find works the other way around, you must know before\n    starting which files you are going to need."
