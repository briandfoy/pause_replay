I then had a choice to either create a\n    Traveller namespace, or RPG::Traveller; I chose the former so I\n    wouldn't have to type as much. So the namespace I would prefer is\n    Games::Traveller::UWP, though I am open to suggestions.\n\n    An alternate namespace would be Games::TAS:UWP, where 'TAS' is a\n    very common acronym in the Traveller RPG ( 'Travellers' Aid Society'\n    ) and is somewhat relevant to Perl modules submitted on behalf of\n    Traveller. But it's a bit less clear than just plain Traveller. So\n    that's where I'm at."
