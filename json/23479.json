Those items can be manipulated\n    and bindings can be associated with them to implement interaction\n    behaviors. But unlike the canvas, Zinc can structure the items in a\n    hierarchy, has support for scaling and rotation, clipping can be set\n    for sub-trees of the item hierarchy. It also provides functions from\n    openGL, such as color gradient and transparencies. The item set is\n    quite more powerful and includes field specific items for\n    prototyping Air Traffic systems Graphic User Interfaces.",
