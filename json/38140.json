The main difference is\n    that it's a source filter module.\n\n    Its main goal is to implement the same error handling interface as\n    Error.pm (since it's the best i've seen in perl) without its\n    inherent problems due to memory leaks and implicit anonymous\n    subroutines through prototypes.\n\n    PS: This is a repost of Error::Filter, using another name, since it\n    was judged as a misleading name. Please, if Error::Filtered also\n    seems misleading (or just plain ugly), I urge you to suggest a\n    better name."
