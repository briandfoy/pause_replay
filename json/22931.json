However, if it\n    is felt that a root namespace name is not justified I'd be just as\n    happy to see this as lib::perl5lib\n\n    This module addresses a common need amongst those people who\n    develop modules and CGI scripts on shared servers. Because of the\n    nature of this module it would be really good to see it get into\n    Development Stage \"S\". A module that allows users to access their\n    own module diretory is not too useful unless it's in the system-wide\n    module directory."
