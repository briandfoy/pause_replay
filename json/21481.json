It is in the same category as MQSeries, which has a\n    top-level namespace, so I think it is reasonable for Tuxedo to have\n    one too. Being an interface to commercial software, it doesn't\n    really fit in with any of the existing namespaces.\n\n    I'm currently only interested in writing a Perl-only module related\n    to Tuxedo administration, so I'd like to use the Tuxedo::Admin\n    namespace for this. I expect that additional modules will be created\n    under the Tuxedo namespace - in particular Anthony Fryer's (AFRYER)\n    recent contributions."
