To ease the creation of new CGI::Application modules.\n\n    2. To allow standardization of CGI::Application coding styles to be\n    more uniformly applied.\n\n    It is also the hope of this module that Computer Assisted Software\n    Engineering (CASE) tools will eventually emerge which will allow the\n    development process for web-based applications to be greatly\n    improved. These CASE tools could more easily convert visual notation\n    (such as UML state-transition diagrams) into method calls to this\n    module, thereby creating actual code.\n\n    What This Module Does Not Do\n\n    CGI::Application::Generator is intended to create a shell of an\n    application module based on the specification you provide. It will\n    not output a completely functional application without additional\n    coding. It will, however, handle the creation of all the structural\n    parts of your application common to all CGI::Application-based\n    modules.\n\n    CGI::Application::Generator is not a system for HTML templates. If\n    you're looking for a Perl module which will allow you to separate\n    Perl from HTML then I recommend you download and install\n    HTML::Template."
