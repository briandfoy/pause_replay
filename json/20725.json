Blog\n    was suggested as a top-level namespace in the thoughts that Blog and\n    blogging related modules should live under one common tree.\n\n    This module offers much the same functionality as LJ::Simple with a\n    few differences. The API that Blog::LiveJournal uses is much cleaner\n    and easier to understand, extend, etc etc. Blog::LiveJournal uses\n    the XMLRPC interface to LiveJournal while LJ::Simple uses the HTTP\n    interface. The major difference there is that LJ::Simple has to jump\n    through a lot of hoops to organize and understand the data coming\n    back from the server where the xml coming back to Blog::LiveJournal\n    is already nicely organized."
