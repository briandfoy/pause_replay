So for the\n    'handler' to know how to handle the template I needed to set a\n    paramater in the template. The old templating system I was using\n    supported this, but didnt handle nested if's very well and I wanted\n    to use HTML::Template. I decided I would write this module, now I\n    can have <TMPL_SET NAME=\"handler\">index</TMPL_SET> and sub index\n    will be called to handle my template."
