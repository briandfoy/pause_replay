Petal is a Perl implementation inspired from that\n    specification, it stands for \"Perl Template Attribute Language\"\n    (Perl TAL).\n\n    Petal makes it possible to write template files which are entirely\n    well-formed XML. I was going to go for XML::Template but since I\n    added the ability to process HTML files as well this is not relevant\n    anymore.\n\n    Petal cannot be under HTML (because it can process XML templates)\n    or XML (because it can process HTML templates as well). It cannot be\n    in Template::Petal either because Template is taken by the template\n    toolkit.\n\n    So I figured out a top-level name 'Petal' would be allright... Hope\n    that's OK with everyone."
