This module is a tied filehandle\n    that also extends from IO::Handle and IO::Selectable. It wraps DBI's\n    blob_read method. By making LOB's available as a file handle to read\n    from we can process the data in a familiar perly way. Additionally,\n    by making the module respect $/ and $. then we can read lines of\n    text data from a textual LOB (CLOB) and treat it just as we would\n    any other file handle."
