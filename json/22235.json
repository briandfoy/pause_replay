      "why" : "I've written a module to parse files issued by the Norwegian\n    Banking Payment Processing Central (my translation, I have no idea\n    what they call themselves in English). I've used it in production to\n    parse files containing payment information amounting to about NOK\n    200 000 (~$25 000), so it works... :-)\n\n    It's fairly simple, and follows a pretty clear specification to the\n    letter.\n\n    I've planned calling it No::Finans::BBS::OCRData. Great Perl Hacker\n    Gisle Aas started No::*, and I asked him about use of the namespace,\n    but I haven't received a reply. I'm a bit in doubt how to do this,\n    or whether it is a good idea to use that many sublevels, but it is a\n    rather natural think to do, given that BBS is this Banking Central,\n    and they have quite a bunch of specs. Aas' module No::KontoNr would\n    for example fit perfectly as No::Finans::BBS::KontoNr. Advice\n    appreciated.\n\n    Obviously, this is just the start! It's my first module, but I'm\n    hacking away happily to the best of my ability so it is not the\n    last! :-)\n\n    Cheers,\n\n    Kjetil",
