Oriented to keep the power\n    of the API, giving the tool to write template based systems.\n\n    Thers is too, a clear separation between the source HTML file and\n    the dynamic content.\n\n    The module uses a tag based zone declaration that exists as the\n    XMLSubsMatch directive in Apache::ASP.\n\n    It's running actually in various sites. I was not sure about\n    uploading, because in some way, it just take functionality present\n    in other two projects, but, the actual programmers using the library\n    are urging me to post it on the CPAN. Actually, i send email copies\n    to my friends."
