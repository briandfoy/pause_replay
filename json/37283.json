The\n    canonical idiom is to test if the absolute value of the difference\n    of the numbers is within a desired precision. This module provides\n    such a function for use with Test::Harness. Usage is similar to\n    other test functions described in Test::More. Semantically, the\n    cmp_float function replaces this kind of construct:\n\n    ok ( abs($p - $q) <= $precision, '$p is equal to $q' ) or diag \"$p\n    is not equal to $q to within $precision\";\n\n    While there's nothing wrong with that construct, it's a pain to\n    type it repeatedly in a test script. This module does the same thing\n    with a single function call and supports user specified precisions."
