Another is to use\n    one of the many (not so portable) libraries such as GnomeVFS.\n\n    VFS is currently being written and has two libraries intended to be\n    released.\n\n    1) Pure Perl - using other perl modules to implement the underlying\n    structure.\n\n    2) XS to GnomeVFS - to allow for the more advanced functionallity\n    of VFS\n\n    The Pure Perl version should work nicely cross platform, but the\n    GnomeVFS version is far more bound to a smaller set of platforms.\n\n    The common subset of features is working, FTP, WebDAV and Local are\n    working in Perl, and a basic XS binding to Gnome VFS is passing most\n    tests."
