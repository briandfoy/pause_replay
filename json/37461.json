If you know what Tie::File does, you can\n    pretty much guess what Tie::File::AsHash does by the name alone.\n\n    I searched CPAN high and low before authoring the module. The\n    closest thing that I found to Tie::File::AsHash is the Tie::File\n    module. I think my approach is unique because it allows users to tie\n    human-readable files to a hash, versus DB_File and other modules\n    that use non-human readable files.\n\n    I believe the module should be in the module list because the\n    module is unique, is useful to me, and I believe many others will\n    find it useful.\n\n    Thanks."
