      "why" : "I'm going to upload three extensions to CGI::Session.\n\n    CGI::Session::Serialize::DataDumper is just a copy of\n    CGI::Session::Serialize::Default but with the actual name of the\n    serializer (Data Dumper) so that module users can reference it by\n    name instead of as \"Default\"\n\n    CGI::Session::FlexMySQL is a derivation from CGI::Session::MySQL\n    which allows module users to fully customize the MySQL connection\n    including data tables and field names, as well as more precisely\n    control when the database handle is disconnected.\n\n    CGI::Session::BitBucket is a new creation to allow module users to\n    test an application which uses CGI::Session but without having to\n    set up any sort of data store at all. Basically it's so they can\n    test it stateless for syntax etc. without a datastore and without\n    having to comment out all the session code.\n\n    BTW I added *@perl.org to my email whitelist but if your message to\n    me is rejected anyway, please call +1 (408) 997-1153.",
