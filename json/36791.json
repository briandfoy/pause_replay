It installs &\n    dispatches to methods named by keys in a hash-object using metadata\n    in the values. Because the object has its own compiler/handler this\n    is generic: it doesn't care HOW the object's compiler does the deed,\n    it just installs the result. I also have Plugin::Language::DML as an\n    exmaple compiled language that is handled by Plugin::Installer. Net\n    result is a generic plugin utility.\n\n    All of the existing items I can find that do anything similar are\n    crammed into Class::, which this isn't since the hash doesn't really\n    even need to be blessed, just present. It isn't an autoloader\n    (although the handler language may choose to use that technique)."
