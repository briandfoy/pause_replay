These modules focus on listing objects and\n    constructing PDF documents from scratch. Then there is Text::PDF\n    bundle. Text::PDF can create, modify and list PDF page objects. It\n    can't delete pages from a PDF document.\n\n    There is no module or combination of modules that would allow me to\n    delete/select pages from an original PDF document and create a new\n    document.\n\n    PDF::Extract is the most logical name I can come up with"
