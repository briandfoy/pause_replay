Consistent looking GUI without the need to code resp. tune each\n    widget by hand. Instead you declare the structure of your GUI,\n    connect it to the data of your program (which should be a well\n    defined set of objects) and control how this structure is\n    transformed into a specific layout in a very generic way.\n\n    2. Automatically keep widget and object states in sync (in both\n    directions), even with complex data structures with a lot of\n    internal dependencies, object nesting etc.\n\n    Currently no other module wich a similar functionality exists.\n\n    The namespace follows the recommendation of the Gtk2 development\n    team for pure Perl extensions, and thus uses the Gtk2::Ex prefix.\n    The name was discussed in the gtk-perl-list@gnome.org mailing list,\n    without objections."
