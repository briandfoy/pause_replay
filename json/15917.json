      "rationale" : "This module will use existing Tk features or native win32 calls\n    (requires Win32::API) to manipulate the mouse cursor\n    programmatically. All methods will apply to user-specified\n    widget(s). This module will incorporate calls to hide or show the\n    cursor when over a widget, move the cursor to a specified widget, or\n    confine the cursor within a widget boundary.\n\n    Tk already has the capability to 'configure' the cursor\n    type(shape), so this module does not do that. However, easier cursor\n    configuration to a number of widgets simultaneously could be grafted\n    in a future release.\n\n    Tk::HideCursor is a relatively new module on CPAN which is limited\n    in functionality, has bugs on Win32, and writes temporary files on\n    Unix :-(\n\n    Tk::Cursor will have no relation to this existing module.\n\n    The above mentioned functionality suggests that Tk::Cursor is an\n    appropriate name. Others I have considered are Tk::CursorControl,\n    Tk::MouseControl. I have dropped a few hints on using the Tk::Cursor\n    namespace in e-mails to the ptk mailing list and to\n    comp.lang.perl.tk and have not yet heard any negative feedback.\n\n    As time comes closer to a release, I will discuss this namespace\n    again on the lists mentioned."
