I would be interested to hear\n    the advice of others regarding this decision.\n\n    LCDproc is a server that drivers an LCD matrix attached via serial\n    or parallel port to a computer. This new module enables 'clients' to\n    communicate to the server and write to the LCD using Perl. There is\n    no similar module that I can see.\n\n    The problem with deciding the namespace is that in the future\n    someone could write modules that connect with LCD displays directly,\n    without LCDproc, therefore necessitating a new category. I might\n    have to rename the module to LCD::LCDproc then.\n\n    Again, I would appreciate suggestions or advice."
