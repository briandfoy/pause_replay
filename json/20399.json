To interact with the database tables, FileSystem\n    implements a command line shell which offers not only a subset of\n    well known shell commands to navigate, view and manipulate data in\n    tables, but also gives the convenience of history, command line\n    editing and tab completion. FileSystem sees the database as a\n    filesystem: each table is a different directory with the tablename\n    as the directory name and each row in a table is a file within that\n    directory.\n\n    The motivation for FileSystem was the need for a terminal based\n    configuration interface to manipulate database entries which are\n    used as configuration data for a server process. FileSystem is\n    neither complete nor a replacement for dbish or other full-feature\n    SQL shells or editors. Think of FileSystem as a replacement for a\n    Web/CGI based graphical user interface for manipulating database\n    contents."
