BIE would provide functions of data\n    query and storage, knowledge exploration, machine learning,\n    statistics and so on, which will be in simple ways for biologists to\n    concentrate on thinking about kinds of biology fields with a little\n    effort on computer skills.\n\n    It's obvious that some of the functions mentioned above already are\n    provided in CPAN. But BIE is unique in that its components are\n    customized particularly for biologists' researches. BIE is to\n    integrate pieces of technologies into comfortable environments and\n    to provide plain syntaxes and interfaces for biology scientists.\n\n    BioPerl is an excellent and very famous toolkit in building\n    bioinformatics solutions\n    (http://bioperl.org/wiki/FAQ#What_is_BioPerl.3F). It mainly works on\n    sequence data (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioPerl#Features). BIE\n    absolutely will utilize BioPerl as an importance base to create\n    environment for sequence analysis."
