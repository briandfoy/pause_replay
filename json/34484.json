The guts of the code\n    is contained in two separate modules:\n\n    Filter::Crypto::CryptFile Filter::Crypto::Decrypt\n\n    The former provides a function for creating the encrypted files\n    (and can also decrypt them). It is typically used via a script\n    called crypt_file (also in this distribution).\n\n    The latter is the filter module which does the source code\n    filtering (i.e. decryption) when the encrypted file is run.\n\n    In addition, one more module is contained in this distribution:\n\n    PAR::Filter::Crypto\n\n    which is a PAR::Filter sub-class which makes use of\n    Filter::Crypto::CryptFile to create a PAR archive containing\n    encrypted files.\n\n    Two similar modules already exist on CPAN: Filter::CBC and\n    Crypt::License.\n\n    However, these modules both use Perl-level source code filters and\n    hence are considerably less secure than this distribution, which\n    uses a C-level source code filter. I realise that this is still by\n    no means \"uncrackable\", but it does represent a significant\n    improvement."
