All\n    automobiles sold in the US that are 1996 and newer use a variation\n    of this bus for communication between the embedded controllers, and\n    to diagnostic tools.\n\n    I'd like to put it on cpan so I can gain interest in this project.\n\n    I also have modules to communicate with the 94-95 Camaro, Firebird,\n    Corvette and Impala. They can be extended to any 1987-1995 General\n    Motors car or truck. I might upload this so that someone else may\n    take it and maintain it.",
