Documents are rendered as\n    collapsible outlines and individual nodes may be viewed and\n    bookmarked as unique pages, so you don't have to click through a\n    gazillion nested leaves to find what you're looking for.\n\n    If you have the Text::Outline package installed on your server, you\n    can use it to convert a number of outline(r) formats as XBEL for use\n    with the handler.\n\n    Once individual nodes/pages have been rendered, they are cached to\n    reduce the load on the server. Cache files are updated whenever any\n    of the widgets involved in the transformation are modified.\n\n    * Note\n\n    This package has a long TO DO list. It works fine, but there are a\n    number of items that I'd like to tickle. They are, however, pretty\n    low on the totem pole so I figured I would share what I've already\n    written now."
