POE::Component::Client::TCP is capable\n    of this, however its overhead is increadably greater since you must\n    spawn a new session for each client connection. The goal of\n    ::Client::TCPMulti is to accomplish all of the multiwheel\n    connectivity within a single session, the reason for it being a\n    seperate module instead of a suggestion for replacement of\n    ::Client::TCP, is to manage all of these wheels with a single\n    session, the API is slightly more complex, however not greatly,\n    ::Client::TCP is still a better solution for working with only a\n    single socket, since overhead will not be affected and the API is\n    more simple."
