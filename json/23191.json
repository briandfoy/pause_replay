I am trying to provide generic integration between this\n    system (written in PHP) and a few mod_Perl applications that I\n    support.\n\n    Will hundreds of people download this? Probably not, but it will at\n    least provide a place to put these modules that is publicly\n    available and where I don't have to worry about backups ;)\n\n    I do plan to create other modules under this same directory to\n    allow for more integration with the MySource tools, so it seems to\n    make sense to create a namespace under PHP::Session\n\n    Thanks, Dave http://www.homsher.com"
