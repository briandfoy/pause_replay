I don't know of other\n    modules that implement this, though people often get the same effect\n    by using closures or else the infamous \"my $foo if 0;\" bug.\n\n    Like other modules in the Tie::* hierarchy this uses tie for its\n    operation. And while many names could be invented for what this\n    module does, the word \"static\" is widely understood to mean the kind\n    of variable that it implements, hence my suggestion of Tie::Static.\n\n    I am also requesting that this be listed under \"Development\n    Support\" or \"Miscellaneous Modules\" despite the fact that the Tie\n    namespace is so far associated with \"Data and Data Types\" or \"User\n    Interfaces\". This doesn't fit with those existing categories."
