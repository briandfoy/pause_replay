It is not tied\n    to any particular file format and is intended to help users work\n    with circuit layout items at a higher level of abstraction once they\n    read in a layout format of their choice (e.g. GDS2, CIF, or\n    whatever). CircuitLayout is a name that clearly advertises to a\n    person that is in the integrated circuit field and would be\n    interested in what the module has to offer."
