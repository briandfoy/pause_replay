Although the\n    images are primarily used on a win32 platform this code was written\n    so that non-windows code could support windows specfic image\n    generation. I would therefore suggest that it should live with other\n    general image-producing/manipulating code in Image::WMF. I have\n    stuck as closely as possible to the GD image API so that people with\n    experience of creating PNG/Gifs will find is very easy."
