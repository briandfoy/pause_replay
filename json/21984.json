Classes\n    which inherit from it (including Text::Shift, and the\n    soon-to-be-published Text::Cipher::Vigenere) have a simple, uniform\n    interface, making it very easy to change which cipher is used in\n    your code. Building off of a single interface also saves quite a bit\n    of compile time and saves the user's hassle.\n\n    The class also provides a clean and uniform definition of\n    alphabets. This allows users to easilly design ciphers which adapt\n    automatically to non-Latin alphabets, and prevents the wasted time,\n    space, and hassle posed by handling alphabets for many different\n    ciphers."
