It can work with any\n    simulator that accepts text input files and produces text output\n    files. It has support for data analysis and plotting.\n\n    I found no modules on CPAN that do something similar. Therefore I\n    propose a new namespace SimTools, under which all kinds of\n    simulation tools could be put. SynSim (Synthesizer for Simulations)\n    would be one of them.\n\n    Anyway, I'm happy to accept any existing or new namespace if it has\n    anything to do with simulations.\n\n    If the name SynSim is to cryptic, AutomateSims is an alternative."
