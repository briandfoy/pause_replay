This module started out as an add-on for\n    Devel::FastProf. It's purpose was to morph the very crappy output of\n    Devel::FastProf into HTML so that our developers could find quickly\n    find bottlenecks using a visual scan.\n\n    I hit a point where it was more difficult to coerce\n    Devel::FastProf's output into rich reports than it would be to just\n    rewrite it to suit our needs. Devel::NYTProf borrows some code from\n    Devel::FastProf, but is nearly a complete rewrite. Its benefits\n    include:\n\n    - Solaris support - Removal of extra steps to translate the binary\n    output into human readable form - Faster & smarter fork handling\n    (e.g. i don't flush the output buffer after every line of perl\n    code... MUCH faster) - the XS returns a cleaner, simple to use hash\n    of statistics - Flexible reporting system can generate many kinds of\n    reports with advanced statistics - ships with HTML and CSV canned\n    report formats.\n\n    Example report screen caps Index page:\n    http://adkap.com/images/Screenshot-Profile-Index.png A file page:\n    http://adkap.com/images/Screenshot-XML-LibXML.pm.png\n\n    All in two commands, without options. Cool, no?"
