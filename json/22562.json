      "why" : "In case Encode is polutable ;) Please, see the note on naming at\n    the very end.\n\n    Encode::Mapper - extension for intuitive, yet efficient\n    construction of mappings for Encode - implementation touches\n    theoretical studies such as Aho-Corasick and Boyer-Moore algorithms\n    and finite automata with the restart operation - object-oriented API\n    to be used in, but not limited to, the modules below\n\n    Encode::Arabic - extension for encodings of Arabic, using\n    Encode::Encoding - aimed at the Natural Language Processing\n    community of IT\n\n    Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX - extension for multi-purpose processing of\n    the ArabTeX notation of Arabic - conversions into/from the Arabic\n    script and/or phonetic transcriptions, highly configurable -\n    non-trivial implementation relying on Encode::Mapper and suiting the\n    Encode::Encoding interface\n\n    Encode::Arabic::Buckwalter - extension for Tim Buckwalter's\n    transliteration of Arabic - tr/// one-to-one mapping with the\n    Encode::Encoding interface\n\n    Encode::Korean - extension for encodings of Korean, using\n    Encode::Encoding - aimed at the Natural Language Processing\n    community of IT\n\n    Encode::Korean::Literal - transliteration of Hangul, the Korean\n    script - Unicode character decomposition, Encode::Mapper inverse -\n    configurable to numerous transliteration standards\n\n    Encode::Korean::Phonetic - extending the above with applicable\n    phonetic changes - providing the Encode::Encoding interface as well\n\n    NOTE:\n\n    We propose the full names of **languages** these modules refer to,\n    rather than the two-letter codes, since:\n\n    - Encode::KR already exists in the internal structure of Encode,\n    and is quite distant from what Encode::Korean does.\n\n    - Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX may imply there will be similar modules\n    working with the many ArabTeX notations in the future. The produced\n    **script** may still be called Arabic (like Encode::Persian::ArabTeX\n    or Encode::Urdu::ArabTeX), but need not (like\n    Encode::Hebrew::ArabTeX). Recall that the rules for interpreting the\n    transliteration depend on the **language**.\n\n    - Finally, we think Encode::* is much more appropriate than\n    Lingua::*, simply because the interfaces we use and provide were\n    designed to fit exactly into Encode's philosophy",
