The Apache::Wyrd class and derived classes represent\n    self-processing HTML template-like objects when pre-processed by the\n    Apache::Wyrd::Handler. Their distinct location on an HTML page lends\n    the idea of \"Word\" as an analogy, but there are several CPAN modules\n    devoted to a well-known wordprocessor that use \"Word\" in their\n    name-space. The old germanic word \"Wyrd\" is a better description, as\n    it has the connotation of a evocative aspect as well as a written\n    one."
