It will\n    provide information about the audio properties (rate, length, ...)\n    via Audio::File::AudioProperties or equivalent, info about the files\n    tag via Audio::File::Tag (artist, album, ...) and probably (at a\n    later point of development) also information about the pure audio\n    data (through Audio::Data?).\n\n    It'll be independent from the files format. At the moment I plan to\n    support Ogg, Flac and MP3, but it'll be extendable quite easy due\n    the features of object oriented programming.\n\n    It would be nice if you could CC me (flora@cpan.org) in your\n    replies.\n\n    Thank you, Florian"
