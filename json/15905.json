It can work with any\n    simulator (in fact on any program, not only simulators), but\n    simulators that accept text input files and produce text output\n    files are better supported. There is support for data analysis and\n    plotting.\n\n    I found no modules on CPAN that do something similar.\n\n    Following some discussion on the modules list\n    (http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/modules/2002-11/msg00331.html\n    ), I propose a new top level namespace Simulation, under which all\n    kinds of simulation-related modules, like SynSim, could be put."
