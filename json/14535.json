(import ':globally' is safe.)\n\n    2) Avoids the problem of getting empty or missing matches from a\n    glob within a automounted directory when that mount point happens to\n    be gone (off, down, or just timed out). Also fixes the opendir on\n    such automount nodes.\n\n    3) Avoids that very nasty \"10 minute choke\" or kernel lock that\n    prevents you from being able to \"kill -9\" a process that accidently\n    attempted to resolve a path or node whose root path contains an\n    automount to a remote box that is offline or suddenly unreachable\n    from the client box.\n\n    4) Uses syncronous tcp SYN packets to detect remote reachability in\n    order to achieve parallel timeouts for multiple down or inaccessible\n    mount points to assist in determining the maximum availability\n    statuses in the minimum amount of real time.\n\n    This is already being using heavily in production. I just removed\n    the proprietary stuff to donate this for the benefit of the open\n    source comunity."
