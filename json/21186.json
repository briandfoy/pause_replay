It can be used to test/interact with GUI applications\n    which have been built upon the X toolkit or those built upon\n    toolkits (i.e., GTK) that \"wrap\" X toolkit's functionality.\n\n    Reason For Listing: I believe this module will be helpful to other\n    people.\n\n    Difference From Existing Solutions: Existing solutions such as\n    xmacro or xautomation seem to be cumbersome to implement and\n    maintain use of.\n\n    Implementation: The Perl package (X11::GUITest) exports the\n    necessary higher level functions to perform GUI interaction through\n    user emulation. Example functions exported: SendKeys,\n    FindWindowLike, WaitWindowLike, StartApp, RunApp, ClickMouse,\n    IconifyWindow, UnIconifyWindow, RaiseWindow, IsWindowViewable,\n    GetChildWindows, etc. There are currently about 10 more functions in\n    addition to this...\n\n    Libraries Used: Xlib, XTest\n\n    Programming Language: Perl, C\n\n    Operating System Support: I have developed the package under Linux\n    without using any Linux specific technologies, so as the name of\n    X11::GUITest implies(-> X11), I'll be happy to help support and\n    modify my package to work on any Operating System that provides a\n    compatible X server, such as FreeBSD.\n\n    Enhancements: I plan on maintaining enhancements to this package\n    and welcome community involvement in doing so."
