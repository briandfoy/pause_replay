The main Base Module will have\n    basic functions used by the more ::specialized modules. and can\n    still be used by anyone if they use that service or not. Then the\n    ::Modules will use those basic functions in the main .pm file and\n    allow users to interact with the various aspects of the service.\n    Basically right now I havn;t started the service as I'm waiting to\n    be able to distribute my modules for it on cpan.\n\n    Thanks a bunch!\n\n    Dan",
