Hence I created a tied wrapper\n    to access the data in a Tk::Listbox widget. It is possible to tie\n    arrays to Tk::Scrolled widgets (and others) as well.\n\n    I searched for existing modules with this functionality but did not\n    find any on CPAN. I chose Tie::TkListbox as namespace because this\n    module implements a tie, not a listbox nor any Tk widget.\n\n    In my opinion, the module should be listed in the User Interfaces\n    chapter with the other modules related to Tk because you'd usually\n    search for something of the given functionality *there*."
