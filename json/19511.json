These modules\n    themselves don't actually output any html.\n\n    Comming next will a collection of modules using the previous ones\n    to actualy create \"standard\" web applications. Some of these include\n    WWWBoards, Configuration Systems, Form Builders, ...etc.\n\n    Most notably, DB::SQL::*.pm contains modules to translate the SQL\n    itself to specific database engines for use along with Tim Bunces\n    DBI. (dates, nulls, outerjoins, concats)\n\n    A subclass of CGI with added date/time methods for creating\n    completely configurable date/time form elements _easily_.\n\n    Thanks the the hard work.",
