Thus, only a limited\n    amount of information from is returned. This includes: + the\n    height/width (in pixels) of the movie in 'Normal' display mode + the\n    length (in seconds) of the movie, + the features (sample rate, bits\n    per sample) of the audio track (if any), + and most significantly,\n    the extraction of the preview PICT image (if any).\n\n    The code is based on the module template provided by the\n    Image::Info package.\n\n    As for the name space choice, it follows the RIFF::Info model.\n    Plans are in place to include access to this new modules from\n    Video::Info. The motivation for the root 'Quicktime' is that it\n    should be easy to expand the module to include Quicktime::Info::QTIF\n    for the Apple Quicktime Image Format, as the header infomation\n    format is similar.\n\n    Suggestions for other namespace locations are welcome."
