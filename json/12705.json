It interfaces to the user at a\n    much higher level then widgets; it gives command-line applications a\n    consistent \"look and feel\". Its metaphor for the computer is as a\n    human-like conversation-partner, and as each answer/response is\n    completed it is summarised onto one line, and remains on screen, so\n    that the history of the session gradually accumulates on the screen\n    and is available for review, or for cut/paste. &choose uses arrow\n    keys (or hjkl) and return, and &edit and &view use the default\n    EDITOR and PAGER if possible. It's fast, very easy for both\n    programmer and user, and has few external dependencies. It doesn't\n    use curses which is a whole-of screen interface"
