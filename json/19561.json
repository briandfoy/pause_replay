      "rationale" : "CGI::Search has the goal of being easy to generate a simple search\n    over a flat-text database file and create HTML output to be sent to\n    a web browser. Further, validation of user input and database fields\n    is tied tightly into its implementation, thus providing no excuses\n    for developers who don't do validation. Further, the output can be\n    templated using HTML::Template.\n\n    HTML::Widgets::Search is the closest of the above listed modules to\n    CGI::Search. However, it relies on a functional database interface\n    and uses an inline HTML syntax (somewhat similar to PHP) instead of\n    HTML::Template. There is nothing wrong with this approach, but many\n    people are already familer with HTML::Template and might even be\n    able to use CGI::Search with only minor changes to their existing\n    HTML::Template-formated documents. Further, HTML::Widgets::Search\n    doesn't provide user-input validation.\n\n    Text::Scan is somewhat similar to CGI::Search in its approach to\n    doing the search, but it doesn't abstract away certain functionality\n    that is typical in CGI applications. Text::Scan could potentially be\n    used as a backend for CGI::Search.\n\n    DBIx::FullTextSearch is specific, not just to a full database, but\n    to MySQL (according to the documentation). Like Text::Scan, it also\n    doesn't abstract away functionality typical in CGI applications."
