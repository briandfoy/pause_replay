Email address\n    validation is a very common problem, as witnessed by the fact that\n    there are several other approaches to address validation already on\n    CPAN.\n\n    Functionally, this module is equivalent to RFC::RFC822::Address,\n    but avoids the significant startup performance hit of using\n    Parse::RecDescent by using regular expressions (see\n    http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm/2001-September/005034.html)\n\n    Mail::CheckUser implements much weaker syntax checking, but\n    provides other functionality.\n\n    I am very much open to advice on namespace choice, but, I believe\n    that this module should live under Mail:: rather than RFC:: as its\n    purpose. The RFC822::Address reflects the fact that the purpose of\n    this module is to check email syntax against RFC822, no more, no\n    less.\n\n    It is my opinion that this is the one useful type of address\n    validation that can be done. Figuring out if an address is\n    deliverable is the job of MTAs."
