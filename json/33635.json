(It makes use of Module::MakefilePL::Parse.)\n\n    Although not as thorough as modules which hook to see which ones\n    really are requested, it's fast, safer, (does not run entire\n    Makefile.PL) and good enough for building a dependency tree.\n\n    It also runs on Windows, which some modules cannot (at least not\n    until their dependent modules are fixed ;)\n\n    Originally it was going to be called something like\n    CPAN::Distribution::Depends, but people suggested alternate\n    namespaces."
