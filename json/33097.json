      "rationale" : "The reason for the namespace choice: 1) It's a config module, so\n    should go under the \"Config\" root. 2) It attempts to be a \"do what I\n    mean\" type module - doing the best it can to figure out any kind of\n    config, so it's \"Magic.\" I might have called it \"Auto\" if that\n    wasn't already taken.\n\n    Uniqueness: Config::Auto separates detection and tree building into\n    two separate steps - sending the text off to other modules once it\n    detects the file type. This parser does not; it merely includes\n    every kind of config in it's Parse::RecDescent grammar and creates a\n    tree from that. Failure to parse completely with the grammar\n    indicates a bad detection rather than a score-based heuristic.\n\n    This gives two distinct differences from Config::Auto: 1) This\n    module is more flexible, allowing for hybrid types and types that do\n    not have supported submodules in Config::Auto. 2) It is slower.\n\n    Of course, it is also \"competing\" with all the specialized config\n    modules whose format it can read (it can read Apache, Ini, CSV,\n    space separated, XML, equals separated, and a lot of formats that\n    currently have no names), and it's only advantage over those is that\n    it can read them all.\n\n    It should be included in the module list because as far as I know\n    it is the most flexible module in existence for reading\n    configuration files.\n\n    I might also add that I am calling it beta only because I've been\n    the only one to test it. There are probably remaining bugs, but if\n    so they're in my blind spot."
