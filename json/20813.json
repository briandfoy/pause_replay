It's designed to read\n    record-oriented data (where records aren't limited to\n    comma-and-newline-delimited type), so I thought about\n    \"RecordParser.\" I don't really see adding the write capabilities of\n    something like DBD::CSV (even if I did steal many other ideas for my\n    module from DBI), so I think it's safe to just call it a \"parser.\""
