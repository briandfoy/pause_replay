I have to do a little more checking\n    on the namespace for this package, but a brief description is listed\n    below.\n\n    Sort::Objects is intended to make it simple to sort a list of\n    objects by one of the return values of a function on those objects.\n    It is able to tell the difference between words and numbers and thus\n    sort them appropriately. The goal of this package is to eliminate\n    the need to write custom sorting code for each type of object you\n    would want to sort.",
