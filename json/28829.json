The codebase is borrowed from P:C:I so felt it was\n    best to place the module in the P:C:I namespace and have discussed\n    via email with Dennis Taylor (P:C:I author) and he is happy with\n    this. POE::Component::IRC::Service is a wrapper to submodules which\n    I forsee handling different IRCd implementations. Eg. I have\n    POE::Component::IRC::Service::P10 for P10 protocol and\n    POE::Component::IRC::Service::Hybrid for Hybrid IRCd The module also\n    utilises some POE::Filter modules, POE::Filter::IRC::P10 and\n    POE::Filter::CTCP::P10."
