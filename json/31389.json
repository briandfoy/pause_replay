I've found getting a single counters value very long winded, and\n    it's not possible to get a counters explain string from the OS etc\n    ......\n\n    Win32::Perflib is good, don't get me wrong, I just feel that I can\n    improve on it, and rather than extending the existing module which\n    some people may be very happy using, I'd rather introduce another\n    version, which will give people another option."
