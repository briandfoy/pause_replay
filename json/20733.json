      "rationale" : "Historically, the former InterNIC managed (under the auspices of\n    IANA) the allocation of IP numbers to ISPs and other organizations.\n    This changed somewhat when the Regional Internet Registry system was\n    started, with the creation of three (and later, four) Regional\n    Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world, each managing the\n    allocation of IP addresses to organizations within differing\n    physical areas (see also RFC2050).\n\n    This means that there is no central whois database for IP numbers.\n\n    This module allows the user to lookup the RIR who has authority for\n    a particular IP address. After finding out the authority for an IP\n    address, it is possible to use the authority's whois server to\n    lookup the netblock owner.\n\n    The difference between this module and the Net::Whois::* modules is\n    that no network lookups takes place. All information is held within\n    a local database. The Net::Whois::* modules could benefit from using\n    this modules, as it would reduce the number of network lookups\n    needed for an IP address from a maximum of four to a maximum of one."
