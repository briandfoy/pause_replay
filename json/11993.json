      "rationale" : "[ Tim suggested the chapter 7 (Database) for this module, but SQL::\n    is associated with chapter 11 (Text, etc.) only at this point. This\n    module should *definately* be in the SQL heirarchy. Should chapter 7\n    be added to SQL:: in addition to chapter 11? ]\n\n    [ The whole Rationale has previously been submitted, so here is an\n    abstract. ]\n\n    -------- ABSTRACT -------- If you work with databases, chances are\n    you have lots of scripts with SQL statements sprinkled throughout\n    them. This situation gives rise to several problems: - Database\n    changes result in hunting down affected SQL statements. - SQL is cut\n    and pasted from script to script, allowing mutation errors. -\n    Flexibility suffers because everything is hardwired.\n\n    SQL::Snippet allows you to modularize all that SQL into one central\n    repository. Instead of complete SQL statements, the repository\n    contains \"snippets\" (i.e. little pieces) of SQL. SQL::Snippet will\n    front end these snippets, allowing your code to call for the dynamic\n    creation of complete, optimized SQL statements using straightforward\n    OO (Object Oriented) syntax.\n\n    There are two kinds of Snippets: 1) populations i.e. people,\n    places, other_objects ...\n\n    2) limits applicable to those populations i.e. gender, location,\n    other_attributes ...\n\n    Real databases are complex beasts with thousands of tables and\n    myriad relationships. SQL::Snippet scales well into the real world\n    -- by viewing your database's structure and data in an OO way,\n    intelligent modularization is possible."
