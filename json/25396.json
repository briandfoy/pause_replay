ParseRDF concisely describes the\n    purpose of the module and hopefully a new root namespace called\n    \"DMOZ\" will promote the development of more helpful DMOZ related\n    modules. From my work with a commercial database management script I\n    have been able to see a great demand for DMOZ content for custom\n    databases but in smaller, more manageable sub-sections. The users\n    requiring such content do not necessarily have the knowledge or time\n    to parse the extremely large RDF file available from dmoz.org and so\n    my module will provide the necessary functionality to cut and manage\n    this file for them.\n\n    Thankyou for considering my application."
