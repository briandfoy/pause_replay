As such, it should be in the DBIx:: namespace as opposed to\n    the DBD:: namespace.\n\n    Compared to DBD::Multiplex, DBIx::HA has a very different\n    philosophy. While DBD::Multiplex is excellent for read-write on\n    multiple servers simultaneously, DBIx::HA is geared towards\n    enterprise-level high availability, including integration with\n    mod_perl and Apache::DBI."
