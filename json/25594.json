However, it is the intention to keep the\n    integration at a level where other RDF libaries could be\n    substituted.\n\n    The namespace would also hold RDF::Scutter::Filter and\n    RDF::Scutter::Consumer, to facilitate the usage of various different\n    document types. Additional packages in these two namespaces would\n    provide actual implementations, hopefully in a decentralized manner,\n    with developers being able to easily submit e.g.\n    RDF::Scutter::Filter::JPegExif and RDF::Scutter::Consumer::OPML.\n\n    Current scutter implementations are mostly based on a wide array of\n    privately crafted scripts, all of which only partially support the\n    generally agreed upon requirements for a scutter, see\n    http://rdfweb.org/topic/ScutterSpec , e.g. support for\n    ETag/Last-Modified and robots.txt.\n\n    It is the intention with this namespace and package complex to ease\n    the task of writing a scutter substantially, hopefully leaving\n    developers to focus on the collected data instead of the collecting\n    process, and eventually leading the way towards a network of\n    independent scutters that collaborate on spidering the Semantic Web."
