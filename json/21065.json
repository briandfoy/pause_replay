      "why" : "I am planning to create newer versions of modules Tcl and Tcl::Tk\n    to make them compilable using more modern perl, make them robust\n    (currently they do crash often). This allows perl to be connected to\n    existing Tcl installation, and this has advantages to existing\n    perlTk scheme, where current stable version does not supports\n    Unicode. Currently I have working version of module that proves the\n    concept. (Also I explained my ideas at URL\n    http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=250229 but currently I\n    have working version of modules) I sent letter to author of module,\n    Malcolm Beattie, and received respond that mail server is not\n    available.\n\n    Also during following two months I am planning to create a module\n    that will provide necessary support for cross-compiling modules for\n    WinCE platform.\n\n    PS. Also I sometimes participate in discussions and sometimes bug\n    fixing in perl5-porters list.",
