There is a simple formula to describe how errors\n    combine, or in other words, propagate, in this way. This is what is\n    automated in this simple little module; error propagation.\n\n    I suppose it belongs in Statistics:: because it deals with\n    statistical data, and ErrorPropagation is what it does.\n\n    Correct me if I am wrong, but I haven't found anything on CPAN\n    which does this."
