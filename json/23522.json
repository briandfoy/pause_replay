Like the Tk::Canvas, TkZinc implements\n    items used to display graphical entities. Those items can be\n    manipulated and bindings can be associated with them to implement\n    interaction behaviours. The following features can be viewed as\n    extensions to the Tk::Canvas: - TkZinc can strongly structure the\n    items in a hierarchy with the use of group items), - TkZinc has\n    support for affine 2D transforms (i.e. translation, scaling, and\n    rotation), - TkZinc can clip sub-trees of the items hierarchy, - the\n    item set is quite more powerful including field specific items for\n    Air Traffic systems - TkZinc offers the support of openGL rendering\n    techniques such as anti-aliasing, transparency, colour gradients as\n    well as the support of an openGL oriented item triangles\n\n    TkZinc makes it easy to use some OpenGL features for 2D Human\n    Computer Interaction (HCI).\n\n    It has been freely available on www.openatc.org/zinc since Jan\n    2001."
