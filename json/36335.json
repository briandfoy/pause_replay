Dynamic subclassing based on database\n    server type enables cross-platform portability. Schema objects allow\n    you to treat each table in your database as an object, while Record\n    objects allow you to treat each row in a table as an object.\n\n    I've selected the DBIx:: namespace as this seems to be the emerging\n    standard for DBI wrappers and assistants.\n\n    This module has been on CPAN for around two years and is a required\n    dependency of several other packages.\n\n    Documentation\n    http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-SQLEngine/SQLEngine.pm\n\n    ReadMe\n    http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBIx-SQLEngine/SQLEngine/Docs/ReadMe.pod"
