The function is\n    named \"part\" because its Perl 6 equivalent carries that name (or did\n    last time I checked); a search of the p6l archives ought to turn up\n    the rationale, but basically it's because it's short for \"partition\"\n    and many other appropriate words. It is not under Perl6 because it\n    isn't designed to be a perfect emulation--just a similar function.\n\n    I think it should be listed because it is useful and (as far as I\n    can tell) unique. Listing will help people who can use the module\n    find it."
