I\n    originally went looking for a widget with this functionality several\n    months ago, however I was unable to find one. Some people on\n    c.l.p.tk suggesting mimicking the behavior of separators using two\n    frames each only on pixel in thickness. While this (sort of) worked,\n    it was somewhat messy and the two light/dark colors used to create\n    the 3D effect were unportable.\n\n    After some experimentation I found the system defaults that\n    produced the desired effects and created the Tk::Separator widget\n    which can be used to easily create both horizontal as well as\n    vertical 3D separators."
