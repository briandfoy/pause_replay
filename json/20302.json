I decided that the most logical is the Net:: since\n    it follows along side its cousin Net::iCal. The authors of Net::iCal\n    informed me that their choice of the Net:: prefix was because this\n    it is based on RFC file spec ... therefore the Net:: hierarchy is\n    the place for that.\n\n    I do not want to debate that logic - but - upon looking around CPAN\n    it seems that there is no appropriate top level for well know data\n    file formats; usually they carve out their own top level (XML; MARC;\n    etc.)\n\n    The other contender was for Data::vCard but I have decided that it\n    is preferable to follow the lead of Net::iCal. I am not stuck to any\n    name space would be happy to accept a counter proposal.\n\n    Thanks"
