      "rationale" : "XRI and XDI are OASIS standards for extended resource identifiers\n    (next-generation URIs). The XDI::SPIT (which stands for Service\n    Provider Interface Toolkit) module implements single-sign on using\n    an XRI resolver (which was uploaded recently). There are also Java\n    and PHP implementations of XDI::SPIT, which will be available soon\n    as well.\n\n    We're applying these standards towards building a distributed\n    digital identity infrastructure that respects the rights and privacy\n    of individuals. (Think Passport or Liberty Alliance, except users\n    own their data, and the data is distributed.) It's a first\n    implementation of the vision described in the Augmented Social\n    Networks whitepaper (http://asn.planetwork.net/).\n\n    A first demonstration of these technologies is happening this\n    weekend at the PlaNetwork Conference in San Francisco\n    (http://www.planetwork.net/2004conf/)."
