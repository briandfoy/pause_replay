The code can currently be found at\n    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174942 (see the\n    \"PatchIterator classes\" attachment). This code is being used in\n    Bugzilla.\n\n    I am also considering submitting UserLogin.pm, an\n    easy-to-use-and-administer set of utilities for managing users and\n    user settings as well as user sessions (typically for web stuff).\n    This code can be found at\n    http://www.masonhq.com/user/Shalom/UserLogin/Index . I have not\n    performed an exhaustive search for similar modules for this for\n    about a year, however, so I won't upload until I am sure it is still\n    unique.",
