      "rationale" : "XML::Maker has been choosen as a short and simple name for a module\n    that produces XML. The module has also a make() function.\n\n    This module was made because I didn't like a few characteristics of\n    XML::Writer, for example, XML::Writer produces output as soon as it\n    can. It also requires error-prone steps like closing tags and making\n    sure there's just one root element, which I thought weren't\n    necessary.\n\n    The main advantage of the module is that it doesn't produce output\n    until told to do so. This makes it possible for example to generate\n    XML, then remove part of it, and replace it with an error message.\n    This should make XML::Maker much more optimal than XML::Writer for\n    writing servers.\n\n    Another characteristic is that it's based on a tree of objects\n    (parent objects know about their children), which makes it possible\n    to pass a child to a function. The function will then have full\n    control over the child, but won't be able to change the parent,\n    which should add some security and make debugging somewhat easier."
