      "rationale" : "Namespace choice:\n\n    I believe that this module, and other \"wiki utility\" modules,\n    belong in Wiki:: rather than CGI::Wiki because they do not\n    necessarily involve CGI. Wiki::Gateway, for example, is not itself\n    CGI, and is intended to communicate with a variety of wiki engines\n    (including Tomcat-based & ASP-based engines), rather than just\n    CGI-based ones. Hence, one would not expect a potential user of this\n    module to look for it under \"CGI\".\n\n    In addition, the world of \"wiki\", wiki-specific software, and wiki\n    developers, is rather expansive, so I think it merits an\n    easy-to-refer to namespace on par with MIME, Apache, Jabber, VRML,\n    etc. While wiki is not a protocol, it is a \"world of its own\" and\n    there are all sorts of wiki-specific software projects, with widely\n    varying goals and functionality (i.e. beyond wiki engine CGI\n    scripts), just like there are all sorts of Jabber-related projects.\n\n    Related modules:\n\n    WWW-Wikipedia, WWW-Mediawiki-Client are similar to this project in\n    that they both include functionality for remote interaction with a\n    wiki engine. However, they are focused on the Mediawiki engine,\n    whereas the raison d'etre of Wiki::Gateway is to present ONE unified\n    API/library which handles interaction with many wiki engine types. I\n    am not aware of any other Perl module providing the functionality\n    that Wiki::Gateway seeks to provide."
