There are methods for querying the most\n    commonly-requested bits of information (battery percentage, whether\n    it's on-line or on-battery, etc.) and methods for querying other\n    bits of information.\n\n    Basically, I think it's a useful animal, and I think other people\n    will think so too.\n\n    Kit Peters"
