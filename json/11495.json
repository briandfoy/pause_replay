I didn't see any\n    other modules that provide this functionality, so I'm providing this\n    one. For a list of length N, it'll go through either the N choose K\n    subsets of size K, or the 2**N subsets of any size.\n\n    I chose the Algorithm::ChooseSubsets namespace because it has a\n    similar interface to (though provides different functionality than)\n    Algorithm::Permute, and could be used in conjunction with this to\n    iterate through all permutations of the subsets of a list."
