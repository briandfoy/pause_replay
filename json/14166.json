I used this module as an add-on for the\n    Math::Geometry::Planar package to extend it with polygon clipping\n    (aka boolean operations on polygons). GPC is quite powerful and\n    offers a reasonable performance (see\n    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/aig/staff/alan/software/ for detailed info\n    about gpc and http://home.attbi.com/~msleonov/pbcomp.html for a\n    comparison of gpc with other popular clipping software). On top of\n    that, the gpc is well contained so wrapping it (using SWIG) wasn't a\n    very though job. Enjoy ..."
