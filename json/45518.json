      "rationale" : "Why ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)? There does not currently appear\n    to be a namespace that reflects datawarehouse/datamining/ETL/OLAP\n    development and tools. DBI is not quite it because itâs more\n    database specific, whereas ETL tools could be cross-database and\n    also relate to raw and ASCII data processing independent of any\n    specific database type. ETL/Datawarehousing tools are not only used\n    to extract and load data into databases. A major part of the ETL/DW\n    process consists of data transforming, cleansing, statistics,\n    aggregation, frequency analysis, data-process distribution, etc.\n\n    Pequel is a comprehensive data processing/transform system. It\n    features a simple, user-friendly event driven scripting interface\n    that transparently generates & execs highly efficient Perl/C code.\n    The generated program can be modified (though no modification is\n    required) and executed independently of Pequel. Its scripting\n    interface is simple enough for non-programmers to use. Its\n    object-oriented base class design will allow experienced developers\n    to easily extend the Pequel language with new event (section) types,\n    macros, aggregate types, etc.\n\n    Pequel will generate Perl programs for: data transforming, data\n    cleansing, distributed data processing, statistical analysis,\n    aggregation, apache CLF log file processing, and other data\n    processes."
