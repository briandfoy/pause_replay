I think\n    it's possible to do *about* the same thing with CGI::FormBuilder as\n    CGI::ContactForm does, provided that you pass quite a few arguments\n    to it.\n\n    The characteristics of CGI::ContactForm, that I believe justifies\n    its listing, are:\n\n    - Since it only does one thing, i.e. generates web contact forms,\n    it's *extremely* easy to use, especially if you make use of the\n    style sheet, that is included in the distribution, as a starting\n    point.\n\n    - Possible failure messages goes to the recipient, so if the\n    submitter enters an invalid address, you know that it's pointless to\n    post a reply to that address.\n\n    - It produces format=flowed messages in accordance with RFC 2646.\n\n    - It generates code that validates as XHTML 1.0 Strict."
