It fetches the\n    credentials that are sent by the client and stores them in an client\n    side cookie, which is aes256 encrypted. Later logons will be made\n    using the credentials that are stored in the cookie. The client\n    won't even know, that it has to authenticate (no more plaintext\n    credentials are sent and no more annoying popups).\n\n    The module is completely independent of the underlying\n    authentication mecanism. As long you are using basic authentication\n    it will work (tested with auth_ldap and auth_pam)."
