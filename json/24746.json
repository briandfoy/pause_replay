Useful for pretty code samples in web pages.\n\n    Search::DocumentDB -- full text search engine, which uses a DBI\n    handle to store the index (currently requires Postgres, but I'll add\n    MySQL support soon). Has good support for storing metadata for\n    documents, which is handy for 'advanced search' features like\n    searching within a date range.\n\n    I've also got most of a module for handling password authentication\n    and cookie-based sessions, useful for web applications. Haven't\n    picked a suitable name for it yet though.",
