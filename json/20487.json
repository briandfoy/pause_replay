I can't see how it can\n    be related to any other module set I know of.\n\n    You are welcomed to try the OO-environment of Perlilog\n    (www.opencores.org/perlilog) which is what Eobj actually is.\n\n    I intend to upload the module as soon as I've finished stripping of\n    the docs from the Perlilog parts. (The modules themselves are quite\n    ready).\n\n    Thanks, Eli"
