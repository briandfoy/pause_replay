Will need to check\n    with Chris Josephes and Mark Hershberger before submitting to\n    discuss and deconflict.\n\n    Module for working with SSH connections - providing ability to\n    automate issuing commands on other platforms using a select\n    mechanism to allow management of multiple simultaneous connections.\n    Will need to check w/ Dave Rolsky and Ivan Kohler before submitting\n    to discuss and deconflict. This code might fit within their existing\n    modules, but they may want to keep it partitioned separately.\n\n    Who knows - I may just wind up providing input to other authors'\n    code, but I've been playing with Perl long enough that I figure I\n    better start trying to get some of my code out to a wider audience\n    than just my company...",
