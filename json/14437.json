      "rationale" : "This module implements the two-membered evolution strategy.\n    Derivatives of the objective function are not required. Constraints\n    can be incorporated. It derives from the 'EVOL' Fortran routine of\n    Schwefel which uses Rechenberg's step- size adjustment strategy.\n    This two-membered evolution strategy is a random strategy, and as\n    such is particularly robust and will cope well with large numbers of\n    variables, or rugged objective funtions. Evol.pm works either\n    automatically with an objective function to be minimised, or\n    interactively with a (suitably patient) human who at each step will\n    choose the better of two (or several) possibilities. A subroutine is\n    supplied allowing the evolution of numeric parameters in a text\n    file. The module Math::Amoeba.pm by John A.R. Williams offers the\n    Simplex strategy of Nelder and Mead; it is a deterministic strategy\n    which can offer fast convergence on smaller problems with smooth\n    objective functions. It doesn't offer an interactive approach."
