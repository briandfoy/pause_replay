If the data can be represented\n    by a row-column matrix, where for each data entry (row) (a) there\n    are one or more fields containing numerical or string values\n    (columns) and (b) at least one of those fields can be used as an\n    index to uniquely identify each entry, then the data structure is\n    suitable for manipulation by Data::Presenter. In Perl terms, if the\n    data can be represented by a hash of arrays, where each element of\n    each array is a number or a string, it is suitable for manipulation\n    by Data::Presenter.\n\n    Under the name ''DataPresenter'', Data::Presenter has been used by\n    the author for more than a year in a production environment and has\n    been the subject of several presentations to Perl Seminar New York.\n    Since the module's code is maturing, now is an appropriate moment to\n    share it with the larger Perl community."
