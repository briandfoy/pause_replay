I doubt anyone else would want to use the\n    Tk::Taxis namespace, as it's quite esoteric.\n\n    The approach is to use an arena (Tk::Canvas) in which configurable\n    critter objects (Tk::Photo) can move according to the rules of\n    biological taxis, the movement that e.g. bacteria use to swim up a\n    concentration gradient of food. A sample script of woodlice in a\n    light/dark choice chamber is included.\n\n    Although this module probably has a limited audience, I hope it may\n    be of use to a few biologists and teachers out there."
