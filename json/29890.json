Later on I would most likely extend\n    this module some. I'm thinking about naming the module PhoA::Filer,\n    is that a good name?\n\n    (I've already written the base module in php, and have started\n    converting this to perl. The reason for me starting in perl, was\n    that I had a web server where I wanted to view the contents of the\n    PhoA-album file. )\n\n    I'm also a main developer of a wiki, namely WikkiTikkiTavi at\n    http://tavi.sourceforge.net/, and I'm thinking about releasing perl\n    modules related to this php-project. Haven't decided yet if and how\n    to do some maintainance on the databases involved...\n\n    I haven't been very active in the perl community lately, but I was\n    a lurker for quite some years when I was a student at the\n    university. I consider my perl knowledge to be somewhat above\n    normal, albeit it's been a while since I programmed in perl. And I\n    would of course respect any guidelines given.",
