I wasn't able to find an existing type\n    of module that was similar.\n\n    What the module does:\n\n    Sets up framework for types of tests (Database,HTTP\n    Service,Ping,etc), and handlers for test responses (E-mail, print to\n    screen,log) to be reused\n\n    Defines specific tests based on Config::General style config file\n\n    Allows for post processing of test results regardless of handler\n    type for a specific test. This could allow for logging, or storing\n    up results of tests to be handled and consolidated after all tests\n    have occurred.\n\n    This module allows for a simple, and easily configurable, and\n    extensible framework for monitoring availability of any important\n    services or resources to your organization."
