Lite is chosen over Light because\n    Lite is a common way of naming modules with fewer features.\n\n    The rationale for registaring the module is that HTTP::Lite appears\n    to have a bit of a userbase with over 175 distinct instances of\n    HTTP::Lite's test.pl connecting to the test-data on my webserver\n    since late February. As there are now numerous users of this module,\n    who have used it instead of LWP because it is \"Lightweight\" and more\n    appropriate for embedded uses. It also requires a single file for\n    installation."
