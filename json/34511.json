      "rationale" : "Oracle's SQL*Loader is a commonly used utility to bulkload data. It\n    offers a considerable number of options, and requires knowledge of\n    its control file specific syntax to use. The Oracle::SQLLoader\n    module provides an object interface to the most commonly used\n    options. It also parses output and error logs and provides useful\n    accessors to the summarized load status information and errors.\n\n    One other CPAN module exists for this utility, Oracle::Loader. My\n    module is very different from Oracle::Loader, both in philosphy and\n    implementation. My goal is to minimize the amount of information a\n    user needs to know about SQL*Loader or PL/SQL to be productive with\n    the utility. This dwimmery is largely accomplished by generating\n    sane values for defaults, while still allowing the user to override\n    these at will. Where necessary, my module sacrifices a little bit of\n    (rarely-used) functionality for the sake of API clarity and\n    ease-of-use.\n\n    This module should be included in the module list because it is\n    useful and time-saving. It lets users accomplish common load tasks\n    without knowing obscure syntax or option specifics; they can focus\n    on their data, not the utility."
