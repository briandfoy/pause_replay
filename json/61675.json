Besides, multiple concrete quasiquoting filters can be\n    chained and composed within a single Perl file.\n\n    Special efforts have been made to ensure line numbers for the\n    resulting Perl source won't be corrupted and support for precise\n    file position information is also provided to user's DSL compilers\n    as well.\n\n    I now have a working prototype ready to upload to PAUSE. But I'd\n    like to seek opionions about this module before uploading here ;)"
