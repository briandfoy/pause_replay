This permits charts to be\n    created solely using SQL syntax, eg,\n\n    $sth = $dbh->prepare( \"SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE col1=? AND\n    col2<? RETURNING LINEGRAPH(col1, col2) WHERE WIDTH=400 AND\n    HEIGHT=400 AND LOGO='gowilogo.png' AND TITLE='Sample Linegraph' AND\n    SHAPE='fillcircle' AND COLOR='red'\"); $sth->execute;\n    $row=$sth->fetchrow_arrayref;\n\n    This approach expands on the concepts behind DBD::Chart to provide\n    a simpler interface.\n\n    Refer to www.presicient.com/dbixchart for details."
