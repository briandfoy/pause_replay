I noticed that I could use\n\n    Convert::ToImage\n\n    but this is not really as descriptive as\n\n    Text::Convert::ToImage\n\n    If the name above is suitable do I also need to register\n\n    Text::Convert\n\n    as a seperate registration because it has not been registered yet\n    or will it automatically be registered.\n\n    Regards, Harry"
