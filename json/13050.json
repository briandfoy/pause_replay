Since Nilson S. F. Junior (Win32::MCI::Basic)\n    said: \"in the future, someone else might even code a complete\n    interface to the MCI API without problems related to namespace\" I\n    thougt Win32::MCI::CD could be a nice name. Win32::MCI::CD is (going\n    te be a) module that is a complete interface to the MCI API and lets\n    you play and control audio cd's, you can even control more cd\n    players at the same time. No more complicated MCI strings. Hence the\n    name."
