Unfortunately, the WWW package was already indexed, so\n    someone will probably want to free up the WWW namespace I\n    transiently, misguidedly occupied. The deletion should go through by\n    Friday.\n\n    WebService::Nextbus also occupies WebService::Nextbus::Agency and\n    WebService::Nextbus::Agency::SFMUNI. In the future, I expect it\n    other subclasses of Agency to be built, representing other specific\n    agencies. Right now, SFMUNI is the only one and is prototypical."
