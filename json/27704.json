      "why" : "I would like to contribute a Perl module called Perl Template.\n    Parallel to the idea of JSP and PHP, Perl Template was designed to\n    separate data from presentation. The data is encapsulated in Perl\n    objects, like Java Beans. The presentation is represented by Perl\n    template files, like JSP files. Perl Template consists of a\n    templating language that is a set of XML tags and a rendering engine\n    that parses templates and generates output using specified Perl\n    objects. Perl Template is suitable for any environment where dynamic\n    content needs to be produced based on Perl objects. For instance, it\n    can be used for developing CGI programs, where Perl developers can\n    concentrate on writing business logics and data retrieval, while\n    content developers can focus on producing presentation layout.\n\n    Compare to Andy WardlyÂ’s Template Toolkit, Perl Template is much\n    more compact and lighter.",
