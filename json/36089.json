Graph::* is not a good\n    namespace because it implies something related to generating or\n    processing graphics.\n\n    I'm unsure of the technical theory terminology used to properly\n    describe this algorithm. \"ScheduledPath\" seems appropriate, since it\n    deals with paths in a directed graph.\n\n    There is no DirectedGraph::* namespace, and\n    Algorithm::DirectedGraph::Scheduled is too long."
