But the\n    main purpose of it is not to do a race with XML::Simple, is just a\n    tool that integrates everything that is needed to load and create\n    XML data, including parsers for different approaches, like wild XML\n    and HTML, and other resources to generated XML files and manipulate\n    or walk through the XML tree. But everything without the user need\n    to really know all the XML roles, it just need to know Perl."
