This will do\n    factoring not to solve radicals but to simplify them. For example,\n    if I have 2 times radical 108, 108 is not a perfect square. It would\n    be about 20.8 if you run it in a calculator. To simplify it you take\n    out perfect square, in this case the greatest factor that is a\n    perfect square is 36 x 3 = 108. 2 times radical 36 times radical 3.\n    Square root of 36 is 6, 2 times 6 is 12, final simplified answer is\n    12 radical 3. I think a modules like this would be important for\n    simplifying radicals for equations and so on."
