Mail::GnuPG modified user\n    supplied data instead of returning modified data (here\n    encrypted/signed MIME::Entity objects), which is bad in many\n    situations. I submitted patches to Mail::GnuPG which added features\n    or fixed bugs, but always disliked its API. Mainly both modules do\n    the same work, but Mail::GPG has more features (in the meantime) and\n    the cleaner (maybe a matter of taste; let's say: at least a\n    different) interface. So I think it's not too bad for the user\n    having the choice between both modules."
