Test::More::Hooks provides\n    before/after hooks for Test::More::subtest.\n\n    I am generally satisfied that the function of Test::More is a\n    simple, but I'm annoyed that the function is not enough. That's the\n    setup / teardown process. However, since I don't want to use the\n    test framework hard to structured like Test::Class, I decided to add\n    functionality to Test::More.\n\n    Test::More::Hooks has some pros. * It is very simple and intuitive.\n    * It has no dependency except core modules. * You can write slim\n    test code when using setup/teardown process. * You will release from\n    t/Util.pm files when you want to use before/after hooks."
