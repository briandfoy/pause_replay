      "why" : "I am a CS graduate student at the University of Minnesota Duluth,\n    working on perl modules to compute the semantic relatedness of word\n    senses using an electronic dictionary called WordNet. This work is a\n    pert of my Master's thesis, however I would like to distribute all\n    the modules I write. Most of the modules are already widely used by\n    a great number of people in their research work and I have seen\n    papers based on work that use the modules. Putting them up on CPAN\n    would make them more accessible to everyone.\n\n    Thanks.\n\n    -- Sid.",
