I'd like the package and share the modules as a base\n    for a generic shopping cart system.\n\n    The main focus of the kit is a set of modules to do basic cart i/o\n    from any application, web or otherwise, with a set of AxKit Taglibs\n    on top.\n\n    Ideally, I would like to go for the Commerce namespace to keep the\n    module/class names shorter, Commerce::Cart::Item vs.\n    Business::Commerce::Cart::Item, but I can see that\n    Business::Commerce would also be a good place for all things\n    eCommerce related.\n\n    The iNcom space seems to be soley based on Apache. My goal is to\n    abstract everything away from any assumption on where the commerce\n    will take place; over the web via html, via SOAP, via console\n    application, via Tk, etc.\n\n    -=Chris"
