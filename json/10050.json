It is in\n    development, and will soon be used in at least one script. :-)\n\n    Finding the proper name is the main problem. After browsing CPAN a\n    little, I have come up with several plausible names: - Log::Procmail\n    - Mail::Procmail::Log - Mail::ProcmailLog - Logfile::Procmail\n\n    But, each name comes with a different problem:\n\n    - The Log:: directory looks like it's holding logging tools (like\n    Log::Agent) and not log parsing tools.\n\n    - Mail::Procmail is a procmail-like tool, while this module reads\n    logs from the original procmail. They are not related, but the name\n    similarity might confuse potential users. And Mail::Procmail::Log is\n    quite long for such a small module.\n\n    - Mail::ProcmailLog doesn't sound that good. Personal taste.\n\n    - Logfile::Procmail should inherit from Logfile::Base, as most of\n    the other Logfile:: modules do, which isn't the case for this\n    module.\n\n    I suppose then that the choice is really between\n    Mail::Procmail::Log and Log::Procmail.\n\n    Thanks for your help in finding the right name for this little\n    tool."
