That system has been created at the\n    beginning of 2001 and continues to extend every blessed day, owing\n    to desire that guide us! We are witness on great number of special\n    Web languages, but all of us, that love Perl can not reconcile with\n    \"hardness\" of Perl scripts writing for the Web! Please do not\n    understand us wrongly! We talking about trivial problems in every\n    our Perl project, we talking about for ways and means that\n    programmer commonly use to provide yourself with security and high\n    performance. Main features of WebTools are:\n\n    - Embedded Perl into HTML files (default) - Buffered/Non buffered\n    output - Easy read of input forms and cookies using global perl\n    variables - Flat database support - MySQL/MS Access support -\n    Sessions support (via DB/Flat files) - Easy user support (all DB\n    engines supported by webtools) - Cookies support - Attached\n    variables - Html/SQL templates (perl\n    functions/INLINE/INPERL/INCLUDE) - Mail functions (sendmail or\n    build-in mail client - pure perl) - Upload/download via Perl scripts\n    - DES III encription/decription in MIME style - Security settings\n    for your scripts - Php subset of functions in perl variant\n\n    Thanks"
