It's the implementation of the PDU encode/decode\n    standard as defined by the ETSI.\n\n    Nicely explained here: http://www.dreamfabric.com/sms/\n\n    Other similar modules didn't have all the PDU types generation and\n    parsing that I needed. GSM::SMS::PDU is the most complete yet\n    missing SMSDeliver encoding (has just decoding) and was otherwise\n    not maintained since 2004 just like other modules of the same\n    author.\n\n    GSM::PDU is implemented from scratch - low level SMS_DELIVER\n    generation is already done and it generates correct PDU data -\n    higher level that doesn't expect from you to know all the details is\n    being finished.\n\n    Possible addition is a way to convert the widely used (cheap and\n    free as it uses regular Internet IP) SMPP protocol (implemented via\n    Net::SMPP) into PDU format - and maybe even the other way around -\n    but will wait for feedback from people."
