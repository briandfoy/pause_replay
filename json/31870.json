Also, the image information is frequently encoded in a\n    unique fashion. There are many medical image formats, each\n    different, each requiring a unique decoder.\n\n    I already have a module currently published at SourceForge as\n    DICOM.pm, it is the first (and to date only) Perl module for the\n    Dicom med image format, the most frequently used format. It's been\n    out for three years. I plan to re-package this as Image::Med::DICOM.\n    I also have Med::Image::Analyze for the Analyze file format,\n    probably the second most commonly used format. I plan to add four or\n    five more formats as Image::Med::XXXX.\n\n    Thanks\n\n    Andy Crabb andy@idoimaging.com"
