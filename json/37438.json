I think a root\n    name such as 'Mobile' may be a good choice to keep all Mobile &\n    Wireless modules together, especially since one can expect increase\n    in the number of these modules being developed from now on.\n\n    == The (not so) similar class HTTP::MobileAgent ==: It's\n    description is similar, but it's functionality is very limited (and\n    basically useless) compared to the class I've already developed for\n    PHP5 and want to port to Perl. These are the 2 URL's to the PHP\n    version: http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/2000.html\n    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobileuseragent/ The name choice of\n    HTTP::MobileAgent isn't perfect seeing that user-agent parsing\n    doesn't necessarily have to take place in HTTP apps (a real example\n    is a cron job that parses useragents in log files/tables looking).\n\n    == Alternative root space ideas ==: I've thought about using these\n    root namespaces which exist but none are perfect: 1. GSM: this is a\n    protocol. Mobile phones don't necessarily use GSM, especially the\n    newer generations. 2. HTTP: useragent parsing hasn't got much or\n    anything to do with the HTTP protocol. 3. Net: useragent parsing\n    hasn't got much or anything to do with the networking.\n\n    I've got more useful mobile & wireless classes that I may submit in\n    the future but I must first decide if I want to opensource them. If\n    I do, I'll need a good root namespace choice for them too."
