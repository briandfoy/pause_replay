(Note that Config::Cfe is only inspired from\n    cfengine, it is not a direct replacement, it has evolved from a need\n    to automate remote configuration of unix hosts.)\n\n    And after an earlier discussion on the modules-list I added Config\n    as prefix, after all, it is designed to edit configure files and\n    other similar types of files. (Although there is nothing that\n    restricts it to just config files. :-)\n\n    It has been used for a year or more in a production environment for\n    configuring servers and clients without any major changes so it\n    should be stable by now.\n\n    So I hope I could help other people, especially admins, by\n    releasing the code.\n\n    There is also an executable script included, update-cfe, which uses\n    Config::Cfe to edit text files in shell scripts."
