True multi-level\n    hash/array support (unlike MLDBM and DWH_File, which are faked),\n    hybrid OO and tie interface, multi-platform FTPable files (unlike\n    BerkeleyDB), and quite fast.\n\n    Most of the other DBMs on CPAN are in the top-level namespace, with\n    class names suffixed with \"_File\" (DB_File, SDBM_FIle, etc.). I'm\n    sure this isn't desired for new modules like mine, but I also see\n    the \"DBM::\" namespace in the list, with one module already under it\n    (DBass). This seems like a better choice for Deep.\n\n    The actual name of the project is \"DeepDB\", but I dropped the \"DB\"\n    from the name because my proposed prefix \"DBM::\" contains that.\n    \"DBM::Deep\" is my favorite choice, but I am completely open to\n    suggestions."
