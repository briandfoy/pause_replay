The first\n    time it is called for a particular file name it will load the file\n    as normal using IO::File. The entire contents of the file will then\n    be stored in the supplied cache object, such that later loads do not\n    have to read from disk. One situation in which this can be useful is\n    to cache files in memory across all processes in a mod_perl server.\n    The name IO::File::Cached was chosen because it provides a drop in\n    replacement for any (read-only) usage of the IO::File module."
