      "rationale" : "App::Info is an abstract base class designed to provide a\n    generalized interface for subclasses that provide metadata about\n    software packages installed on a system. The idea is that these\n    classes can be used in Perl application installers in order to\n    determine whether software dependencies have been fulfilled, and to\n    get necessary metadata about those software packages.\n\n    App::Info seems a good namespace choice to me, as the goal of this\n    module is to provide a uniform interface for providing, well,\n    information about applications. It's also designed to grow, so that\n    anyone can contribute subclasses in the App::Info namespace\n    (preferably in a subcategory, e.g., App::Info::Lib or\n    App::Info::RDBMS). And since there are many, many applications for\n    which people might want data, the number of packages in the\n    namespace could become extensive. Registering the namespace will\n    help people to think about App::Info as addressing a particular\n    problem space, and will discourage them from uploading unrelated\n    stuff while, at the same time, encouraging them to contribute new\n    subclasses to it.\n\n    Thanks!"
