The existing\n    Device::SerialPort module contains some similar functionality, but\n    differs in some low-level details necessary for reliable\n    commincation with these particular devices. While it likely that you\n    can achieve proper communication with the SerialPort module, this\n    module provides a much more straightforward approach, and is\n    therefore much less complex."
