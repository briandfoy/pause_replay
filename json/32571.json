The difference is, you specify a priority level when\n    enqueuing items in the priority queue. Items with a higher priority\n    (lower number) will come off the queue before items with lower\n    priorities. This can be used to prioritize the order in which items\n    are processed by threads. Within the same priority level items are\n    returned in the same order they were enqueued in.",
