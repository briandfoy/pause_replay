      "rationale" : "The short story: the only other module that does HTML syntax\n    highlighting is HTML::SyntaxHighlighter, but does not fit our needs,\n    hence this module.\n\n    The long story: The group \"Les Mongueurs de Perl\" is currently\n    writing articles (about Perl of course) in the French edition of\n    Linux Magazine. We then publish them online the following month. You\n    can check our web site <http://articles.mongueurs.net/> (but\n    everything is in French, sorry).\n\n    Philippe \"BooK\" Bruhat recently programmed a Pod::POM extension in\n    order to add syntax highlighting for Perl code in the articles. You\n    can check the result for example in one of his articles on LWP\n    <http://articles.mongueurs.net/magazines/linuxmag56.html>.\n\n    We then wanted to add syntax highlighting for other\n    languages/formats. We tested HTML::SyntaxHighlighter, by Alex\n    Bowley, but it has the default to reformat and reindent all the HTML\n    code, which is really not desired. That's why I quickly coded an\n    HTML syntax highlighter which does not modify the indentation of the\n    code. The name was chosen to follow Syntax::Highlight::Perl, and\n    because it seemed more natural."
