This is more easily explained by way of example:\n\n    Let's say we want to have user information about a person in a\n    hash. We can have rules assigned to each hash key in order to derive\n    its data from other entries. The last name could be derived from the\n    SSN, if available.\n\n    With this module, the user can specify rules such as those: To\n    derive the last name from the SSN, execute a piece of code. This\n    would be writen as\n\n    my $hf = new Hash::Filler; $hf->add('LastName', sub { ... }, [\n    'SSN' ]);\n\n    Later, the user can add the available data to the hash ($hash{SSN}\n    = $ssn) and call $hf->fill(\\%hash) to fill the rest based on what's\n    known."
