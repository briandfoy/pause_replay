      "rationale" : "Config::Natural is a module created for parsing configuration files\n    with a simple and easily readable syntax and present the result as a\n    Perl object. The OO interface proposes a param() method as CGI.pm\n    and HTML::Template objects.\n\n    Why creating Yet Another Configuration Module? Simply because I\n    began to write this module three years ago, before Config::Simple,\n    Config::General or any other configuration module were published on\n    CPAN (AFAIK. I may be wrong, of course :-) At this time it was still\n    named Data::Config, but after asking for advice on module-authors, I\n    renamed it to Config::Natural.\n\n    Aside reading \"key=value\"-type configuration files, Config::Natural\n    also offers features that seem to be unavailable in others modules,\n    like nested lists or the possibility to change the symbols of the\n    syntax, in order to allow the user to adapt it to its own needs. I\n    think it's interesting for the user because he or she is not bound\n    to the choices I made concerning the syntax and has a degree of\n    freedom to adapt Config::Natural to its own config syntax.\n\n    I am unable to evaluate the current popularity of this module but I\n    have implemented some features upon users requests and have also\n    provided support to a few others, so I guess I'm not the only guy to\n    use it :-)\n\n    Thanks for reading"
