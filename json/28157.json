Many other templating systems, such as\n    Text::Templar, Text::Template, Template Toolkit, etc., are complex\n    and slow. PORE is a very light, very fast and does not require any\n    other Perl modules. PORE uses byacc and therefore is easy to extend\n    and maintain.\n\n    Parallel to the idea of JSP and PHP, PORE was designed to separate\n    data from presentation. The data is encapsulated in PORE objects,\n    like Java Beans. The presentation is represented by PORE template\n    files, like JSP files. PORE consists of a templating language that\n    is a set of XML tags and a rendering engine that parses templates\n    and generates output using specified Perl objects. PORE is suitable\n    for any environment where dynamic content needs to be produced based\n    on Perl objects."
