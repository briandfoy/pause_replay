      "rationale" : "NAMESPACE\n\n    Initially I thought Wx::CGI, because it provides a CGI.pm-like\n    interface to wxPerl, but that was considered confusing (people might\n    think it was a web programming module). I considered Wx::Simple, but\n    it's not really that simple (c.f. LWP::Simple, XML::Simple).\n    Considered Wx::Abstract, but it's not abstract (c.f. DBI). Someone\n    mentioned Wx::Thunk::CGI, but I think \"thunk\" is a little obscure\n    and the module name still contains CGI. Someone mentioned\n    Wx::WidgetMaker; there was an objection that \"widget\" isn't really a\n    wxwindows term, but I think it's generic/common enough. \"Maker\" has\n    some precedence in other CPAN modules.\n\n    UNIQUENESS OF APPROACH\n\n    There are currently no wxPerl-related modules other than Wx.pm.\n\n    WHY IT SHOULD BE LISTED\n\n    Using Wx.pm is somewhat low-level, as it is a thin wrapper for the\n    C++ library; Wx::WidgetMaker provides a higher level interface. It\n    also tries to mirror the CGI.pm API, so it should be familiar to CGI\n    developers."
