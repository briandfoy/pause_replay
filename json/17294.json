On a practical level, they make it easy to\n    keep the search engine in RAM (no disk or DB access except to\n    retrieve the actual results), and they allow for sophisticated 'find\n    similar' searches on one or more existing results. The module itself\n    will be simple (to accompany a Perl.com tutorial), but allow for\n    subclassing to enable sophisticated parsing, term weighting, etc."
