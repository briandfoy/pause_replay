As far as I can tell\n    the only NN modules in native perl - AI-neuralnet-mesh &\n    AI-neuralnet-backprop modules written by Josiah Bryan - aren't being\n    maintained anymore. AI-neuralnet-simple is purely backprop, and much\n    simpler than either Josiahs or mine.\n\n    My module comes with feedforward & backprop plugins, but is\n    designed to allow easy development of other types of network as\n    plugins, rather than having to rewrite existing code. Its purely\n    written in perl, so its slow as neural net packages go, but pretty\n    simple to understand and modify. I intend to write additional\n    plugins for gamma networks in the future, as well as a cli frontend\n    & a tk frontend."
