Companies\n    can also use the resulting pictures to visualize the project\n    hierarchy and embed them into their documentation.\n\n    The users no longer need to drag a mouse on the screen so as to\n    draw figures themselves or provide any specs other than the source\n    code of their own libraries that they want to depict. This module\n    does all the jobs for them! :)\n\n    You know, I was really impressed by the outputs of UML::Sequence,\n    so I decided to find something to (automatically) get pretty class\n    diagrams too. The images from Autodia's Graphviz backend didn't\n    quite fit my needs when I was making some slides for my\n    presentations."
