The basic framework\n    provides document parsing, caching, complex template variables and\n    functions, and support for user defined tags using XML namespace\n    conventions. This project is sort of like Template Toolkit in XML\n    spefically for making web sites (in fact, some of the design is\n    based on tt2's). As far as I know, there are no Perl modules that\n    provide exactly what this set of modules provide, at least not to\n    the extent that this does. Note, this is not like AxKit, which aims\n    to be an XML conversion application. XML::Template is, instead, a\n    fully XML template framework."
