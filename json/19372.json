I will be\n    releasing the code soon to the pma list, but I thought it was a good\n    idea to post it on CPAN as well.\n\n    I'm also working on another module that aggregates a number of\n    subroutines I have developed over time to analyze ns2 simulation\n    trace files. But that would not be ready before end of April.",
