      "rationale" : "List::Compare is a simple, object-oriented implementation of\n    standard Perl code (perlfaq4, Perl Cookbook Chap. 12) for the\n    comparison of lists. While the code to compare two lists with\n    respect to intersection, union, subset status, etc. is well-known, I\n    could find no object-oriented implementation of the code available\n    on CPAN. As I have found this useful in my day job as well as in\n    preparing an introductory level course in Perl, I would like to make\n    it available to the Perl community at large. Similarly named modules\n    and/or modules with similarly named methods exist on CPAN but are\n    aimed at other tasks. Array::Compare, for example, focuses more on\n    evaluating the sameness/difference of two arrays judged by various\n    criteria and does not focus on intersection, union, etc. Set::Scalar\n    compares sets for the aforementioned properties but returns strings\n    rather than lists. These modules have very sophisticated features,\n    but they don't solve the precise problem which List::Compare does.\n    Latest version is available at\n    http://www.concentric.net/~Jkeen/list/ . Thank you very much."
