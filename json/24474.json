The name conforms with 00modlist.long.txt where it\n    says \"Always try to use two or more whole words\". Also included are\n    routines for converting a Hadamard to a Walsh transform and vice\n    versa, for calculating the Logical Convolution of two lists, or the\n    Logical Autocorrelation of a list, and for calculating the Walsh\n    Power Spectrum - in short, almost everything you ever wanted to do\n    with a Walsh Transform."
