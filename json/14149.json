I\n    would like to start off with the current example Perl Guide I have\n    been working on and expand itto real examples - more than taking\n    another book approach, but allowing a culmination of Perl examples\n    with which to review and practice key ideas. Each lesson section\n    will point to and list specific areas and examples on both the\n    Internet as well as book sources. There are many sites on the\n    Internet who have already addressed this idea to one degree ot\n    another - however that now becomes the issue - there are many sites\n    that address the issue to one degree or another -- but no definitive\n    direction or goal. I feel strongly that Tutorial:: would help\n    resolve and add direction to some of these long standing issues."
