I will eventually like\n    to make it mimic all of PHP's builtin array functions, but for\n    starters it has some good ones. Having programmed in Perl and PHP, I\n    learned how useful it was having PHP's builtin funtions and I\n    thought I would try to give the same functionality to Perl. I have\n    kept the names of the functions and how you pass parameters the same\n    so seasoned PHP programmers will feel right at home."
