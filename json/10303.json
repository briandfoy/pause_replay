Subclasses provides access to the USNO-A2\n    and Guide Star Catalogues hosted online at the ESO/ECF-ST archive\n    site, it also provides read/write access to ARK CLUSTER format\n    catalogue files.\n\n    Due to it generic and extensible nature it is easily subclassed to\n    provide access to other catalogue sources, for instance access to\n    the Hipparchos and Tycho-2 catalogues could be easily added.\n    Additonally the Catalog class itself is fairly vital for moving\n    information about a stellar object around inside an OO perl program.\n\n    The module is related to my own Astro::DSS and Astro::ADS modules\n    which also give access to online astronomical databases. Neither of\n    these are \"catalogues\" as such however, the Deep Sky Survey is just\n    that, an imaging survey and the ADS is a publications archive, hence\n    the new namespace.\n\n    The module has already been released on Freshmeat and amougst the\n    astronomical community interested in such things and has proved\n    popular."
