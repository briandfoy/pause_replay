By now they are called\n    Opis::GetSet::HASH and Opis::GetSet::GLOB. But I want to rename them\n    to something like Class::HASH. If used as \"use Class::HASH qw/m1 m2\n    m3/;\" they generate the functions m1, m2, m3 in the calling package.\n    Class::HASH can be used if the object is represented as a HASH\n    reference, Class::GLOB if it is a GLOB ref.\n\n    The 3rd module is a template processor.",
