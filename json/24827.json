      "why" : "I've put together a Captcha module (http://www.captcha.net for\n    explaination - not my site) and wish to distribute it on CPAN.\n    Captcha's purpose are to verify the human element in a transaction.\n    The module I've put together currently achieves this through use of\n    distored text in an image and an md5sum of the text it contains. The\n    user then has to submit back the md5sum and the text the image\n    contains. That is then compared to itself, and then to a database to\n    make sure it was one that you actually handed out, and returns a\n    result code to the user of the module.\n\n    I plan on releasing this as Authen::Captcha, unless I can find a\n    better home for it. It's currently complete, tested on 3 platforms,\n    documented, and ready for a make dist.\n\n    I also have a few other modules I've created over the years that I\n    have personally relied on, and I hope to clean them up and possibly\n    add them as well.",
