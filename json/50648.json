      "rationale" : "The PDF::Table Module by Daemmon Hughes is abandoned. He is not\n    answering my e-mails (maybe he changed his job). I am willing to\n    develop further the module and release new version but i don`t have\n    rights to upload into his namespace. I fixed the reported bugs and\n    some additional that found into the code itself. I made some\n    optimization and added new functionality. Currently I am developing\n    user defined table header and spanning them to new pages created by\n    the module. I would appreciate if i you give me write permissions to\n    PDF::Table namespace instead of creating this one but if you approve\n    it i will develop it further. With kind Regards D.Kamenov"
