The daemon\n    gathers input from the station, produces comma seperated files\n    containing observations for each minute of the day, the daily\n    extreme values, and the most current readings available. It also can\n    update the Weather Underground at user configurable intervals, and\n    will store the daily extremes in a database (mysql by default).",
