So I wrote a script which starts the\n    process and than I had the problem how I can capture the performance\n    via perl. I found Win32-PerfMon, but it was to complicated to me,\n    therefore I wrote this module using the XS file of Win32-PerfMon.\n    Thank you Glen Small.\n\n    At this time I use a selfmade C-program in my office to get varios\n    performance data of a spezific process, but I will rewrite my script\n    soon to use the new module."
