Have not been able to contact\n    original author, so I figured I would fork it and move on.\n\n    Also, I have a PAUSE account under James Olin Oden, but I cannot\n    seem to get anyone to respond to my requests to change my password.\n    I think this is probably because I had set my email to a server that\n    no longer exists. Anyway, a new account seems to be the most\n    expedient method for dealing with this.\n\n    Cheers...james",
