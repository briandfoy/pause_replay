      "rationale" : "The TIBCO TIB/Rendezvous library ships as \"libtibrv.so\" and links\n    as \"-ltibrv\", and all functions are prefixed with \"tibrv\" (such as\n    \"tibrv_Open( )\"). Thus, \"Tib::Rv\" in Perl will be analogous to\n    \"tibrv\" in C. Similarly for other, more advanced libraries that ship\n    with TIB/Rendezvous, like tibrvft and tibrvcm. They will all map\n    similarly -- Tib::Rvft, Tib::Rvcm.\n\n    From a product standpoint, TIBCO abbreviates all their products\n    with the \"TIB/\" prefix -- eg, TIB/Rendezvous, TIB/Hawk, and so on,\n    so creating a top-level \"Tib\" namespace is consistent with that. I\n    will possibly be creating a Tib::Hawk module in the future, and I'd\n    like to see it all bundled under \"Tib::\".\n\n    \"TIB\" is TIBCO's abbreviation for \"The Information Bus\", and so all\n    users of TIBCO products will find a \"Tib::\" namespace to be natural\n    and reasonable.\n\n    Ultimately, I'd like to end up using:\n\n    Tib::Rv Tib::Rvft Tib::Rvcm Tib::Rvcmq Tib::Rvsd Tib::Hawk\n\n    ... and a Bundle::Tib"
