[...] Partial derivatives\n    of logarithms, exponentiations, and arithmetic terms (*,/,+,- and\n    unary minus as well as variables and constants) work rather well\n    albeit slowly). Simplification of algebraic terms is severely\n    limited at this time. [...]\n\n    I think the module should be on the list because I have yet to find\n    a related module in there. I plan to continue developing the module\n    and upgrade its status from \"pre-alpha\" to \"Released\" at some point.\n    In the meantime, I'd love to get some feedback from users and\n    hackers alike which being included in the module list would help\n    with."
