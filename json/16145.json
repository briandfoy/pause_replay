Unlike a natural starfish, this starfish is\n    interested in pearls and does not normally touch most of the\n    surrounding meat.\n\n    Uniqueness of approach: There are similar modules. The idea is\n    similar to php: Embed Perl code inside the text, execute it is some\n    way, so that the output is interleaved with the text. This approach\n    is unique because it is a small Perl module (not large, and no\n    binaries), it works with any kind of textual file (text, programs,\n    HTML, Makefiles), and the most important feature is that by default\n    it updates the source file by updating the code outputs and the code\n    remains in the file."
