All PDF generating packages I found on CPAN provide\n    basic elements to create PDF files, lacking of components of a\n    higher level of abstraction (tables, layout managers, advanced text\n    formatting), so I actually decided to call my package PDF::Layout.\n    But this sounds rather like the ultimate collection of layout\n    classes, covering all kinds of subjects, which is not what\n    PDF::PlainLayout was intended to do. PDF::Layout::Lite requires the\n    PDF::Layout name space already to exist, which is also not the case."
