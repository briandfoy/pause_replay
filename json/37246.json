The text may be plain text, or it may\n    be part of speech of tagged with the Brill Tagger. This is an\n    important foundation for automated natural language understanding,\n    since it is hard to understand what a sentence or document means\n    without knowing what the individual words mean.\n\n    The module uses the WordNet::Similarity module, which computes the\n    semantic relatedness between concepts (based on information found in\n    WordNet). Our disambiguation algorithm assigns the sense to a word\n    that is most related to the senses of its neighbors (based on the\n    WordNet::Similarity computations).\n\n    The module is also dependent on WordNet::QueryData, which is used\n    to access WordNet, which is a free lexical database distributed by\n    Princeton University.\n\n    The name WordNet::SenseRelate makes the relationship to WordNet and\n    the other WordNet:: modules clear. Disambiguation is based on\n    finding the most related sense, hence SenseRelate."
