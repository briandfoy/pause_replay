Please note that there is not\n    inheritance involved, just one module uses the other.\n\n    I just made up the word ShareSimple, wanting to stress that we are\n    aiming for simplicity.\n\n    As for uniqueness, as far as I can tell, there are excellent\n    choices already at CPAN when it comes to IPC, but I needed something\n    that does not map to a regular file (eg. I really mmap to /dev/zero)\n    and that does present a minimal interface, so that it can be used\n    immediately.\n\n    Lastly, as for listing in the list, I thought that someone else\n    besides me might find the module useful some day."
