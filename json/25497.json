Note that RVP is not the same as (or\n    even all that similar to) the MSN protocol.\n\n    I have developed some modules (whose structure and organization I\n    have posted about on module-authors) that can connect to an RVP\n    server, chat, receive messages, etc., plus a primitive client that\n    uses them.\n\n    This belongs in Net:: because it is an interface to a network\n    protocol, and other similar protocols e.g. AIM, Goofey, Jabber,\n    Oscar are represented here."
