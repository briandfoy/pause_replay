The basic module is not designed\n    to be used directly by anything other than other modules. One of the\n    unique features of this module is that it overrides some arithmetic\n    operators to allow users to intelligently diff and patch\n    configuration files, even files of different formats. The\n    intermediate abstraction also facilitates conversion between\n    different file formats."
