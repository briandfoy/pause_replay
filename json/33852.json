      "why" : "Module (mainly used for preprocessing the pages of a website):\n    Opens the specified input file, or 'siteDescription.txt' if none\n    specified. Each line in the file is parsed. First filenames on each\n    line are concatinated to the last filename on that line, in order,\n    and the file is created. This is quite different from most\n    preprocessing programs which use a macro language. Instead, you have\n    a single file which describes how to construct every page in the\n    website from smaller text files, and 'mcat.pl' which reads that file\n    and creates the site. It is very useful for making pages with common\n    elements like menus, headers, and footers.\n\n    (Could also upload it as a script. See\n    http://www.mbstevens.com/preprocessor/ ...it is the mcat.pl script\n    from the download. At a future time I might also like to upload a\n    module and/or script for the mfilt.pl component of the download.\n    This mfilt.pl component does use a simple macro language.)",
