The new implementation of the Next\n    Generation Auto-Parallelizing Programming Language known as\n    'SequenceL' includes the addition of bleeding-edge Artificial\n    Intelligence algorithms and the ability to run on Major Grid\n    Computing Platforms (Globus, Avaki, or even a plain old Cluster).\n    Also included is a nifty Web-based UI called JSSIM (JavaScript\n    Scaleable Image Map). JSSIM is fully Skin-able, with several\n    eye-candy SkinSets for your Computing pleasure. All code is written\n    in pure, Object-Oriented Perl. Surf to the SourceForge Release Page,\n    for immediate access to the new WOOP::SequenceShell interface!",
