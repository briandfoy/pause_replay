I've already built a php\n    interface to this structure, and want to build a Perl interface.\n\n    I'm not quite sure whether this is a good namespace, but as far as\n    I could tell by a glimpse through the module list, it seems like a\n    good idea to have a separate namespace for the PhoA-application.\n    It's not commercial, but more related to imaging.\n\n    The module I'm building first is a general read/write module, which\n    most likely will deliver a object tree ready for other (not-written)\n    modules to use. In the future I'm foresee modules like\n    PhoA::Relocator, or PhoA::WebBuilder, and so on.\n\n    If you have suggestions as to a better namespace, please give a\n    response. ;-)\n\n    From a new PAUSE member Holroy"
