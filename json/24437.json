      "why" : "I have written a module to provide a Perl interface to Gramofile, a\n    program for recording gramophone records. It is able to record hours\n    of CD quality music, split long sound files in separate tracks, and\n    remove ticks and pops from recordings. The program originally had a\n    curses interface, and I have modified the source code to allow an XS\n    interface to Perl.\n\n    Gramofile was written by Anne Bezemer and Ton Le and is available\n    from http://panic.et.tudelft.nl/~costar/gramofile/\n\n    The library used by this module is available from\n    https://sourceforge.net/projects/libgramofile/",
