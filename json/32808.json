For example, the LAPACK matrix invert function seems to\n    be slightly faster than the current 'matinv' from PDL::Slatec. But\n    you get a huge speed improvement, if you can call the special LAPACK\n    function for inverting a posivive definte matrix. Additionally i\n    plan to release another PDL addon especially for time series\n    analysis, because i am missing variance, covariance, etc.",
