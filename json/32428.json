The UPS module works\n    properly for shipments to, from and within Canada. The existing\n    shipping modules use the old UPS cgi interface and don't calculate\n    Canadian shipping.\n\n    The FedEx module calculates FedEx rates for all modes on both\n    domestic and international shipping. It also submits the shippment\n    to FedEx and returns a printable shipping label. I've completed\n    FedEx certification of the module and waiting for approval.",
