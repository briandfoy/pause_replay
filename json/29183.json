Symbols:\n    the objects managed by Algebra are symbolic references to sets. It\n    might be tempting to call it Sets instead of Symbols, but I think\n    this would disappoint downloaders as they would expect to see set\n    operations like union intersection etc. Calling it Numbers would\n    also disappoint as although complex numbers are represented, it is\n    their symbolic manipulation that is of interest rather than numeric\n    calculations. 'Symbolic Processing' is a generic term for this\n    subject area (see Math::Symbolic) so Symbols somewher in the name is\n    appropriate. Possibly: Math::Symbolic::Algebra would be a reasonable\n    alternative although this would mix things up for SMUELLER's\n    packages."
