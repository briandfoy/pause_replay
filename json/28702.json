After that, the\n    PowerEdge::RAC author may update his module name to follow the\n    convention, and upload it to CPAN as well. I will be following up in\n    the coming months with additional system management modules, as I\n    mentioned in my original posting:\n\n    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/cgi-bin/w3glimpse2html/modules/2003-11/msg00193.html?58#mfs"
