The problem with current duplicated\n    files finders is that they are too strict. For example, if the file\n    name is changed a little bit, it will not be found as duplication\n    any more.\n\n    This module makes more aggressive guessing, with user controllable\n    suggestion levels. It is ready to use for end users. It will be\n    especially useful for people who download lots of files from\n    different sites.\n\n    The package name has been discussed with module controller before,\n    was actually suggested by module controller."
