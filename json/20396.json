It was discussed\n    on the DateTime list and Builder was found to be the most pleasing\n    and appropriate.\n\n    The purpose of Builder is to simplify the creation of\n    DateTime::Format modules. At present this means it helps one create\n    format parsers in a fairly straight forward manner.\n\n    As one of the more useful, yet independent, components of the\n    DateTime project it makes sense to have it on the module list.\n\n    cheers,"
