Included are validators and form fillers and conf\n    reader wrappers (doesn't actually have a reader of its own) and\n    extentions to CGI style objects.\n\n    Most of the functionality included in this module has been used for\n    several years in house at a fairly large perl shop.\n\n    As for uniqueness - there may be little. CGI/Ex.pm provides useful\n    extensions to CGI.pm (or similiar modules). CGI/Ex/Validate.pm\n    provides more powerful validation of cgi parameters than in other\n    similar modules (nested tests, conditional validation, and grouping)\n    as well as nearly duplicate javascript validation that works on all\n    current major browsers. CGI/Ex/Fill.pm is fairly similar to\n    HTML::FillInForm with a few additions, the most significant being a\n    tremendous speed improvement (CGI::Ex can be set to use\n    HTML::FillInForm instead of CGI::Ex::Fill). CGI/Ex/Conf.pm is a\n    wrapper around the various methods of reading settings files\n    (storable, perl, yaml, inihash, xml) with a common interface and the\n    option of preloading files at server start time in a mod_perl\n    environment.\n\n    All of this is put through a common interface in CGI::Ex which\n    allows for and easier gateway to common used functions."
