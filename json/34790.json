An class I wrote is\n    MultiProc::Generic. This is the most basic of implementations. There\n    are many useful features and options like support for shared memory\n    between parent and child processes, capping the max number of\n    processes running at any one time, logging functionality. Its\n    particularly useful to my company where Ive written many classes for\n    multi database/schema database crawling scripts.",
