The suggestion was since Palm already has a rootlevel namespace\n    for files, Nokia was also suitable. Also suggested was creating a\n    File level so future Nokia file format modules will fit neatly into\n    this namespace. The module's name corresponds to these suggestions.\n\n    The module should be listed to help other developers working with\n    Nokia phones. It provides access into the .nfb file's structure and\n    allows for the creation, modification and extraction of data in a\n    clean object orientated environment."
