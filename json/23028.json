Communication may be achieved\n    through other modules, such as Net::SNMP, Net::Telnet, LWP,\n    Net::FTP, etc etc. This communication with the network device would\n    be use to manage the device. A Net::Dev module would use a\n    'protocol' type module to access the device and then perform desired\n    functions on the device.\n\n    Other modules to support the communicating modules are also\n    envisioned, such as Net::Dev::Tools. A planned upload is\n    Net::Dev::Tools::MIB::MIBLoadOrder, (determines load order for a NMS\n    given a group of MIBs).\n\n    My work includes writing scripts that solve customer problems on\n    network devices, have written several modules to support myself,\n    would like to post publicly."
