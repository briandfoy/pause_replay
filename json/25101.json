      "why" : "You don't know me. My project uses perl at all levels (embedded\n    perl and perl modules). The latter is what I wish to contribute. I\n    have written a Perl module that interfaces directly with the network\n    server for my project. Both the module and the client/server\n    software are under the GPL. I do not suspect I need my own\n    namespace, I assume I would be able to list it under Net::Benson.\n\n    Ancillary to the above, I also have a better NeuralNet and Genetic\n    Algorithm perl module implementation that I have thought about\n    cleaning up and making available.\n\n    I am not sure I have come to the right the place. Although, it\n    seems logical to me at the moment, I wish to discuss further if\n    possible. Thank you for your time.",
