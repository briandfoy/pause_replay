      "rationale" : "Math::Series defines a class for simple mathematic series with a\n    recursive definition such as C<x_(n+1) = 1 / (x_n + 1)>. Such a\n    recursive definition is treated as a sequence whose elements will be\n    added to form a series. You can refer to the previous sequence\n    element as well as to the current index in the series.\n\n    Each Math::Series object is an iterator to iterate over the\n    elements of the sequence starting at the first element (which was\n    specified by the starting element, the second argument to the new()\n    constructor). It offers facilities to cache all calculated elements\n    and access any element directly, though unless the element has been\n    cached in a previous calculation, this is just a shortcut for\n    repeated use of the iterator.\n\n    The namespace choice seemed obvious to me. I could not find any\n    modules with similar functionality on CPAN. It is derived from\n    Math::Sequence, but doesn't fit in Math::Sequence::* because it's\n    more of a use-relationship than an isa-relationship."
