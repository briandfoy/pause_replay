      "rationale" : "The related modules DBIx::Browse, CGI::CRUD,\n    Catalyst::Plugin::CRUD, and CatalystX::CRUD provide a one-stop shop\n    for CRUD/BREAD functionality. While this can be very handy for many\n    situations, sometimes you really need *very customized* forms for\n    create/edit/update.\n\n    CGI::Browse is more like CGI::List with additional flexibility. It\n    focuses on providing just the review/browse functionality plus\n    deletes, while enabling link-outs from any number of columns (each\n    based on any columnâs value). This allows the developer to build\n    lateral or drill-down links in addition to or instead of edit/update\n    links. Additional features that can be enabled include: clickable\n    column headings for sorting rows, single row or multiple row\n    deletes, default HTML layout or hashref values for use with Template\n    layouts, and CSS styles including flexible alternating row coloring\n    for readability. Also included are traditional review/browse\n    features like âprevious/next linksâ (move to contiguous pages),\n    âshow X rowsâ text box (set view window), âgo to pageâ drop\n    down (move to any page), âstarting on row Xâ index label, and\n    âsorted by columnXâ sort label. Each of these features are\n    included in the default HTML layout but may be excluded by using a\n    Template.\n\n    The package includes a stylesheet, default template, javascript\n    file, working CGI scripts, and the actual SQL data used in the\n    examples. The documentation illustrates all features and outlines\n    the necessary changes to get the sample scripts running on any\n    server. Running examples can be tested at\n    http://www.ourpug.org/cgi-bin/eg/browse.cgi and\n    http://www.ourpug.org/cgi-bin/eg/browse_tmpl.cgi."
