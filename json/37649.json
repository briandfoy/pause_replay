This module goes hand-in-hand with the\n    Gtk2 module, and the Gtk2::Ex::DBI namespace was suggested by the\n    Gtk2 developers in their mailing list.\n\n    <sales pitch> Gtk2::Ex::DBI basically automates the process of\n    database interaction when building Gtk2 apps with Perl. It handles\n    querying, inserting and deleting records when given a DBI handle. It\n    also 'paints' the data onto the form, supporting most of the Gtk2\n    widget types. It detects changes made to a record, and handles\n    passing those changes back to the DB server. It's recently had a\n    major rewrite in the querying logic that makes it practically\n    infinitely scalable with respect to recordset size ... it now pulls\n    records in small 'slices' ( size is configurable ) when needed,\n    maintaining very snappy performance on low-powered and low-memory\n    machines even when running queries that return millions of records.\n    I suppose this last part is the most innovative, but then again I\n    assume others have trodden the same path before me. I'm the first to\n    do it for Gtk2-Perl though :) </sales pitch>"
