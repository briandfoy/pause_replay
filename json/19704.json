This framework provides\n    database-vendor-specific capabilities that DBIx modules cannot offer\n    since they are intended to be vendor-neutral.\n\n    This framework arose from that vendor-specific desire: to\n    dynamically create DDL required to create a database and\n    corresponding tables, making tables easy to recreate on multiple\n    systems, esp test vs production systems.\n\n    Once the framework already knew about databases and tables, it was\n    a relatively minor step to provide functions for querying,\n    inserting, and updating those tables. Rather than discovering the\n    table format for each query (as DBIx must do), the table format is\n    already located in the framework, allowing for certain\n    simplifications in code (not always optimal either). It is possible\n    to manipulate DB2 databases with a minimal amount of SQL through\n    this framework, whereas DBIx modules usually require more indepth\n    knowledge of SQL.\n\n    Modules in this package include:\n\n    DB2::db DB2::Table DB2::Row"
