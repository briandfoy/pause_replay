      "rationale" : "The module name is Statistics::LineFit because it uses statistics\n    (linear regression using the method of least squares) to do line\n    fitting to a set of (x,y) points.\n\n    Statistics::LineFit was inspired by and borrows some ideas from the\n    venerable Statistics::OLS module. The significant differences\n    between Statistics::LineFit and Statistics::OLS are:\n\n    * Statistics::LineFit is more robust. For certain datasets\n    Statistics::OLS will return incorrect results (e.g., only two data\n    points). Statistics::OLS does not deep copy its input arrays, which\n    can lead to subtle bugs. The Statistics::OLS installation test has\n    only one test and does not verify that the regression returned\n    correct results. In contrast, Statistics::LineFit has over 200\n    installation tests that use various datasets / calling sequences and\n    it verifies the accuracy of the regression to within 1.0e-10.\n\n    * Statistics::LineFit is faster. For a sequence of calls to new(),\n    setData(\\@x, \\@y) and regress(), Statistics::LineFit is faster than\n    Statistics::OLS by factors of 2.0, 1.6 and 2.4 for array lengths of\n    5, 100 and 10000, respectively.\n\n    * Statistics::LineFit can do weighted or unweighted regression.\n    Statistics::OLS lacks this option.\n\n    * Statistics::LineFit has a better (or at least different)\n    interface.\n\n    Once you call the Statistics::LineFit::setData() method, you can\n    call the other methods in any order and call methods multiple times\n    without invoking redundant calculations. Statistics::LineFit lets\n    you enable or disable data verification or error messages.\n\n    * Statistics::LineFit has better code and documentation. The code\n    in Statistics::LineFit is more readable, more object oriented and\n    more compliant with Perl coding standards than the code in\n    Statistics::OLS. The documentation for Statistics::LineFit is more\n    detailed and complete."
