      "rationale" : "GFL is the name of the cross-platform C library for which this\n    module is a wrapper - it stands for Graphic File Library - see\n    www.xnview.org It is similar to GD, but with a stress put on the\n    very high number of exotic graphic formats supported (more than\n    300).\n\n    Thus this proposal to adopt the same naming scheme than GD :\n\n    GFL -> low-level wrapper GFL::Image -> high-level Object Oriented\n    wrapper which inherits the above.\n\n    This structure seems the most relevant as it is coherent with the\n    inheritance scheme. Moreover, it seems unlikely that a three letters\n    capitalized acronym like this one could clash with future root names\n    as there are 26^3 = 17576 other 3 letters combinations. At last, GFL\n    is actively developped since 2 years and is likely to gain a large\n    fame as a \"swiss-knife\" for image importation."
