The first is an all-Perl implementation whereas the\n    latter interfaces with the neon library.\n\n    To the best of my knowledge there is no all-Perl implementation of\n    a WebDAV server. Therefore I have set about making one. My module,\n    HTTP::DAVServer can be a starting point for anyone wishing to create\n    a WebDAV server with some smarts behind it. :)\n\n    I have chosen the name HTTP::DAVServer to follow the lead of other\n    Perl modules which can act as a server (NET::FTPServer,\n    NET::DNSServer). I might have chosen HTTP::WebDAVServer but want to\n    match up with client naming HTTP::DAV."
