I'm afraid you lost it :)\n\n    A simple thing as a portable implementation of the command-line\n    `which' utility doesn't seem to exist in Perl. This modules has its\n    origins in mod_perl 2.0 and the new mod_perl site, which needed an\n    implementation of this, and has further been developed to be more\n    cross-platform (atleast supports Win32 and Unix now).\n\n    As it deals with executable files, the File:: namespace seems\n    appropriate. The ::Which part is pretty self-descriptive too."
