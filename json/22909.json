I have tried recently and also a few years ago.\n\n    I would like to create a module that uses XS to call the statfs()\n    function directly. Currently there is no mechanism to do this in\n    Perl. It would mirror the Filesys::Statvfs module closely and I\n    would like to tie it into Filesys::Df as well. This will be useful\n    for operating systems like OS X which do not have a statvfs() call.\n\n    If I can not use Filesys::Statfs would a different namespace be\n    possible?\n\n    Thanks, Ian Guthrie"
