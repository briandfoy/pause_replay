The\n    module supports multiple graphics file formats, is machine\n    independent (everything is in perl) and supports multiple barcode\n    types (I have written Code128, Code39, Code93 so far). Adding new\n    symboligies is done by creating a module in BCode/Types (a template\n    of the class is supplied). The same is true of file formats\n    BCode/Formats (I've written xbm, bmp so far and am working on png).\n    The program also generates human readable zones on the barcode in\n    various fonts (two supplied at present). I plan on adding 2D\n    barcodes too at some stage.",
