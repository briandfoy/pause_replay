Ultimately, I think it belongs in the perl\n    core, but initially, it needs to mature as a separate entity.\n\n    There doesn't seeem to be any existing namespace that's devoted to\n    control structures for Perl. The most similar module, Damian's\n    Switch.pm, was granted its own root-level namespace, so I figure\n    this module should get the same treatment.\n\n    Ultimately, perhaps we should have a root-level namespace of\n    \"source-filtered flow-control extensions to Perl\", providing for\n    names like PerlExt::SelectLoop.pm. Maybe this would be a good time\n    to institute that change!"
