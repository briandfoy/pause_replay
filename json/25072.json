It works to maximize\n    the number of times an event happens without going over set limits.\n    The only other thing that I could find on CPAN that comes close to\n    doing something like this is POE, which is more heavyweight has a\n    higher learning curve.\n\n    Schedule::RateLimiter is an appropriate name for this module.\n    \"Schedule\" is an already established root namespace used for\n    scheduling events, and \"RateLimiter\" does well at describing exactly\n    what this module does with scheduled events."
