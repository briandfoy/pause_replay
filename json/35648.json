I did not want to stick to LWP, so extending the\n    Net::Orkut module was no choice.\n\n    I think Orkut should allow users a more direct access to their\n    data. While this module is no solution to the current development in\n    social networking sites, i hope it shows the demand for more\n    sophisticated interfaces than a browser if we ever want to make more\n    out of this networks. This module may help to make users understand\n    which data they leak on Orkut.\n\n    Last but not least i hope the module will make a good example for\n    the use of WWW::Mechanize."
