Because it matches in whatever way seems appropriate\n    it doesn't fit in the 'Regexp::' root.\n\n    Since the term \"smart matching\" has already become common in the\n    perl 6 design, 'Match' and 'Smart' seemed like appropriate terms to\n    use in the module name. Since there are already 'Smart' modules such\n    as 'XML::Smart' and 'Tree::Smart', it seemed to reinforce using\n    'Match' first and 'Smart' second. Hence 'Match::Smart'.\n\n    And though it does draw heavily from Apocalypse 4, it makes no\n    attempt to mirror perl 6 syntax, making 'Perl6::' inappropriate."
