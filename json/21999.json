There exist a\n    few generic modules for encapsulating various Net:: classes in SSL,\n    but none for the HTTP::Daemon class, which seems to be the most\n    popular HTTP server class on CPAN. Most of the \"quick solutions\"\n    that people have found either involve patches to HTTP::Daemon to\n    make it only an SSL server or dynamically changing its inheritance,\n    both of which are improper long-term solutions. Hence, I wrote a\n    quick extension class to HTTP::Daemon which I would like to see on\n    CPAN, as it may benefit many others besides myself.\n\n    Thanks,\n\n    Peter Behroozi"
