Default settings for the name of the\n    shell the greetings and the prompts are included. Extra commands can\n    easily be registered or removed [a feature not existing in the other\n    shells] using the included methods. User functions will be called\n    with the parameters and switches [gnu/unix styles supported]\n    preparsed into an array and a hash respectively in order to ease the\n    processing by the user function."
