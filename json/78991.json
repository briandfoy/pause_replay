So change my\n    namespace to Lingua::ZH::MMSEG\n\n    A problem in computational analysis of Chinese text is that there\n    are no word boundaries in conventionally printed text. Since the\n    word is such a fundamental linguistic unit, it is necessary to\n    identify words in Chinese text so that higher-level analyses can be\n    performed. This module provide phrase segmentation using Maximum\n    Matching Algorithm. It was found that the system successfully\n    identified 98.41% of words in a sample consisting of 1013 words."
