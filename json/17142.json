Registered\n    event handlers are automatically called with any manipulation of any\n    flag in the flag register. It also provides tracking for\n    parent<->child relationships and clean destruction of those\n    resources.\n\n    In sum, this is really a small & simple module, but having it\n    available would increase my code reuse significantly, since many of\n    my other modules on CPAN will be using this functionality."
