The framework inside PHP::Include\n    could easily be extended to provide new grammars that parse more\n    PHP.\n\n    There is a great deal of opportunity to create Perl libraries for\n    interacting with PHP applications/code...and a top level PHP\n    namespace would be the logical place to put them."
