This code access various specialist\n    functions which normally generate one or more graph lines.\n\n    Finance::Shares::Function is the base class for these auxilliary\n    functions. There are about 20 already, but I see no need to register\n    them all. They are more 'user data' than 'system'.\n\n    Finance::Shares::Line is the class implementing the graph line(s)\n    created by Finance::Shares::Function, providing data for the code\n    fragments."
