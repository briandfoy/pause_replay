Within\n    this remit it intends to be complete. It handles the pre-1972 form\n    of UTC, in addition to the current form with leap seconds. It\n    automatically downloads new UTC data (published by the IERS) to stay\n    up to date.\n\n    The name \"Time::UTC\" refers to this view of the module as\n    describing UTC.\n\n    I've found two other modules that encapsulate information about\n    leap seconds: Date::Leapsecond and DateTime::LeapSecond. The latter\n    is derived from the former. They are minimalistic, tailored to the\n    use DateTime makes of them. They cover only leap seconds, not the\n    earlier form of UTC, and they do not correctly handle future leap\n    seconds. Conversely, they are faster at those things they do\n    support. They thus have a rather different intent from Time::UTC. It\n    would be possible, and reasonable, to implement DateTime::LeapSecond\n    in terms of Time::UTC, using Time::UTC as the underlying source of\n    knowledge about UTC."
