PIKT::UI is one of them, and as it names suggests, it\n    implements a User Interface. Among others, PIKT::Config is an\n    interface to pikt configuration system, PIKT::Random contains and\n    interface to several PRNGs used in pikt. As pikt will integrate\n    direct perl support in its future versions, other modules will come\n    as well (PIKT::History for instance). This is why a rootlevel\n    namespace seems reasonable in this perspective."
