It can\n    deal not only with content objects (paragraphs, tables, item lists,\n    footnotes, images...) but with presentation objects (styles). Its\n    most usefulness is probably related to text (Writer) and spreadsheet\n    (Calc) documents, but it can process any OOo content class (one can\n    use it, say, to resize an image or to do a keyword-based search in a\n    slideshow (Impress) document.\n\n    It's pure perl, platform independant, and don't use the\n    OpenOffice.org API; it works directly with the OpenOffice.org files,\n    using XML::Twig and Archive::Zip.\n\n    The root namespace (OpenOffice) was the most straightforward\n    choice.\n\n    The more questionable OODoc name comes from historical reasons. The\n    initial project name was \"Open Office Document Connector\", so\n    \"OODoc\", and a few companies used it privately with a \"use OODoc\"\n    statement. When the module was open-sourced and came to CPAN, the\n    OODoc root name was no longer free, and the OpenOffice one had\n    appeared in the meantime. So, I opted for the laziest possible\n    option and simply inserted \"OpenOffice::\" before \"OODoc\" (knowing\n    that there is a lot of better possibilities, such as\n    \"OpenOffice::Connector\", \"OpenOffice::Query\", etc...)\n\n    Thanks for your comments"
