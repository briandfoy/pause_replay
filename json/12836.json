You can script almost anything through this module\n    that you can do in a normal interactive CL session.\n\n    This module provides several improved, and more Perl-like,\n    interfaces to various IRAF systems, such as session variables, the\n    management of loading/unloading IRAF packages and the session\n    history. It also provides the ability to specify maximum run times\n    for commands, and the clean handling of these time outs and other\n    types of errors and exceptions. All functions are called in an\n    object-orientated fashion allowing several concurrent interpreter\n    sessions if desired.\n\n    I am proposing to create the IRAF sub-section within the Astro\n    namespace as with such an extensive system as IRAF i can foresee\n    other people wanting to upload their own IRAF modules in the future,\n    possibly built on top of this generic module.\n\n    IRAF is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, a general\n    purpose software system for the reduction and analysis of\n    astronomical data. See http://iraf.noao.edu for more details"
