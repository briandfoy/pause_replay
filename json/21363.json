UML::Sequence draws sequence diagrams\n    from simple text files, or by actually running the code. UML::State\n    draws state diagrams from simple text files.\n\n    I don't like to point and click. I would rather have Perl work for\n    me. With UML::State I can draw a state diagram in a few minutes,\n    then edit it with vi whenever it needs maintenance. The output is in\n    SVG which can be converted easily to PNG or JPEG with free tools.\n\n    I don't think there are other state diagram tools on CPAN."
