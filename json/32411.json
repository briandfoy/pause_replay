The database is a simple data file\n    containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key\n    and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and\n    character string can be used as a key and a value. There is neither\n    concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash\n    table or B+ tree.",
