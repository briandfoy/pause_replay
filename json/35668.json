In\n    future versions of Data::Diff I'm planning on incorporating\n    Algorithm::Diff by using it on the input arrays thought the use of\n    options provided by the user. Data::Diff is from the start designed\n    to work recursively on perl data structures.\n\n    unlike Data::Compare, Data::Diff not only tells you that the two\n    data structure are different but how they differ. There are several\n    methods that do operations on this information that i've found\n    useful and it is easily extendable to include more functionality in\n    future versions.\n\n    I feel that the these three modules solve sufficiently different\n    problems and that the addition of this new one will benefit others."
