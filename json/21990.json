I plan to release also a wrapper for libfolder (a\n    part of future balsa MUA project). Then this three modules would\n    even allow anyone to build a separate MUA (without huge disk and RAM\n    usage). Net::SMTP::ESMTP is independent package (depends only on\n    libESMTP and optionally openssl), and could be used to send e-mails\n    to SMTP server from any source.\n\n    I have proposed two names on usenet news (comp.lang.perl.modules):\n    - Net::SMTP::Client (this is bad because libESMTP could one time to\n    become more advances library, that some MTA could use it as well). -\n    Net::ESMTP - is would be the best one, because it is short. But I do\n    not know if it is good to start a new namespace in Net. Is it??\n\n    Other modules comparison: - other modules are written purely in\n    perl, this module does not need other perl modules, then it is\n    easier to use - Net::Server::Mail is meant for servers -\n    Mail::Transport::SMTP is a part of Mail-Box. This is very good and\n    well designed package, but Mail::Transport::SMTP is not so advanced\n    as Net::SMTP::ESMTP."
