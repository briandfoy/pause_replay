This doesn't seem to work in a mod_perl\n    context, which means you have to create a scalar and fill it up with\n    stuff before printing it at the browser.\n\n    my $output = Apache::SAX::ConsumerObject->new($r); my $writer =\n    XML::SAX::Writer->new(Output=>$output);\n\n    Matt Sergeant has already written a similar package for AxPoint,\n    but it would nice to have a simple bare bones consumer that does not\n    require installing all the stuff used by AxPoint.\n\n    http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/1258526"
