I\n    initially experimented with Games::OpenGL::Font::2D, but found the\n    implementaiton to be slow and inflexible (not to mention it is\n    compatible with only pre-2.0 versions of SDL_perl)\n\n    The OGLFT library handles this problem very well and has many\n    useful drawing styles. Although my work, currently, is very\n    preliminary, I am attempting to expose the majority of the\n    functionality of this C++ library in perl with minimum overhead. I\n    should have an upload ready within two weeks.\n\n    OpenGL::OGLFT is designed to work with SDL::OpenGL; however, it\n    should also work with any perl OpenGL implementation provided that\n    the OGLFT library is linked to the same OpenGL library the perl\n    module is using. It should work with the basic OpenGL module and\n    also QT::OpenGL, thus the choice of namespace.\n\n    Information on OGLFT can be found at http://oglft.sourceforge.net/\n\n    Thanks for your consideration."
