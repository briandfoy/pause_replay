It allows an author to package up a web\n    application, including configuration, static files, Perl modules,\n    and Registry and PerlRun scripts to include in a single file. This\n    archive can then be moved to other locations on the same system or\n    distributed, and loaded with a single set of configuration options\n    in the Apache configuration.\n\n    The name Apache::PAR derives from the necessity of using under\n    mod_perl (Apache::) and the usage of PAR files (the module uses\n    PAR.pm as part of its requirements)\n\n    I did not find any modules on CPAN which performed a similar\n    function.\n\n    Posted an RFC on the mod_perl mailing list\n    (modperl@perl.apache.org), and have not yet received any negative\n    responses on the namespace choice (or on other aspects of the\n    module.)"
