You also can make a search for nodes that have some\n    attibute, etc...\n\n    You just access/manipulate the object, and the XML tree inside it\n    is changed automatically. So, the hard work stay internally in the\n    module, not with the user, what make this a \"Smart\" way. ;-P\n\n    The namespace is needed since it has sub-modules, like\n    XML::Smart::Tree and XML::Smart::Parser (used when XML::Parser is\n    not installed), and can have more in the future."
