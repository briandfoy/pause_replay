We were discussing\n    possible titles for the package on module-authors and it was\n    suggested that a more general Tie::Simple might be even better. That\n    didn't really fit my goals at the time, but for another project, it\n    does.\n\n    Therefore, I've gone back and implemented Tie::Simple. The class\n    basically allows you to write an anonymous tie package. It's not yet\n    implemented as well as I'd like, but it serves my current needs and\n    I will probably improve it in the future (mostly it needs better\n    SUPER dispatching and more @ISA flexibility).\n\n    Thanks, Sterling"
