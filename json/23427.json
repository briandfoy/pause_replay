It is aimed at the\n    Natural Language Processing community of IT, web designers etc., and\n    Orientalists.\n\n    Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX - extension for multi-purpose processing of\n    the ArabTeX notation of Arabic - conversions into/from the Arabic\n    script and/or phonetic transcriptions, highly configurable -\n    non-trivial implementation relying on Encode::Mapper and suiting the\n    Encode::Encoding interface\n\n    Encode::Arabic::Buckwalter - extension for Tim Buckwalter's\n    transliteration of Arabic - tr/// one-to-one mapping with the\n    Encode::Encoding interface\n\n    Unlike other CPAN modules working with the Arabic script, this\n    module supplies two most popular ASCII transliterations of the\n    script. The author would like to stress the Encode::Arabic::ArabTeX\n    module, which is a unique implementation of the interpreter to the\n    excelent ArabTeX notation for Arabic -- there is only the original\n    TeX/LaTeX package doing the job."
