I've found a project in\n    sourceforge(http://thaiwordseg.sourceforge.net/) release a C-library\n    that work well. So I create a XS interface to it, pack to a module\n    called Lingua::TH::Segmentation. At first, I've just registered a\n    name(String::Thai::Segmentation), but after someone in the news\n    group suggest me that my modules is for single language and should\n    lead with Lingua, and TH is the code name of my country from\n    ISO-xxxx, I do agree with him. Sorry for submit more than once. :)"
