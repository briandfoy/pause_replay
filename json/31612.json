They can be connected by a serial port or over the\n    network. As a result, neither the Net:: nor the Device:: heirarchies\n    seem appropriate. In that way, it seems similar to a Remote Access\n    Server device, which as its own RAS:: heirarchy.\n\n    I expect other driver modules to use the RFID:: namespace, as well\n    as middleware protocols like Savant, general abstractions used by\n    several driver modules, and various frontends for dealing with the\n    data."
