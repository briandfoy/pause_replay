Interfaces and support\n    libraries will be added to support enterprise computing concepts and\n    other ideas as they rise. Many of these ideas will come from the\n    Spring framework that was developed for Java and is currently being\n    ported to .NET.\n\n    This namespace is the logical collection point for these add-ons.\n    Currently only picocontainer-like functionality is provided. But\n    this is just the foundation for more and more layers."
