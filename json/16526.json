These are hard to write, hard to maintain and\n    hard to document.\n\n    This module provide a simple interface for writing rules to which\n    an item of data must conform. This allows you to put all of the\n    rules which an item must obey in one place. If you have, as is the\n    common situation, many items of data organised as records, you can\n    take out common rules, and write these only once.\n\n    This is an alpha release, intended for comment and critical\n    feedback. The interface may well change in response to this fedback.\n\n    What this module does not do is allow you to specify rules\n    involving several data items. The non-existent companion module\n    Data::Validator::Record will do this some day. Feel free to start\n    writing it!"
