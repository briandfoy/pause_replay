As there is no\n    namespace related to knowledge representation or knowledge\n    management in general, it is propably a better solution to have a\n    rootlevel namespace 'KR' or 'KM' and make TM a subspace in turn. I\n    am still open to rename TM into KR::TM or KM::TM. It might also be\n    worth to consider to line up with the ODP hierarchy:\n\n    http://dmoz.org/Reference/Knowledge_Management/Knowledge_Representation/Topic_Maps/\n\n    although KM::KR::TM is propably overkill...\n\n    Note that Topic Maps cannot be subsummed under WWW, since they are\n    not an XML or Web application per se. Only is XTM a subset of Topic\n    Maps that aimes to bring Topic Maps to the Web. Topic Maps (in the\n    sense that my implementation approaches them) are not even a markup\n    technology.\n\n    Thanks and regards--\n\n    Jan Algermissen"
