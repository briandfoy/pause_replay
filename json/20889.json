If it\n    proves reliable and useful, as I expect, I think it should\n    ultimately move into the Perl Core.\n\n    The most similar module is Damian's Switch.pm, which likewise adds\n    a new flow-control construct to Perl through source filtering.\n\n    There was some earlier discussion on the \"modules list\" regarding\n    the most appropriate namespace for this module, which resulted in\n    the choice shown above.\n\n    (Most of the comments came from brian d foy, whom I have recently\n    tried to contact, but apparently he's toppling statues in Baghdad or\n    something these days.)"
