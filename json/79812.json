I donât much care, but\n    Brianâs seems cool.\n\n    My approach differs from all existing approaches because it uses a\n    language model trained against three different very large\n    English-language corpora. It correctly determines the encoding\n    between several possible 8-bit encodings where the other modules\n    fail miserably.\n\n    I had originally thought to put this under Lingua::EN:: somewhere,\n    but Damian convinced me that this was wrong. It is only the fact\n    that I use English-language models by default that it works on\n    English-language text. There is no reason that the user could not\n    supply their own training model for some other language, and have it\n    perform commensurately well on the non-English text.\n\n    I will make the mechanism for doing this clearer in the beta\n    release."
