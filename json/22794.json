It's what I'm known\n    as in the real world too -- I've been called it for years before I\n    heard of the net, it's what I introduce myself as to neighbours or\n    people in bars. As such, it's what I'm called and it would seem\n    silly for my author page on search.cpan.org to display a name by\n    which most people don't know me.)",
