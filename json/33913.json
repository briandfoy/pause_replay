(not UCM).\n\n    The Modules listed above as \"similar functionalities\" provide\n    interactivity with cleartool command utilities and process its\n    stdout and stderr for automations.\n\n    Module 'ClearCase::Base' (and its childrens) tries to encapsulate a\n    whole mature SCM process, tailoing CMM Activities of this KPA. So\n    the \"way\" for executing and planning SCM activities could rely on a\n    pre-determinate, Company-Specific desinged pattern.\n\n    This system could be used by many other companies, promoting the\n    same CMM implementation design patterns for all."
