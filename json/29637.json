This is more\n    useful than it sounds as that CMS contains no meaningful documention\n    on this interface, so a lot of stuff is reverse-engineered. However\n    it's not patented info or anything so should be fine.\n\n    I also have a module to connect to Minidisc players via the NetMD\n    USB interface that i'd like to contribute sometime, although as it's\n    a totally reverse-engineered protocol, I should probably check on\n    the legality before I submit that one.\n\n    I also have some addon's for the OpenGuides/CGI::Wiki stuff managed\n    by Kake and Earle.",
