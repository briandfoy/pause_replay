First of all, a\n    CGI framework, which incorporate a fast replacement for CGI.pm, a\n    module that supports user sessions and session persistence, an\n    exception class with ability to dump the stack trace, an\n    object-oriented wrapper over DBI, ACL-based access control module,\n    and other modules. This framework is a complete solution for\n    developing several (related or not) websites under one virtual\n    hosting account. Also, I have some utility modules that, I believe,\n    are interesting too.",
