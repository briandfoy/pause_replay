I liked the idea better of a highly readable version\n    of the program so that everyone knew what it was doing. Sometimes\n    beginners don't know how things work so well and a clear and\n    documented module would be a help.\n\n    That, and it's FUN !!!\n\n    This module, just like Acme::Bleach & Acme::Buffy, when included at\n    the top of a Perl script, turns the rest of the script into words\n    relating to the movie, \"Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension\"\n    (based on a book by Earl Mac Rauch, see the IMDB.com listing). This\n    includes character's names, actor's names, locations, etc. This is\n    done in a different way from the other modules, too (one character =\n    one movie character), not by converting to binary and using\n    capitalization as Buffy and Bleach do.\n\n    Yes, the script still works as it normally did before the script\n    source was changed. But, you get to see all the names of the people\n    in what could possibly be the greatest movie ever made! (okay, well,\n    Ice Pirates may have been a little better, I'm not sure...) grin :-)"
