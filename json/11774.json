Yet I\n    cannot simply subclass other packages because a large part of the\n    security protocol involves careful handling of multiple cookies,\n    parsing them and making certain decisions based on internal proofs\n    of authenticity (of the cookie itself -- not just of its owner). The\n    code of Apache::AuthCookie::recognize_user($$) makes it clear that\n    this package was designed for single cookies, and thus cannot be\n    used.\n\n    The name Apache::SecSess::* is short for Apache::SecureSession.\n    Since my class hierarchy is 3 deep (not counting Apache), a short\n    name is highly desirable.\n\n    Further justification is contained in README, man pages ..."
