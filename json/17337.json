There are already implementations for Java, Ruby,\n    Python, .NET, Smalltalk.\n\n    You can find an introduction into Prevayler/Object Prevalence on\n    www.prevayler.org.\n\n    Prevayler is something like an object-persistence-database. It\n    works by serializing command-objects and re-applaying them to the\n    system after crash or shutdown.\n\n    I think it fits better into the 'Class'-Namespace than in something\n    like 'DBD'.\n\n    Thanks!"
