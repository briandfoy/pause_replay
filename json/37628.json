Although the main reason for\n    writing it was to add non-blocking IPC to Win32, it's not really a\n    Win32 only module, so putting it under Win32 does not seem the best\n    place. Other Win32-only modules can already pass messages. This\n    module is cross platform, and that is it's advantage, to have a\n    single method that can run on many platforms. I would think either\n    IPC::UDPmsg.pm or IPC::MSG:UDP.pm would be the best names. I would\n    be happy with either. But if you feel that something else would be\n    better, I doubt that would upset me."
