It's a library built\n    on top of an asynchronous DNS stub resolver. RULI provides an\n    easy-to-use interface for querying DNS SRV resource records. The\n    goal is to promote the wide deployment of SRV-cognizant software.\n    RULI aims to fully support SRV-related standards.\n\n    I'm aware Net::DNS facilities for DNS handling are more general,\n    and I suppose they are written in pure Perl.\n\n    RULI is unique in the sense it enforces strict adherence to DNS SRV\n    specification (RFC 2782), thus relieving the application programmer\n    from doing it.\n\n    Actually I would prefer to see a similar pure-Perl module, but I\n    can't spend the time to maintain one. Thus I'm providing a wrapper\n    module for an equivalent library.\n\n    I'm unsure RULI would fit under Net::DNS, that's why it's proposed\n    directly under Net. I'd really appreciate guidance on this, though."
