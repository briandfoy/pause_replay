      "why" : "I would like to package SNMP_Simple as an official module. I have\n    the author's permission already. He originally wrote it for internal\n    use at Sun, but it was then released to the public informally and is\n    now used by a few GPL'd projects (Cricket and NMIS to name a couple)\n    and would benefit a lot of people if they knew about it.\n\n    It is basically a wrapper around SNMP_Session and SNMP_BER to make\n    queries simpler. I will contact those maintainers to see if we could\n    just add SNMP_Simple to their project.\n\n    I also have a module that I have written to work Aperto's\n    Packetwave product line (www.apertonet.com) that uses Net::Telnet.\n    It could probably be another dub-project under Net::Telnet much like\n    Net::Telnet::Cisco or Net::Telnet::Netscreen.\n\n    If you need any more information do not hesitate to contact me.",
