      "rationale" : "ScanLite may me a bit of a misnomer as nessus scan latency is\n    defined by the plugin list not the protocol. This module does\n    however take advantage of the nessus NTP 1.2 \"fast_login\" method. It\n    allows applications to request a nessus daemon perform an attack in\n    a time sensitive environment. This will allow CGI applications and\n    systems such as NetReg to request real time scans.\n\n    1) Using NTP 1.2 protocol over a socket connection means you don't\n    have to have the nessus client install locally. 2) Supports ssl and\n    non-ssl nessusd connections. 3) Performs a \"fast_login\", bypassing\n    the huge list of nessus plugins. 4) Supports ini style configuration\n    files as well as methods for specifying plugins and preferences.\n\n    This application does not support the full NTP 1.2 protocol hence\n    ScanLite."
