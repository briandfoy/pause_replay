      "why" : "The OpenOffice::OODoc module provide an object-oriented interface\n    for reading and editing of OpenOffice.org documents by Perl programs\n    without having to use the OpenOffice.org software. It's mainly based\n    on XML::XPath and Archive::Zip.\n\n    Their objective is to offer programmers a concise and reasonably\n    high-level language, allowing the manipulation of document objects\n    without having to know the details of data representation used in\n    OpenOffice.org files or of XML programming interfaces.\n\n    The project page is http://www.genicorp.fr/devel/oodoc It's already\n    referred in the OpenOffice.org community (see\n    http://xml.openoffice.org/uses.html) as a toolbox allowing \"direct\n    OpenOffice file update and creation from Perl scripts (for automatic\n    document processing out of the OpenOffice software)\".\n\n    The distribution file (OpenOffice-OODoc-1.102.tar.gz) contains only\n    an introduction (README), while the full reference manual of the API\n    is a 100-page document in OpenOffice.org (SXW) format, not included\n    in the CPAN-compliant package. This manual is downloadable at\n    http://www.genicorp.fr/devel/oodoc/oodoc_man_en.sxw",
