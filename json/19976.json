      "rationale" : "This is an exceedingly simple module. It ties two variables and\n    places them in the caller's namespace. When used, these variables\n    contain the name of the function that uses them. One variable just\n    contains the function name, the other includes the function's\n    package. Example:\n\n    use Function::ID; sub foo { print \"This is $this_function\\n\"; print\n    \"Also known as $this_fn\\n\"; }\n\n    This will print:\n\n    This is main::foo Also known as foo\n\n    It seems to me that this is a useful shortcut for error or log\n    messages, and possibly for debug messages. You can copy/paste an\n    error message from one function to another, and you don't have to\n    worry about changing the text of the message to reflect its new\n    place in the program.\n\n    I suggested this module on comp.lang.perl.modules about a week ago,\n    and the response was positive. I did a search around CPAN and didn't\n    find any similar modules. I did see that a top-level Function:: name\n    exists, and I think that this module logically fits under that name.\n    However, I'm not wedded to the name \"Function::ID\"; I'm open to\n    changing it if someone has a better suggestion or if there's a\n    problem with that place in the hierarchy.\n\n    Thanks, Eric"
