My\n    current PAUSE ID is 'MACIEJ', which I realized is rude of me (Maciej\n    is a common name in Polish), and somewhat presumptuous. I had not\n    realized when I registered that I was picking a handle for everyone\n    to see, and I think it is more appropriate to use my full name.\n\n    I have refrained from uploading anything in hopes that this name\n    change request will be honored, to avoid renaming issues on my\n    modules. My apologies for the hassle, and for not reading carefully\n    enough when I requested my account.",
