This\n    makes programs both shorter (you don't have to implement the side\n    your're not interested in) and more flexible (you can read teletext\n    pages long after the collector stopped running and you don't have to\n    be tuned in to the channel you want to read).\n\n    The module is neutral about who fills in the database, but you'll\n    probably need something like Video::Capture::V4l to actually put\n    something in there, so likely this module will only get used on\n    linux (though it should be portable among unixes)."
