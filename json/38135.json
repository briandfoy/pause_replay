The approach taken is to provide a simple interfact for\n    what can easily be a complicated task. As opposed to the module\n    Text::Flowchart, no coordinates or location data is required to\n    generate a diagram. The mechanics of placing the diagram's output\n    objects are all handled automatically. The module is named\n    ProcessMap because it has been designed to be good at describing\n    computer processes, I thought the name \"Activity Diagramer\", or the\n    like, was a bit too broad for this application."
