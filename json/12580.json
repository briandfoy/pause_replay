A simple example could be: 1 2 3 4 Sum 1 4 5 6 1\n    16 2 1 2 3 4 10 3 10 1 1 2 14 Sum 15 8 10 7 40\n\n    Setting the values into the tables will force to recalculate the\n    sums. That is e.g. used when generating statistical reports.\n\n    Of course, you can use any associative, distributive operation\n    instead of sum (e.g. multiplication makes sense when working with\n    probabilities).\n\n    It's a special form of a table, so the name Data::CrossTable should\n    be O.K..\n\n    Of course, it's easy to implement, but this module enables a more\n    easier and less errorprone possibility to work with such tables (in\n    fact, in my first hacked versions, I sometimes switched rows/cols or\n    forgot whether 0 or 1 was the first line/row with some subtils\n    errors). As I believe, it's a standard form of output, used by some\n    people, it should be at CPAN."
