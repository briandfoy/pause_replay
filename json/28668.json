The\n    Bittorrent::Tracker::Protocol namespace will handle different ways\n    of Client<->Tracker communication for the Bittorrent::Tracker.\n\n    I believe that Bittorrent is a very useful method of file\n    distribution, and that many people would benefit from a simple,\n    abstracted way to use Bittorrent."
