I have been experimenting with all the different Apache\n    compression modules I have been able to find, but have not been able\n    to get the desired result. I have tried Apache::GzipChain,\n    Apache::Compress, mod_gzip and mod_deflate, with different results.\n    One I cannot get to work at all. Most work, but seem to collect all\n    the output before compressing it and sending it to the browser...\n\n    ... Wouldn't it be nice to have some option to specify that the\n    handler should flush and send the currently compressed output every\n    time it had received a certain amount of input or every time it had\n    generated a certain amount of output?..\n\n    ... So I am basically looking for anyone who has had any success in\n    achieving this kind of ``streaming'' compression, who could direct\n    me at an appropriate Apache module.``\n\n    Unfortunately, the Apache::Dynagzip has not yet been publicly\n    available at that time..."
