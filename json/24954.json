It is true that fact is stranger\n    than fiction. I cannot even blame it on a Monday morning ;-) Its\n    times like these I hate archives.\n\n    I am planning to add a facility to the Tie::RDBM possibly the\n    Tie::DBI module where the data can be cached in various ways before\n    inserting into the database. I have emailed Lincoln D Stein about\n    this and he recommended Sub-classing his module rather than adding\n    it to his own.",
