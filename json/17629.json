      "rationale" : "Tk::MatchEntry is yet another combination of an entry widget and a\n    listbox attempting to provide user-friendly auto-completion.\n\n    This one is modelled after the \"recipient\" entry widgets in modern\n    email clients and differs from other currently well-known widgets\n    (BrowseEntry, HistEntry, JBrowseEntry, SelectionEntry) as follows:\n\n    - no \"arrow button\" attached. Instead, the listbox with\n    auto-completion choices pops up automatically if there are at least\n    2 different choices which match. If you need a button to popup the\n    listbox, you can use the popup() method.\n\n    - the listbox with auto-completion choices only shows those entries\n    which still can match what the user is entering. Thus, the number of\n    choices shown to the user usually decreases with increasing length\n    of manually entered text.\n\n    - advanced handling of case-insensitive auto-completion. Example:\n    you provide an auto-completion choice \"John Doe\", and the user\n    starts with a lower-case \"j\". Auto-completion will make \"john Doe\"\n    out of it, however if the MatchEntry widget is left with accepting\n    this auto-completion choice, \"john Doe\" will be auto-converted to\n    \"John Doe\". On the other hand, the user could enter all-lowercase\n    \"jane doe\" without auto-completion messing up anything.\n\n    Available at:\n    $CPAN/modules/by-authors/id/W/WH/WHOM/Tk-MatchEntry-0.1.tar.gz"
