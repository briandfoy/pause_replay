I have discussed with\n    Dennis Taylor (via email) the module namespace to use and have\n    between us come up with POE::Component::IRC::Service This will be a\n    wrapper for various modules for dealing with different IRCd\n    implementations such as POE::Component::IRC::P10 for ircu type and\n    POE::Component::IRC::Service::Hybrid for Hybrid etc.\n\n    I have some POE::Filters that would go under POE::Filter::IRC::*\n    and POE::Filter::CTCP::*\n\n    Cheers.",
