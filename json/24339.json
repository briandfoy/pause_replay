      "rationale" : "I've written a module to implement the two RPC interfaces to the\n    Sawfish window manager for X windows. It's broken into three\n    modules. X11::WM::Sawfish is the base class from which\n    X11::WM::Sawfish::UNIX and X11::WM::Sawfish::XProp are derived. The\n    two derived classes each handle one of the two protocols for RPC,\n    and the base class constructor creates one of the two derived\n    classes depending on which is able to sucessfully connect.\n\n    As mentioned in a previous mail to modules@perl.org, I'd like to\n    group modules relating to interfacing with Window Managers for X11\n    together to make them easier to find. The other option would be to\n    spell out X11::WindowManager::Sawfish, but I think that X11::WM is\n    pretty obvious.\n\n    I've received no responses to my original request for comment on\n    the proposed namespace, so here is the official request. I'll be\n    uploading the module after submitting this request with the\n    assumption that the namespace I've chosen is non-controversial\n    enough to be accepted.\n\n    Thanks, -Craig"
