Major selling point is\n    its ability to tunnel through a series of proxy hosts e.g. if your\n    local proxy restricts the ports it allows, or injects return chars\n    that would break ssh (this is quite common), and to forward TCP/IP\n    without needing ssh and an ssh daemon. Also supports proxy auth...\n\n    2. Perhaps a modularised version of 1.\n\n    3. Got a vague urge to revamp CORBA::ORBit to work with ORBit2 -\n    I've got commit on the orbit-perl CVS so this really just requires\n    copious free time.",
