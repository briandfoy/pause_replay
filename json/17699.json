An XML document and\n    the corresponding tXML document contain precisely the same\n    information (and can be converted back and forth losslessly), but\n    tXML is much easier for humans to read and write. I'm using it as a\n    configuration file format for some internal projects, and the\n    feedback has been quite positive. (People love XML, but they hate\n    its syntax.)\n\n    XML::Terse can be used as a drop-in replacement for\n    XML::Parser::Expat, so nearly all the XML classes can use its\n    functionality transparently.\n\n    The choice of namespace should be obvious I think!"
