      "rationale" : "WWW::Authen::Simple provides authentication via database, session\n    handling (cookie based), and group based authorization with optional\n    read/write bits on each group. It's also compatable with normal CGI\n    scripts, mod_perl (1 and 2), and likely compatable with any\n    webserver.\n\n    It's goal is to provide a very simple API to handle sessions and\n    authentication.\n\n    I wrote it because I needed something simple to handle sessions,\n    authentication, and authorization. Apache::Session just does\n    sessions, and is tied to apache. CGI::Session is very flexable, but\n    only does sessions. CGI::Session::Auth I probably could have worked\n    off of, but there isn't much there at all, and I'd probably have to\n    subclass it, and override just about every method. And there are\n    others.\n\n    I hadn't released it before because there are so many other modules\n    in the same realm. However, it has matured, and I think it offeres a\n    unique way of doing things that others might find useful."
