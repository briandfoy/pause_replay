The machine learning algorithm can be changed,\n    the pre-processing and categorization behaviors can be changed, and\n    more.\n\n    On the perl-ai list, we tried to think of a better namespace than\n    AI::, because some of the algorithms that are used here are hardly\n    AI. They're pretty mundane. But Text:: doesn't work because this\n    module can actually work on non-text data (i.e. protein or sequence\n    biological data), and MachineLearning or ML:: namespaces don't exist\n    yet (and wouldn't likely be the first places people would look,\n    anyway).\n\n    Because this code is being used in the wild already and has been on\n    CPAN for several releases, I'd like to keep the name as\n    AI::Categorizer.\n\n    -Ken"
