In the\n    processes of my researches, I have come across Tk::Clock.pm, whose\n    analog display functionality I quite like.\n\n    However, Clock.pm only gives you the current system time. I have\n    contacted the author of this module (H Merijn Brand) to see if there\n    are any enhancements in the pipeline.\n\n    Even if Clock.pm is enhanced (either by Merijn or myself), there is\n    still a need for a separate Timer.pm composite widget to provide a\n    button, extra configuration, and functionality of the timer."
