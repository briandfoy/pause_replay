There\n    is a large and growing segment of baseball fans that are moving\n    towards more analytical and mathematical judgements of players,\n    teams, and events. This is evidenced by the large propogation of\n    baseball statistical sites, the growing membership of the \"Society\n    for American Baseball Research\", and teams such as the Boston Red\n    Sox, Toronto Bluejays, and the Oakland Atheletics, who heavily rely\n    on mathematics, simulation, and data mining to determine player\n    roster and movements.\n\n    This means the rootlevel \"Baseball\" namespace should be created, as\n    there are many calculations and tools that can be available to the\n    average fan.\n\n    The \"Simulate\" namespace is named so because it simulates a season\n    for a specific team."
