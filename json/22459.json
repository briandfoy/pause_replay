As for why the module it self: I was trying to see if\n    there was a way to make an always solvable minesweeper game, where\n    you'd never have to guess. But for that, I needed to have a set of\n    games that couldn't be solved without guessing, and see if they have\n    some commonality. So I had to write a program that could play a\n    minesweeper like game as far as it could go and then save the result\n    for me to examin. Of course that meant I need a game for it to play.\n    Checking on CPAN, I couldn't find anything that could help me with\n    that. So I wrote my own, and thought this would be a good think to\n    release. Thank you"
