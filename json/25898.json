I was\n    reluctant to implement it myself, but clearly there ought to be a\n    module for this, so since it appears that nobody else has done one,\n    I decided it was worth doing myself if that was the only way to get\n    it.\n\n    I believe the module should be listed, so that anyone else who\n    wants to work on or use a POP3 server module will be able to find\n    it."
