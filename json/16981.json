      "why" : "I am requesting a PAUSE ID foremostly to maintain the CPAN module,\n    Text::Morse, which is at the moment, not maintained by anyone\n    because of the tragic passing away of it's creator, Ariel Brosh.\n\n    In the future, I plan to use the PAUSE ID to make available via\n    CPAN Perl modules of my own and also to maintain any unmaintained\n    modules of interest.\n\n    At the moment, I'm also in mature developement of a GPL'd Perl\n    program that may benifit of the Bundle feature of CPAN, as it takes\n    advantage of many CPAN modules.\n\n    A little background: I'm currently an Art Student at the Rocky\n    Mountain College of Art and Design. I've found Perl to be an\n    excellent language for Net Art Projects, of which I've done a few\n    of, examples that use Perl in some way:\n\n    http://prolix.nu/haircut http://prolix.nu/help\n    http://prolix.nu/strange\n\n    Along with Net art projects, I've also used Perl in my paintings.\n    This painting was actually painted from a report made in part by a\n    Perl program:\n\n    http://www.justinsimoni.com/images/full/theeye.jpg as is this one:\n\n    http://www.skazat.com/for_you/nicole512.jpg\n\n    I know I could bring to the Perl community even MORE diversity.\n    Since Perl is released under the Artistic License, it makes sense\n    for an Artist to be a part of CPAN :) I've been using Perl for 3 1/2\n    years now.\n\n    Cheers,\n\n    justin",
