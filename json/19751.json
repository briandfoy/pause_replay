Pro/Engineer is an MCAD (mechanical computer aided\n    design) software package widely used in design and manufacturing.\n\n    There is currently no namespace that nests CAD software API's, nor\n    other namespaces that are a direct fit. In the interest of not\n    further congesting the root level, I suggest a new top-level\n    namespace of \"CAD\", with \"CAD::ProEngineer\" as the first member.\n\n    Personally, I'd prefer something at the root level (there are\n    endless examples), but I know that's frowned upon."
