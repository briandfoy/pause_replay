Tk::CustomizableButton is a bit long!\n\n    This Tk Widget allows the programmer to have a customizable\n    graphical button, it allows the programmer to have 3 images\n    associated with a button, one for general display (when the button\n    is left alone), one for when the mouse is over the button and\n    finally one for when the user clicks the and/or holds the left mouse\n    button down over the button.\n\n    It's a small step towards a more customizable Tk GUI requiring less\n    programming from the programmer.\n\n    I couldn't find a customizable button widget on CPAN."
