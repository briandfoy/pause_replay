The basic idea is to have something like CVS, so that\n    a wiki contributor can edit any number of .wiki files locally in the\n    editor of their choice, update with new changes from the wiki\n    server, and commit changes.\n\n    I've written it in Perl to take advantage of the LWP library. It\n    consists of a module and a calling script.",
