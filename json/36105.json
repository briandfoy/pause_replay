Every time someone creates a new game, the problems regarding\n    scoring have to be dealt with again. With this module, those\n    problems are now solved:\n\n    - You can create players, and assign them a default (or not) score;\n    - You can define the scoring method (increasing or decreasing); -\n    You can add or subtract points, assign the score directly, etc.; -\n    You can define victory and defeat conditions; - You can assign code\n    to what to do when a player wins or loses; - You can define what has\n    priority when the player wins and loses at the same time; - You can\n    define conditions that invalidate a new score and force the current\n    one to remain active; - And much, much more.\n\n    This is the wheel of games. Let no one reinvent it again! :-)"
