When\n    combined with this module, and my Image::Maps::Plot::FromLatLong\n    module, it becomes possible to ... use perl to plot IP address on a\n    map! What FUN!!\n\n    The more publicity this gets, the less poor people will have to\n    hand over hard-earned dosh to the Geo::IP company - who claim\n    Geo::IP::Records works for free to supply lat/long, and doesn't.\n    Instead it supplies random strings which change depending on the\n    size of the code accessing them (apparently): requests for support\n    result in requests for money --- not very perl, not very CPAN. This\n    module attempts to correct the error."
