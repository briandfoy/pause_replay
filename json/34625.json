      "rationale" : "Howdy! I'm requesting the Test::LectroTest namespace. Here's the\n    rationale.\n\n    Test::LectroTest is the natural choice for the namespace. A root\n    level name doesn't make sense, and Test is a fitting non-root parent\n    for the module.\n\n    As to why \"Test::*LectroTest*\" and not something else, well, that's\n    a longer story. LectroTest is an automatic, specification-based,\n    random testing system. Ideally, we want name that conveys that idea,\n    but we also want it short enough to be practical. So\n    Test::AutomaticSpecificationBasedAndRandom is out. But\n    Test::Automatic doesn't make the cut, either, because most people\n    equate \"automatic\" tests with those that can be *run* automatically\n    (a la Test::Simple and friends). LectroTest, however, will\n    automatically *create* (and then run) tests for you. So we also need\n    to convey a degree of magicness, which is how I ended up with\n    \"LectroTest.\" That the name also projects a friendly,\n    hey-this-is-fun! quality is a bonus that we can hope will encourage\n    programmers to write more tests and improve the quality of their\n    Perl code. We can always use better code, right?\n\n    If you want to know more about the system, check out the slides for\n    my Perl Mongers talk:\n\n    \"Free Unit Tests in Perl with LectroTest\"\n    http://community.moertel.com/ss/space/Talk+-+Free+Unit+Tests+In+Perl+with+LectroTest\n\n    That's about it. If you have any questions or concerns, please\n    don't hesitate to throw me an email.\n\n    Cheers, Tom"
