The IRRd was designed and\n    written by Merit and is used by RIPE NCC for the Route Arbiter\n    Database, RADB.\n\n    The first version of this module that I uploaded to the CPAN was\n    called IRR.pm. As we all know, this creates a new namespace in the\n    CPAN. Since the Perl module is a TCP client interface to the\n    Internet Routing Registry database server I figured that Net::IRR\n    would be a more appropriate namespace since this module is *VERY*\n    internet specific. The only other idea for names that I've had was\n    DBIx::IRR although this make it confusing as to what this module\n    actually is/does. The fact that the IRR is a highly specialized\n    database server, (note that this is not a relational database\n    server), isn't as important as the fact that this is a client\n    interface that will allow you to connect to a IRRd server on the\n    internet to perform client/server exchanges for internet routing\n    information."
