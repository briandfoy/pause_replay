FedEx calls this service \"FedEx Ship\n    Manager Direct Connect\"\n    (http://www.fedex.com/globaldeveloper/shipapi/).\n\n    Business::FedExDC will provide the necessary communication using\n    LWP and Crypt::SSLeay. This new service is much easier than the\n    previous module (Business::FedEx) as it will talk directly to FedEx\n    and there is no need to install FedEx's JRE-based API.\n\n    Additionally, Business::FedExDC allows full \"non-Win32\"\n    functionality. In the previous version, non-windows users had to\n    proxy to a windows box.\n\n    Thanks, Jay Powers"
