      "rationale" : "GD::SVG is a wrapper around GD methods enabling users who have\n    written scripts to seamlessly export scalable vector graphics (SVG).\n    This was initially created as an offshoot of the BioPerl and Generic\n    Genome Browser (www.gmod.org) projects.\n\n    A seperate module, SVG::GD, was created by Ronan Oger\n    simultaneously as the creation of this module. Ronan and I have\n    communicated on this and have agreed to continue concurrent\n    development with an eye towards merging these modules in the future.\n    In part this was because of three reasons: 1) GD::SVG was created to\n    support an aspect of the bioPerl project. As such, substantial\n    changes to Bioperl code had already been made in order to support\n    the interface of GD::SVG. 2) The modules are currently at different\n    levels of development; 3) SVG::GD aims to delve into more of the\n    raster processing functions of GD - whereas GD::SVG focuses\n    primarily on de novo creation of images from data.\n\n    Thanks,\n\n    Todd Harris"
