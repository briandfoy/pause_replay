I like SOAP as much as the next person,\n    but all that typing gets old and I just want to be able to do :\n\n    my $google = Net::Google->new(key=>LOCAL_GOOGLE_KEY); my $search =\n    $google->search(); $search->query(qw(aaron cope)); map { print\n    $_->title().\"\\n\"; } @{$search->results()}; Is there a naming\n    convention for wrapper-ish packages? I gave it the Net:: prefix\n    since that seemed most appropriate.\n\n    See also :\n    http://aaronland.net/src/perl/net-google/Net-Google-0.1.tar.gz\n    http://aaronland.net/src/perl/net-google/Net-Google.html"
