      "why" : "The primary project I had planned on contributing is described in\n    the following. There is the possibility that I'll find other things\n    to contribute in the future.\n\n    Project Description:\n\n    X11::GUITest is a GPL'd Perl package intended to facilitate the\n    testing of GUI applications by means of user emulation. It can be\n    used to test/interact with GUI applications which have been built\n    upon the X toolkit or those built upon toolkits (i.e., GTK) that\n    \"wrap\" X toolkit's functionality.\n\n    Difference From Existing Solutions:\n\n    Existing solutions such as xmacro or xautomation seem to be\n    cumbersome to implement and maintain use of.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    The Perl package (X11::GUITest) exports the necessary higher level\n    functions to perform GUI interaction through user emulation. Example\n    functions exported: SendKeys, FindWindowLike, WaitWindowLike,\n    StartApp, RunApp, ClickMouse, IconifyWindow, UnIconifyWindow,\n    RaiseWindow, IsWindowViewable, GetChildWindows, etc. There are\n    currently about 10 more functions in addition to this...\n\n    Inspiration:\n\n    Inspiration for this project came from my development work on the\n    GPL'd Win32::GUITest package.\n\n    Libraries Used:\n\n    Xlib, XTest\n\n    Programming Language:\n\n    Perl, C\n\n    Operating System Support:\n\n    I have developed the package under Linux without using any Linux\n    specific technologies, so as the name of X11::GUITest implies(->\n    X11), I'll be happy to help support and modify my package to work on\n    any Operating System that provides a compatible X server, such as\n    FreeBSD.\n\n    Enhancements:\n\n    I plan on maintaining enhancements to this package and welcome\n    community involvement in doing so.\n\n    Thank You,\n\n    Dennis K. Paulsen",
