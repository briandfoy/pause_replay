Each key term in the Binder may be unbound\n    (associated with an undef value), or bound to a defined scalar\n    value. Unbound keys may be bound to anything, and bound keys may\n    only be bound to identical values. Attempts to bind a new set of\n    values succeeds completely or fails without changes.\n\n    This module is of general usefulness, but will be a dependency for\n    upcoming HALLEY modules to be submitted later."
