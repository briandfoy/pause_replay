I have contacted the author\n    of that C library with a view to making the code available under the\n    usual Perl licence (GNU GPL / Artistic): he is currently\n    investigating the purity of the code and will reply to me shortly.\n\n    Lastly, there is already a Win32::FileTime module on CPAN, but that\n    has nothing to do with this bug: it simply provides an OO interface\n    for retrieving file times, much like the standard File::stat module,\n    in fact."
