      "rationale" : "Log::Procmail is a small module to read procmail logfiles.\n\n    Most of this rationale is pasted from what I submitted on Thu, 7\n    Feb 2002. See the following link:\n    http://archive.develooper.com/modules@perl.org/msg10035.html\n\n    Finding the proper name was the main problem. After browsing CPAN a\n    little, I have come up with several plausible names: - Log::Procmail\n    - Mail::Procmail::Log - Mail::ProcmailLog - Logfile::Procmail\n\n    But, each name came with a different problem: - The Log:: directory\n    looks like it's holding logging tools (like Log::Agent) and not log\n    parsing tools. - Mail::Procmail is a procmail-like tool, while this\n    module reads logs from the original procmail. They are not related,\n    but the name similarity might confuse potential users. And\n    Mail::Procmail::Log is quite long for such a small module. -\n    Mail::ProcmailLog doesn't sound that good. Personal taste. -\n    Logfile::Procmail should inherit from Logfile::Base, as most of the\n    other Logfile:: modules do, which isn't the case for this particular\n    module.\n\n    I suppose then that the choice was really between\n    Mail::Procmail::Log and Log::Procmail.\n\n    So I chose Log::Procmail. Now in version 0.04, which is quite\n    stable. It's not very difficult to change the name of the module,\n    since to my knowledge, nobody is actually using it.\n\n    Thanks for your help in including this small module in the module\n    list."
