Nothing else I have ever seen does something in\n    this manor. FLDBM requires only one module file to work, and it's\n    fast and light on a systems resources.\n\n    FLDBM can be used on any system with perl, unlike\n    BerkeleyDB/DB_File, FLDBM does not require anything else for it to\n    work. DB_File and BerkeleyDB can seem a tad confusing to a lot of\n    folks, that's why FLDBM is also easy to use and simple to\n    understand.\n\n    I truly feel FLDBM could have a great future if it is given the\n    chance to develop."
