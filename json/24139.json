In the\n    future I may make this module Math::Gradient::PurePerl and write a\n    C-based version as well for speed enhancement.\n\n    Mathematical gradients are an essential part of both graphics\n    manipulation and statistics. I looked for a module that would\n    calculate simple gradients on CPAN and could not find one, and I\n    have two projects that I am working on right now that require such\n    functionality. I felt this module would be useful to others as well\n    because of it's application in graphics especially; the ability to\n    generate fully gradient palettes for use in dynamic webpages seems\n    really, really neat, and there's dozens of other applications as\n    well."
