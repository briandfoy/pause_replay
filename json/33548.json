There\n    were significant changes between gtk+ 1.x and 2.x that prevented the\n    bindings from being able to bind both in any resonable manner. In\n    addition both Gtk and Gtk2 are widely used and often will need to\n    co-exist on systems.\n\n    The Gtk2-Perl set of modules are part of the official Gnome\n    Language Bindings set which requires adhereance to a set of rules\n    about api stability and release numbering. The bindings are pretty\n    complete (api-wise) as are the tests."
