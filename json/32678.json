I havent't seen anything comparable\n    in the module list. Although it is a library on a very specialized\n    subject, I think it's worth having it on the module list it groups\n    some of the methods standard in the field. It can help people new to\n    the field. Furthermore, being in the module list, it can get\n    contributions from other people. I think the only reason to reject\n    it would be because the field is too specialized."
