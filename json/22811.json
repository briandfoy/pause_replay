The last bit is shortened to Ver from Version,\n    because the Microsoft library it links to is called version.dll and\n    if they have the same name the Microsoft compiler gets confused.\n\n    Also, there already was a module of the same name that did the same\n    thing (albeit using Win32::API, not XS) that was written by Mike\n    Blazer sometime in 1999. This seems to have vanished off the face of\n    the earth (and was never on CPAN).\n\n    This module is a perl wrapper for the Win32 Version API. It lets\n    you read the version information resource from files in the\n    Microsoft Portable Executable (PE) format (including programs, DLLs,\n    fonts, etc).\n\n    This module is useful for writing installers, or other tools that\n    need to deal with versioned programs or DLLs."
