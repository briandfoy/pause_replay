They link to a C library called SinisterSdp using\n    XSubs.\n\n    I originally proposed SDP::Parser and SDP::Generator, but Brian D\n    Foy recommended against them citing their nonspecifically, and I\n    have to agree with him (Bluetooth, for example, has its own thing\n    called \"SDP,\" and there are probably a few other common technologies\n    using that acronym as well).\n\n    This name seems pretty accurate and descriptive. Yes, SDP isn't\n    exactly multimedia, but it describes it, which I think is close\n    enough."
