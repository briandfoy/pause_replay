      "why" : "I am working on developing a frontend for flac123, a command line\n    flac music player. This is to be the major component of a flac music\n    player, aflac, also written in perl, that attempts to replicate the\n    ipod interface on an lcd, using proclcd to write to the lcd. This\n    program will be controlled using an IR remote and is intended to be\n    run as a music appliance in a home or car setting. Eventually, I\n    will post instructions on how to build this computer so that it\n    boots up quickly, (root partition on a CF card) and starts my aflac\n    program. There will be a hard drive in the computer that contains\n    all the flac files, more file types to come later, and aflac will\n    generate an XML database file with all the flac file info for use in\n    the browse section of the interface. I guess that is more than you\n    needed, hehe. Thanks! Joshua",
