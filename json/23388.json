Error handling is standardized. * Full API Access:\n    Pass-through arbitrary SQL and allow access to entire DBI API for\n    cases when high-level interfaces are insufficient or inconvenient. *\n    Portability: Dynamic subclassing (via DBIx::AnyDBD) to allow\n    platform-specific support for driver idiosyncrasies and DBMS\n    workarounds.\n\n    The DBIx namespace seems to have emerged as the standard place for\n    modules like this."
