It doesn't do half of what that module does,\n    but what it does do is provide just the functions needed for drawing\n    and processing forms, which makes it light-weight compared to\n    CGI.pm. It also provides for reasonable defaults for many field\n    attributes, meaning less typing. And it also (optionally) draws your\n    form in a nice table format, making for a more readable layout."
