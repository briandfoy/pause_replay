I wrote/am\n    writing a Perl Module that determines variable length n-grams using\n    suffix arrays. An n-gram is a sequence of 'n' tokens that occur in a\n    given text. The module has different options, such as the ability to\n    define a stoplist, define a token, remove nontoken characters, to\n    name a few. I called the module Array::Suffix and rather hope to\n    keep that name if it is okay. I didn't find another module of that\n    name. If you need more information or have any questions, please\n    email.\n\n    Thank you for your time,\n\n    Bridget Thomson McInnes bthomson@d.umn.edu",
