However, glib-2 is a\n    very useful library on it's own, as it offers an event model similar\n    to event, cross-platform-utility functions, an object and type\n    system more.\n\n    Thus it's only reasonable to unbundle it so users can take\n    advantage of it without having to install and use Gtk2.\n\n    The new toplevel namespace makes sense because the module name is\n    sufficiently unique, and doesn't fit into any existing \"category\"\n    (also, I think that categories and namespaces are distinct\n    things...)."
