I try to introduce an\n    abstraction level that I have not found in any other modules, and\n    hopefully this abstraction level may help me to use other people's\n    code in my framework by subclassing it. The listed with similar\n    functionality does nothing like what I do, but they are examples of\n    other ways to achieve the same thing, and perhaps I can use them in\n    the future. The choice of name is rather obvious, it is an\n    application on the top of AxKit, and AxKit::App exists allready with\n    AxKit::App::Gallery."
