It does not\n    support the (often) complex threading models that other BEEP\n    implementations have. Because of this, it does not directly support\n    some of the use cases that BEEP is known to handle (specifically\n    highly-multiplexed or peer-to-peer appliations).\n\n    This name also creates a ready-made name for a more full-featured\n    implementation (Net::BEEP).\n\n    As far as I could tell, there are no other Perl BEEP\n    implementations of any sort."
