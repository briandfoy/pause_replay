      "rationale" : "In testing, we generally want tests to create and destroy all their\n    own data. When writing Class::DBI-based projects, it's helpful to\n    have a test database in which to do this, so that we can (a) be sure\n    we're not stepping on production data, and (b) be sure of exactly\n    what data is in the test database at the beginning/end of each test.\n\n    Class::DBI::Test::TempDB handles the creation and destruction of a\n    temporary SQLite database on disk; it also allows you to point your\n    Class::DBI classes at the test database. You can then get on with\n    creating, testing and destroying test data simply by interacting\n    with your Class::DBI classes.\n\n    The name for this module was suggested to me by Tony Bowden on the\n    Class::DBI mailing list."
