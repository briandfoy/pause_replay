It would fit under \"Misc. Apache\n    modules\", along other mod_perl applications that have their own\n    top-level namespace. 3) Chronos is not a library, does not implement\n    any standard and has no interface (well, yes, it does, as does any\n    module, but it's not meant to be used by a third-party)."
