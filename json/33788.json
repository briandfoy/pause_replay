Everybody\n    found it nice, and useful (even with fun desactivated) It as simple\n    as Log::Simple, or Log::Logger, and you can add loglevel, choose\n    between logging to STDERR and a file, choose the prefix of the\n    lines, see the calling subroutine (and even see the subroutine that\n    called the subroutine that called the ... Ok, you see :) ), and, of\n    course, add a bit of fun to you logs (between 0% and 100%)\n    Basically, it just logs with a loglevel in a flexible way :)\n\n    In a few words: it works, it works well, its flexible, and its fun!"
