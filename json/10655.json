It provides default\n    error handling, and provides what I think is a nice syntax to\n    clearly delineate the parent and child code.\n\n    Proc::Forkfunc is rather limited, and seems not to have been\n    updated since 1996. (also, I think Proc::Fork is a more sensible\n    name than \"Forkfunc\", but that's my own prejudice, no doubt).\n\n    It's not tested as thoroughly as I'd like, hence the \"alpha\"\n    status, and the fact that test.pl has no test cases. If any of the\n    CPAN testers out there can suggest nice test cases, I'd be grateful."
