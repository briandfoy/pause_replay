It makes\n    Perl I/O more easy for the Perl neophyte, and dramatically\n    simplifies complex/multi-step I/O operations (take the automatic,\n    intelligent file locking, for example).\n\n    Its second goal is to do all this in the most portable manner\n    possible so that users of this module wonât have to worry about\n    whether their programs will work on other OSes and machines.\n\n    This module has been on CPAN for over 5 years. It's probably mature\n    enough for an official namespace assignment now. It is not for\n    notoriety that its author seeks the official namespace, but is the\n    hope that this module can make Perl I/O more \"fun\", more safe, less\n    error prone, and less confusing for its users.\n\n    -- Tommy Butler"
