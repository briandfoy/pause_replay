Each panel acts as if it is a\n    stand-alone app (eg it's parameter list does not affect the\n    parameter list of other applications) and can generate and respond\n    to events (eg a button or link click can generate an event that is\n    responded to by the panel).\n\n    Each panel object would inherit from CGI::Panel, except the main\n    panel (which manages the sessions and dispatches the events) which\n    inherits from CGI::Panel::MainPanel. I think CGI::Panel is a good\n    choice of namespace as it sums up what the module does.\n\n    I am currently working on CGI::Panel::Tutorial which will teach a\n    beginner how to use the system and also a test suite."
