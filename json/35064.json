I find his module is too complex for\n    the most often used basic functionality - that is, to get the names\n    (namedays) for a given date. Also, his module cannot handle multiple\n    names for a day, which is a big problem for example in Hungary,\n    where more names are associated to one day. Leap years behave\n    interestingly in Hungary when it comes to namedays, too.\n\n    Date::Namedays::Simple is an abstract class for handling namedays.\n    The first package will also contain\n    Date::Namedays::Simple::Hungarian. (Probably Date::Event::Nameday\n    will use this module later, too.) I hope I can find local\n    maintainers for different countries - I will only write and\n    regularly update the base class and the Hungarian extension.\n\n    I think this module belongs to just under Date::, rather than\n    Date::Event. This package will (mostly) be used by portals/portal\n    engines/websites to simply get the namedays for the actual day.\n    However, it might rather belong to chapter 13 (Internationalization\n    and Locale)."
