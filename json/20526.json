It provides an OO framework for creating\n    console-based menus including hotkeys, context-sensitive help,\n    colors, styles, etc (it is not equivalent to perlmenu). I made some\n    improvements after comments from PodMaster at perlmonks.org and\n    think it is ready for the general public now. See\n    http://huizen.dto.tudelft.nl/devries/files/Term-ANSIMenu-0.02.tar.gz\n\n    After that module is accepted I plan on finishing a module\n    extending the GD::Graph offerings.",
