I work mainly in Windows machines\n    and life is not easy compared to the Unix toolkit Perl developers\n    take for granted. I also have some code I intend to publish on CPAN,\n    but I need to polish it and check with others if they are worth or\n    if I am just repeating existing modules. My interests are wide, from\n    SQL statements with named placholders (:a instead of ?) to IRC bots.",
