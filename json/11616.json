The interface is intended\n    to be as close to the script's as possible, implementing all\n    features (and supporting the \"links dictionary\" as used by txt2html\n    also). Thus its feature-set (and interface) is incompatible with\n    that of HTML::FromText, the only existing module I could find with\n    any kind of similar functionality. I have attempted to contact the\n    author of HTML::FromText, but his email address bounced, and\n    considering that his last update of the module was in 1999, I\n    suspect it is an orphaned module. (I have also contacted Seth Golub,\n    and he is quite happy that I do the port)."
