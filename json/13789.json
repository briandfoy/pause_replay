There appear to be no other modules which implement IP routing\n    protocols, so choosing BGP for the module name will cause no\n    namespace conflicts and the module aims to be a general and flexible\n    API which would serve as a good foundation for any more specific\n    BGP-related tasks, so it (hopefully) would fulfill and preempt any\n    other designs on the Net::BGP namespace anybody might have."
