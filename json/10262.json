I.e taking values\n    from the columns of a table and using as row and column headers in\n    the new table, I have found the functionality in MS excel and a\n    number of other properitary spread sheet and data base packages. I\n    have been thinking about making this module for a while to avoid\n    having to start up excel each time I need to 'pivot' a table, I have\n    also seen several queries for this functionality on some of the\n    postgreSQL mailing lists.\n\n    For development, I have been using the namespace Table::Pivot, but\n    to my surprise, no root level name space Table exists, I think that\n    DBIx is the closest rlns, since (at least for me...) most of the use\n    of the module will be in connection with DBI, although it is by no\n    means limited to that."
