Conventionally, partial solutions are coded inline;\n    often they then fail under unexpected circumstances. This is exactly\n    the kind of thing that should be done properly, once and for all, in\n    a module. Apparently no one has already done this on CPAN.\n\n    IPC::Open2 is obviously related, being the usual substrate for ad\n    hoc implementations of filtering. It's much lower level than what\n    this module implements."
