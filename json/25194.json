It's not perfect, but it does most of what I\n    needed. At this stage it may be useful for others, and they might be\n    able to enhance it further.\n\n    I have seen tools like this in Java editors (Eclipse and CodeGuide)\n    and decided that it would be useful for Perl coding on the occasions\n    that I have found myself putting too much functionality in too few\n    subs."
