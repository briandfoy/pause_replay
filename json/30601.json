A\n    published .disco file, which is an XML document that contains links\n    to other resources that describe the XML Web service (e.g. an HTML\n    description or a WSDL description), enables programmatic discovery\n    of an XML Web service. Many .NET Web Services expose this\n    information; the module creates a simple API access to the\n    information within these file types. I am not to sure about where to\n    put the module, since there is no \"Web Services\" category yet. SOAP\n    has its own new rootlevel namespace. Maybe one could put this into\n    the XML namespace, but I am uncertain about that."
