A\n    dozen of different rule sets exist for boards 8x8, 10x10, 12x12 and\n    14x14.\n\n    I believe that the design I use (as shown in\n    http://migo.sixbit.org/papers/AI_and_Perl/checkers-classes.png) is\n    good and probably applicable to other 2-player full-information\n    board games as well.\n\n    The first please-initially-test public version is available at\n    http://migo.sixbit.org/software/checkers/ (it's not really\n    announced). Unpack the tarball and run one or another script in bin/\n    directory as is, this should automatically play checkers in console.\n    Both scripts accept --help option.\n\n    If for some reason the Games::Checkers namespace is not available,\n    I would like to use the Gaminx::Checkers namespace that is used in\n    the initial 0.0.1 release."
