Since I already\n    have working code to do this, I figured it would make a good\n    addition to CPAN.\n\n    What makes it unique (compared to Geo::PostalCode): -it uses DBI\n    instead of Berkeley DB as a source of data -features the option to\n    use a less-accurate, but higher-speed query for very time-sensitive\n    applications -built to work with the publicly-available US Census\n    2000 ZCTA data (which I'm planning to possibly bundle with the\n    module), but can be configured to use other sources (such as\n    commercial zip code databases)"
