A lot of people tend to find the number of variables\n    needed to handle the widgets in a Tk program confusing and, while a\n    number of soloutions are possible none of the ones suggested are\n    really general purpose and all required an overhead of coding.\n\n    The whole idea of this module is to remove the work required in\n    organising and structuring the variables. The fact that it works on\n    a heirarchy basis means that you can access variables like\n    $mw->frame1->label1 and $mw->frame2->label1 etc meaning that similar\n    frames, windows, etc can have identical sub-widget names which can\n    be a much lighter load on the memory!
