These are devices which\n    control and measure the amount of power in and out of a device or\n    power store. The Plasmatronics series of regulators are designed for\n    charging (measure and control) of batteries, usually used for Solar\n    Power, Wind, Generators etc. Although there are currently no other\n    regulator interfaces on CPAN, it seems to make sense that they are\n    grouped together. Device covers things like modems which are\n    external bits of equipment connected via serial ports, as are most\n    Regulator Interfaces."
