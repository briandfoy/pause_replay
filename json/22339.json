      "rationale" : "The File::MimeInfo works similar to File::MMagic but where MMagic\n    seems to be written to adopt a zoo of magic file, MimeInfo is very\n    particularly ment for usage with the shared mime info database of\n    the freedesktop project <http://freedesktop.org>. It tries to\n    conform as far as possible to the freedesktop specifications for\n    this. The advantage of this that the format of the database files is\n    known in detail. The freedesktop mime database is packaged available\n    for all major linux ditributions.\n\n    I considered using a namespace below the MMagic namespace, but I\n    felt this would be to cryptic for most users.\n\n    Currently only the determining of a mime type from the globs file\n    is supported, but other projects implementing (like for example rox\n    <http://rox.sf.net>) do the same, so it provides compatibility."
