      "rationale" : "1. Why this module\n\n    Math::RPN only provides RPN expression evalution, and the semantics\n    of the evaluation are different from this module (and the HP RPN\n    calculators on which this module was based). Namely, this module has\n    a register.\n\n    Tk::Calculator::RPN::HP, though very similar, is a Tk module, and\n    essentially requires a GUI. RPN, on the other hand, provides by\n    default only an IO-handle interface, and a simple interactive\n    frontend, rpnc. However, it can be easily overridden; the\n    command-line interface is only about 10 lines.\n\n    2. Why this namespace\n\n    Math::RPN is already in use, and Math:: is the only obvious place\n    (after browsing the module-list)\n\n    3. Current status\n\n    After I get a chance to write a readme and some tests, I'll\n    activate the mailing-list above and upload the module to PAUSE. It\n    should be uploaded within the next week. It is already (AFAIK) fully\n    functional."
