      "why" : "I'm planning on contributing a module : CGI::FormManager. Its\n    functionality is somewhere between the simple form support found in\n    CGI.pm (start_form(), checkbox_group(), etc) and the full-blown\n    templating system found in HTML::Template.\n\n    In FormManager, forms are created, along with their form elements:\n    $fm = new FormManager (); $fm->addComponent (FormManager::Text\n    (heading=\"First Name\", name='fname' validate=>'alphanumeric'));\n\n    The form can then be generated with $fm->getFormHtml(), and when\n    the form is submitted, the results can be read with:\n\n    $fm->processQuery($a_cgi_instance); $fname =\n    $fm->getValue('fname');\n\n    I've found this module to be very useful in large forms where the\n    user might make a mistake. FormManager can return the form again,\n    with the errors listed at the top of the screen, and all of the\n    fields retaining their previous values. It's also a great way to\n    make a quick and dirty form that validates its input.\n\n    Hope that qualifies as a \"short description\".\n\n    Cheers! James",
