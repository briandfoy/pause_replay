It's\n    very useful, not only for use as vector data, but because it can be\n    converted to an image of the world for prorgrams which handle images\n    (web-applications, for example).\n\n    The data is published by the University of Hawaii, and available as\n    a set of binary data files. I have a perl module which can read such\n    data, and thought it might be useful to publish that on CPAN for\n    others to use.\n\n    I'm suggesting the *::PurePerl namespace, so that if somebody\n    writes an implementation in C (which will likely be faster, hence\n    more useful), then I won't get in the way of any later modules.\n\n    I'm suggesting Geo::* rather than Geography::* because it seems to\n    be common among other modules such as Geo::Shapefile, although the\n    Geography::* namespace has started to appear recently\n\n    I'm suggesting Geo::* rather than GIS::* or Cartography::*, because\n    neither of those would show up in a search for \"Geo\" which might be\n    initiated by anyone looking for modules similar to Geo::ShapeFile\n    and Geo::GeoIP, Geo::OSGB, etc.\n\n    Web links to the data files, and to a description of GSHHS itself\n    can be found at: http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhs/gshhs.html\n    ftp://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/pub/pwessel/gshhs\n\n    Regards,\n\n    OJW"
