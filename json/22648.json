The\n    purpose of the package is to provide a unified interface to these\n    different programs and provide the means to design and test PCR\n    primers with the same. The Primers and e-PCR programs are both\n    unix-specific binaries. Another advantage offered by this package is\n    that it supports platform indepenendent programatic access to the\n    programs via a remote server.",
