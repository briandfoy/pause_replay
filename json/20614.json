Locale::Maketext lacks the full lexicon management\n    tools that GNU gettext has. Locale::Maketext::Lexicon tries to seal\n    this gap, but it is not working. It is not platform independent,\n    either, since it uses msgunfmt from GNU gettext, and msgunfmt is not\n    available on non-GNU systems. Locale::Maketext::Gettext is a\n    replacement of Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. It dedicates itself to\n    bridge GNU gettext to Locale::Maketext, with almost the same way of\n    working. It is working, simple, and it is a lot faster than\n    Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. In the future I would like to implement\n    some sort of smart encoding conversion, like what GNU gettext does\n    now, to make it a smarter wrapper to the Locale::Maketext class."
