I think the module fits into the existing Language::\n    namespace. Since it's possible I, or someone else, may write other\n    Frink related modules, I thought it best to qualify it with ::Eval,\n    to limit the scope.\n\n    Blurb from the Frink web page: \"Frink is a practical calculating\n    tool and programming language designed to help us all to better\n    understand the world around us, to help us get calculations right\n    without getting bogged down in the mechanics, and to make a tool\n    that's really useful in the real world.\"\n\n    More information on Frink can be found at\n    http://futureboy.homeip.net/frinkdocs/"
