However it is flexible enough to\n    be used for other needs beyond chatting, such as filesharing which\n    is actually done. PSYC has some similarities to jabber but PSYC is\n    capable of distributing messages to a group in an efficient manner\n    and supports binary data.\n\n    A full server implementation of PSYC including support for several\n    other chat-protocols (jabber, irc, telnet-interface) can be found at\n    http://muve.pages.de."
