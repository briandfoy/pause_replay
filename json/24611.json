I believe this\n    choice is the best comopromise among many factors that we've already\n    discussed. I'll elaborate if you need more detail.\n\n    Bio::Prospect is uses other Bio:: modules (from bioperl) and is in\n    that sense related to them. There are no other modules with similar\n    functionality (i.e., execution, manipulation, and visualization of\n    protein threading alignments generated by Prospect).\n\n    Thanks, Reece"
