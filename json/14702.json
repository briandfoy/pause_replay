Not all\n    traceroute implementations are taken into account. By implementing\n    the traceroute functionality in native perl, we avoid having to\n    parse the many different traceroutes.\n\n    Net::Traceroute::Native avoids removing the current user base.\n    Also, the raw sockets require root access, so it is good to keep a\n    fallback for the security minded. HAG (owner of Net::Traceroute) and\n    I have spoken about this and he has made changes to allow this\n    subclass.\n\n    tscanlan"
