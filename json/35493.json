We have uploaded it already to\n    CPAN, but would like it officially accepted into the module list.\n\n    The framework is such, that hopefully any country in the world\n    could plug in the corresponding country module and any city/state\n    modules they need and be able to process their payroll. Definitely\n    the US is doable (by design), once someone implements the necessary\n    info for their specific state and city taxes.\n\n    I'm selecting the Miscellaneous Modules section as none of the\n    listed sections come close to representing the nature of this\n    module.\n\n    Thanks for your consideration."
