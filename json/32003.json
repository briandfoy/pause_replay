For this reason,\n    newsgroup participants recommended that the module be named\n    Digest::SHA. This module conforms to all naming conventions and\n    interface styles specified in the CPAN Digest module.\n\n    I submitted a registration request for this module over 7 months\n    ago. Brian D. Foy informs me that he was unable to find the\n    registration data for this module. So, he recommended that I\n    re-submit it, and he would personally attend to getting it\n    registered.
