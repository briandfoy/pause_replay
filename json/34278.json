I don't have access to enough\n    modems to be able to say that it's totally portable. I also have an\n    application that's built off of the module that provides a \"works\n    for me\" implementation of a passive answering service (i.e. phone\n    rings, program can trigger instant messaging, email reporting... i\n    have a web interface to the caller log so the user can do their own\n    reporting, etc.)\n\n    I've done lots of programming across the board but not much\n    contributing, so I figure this is the logical second step (first\n    step being writing code to publish, of course)",
