      "rationale" : "Basically, for good reasons perl only allows setuid programs to\n    either use \"use lib\" or the compiled in values for @INC to search\n    for modules. This module allows admins and developers to specify a\n    config file (or config files) containing library paths, that are\n    then used to alter @INC. This is very much in the same vein as ld's\n    use of /etc/ld.so.conf. I have written some code that implents this,\n    and it seems to work fine, but it obviously needs some more work to\n    handle things like taint checking and further checks on the config\n    file(s) specified (for instance it now checks that uid and gid are 0\n    and 0 respectively and the perms are 0444, but checks on the\n    ownership and permissions of the parent directory are probably in\n    order).\n\n    So since it is trying to allow for configuration of the search\n    module/library search path in a secure way, I choose\n    Security::LibPath as its name space (but any other suggestions are\n    most welcome).\n\n    Cheers...james"
