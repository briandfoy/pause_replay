      "why" : "A company called TIBCO produces a product called TIB/Rendezvous. It\n    is a proprietary publish/subscribe message-passing API. It's\n    basically a C library with C++ and Java API's built over it, along\n    with a very simple Perl XS module (it's little more than wrappers\n    around the C functions).\n\n    I am writing better Perl bindings for it (using Inline, actually),\n    and putting it all together in an OO API. I'm hoping to use the\n    Tib::Rv namespace.\n\n    My code will be licensed under the same terms as Perl itself, but\n    TIBCO only provides a developer version for free (otherwise, it's\n    pretty spendy).",
