The only one I've put for public release is\n    SCSI.pm <http://www.cabal.org.uk/freeware/scsi-perl.html> along with\n    a sample application that rips CDs.\n\n    Sat in the wings is an inteface for tun0, so one can write tunnels\n    in pure Perl. Again, I have a proof-of-concept that does tunneling\n    via DNS servers using Net::DNS.\n\n    Unsurprisingly, I've also got YA HTML templating system, lovingly\n    hand-crufted. It does the page rendering for my website and has a\n    few features (the main one being that embedded code markup doesn't\n    stop the document from being validating SGML) that I couldn't find\n    in other such things at the time.",
