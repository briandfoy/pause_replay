To enable remote control of Windows via\n    TCP/IP there is now an 'Internet Events' (IEvents for short) API for\n    Girder.\n\n    There already exists Java and C# example code, but no perl - so I\n    came up with:\n\n    Win32::Girder::IEvents::Client - Talk to a Girder instance\n    Win32::Girder::IEvents::Server - Pretend to be a Girder instance\n\n    I avoided Win32::Girder::xxxxx because that may later be needed for\n    a direct Windows level interface.\n\n    For more information about Girder (which really is very cool ;-),\n    see http://www.girder.nl/"
