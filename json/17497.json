Encode::HanConvert provides perl functions\n    to support Simplified-Traditional mappings.\n\n    Encode::CNMap can be viewd as an enhanced version of Encode::CN,\n    and a new realization of Encode::HanConvert.\n\n    In addition, Encode::CNMap provides two command-line utilities to\n    support file and recursively directory convertions."
