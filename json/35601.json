Part of this\n    saved money is in its turn placed into funds via a state\n    organization called PPM (Premiepensionsmyndighet).\n\n    PPM gives to every Swedish pension saver the possibility to choose\n    in which funds to place his/her money and to change funds at no cost\n    and as often as wanted. In other terms, PPM is a low cost and high\n    quality fund placement bank, where you start getting your money back\n    only upon retiring.\n\n    All those transactions (account status, changing funds...) can be\n    performed via PPM's webportal, www.ppm.nu.\n\n    Finance::PPM offers an object oriented interface for performing\n    fund related transactions on a pension saver's account. It is a\n    wrapper around PPM's web portal and is designed to be integrated\n    into later account monitoring and managing tools."
