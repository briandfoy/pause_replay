The parsed data\n    is a complex structure like:\n\n    $parsed = { CDNAME => [['ID3 NAME','SECONDS','FULLPATH']]]};\n\n    It parses EXTINF lines (where MP3::M3U just ignores them) in a\n    playlist to get the 'ID3 NAME' and 'SECONDS' data, if it does not\n    exist they will be empty.\n\n    Also there are some methods to get some info of the songs like:\n    total_time, total_songs, average_time etc...\n\n    Also I've added an export() method to show the parsed data in a\n    visual context (html) it can also export the data to a xml file for\n    using in other applications.\n\n    Also there is a basic case-insensitive search option to filter the\n    parsing.\n\n    So, it is totally different (and has more options) than the\n    MP3::M3U module and I want to name it MP3::M3U::Parser (I think that\n    there is not a problem since there are billions of pod parsers doing\n    the same thing :))."
