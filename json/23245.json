There is currently a\n    module called Business::FedEx::DirectConnect which does allow one to\n    interface with FedEx via this API. However, its interface can only\n    be described as difficult to use. In order to properly use this\n    module, you must consult the Transaction Guide which is a mere 156\n    pages. I plan to make a module that should allow a company to become\n    certified within a matter of two days(you must submit labels to\n    FedEx).\n\n    Thank you",
