The\n    documentation is not yet ready and probably won't be for a short\n    time. If permitted, I'll make my contribution in a few weeks. I have\n    other modules that I'd like to contribute, but they are not yet\n    ready. These include an interface and advancements on\n    Time::ParseDate to include date formatting and slightly more complex\n    date requests. Also, an IO::Socket/IO::Select-based multiplexing\n    server/client module that will enable a program to become a server\n    on any requested port or connect to any remote host and port\n    requested (permissions permitting, of course). This transponder code\n    has been designed for usage on both Linux and Windows. It's been\n    tested on several distributions of Linux, Windows 98, Windows 2000,\n    and Windows XP. Also there are various little modules like a PID\n    handler and specialized log handler.",
