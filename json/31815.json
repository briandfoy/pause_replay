This module (Chunks)\n    has been running in production Web environments since 2001\n    (Apache/mod_perl), so it's very stable. Currently working on\n    enhancements which make localized content easier to create and\n    present. Includes POD, and will have Makefile.pl before uploaded.\n    Created and currently maintained by myself and Mark Blythe.",
