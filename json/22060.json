And because when I\n    went looking for a module that did this, I first went to Net::HTTP*\n    and didn't find anything except Net::HTTPTunnel.\n\n    This is different from HTTP::Daemon in that HTTP::Daemon gives you\n    a low level access to a web server. HTTPServer gives you a full web\n    server that can serve files right out of the box, but is very light\n    weight. It is meant to be used in several ways:\n\n    1) embedded in another program that needs to serve files on the fly\n\n    2) stand alone application that can serve up existsing\n    documentation, and provide an internal search functionality to\n    search that documentation\n\n    3) Turn your CGI program into a stand alone program.\n\n    and lots lots more possibilities.\n\n    I didn't depend on HTTP::Daemon because to get that, you have to\n    get ALL of the libwww modules and files. HTTPServer is a single\n    file, and thus sticks with my light weight goal."
