Declension of russian given names is similar with declension\n    of common nouns and adjectives: I plan to extend functionality of\n    module to decline common words too.\n\n    Russian word \"skloneniye\" translated as \"declension\", but some\n    linguistic modules for other languages named Lingua::*::Inflect (*\n    == EN, FI, PT). May be Lingua::RU::Inflect is good name for my\n    module?"
