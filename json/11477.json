      "rationale" : "There's already a root namespace 'Convert', which is obviously the\n    best for a module that deals with data conversion. 'Binary' is\n    because the module converts between binary data and Perl data\n    structures. 'C' is because C data type definitions are used to\n    describe the conversion. The module name was suggested by Mark\n    Overmeer, and a lot of people (including myself) liked it a lot\n    better than the name I chose initially.\n\n    The module includes a preprocessor, scanner & parser that extract\n    all information about enum's, struct's, union's and typedef's from C\n    source code and allows to use this information primarily to pack and\n    unpack data through an (hopefully) easy to use OO interface. The\n    module is (almost) completely written in XS and builds on all\n    platforms that I've been able to test it on (these include Win32,\n    Cygwin, Linux and HP-UX).\n\n    The module should be in the module list because there's currently\n    only one similar module available (C::Include) which lacks a lot of\n    the functionality provided by Convert::Binary::C.\n\n    If you want to have a look at the manpage, a recent online version\n    is available at:\n\n    http://www-stud.fh-fulda.de/~fd9099/download/Convert-Binary-C.html"
