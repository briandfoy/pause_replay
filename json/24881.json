This is a package that allows\n    uses to count up sequences of words in large samples of text, and\n    find out which character sequences are particularly interesting.\n    This is a released package that is used in Natural Language\n    Processing research. It deals with Text in any language, hence the\n    name Text::NSP. The package is reasonably mature, but still under\n    active development. We are currently making it more modular in order\n    to release via CPAN. The existing sites for NSP include the\n    following:\n\n    http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html\n    http://ngram.sourceforge.net\n\n    We believe that CPAN distribution is also important, since the\n    package is written in Perl and would be of interest to the Perl\n    world.\n\n    Text::ngram is not quite as developed a package as Text::NSP."
