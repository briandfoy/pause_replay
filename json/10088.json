Tickets and users have a many-to-many relationship.\n    One user could be useing multiple browsers and so logged in under\n    several tickets simultaneously, or multiple users could\n    consequitively (not simultaneously) use the same the same ticket in\n    one browser.\n\n    So, the ticket metaphor is relevant, and differs from other common\n    ways of handling user login sessions.
