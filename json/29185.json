The\n    Wabby part of the name comes from the fact that it is based upon an\n    earlier IRC bot called 'wabbylegs'. I have greatly enjoyed using\n    Silly::Wabby to annoy people on IRC and AIM while writing it, and\n    think it needs to be shared with the rest of the Perl world.\n\n    Silly::Werder performs a vaguely similar function, except that it\n    deals with syllables within words. Algorithm::MarkovChain is a more\n    generalized Markov chain implementation, but doesn't suit my more\n    specific needs (in particular the memory usage is very high, and it\n    doesn't seem to generate chains in a manner which suits my usage).\n\n    I chose chapter 11 because this module really does not fit well\n    into the chapers in which Acme is registered: 2 (not a Perl language\n    extension or core module), 9 (not an interface or emulation of\n    another language), or 15 (Does not deal with the WWW, HTML, CGI,\n    etc...). The best fit seems to be under 11."
