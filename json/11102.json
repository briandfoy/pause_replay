It uses Device::SerialPort to connect to serial port and\n    implements some frequently-used low-level AT commands in a simple\n    way, with automatic user request / modem response cycles. It may be\n    appropriate to place it under \"Device::\" because it does not\n    implement any type of application over serial links, but only an\n    interface layer that (i hope) simplifies the task of talking to a\n    modem."
