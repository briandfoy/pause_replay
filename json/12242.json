I'm too lazy to write always something like\n\n    my @files = (<*.*>); my $rand_file = $files[rand @files];\n\n    or\n\n    opendir DIR, \"/foo/bar/\" or \" ... \"; my @files = grep /\\.txt$/,\n    (readdir DIR); closedir DIR my $rand_file = $files[rand @files];\n\n    Especially, I'm too lazy to do it with recursive directory\n    structures. More important, the main idea is hidden, because all I\n    wanted is something like:\n\n    use File::Random;\n\n    my $rand_file = random_file(); # or my $rand_file =\n    random_file(-dir => '/foo/bar', -recursive => 1, # or -r => 1 -check\n    => qr/.../ # or -check => sub {-M < 7});\n\n    I'm also often more interested in the content of the randomly\n    selected file, than in the file itselfs. So I'd like to have a\n    function like\n\n    my @lines = content_of_random_file();\n\n    For laziness, I also want to add a simple method\n\n    my $rand_line = random_line(\"fname\");\n\n    (like in the Perl Cookbook).\n\n    I think, this module will be usefull and I couldn't find such one\n    in CPAN.\n\n    From a linguistic view Random::File would be a better name, but I\n    don't want to create a new Top Level Domain quite only for such a\n    little module. Also File::Random express very good, what the module\n    stand for."
