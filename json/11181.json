This simplifies\n    implementing Localization and Internationalization, since the\n    regionally variant components are located in a configuration segment\n    or even a separate file. Separating the components can make the code\n    simpler to understand. Changing the file editing components can be\n    peformed with minimal risk of damaging the actual code, since the\n    two are no longer intermingled.\n\n    Eventually, I would like to implement a GUI interface to assist in\n    generating the external description files."
