Specifically, it is an XS\n    module interface to the libkadm5clnt library, which means it can\n    manipulate principals and policies on a remote KDC running kadmind.\n\n    Rather than adding on to Authen::Krb5, I decided to create a\n    separate module since most developers won't need the kadmin\n    functionality, which only KDC administrators can use. Also, long ago\n    Jeff Horwitz suggested a separate module since Authen::Krb5 was\n    already so large.\n\n    Since this implementation is MIT-specific, it's tempting to add\n    \"MIT\" somewhere in the name. But I think it would be better to keep\n    the name simple and eventually add compatibility with other KDCs to\n    the module. Users should not have to care which KDCs they're talking\n    to.\n\n    Originally, I named this module Authen::Krb5::Kadm5, but I decided\n    the Ks and the 5s were redundant."
