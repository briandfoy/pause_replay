Having the\n    languages live in Plugin::Language::NAME simplifies keeping track of\n    them in programs.\n\n    P::I requires a handler for the metadata, DML provides a compiler\n    (token+args -> closure) that produces sub's installable by\n    Plugin::Installer.\n\n    This doesn't really belong in Class:: since the installed plugins\n    can just as easily be functions (and Class:: is getting pretty\n    overused anyway). This could also go into Language::Plugin::DML, but\n    \"Language::Plugin::Installer\" didn't seem all that intiutive to me.\n\n    The only other inline Little Language I know of is L::R::P, but\n    \"Lingua::Plunina\" didn't seem all that descriptive."
