Distinct from Crypt::RandPasswd\n    by the important fact that Crypt::RandPasswd's method has been\n    proven to be insecure. Since making it secure would break compliance\n    to the FIPS-181 NIST standard, Crypt::RandPasswd cannot be fixed.\n    This module explicitly does not adhere to that standard but tries to\n    do the Right Thing(tm)."
