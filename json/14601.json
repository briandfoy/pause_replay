The handiest feature of this\n    interface is that it returns an array of hash references from the\n    Query routine. Each element in the array represents a record, each\n    key/value pair in the hash reference represents a field and value in\n    the record.\n\n    Also there is a routine which will parse Remedy (see ARS module)\n    diary entries as they are stored in the native database. This\n    alleviates the need for Remedy developers to use the ARS API to\n    retrieve diary entries from their Remedy servers."
