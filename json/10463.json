      "rationale" : "CGI::Htauth offers a variety of authentication mechanisms to the\n    CGI programmer. The main subroutine is &authenticate($config)\n    $config can be either a string or a filename, and looks a bit like a\n    simple router configuration, with different authentication modes to\n    be offered to different IP addresses or ranges. Possible modes\n    include allow, deny, password and challenge-response. CGI::Htauth\n    uses Crypt::Tea, CGI::FormBuilder and CGI.pm. From a JavaScript\n    browser, The user is authenticated by encrypting a random challenge,\n    so the password is never transmitted, and subsequent traffic in both\n    directions is encrypted. Timeouts are handled and there are built-in\n    buttons for logout and password changing. Originally CGI::Htauth\n    used a module of mine called CGI::Htui (analagous to Term::Clui) to\n    handle the forms, but over the last couple of months I have ported\n    it to the already-existing CGI::FormBuilder which provides similar\n    functionality."
