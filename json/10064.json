Does\n    not seem reasonable to me, but you - surely - know CPAN better than\n    I do).\n\n    Please let me know where to put this (fundamental) module.\n\n    Bonus question: I put this module in \"13) Internationalization and\n    Locale\" 'coz it allows to translate sentences in h4x0r talking...
