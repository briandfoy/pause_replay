More information is available at\n    http://uttu.tamu.edu/docs/ (currently being used as a development\n    server, so if it doesn't show up, I'm working out a bug somewhere -\n    plus a few details are still subject to change :/).\n\n    Uttu has (pre-alpha) support for internationalization and (beta)\n    support for uri->filename translation. This last bit separates the\n    public and private namespaces from each other, allowing changes in\n    one to not affect the other.\n\n    Uttu currently only supports HTML::Mason, but should be modular\n    enough to allow support for Embperl, template toolkit, etc. as a\n    basis for the web pages."
