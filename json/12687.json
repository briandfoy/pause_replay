Subroutines offer encryption,\n    decryption and digest and all cyphertext is ascii-encoded to prevent\n    munging. Another subroutine returns JavaScript code which offers\n    identical functions in JS, and this will be used by GCIs to feed the\n    browser. A wrapper executable 'tea' is included for command-line\n    use. Tea.pm is used by the CGI::Htauth.pm authentication module ..."
