It also provides\n    client tools for using web services in a \"batch-oriented\" manner.\n\n    SOAP::Clean has been developed as part of a NSF-funded project on\n    adapative software. It provides a framework for turning a set of\n    pre-existing codes running at different institutions into an\n    integrated, distributed computational science application."
