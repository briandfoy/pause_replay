There are various things designers can\n    do with HTML to mitigate this, such as using ALT fields in IMG tags.\n    This module tests for those things.\n\n    I'm not an expert in this area, but I volunteered to start the\n    module while at the Higher Ed Web Dev conference. I can add more\n    things on request, or even add co-maintainers. :)"
