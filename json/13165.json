I wouldn't like to put it under Compress::* as the algorithm\n    could be used for compressing, but a similar result could also be\n    achieved with Shannon-Fano-Algorithm (or ZIP or\n    run-length-compressing or ...). Also the creation of a symbol code\n    table isn't important (looked from the point of the user) for a\n    compression tool, but it's a very important part of the Huffman\n    algorithm."
