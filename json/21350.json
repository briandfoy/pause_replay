Most of them have been written\n    for my own use inside some scripts but recently managed to clean\n    them up, take them out and put them in different modules.\n\n    Gregorian<->Jalali(Shamsi) converter: Converts Gregorian date to\n    Jalali(Shamsi) which used in Iran. It will be added to date::convert\n    http://search.cpan.org/author/MORTY/DateConvert-0.16/Convert.pm.\n\n    Other modules are mostly related to automatic language detection\n    (with a pool of Persian words to guess the language), automatic\n    encoding conversion of web pages using meta tags and Encode,\n    specifically tuned up for conversion between Arabic-1256 and UTF-8)\n    which naturally fixes some Persian letters problems.\n\n    Numbers converter: Basically converts 1234567890 to its Persian\n    equivalent, which is ۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹۰ and vice versa.",
