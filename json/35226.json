File::Find::Closures is a library\n    of subroutines to give to Find::Find::find(). Each thing in\n    File::Find::Closures supplies a closure to use with\n    File::Find::find() and another closure to access the results.\n\n    Randal has File::Finder which is the same idea (make two closures),\n    but you still have to build up the finder closure. I hide all of\n    that behind a function name."
