Net::IP::Match works fast for a few subnets but they have to be\n    hardcoded, Net::Subnets works fine for even a million dynamically\n    loaded subnets.\n\n    3. I have planned some more subnetting related features for future\n    releases.\n\n    Why not name it Net::IP::Subnets?\n\n    In fact the first version was named so, but I talked to a lot\n    people and all expected it to be Net::Subnets, so I decided that\n    there is no reason not to rename it. In addition it enables me to\n    add subnetting features that are not IP related, if there are any?\n    :]"
