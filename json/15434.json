I took the functionality of both,\n    and combined them into one module, making the OO interface more\n    streamlined, as well as easier to use. I also managed to correct a\n    problem that I had noticed with the Simran::Log::Log module, where a\n    call to a method in the object in a scalar context would not return\n    anything. This was due in part to a parameter within the object not\n    being set, and that there was no way to set that parameter within\n    the object in the first place."
