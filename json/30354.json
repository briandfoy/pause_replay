      "rationale" : "Sorry to resubmit request so soon, but a Perl.com article is coming\n    out and I would like to have the namespace registered before\n    publication.\n\n    A Bloom filter is a cool form of compact storage when testing for\n    the presence of keys in a very large set (for instance, a spell\n    checker). There are currently two CPAN modules that implement parts\n    of the Bloom algorithm - Text::Bloom and Bloom16 - but both are\n    somewhat limited. Text::Bloom is geared exclusively at text\n    collections, and has its own collection+weighting model built in as\n    a result, this makes it less than ideal for other uses (spam\n    whitelists, for example). Bloom16 is implemented in XS and has a\n    hard-coded four-bit window size, this makes it much less useful to\n    people who need a vanilla, one-bit Bloom filter for compactness, or\n    work in a compiler-free environment. The aim of this module is to\n    provide a configurable Bloom filter implemented using Perl's own\n    pack, vec and bitwise operators. The module is abstracted from the\n    innards of the LOAF project for a social network extension to email\n    (http://loaf.cantbedone.org). If the Bloom root level namespace is\n    undesirable, I can suggest Algorithm::Bloom::Filter, but I would\n    point out that Bloom16 has already blazed the namespace trail ;-)"
