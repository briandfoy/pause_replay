(Its been a\n    while so I can't remember the specifics..), Some limited you to HTML\n    output only...\n\n    What it does is not only give you access to the same types of\n    information in regard to paginating, it gives you functions for\n    outputting HTML/whatever nav menus, with methods to control all\n    settings and output.\n\n    Its quite slick and I use it in out company database system now.\n\n    I was thinking Data::Paginate or Data::Paginate[Complete|Easy] or\n    Data::Paginator for the name space.\n\n    Then if someone wants to come upwith special functionality to make\n    paginated menus for TTY, Tk, etc all they have to do it\n    Data::Paginate::Foo Data::Paginate::Etc\n\n    Thanks :)"
