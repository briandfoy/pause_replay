An\n    example of two cases which HTML::LinkExtor doesn't handle are\n\n    <!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM \"http://www.w3.org/DTD/HTML4-strict.dtd\">\n\n    and\n\n    <meta HTTP-EQUIV=\"Refresh\" CONTENT=\"5;\n    URL=http://www.foo.com/foo.html\"> It's built upon\n    HTML::TokeParser::Simple, an easier to grok interface to\n    HTML::TokeParser.\n\n    I marked it \"M\" for mature above, because HTML::TokeParser is\n    mature, and HTML::TokeParser::Simple and my module are pretty\n    straight forward. (plenty of testing has also been done)"
