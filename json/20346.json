The idea behind is quite unique, and I therefore\n    think that the creation of a new rootlevel namespace is acceptable.\n    Looking through the modules registrated under Miscellaneous, I seen\n    no namespace where bovlam will fit into. I am also sure, that we in\n    the future will se several different approaches on the concept of\n    bovlam, and then the root namespace will come in handy. However, if\n    you do not share my opinion about this, I am willing to discuss it\n    further.\n\n    Best regards, Andreas Kryger Jensen"
