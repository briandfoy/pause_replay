I already many modules in the\n    Mail::Box::* namespace, but this one would be released as separate\n    distribution.\n\n    The main difference with the usual procmail implementations is that\n    you do not need to create a cryptic configuration file with its own\n    syntax (and therefore limitations), but you simply extend your own\n    program based on Mail::Box and User::Identity.\n\n    Mail::Box::Procmail supports the concept of 'roles': people using\n    different e-mail addresses, signatures, languages, and encryption\n    keys but use only one MUA. The module also helps to archive the data\n    in the correct folders, something that (for instance mutt) is only\n    poorly capable of.\n\n    An extended example (ready to use) will be enclosed in the\n    distribution."
