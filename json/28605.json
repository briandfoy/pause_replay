      "why" : "Dear CPAN,\n\n    Currently there are two things I want to contribute. I don't want\n    to waste your time, so I start explaining:\n\n    The first one is, I added server-support to Authen::SASL::Cyrus\n    (currently only client behaviour is implemented). Of course I tried\n    to contact the author (Mark Adamson) to apply my patches, but I\n    don't received an answer (I contacted him in Nov/Dec 2003, Jan 2004,\n    last try was 1 weeks ago). Graham Barr, who will apply a patch to\n    Authen::SASL to enable server functionality, suggests to create a\n    new module. Andreas Koenig added: at least a temporary module, until\n    Mark is responding again.\n\n    I needed the server functionality of Authen::SASL:: because I wrote\n    a client/server framework in OOPerl which relies on SASL for\n    authentication. This will be my second contribute to CPAN in the\n    next time.\n\n    I think in the future I will bring maybe some more useful things,\n    but currently this is what I would like to provide.\n\n    best regards and thanks for your attention, Patrick Boettcher",
