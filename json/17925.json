What this\n    module provides:\n\n    1) Cursor tracking/manipulation (transparently access/manipulation\n    in either string ordinal index mode or (row, column) coordinates)\n\n    2) Input management (methods for character/string input,\n    backspaces, deletions, etc. from the cursor position)\n\n    3) Output formatting (automatically line wraps, expands tabs,\n    handles left/center/right alignment, etc.)\n\n    4) Search/Replace functionality (from cursor position, optionally\n    wrappping to the beginning)\n\n    There's a ton of formatting/parsing modules, but none that I could\n    find that concern themselves with #1 & #2, which are extremely\n    important to widget writers. #3 is implemented internally for\n    performance reasons (tab expansion and line wrapping, for instance,\n    is about 4-5 times faster than Text::Tabs + Text::Wrap) plus the\n    need to preserve characters (Text::Wrap will strip newlines from\n    adjacent lines that may comprise a paragraph). #4 is also\n    implemented internally since they depend/affect cursor position.\n\n    That's the justification for my request for inclusion."
