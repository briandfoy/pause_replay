The Convert::ASCIInames module allows\n    translation between the C0 and C1 control character octets and the\n    short codenames (e.g., ESC, DC3) defined for them. I have found no\n    other module in the CPAN which provides this functionality; the\n    closest is the 1.02 version of charnames.pm, which has a viacode()\n    method that can return the long names (e.g., 'Escape', 'Device\n    Control 3') but not the short ones, and appears to not be readily\n    installable on Perl environments earlier than 5.8.1."
