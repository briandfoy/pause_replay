This helps point out when one's signature\n    is not accurate when you're doing this final tests before uploading.\n\n    Its main benefits are that (a) it works fine with Module::Install,\n    and thus can be painlessly included with a distribution if desired,\n    and (b) it can happily \"work\" without Module::Signature being\n    installed. It takes care of checking that the signature checking is\n    possible."
