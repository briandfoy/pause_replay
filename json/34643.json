It's an\n    experimental implementation of *that* \"the network is the computer\"\n    *thing*. FullAuto uses SSH,SFTP,TELNET and FTP to combine command\n    line environments on multiple computers into one GRAND COMMAND LINE\n    where complex network-wide processes can be automated in ONE script\n    - on ONE computer. FullAuto is a paradigm shift in computing in that\n    it successfully implements true CLIENT-LESS computing (coining yet\n    another phrase).",
