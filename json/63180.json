The accuracy is up to 99.94% much better than\n    Encode::Detect in EasyAsia language.\n\n    It has been published as CharsetDetector\n    (http://search.cpan.org/~foolfish/CharsetDetector-1.0.0/) for two\n    years,works perfectly well.\n\n    As it was not well named and document is poor,I want to rewrite the\n    document and re-publish it as new name \"Encode::Detect::CJK\"\n\n    Thanks very much"
