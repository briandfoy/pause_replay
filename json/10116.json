      "rationale" : "I like to write german text in pure ASCII. So I transliterates\n    mutation characters like 'ä', 'ö', 'ü', 'á' or 'ß' with 'ae',\n    'oe', 'ue', 'a', 'ss'.\n\n    I think it's the normal style for a programmer, but for\n    non-programmers it's hard to read. So I'd like to have a module\n    which creates from a standard german text (with mutations) a\n    7-bit-ASCII code AND reverse.\n\n    Unfortunately the reverse 'ae' => 'ä' transliteration is a little\n    bit more complicated than only a s/ae/ä/g - statement. There are\n    many exceptions like 'Abenteuer' != 'Abenteür', 'Bauer' != 'Baür',\n    'Clique' != 'Cliüe', 'Kongruenz' != 'Kongrünz', ... . Many words\n    from foreign languages like 'blue' should not become 'blü' and even\n    many latin abbrevations ending on 'ae' make problems. Obviously, to\n    decide when an 'ss' is in reality an 'ß' and when not, is the most\n    difficult.\n\n    There are enough reasons to write a perl module for and to throw\n    away all these 4-5 liners which had never worked right.\n\n    I'm not sure about the namespace. I choosed, Mutations, because\n    [äüö] are in fact mutations. From a non strict linguistic point\n    of view, [áàó...] are mutations, too. Of course 'ß' is not - but\n    it's only one character :-). T prefer the plural form Mutations,\n    because the module never cares about only one of the characters -\n    always of all.\n\n    On the other hand, Mutations has a very tough assosziation to\n    biology. Other possible names could be Lingua::DE::ASCII,\n    Lingua::DE::ASCIICharacters, Lingua::DE::ProgrammersStyle,\n    Lingua::DE::Umlaute or whatever you will suggest. (Even\n    Lingua::DE::Goethe is a possible name - as the 'ae', 'oe', ...\n    writing is typical for the time Goethe had lived :D)"
