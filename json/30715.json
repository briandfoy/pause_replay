For\n    the sake of simplicity, and because ObjectivePerl runs (mostly) as a\n    source filter, it is really nice to be able to say\n\n    use ObjectivePerl; ... no ObjectivePerl;\n\n    which helps with source code readability.\n\n    Since it's a project unto itself, and will be extended over time as\n    I connect it to Camel Bones and maybe even the Mac OSX\n    PerlObjcBridge, it doesn't seem too strange to me that it would have\n    its own namespace.\n\n    Thanks for your consideration!"
