The query parser parses the question and calls a query\n    expression builder (internal form of the question). The optimizer is\n    then called to reduce the complexity of the expression. The solver\n    applies the expression on a data source.\n\n    Built-in methods are provided for evaluating common \"search engine\n    style\" queries (simple and Boolean) against scalar string variables."
