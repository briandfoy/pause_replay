That is: in a similar way as you can read\n    textfiles by line with \"while(<>)\" you use\n    HTML::Tagreader::getbytoken to read a file by tag (and text).\n    Although this module is also suitable to read xml code it is\n    probably most useful for processing web pages in an efficient way.\n\n    I have included a number of application programs that use Tagreader\n    to modify/process html. Therefore I think that HTML::Tagreader is a\n    good choice."
