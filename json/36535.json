The distribution includes different backends in order to\n    be portable and to adapt to the requirements of the local system.\n    Currently, only the command-line backend is implemented (which\n    should be the most portable), but the others will be implemented as\n    soon as possible.\n\n    The name was chosen following Net::Pcap (which is used by Net::P0f\n    in order to avoid unnecesary XS code) and because it's clearly a\n    network tool.\n\n    Thanks in advance"
