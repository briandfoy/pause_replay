And i want to write a rewrite module for\n    encoding URL's. This module including regional character encoding\n    from the URL. For example: The documents title: 'Onur Aslan KuyruÄŸu\n    Noksan'. My module encode this like this:\n    onur-aslan-kuyrugu-noksan.html. This can be usefull for using\n    Apache's mod_rewrite. This is my project. I didn't write this module\n    yet. I am planing to write this module after joining PAUSE.",
