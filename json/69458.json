      "why" : "I am a student of Czech technical university in Prague. As a\n    bachelor project I chose to update CalendarMonthSimple module which\n    is used by a plugin for Twiki called Calendar plugin (the update\n    consists in overriding the method as_html(), the new method takes\n    place in new module called CalendarMonthSimple2, which is then\n    called by TWiki::CalendarPlugin). Under the leading of Ciant\n    (International centre for art and new technologies) I succesfully\n    improved the visual look and feel of the calendar. Our main goal was\n    to achieve Google-like calendar style. The results are more then\n    satisfying. Thanks to updates made to CalendarPlugin (which were\n    made by other student as a bachelor project) we can now display\n    multiday event including time, as well as single day events of\n    course. Simple javascript is provided to display details about each\n    event in a bubble tooltip.",
