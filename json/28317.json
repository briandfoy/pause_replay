The MIF\n    object is implemented as a Tree::DAG_Node tree object, the parser\n    uses IO::Tokenizer to process the MIF file.\n\n    MifTree not only knows the MIF syntax, but it also has some\n    understanding of the allowed structures (within their contexts) and\n    attribute types. The current module sopports MIF version 7.00.\n\n    The following important methods are available: * inherited methods\n    from Tree::DAG_Node * methods to access MIF-specific attribute types\n    (e.g., measurements, MIF strings, paths) * methods to handle facet\n    data (embedded images) * parse MIF from file and from a text string\n    * write out a MIF object to a MIF file or text string list\n\n    I've plans for the following other methods: * a validator that\n    checks some extra constructs * a \"flatten\" method that tries to\n    reduce the number of objects needed for text flows and pages\n\n    Non-supported MIF functions: * #-style comments * MIF macros *\n    include files",
