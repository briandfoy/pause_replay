It is sort of smart in that if it has to\n    create the file it automatically puts the columns in as the first\n    row. Otherwise, it just appends\n\n    URLEncode(join($delimiter, @$info_ref)) . \"\\n\"\n\n    to the log file. I really do need the columns to be first. It make\n    for a nice array of arrays where the 0th array contains columns, and\n    the rest contain data. Looks just like a database table really. I\n    talked to the Log::Agent guy and said I would be happy to write a\n    new personality and use his stuff, and he wrote me back saying it\n    might be possible, but he has not responded to my response for a\n    month.\n\n    This is a very simple module that I have already written, that is\n    in use on my work servers. I need something that does just this for\n    two or three other thing I want to submit to cpan.\n\n    Thanks, Earl"
