This takes the power of nmap information,\n    into a perl developer's hands. The nmap security scanner is widely\n    used, (as perl) in the security industry and more modules could be\n    created (Nmap::*) to be compatible with helping in the development\n    in these tools which will benefit various security developers.\n    (Nmap::Scanner is an example of an existing Nmap module on CPAN)."
