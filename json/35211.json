It will provide methods to list\n    all, mounted and unmounted filesystems available to a system, and\n    then query as many properties about each or any filesystem which can\n    be found. It is intended to provide a single consistant API across\n    as many platforms as possible. This module was originally required\n    for a home brew platform independant backup script written in perl.\n    The namespace is unique and not stepping on anybody's toes. I\n    envisage Sys::Filesystem::Platform, eg: Sys::Filesystem::Solaris\n    Sys::Filesystem::AIX Sys::Filesystem::HPUX Sys::Filesystem::Linux\n    Sys::Filesystem::BSD Sys::Filesystem::Tru64 etc etc as the platform\n    specific data gatherers which will inherit from Sys::Fileystem. I\n    feel this will be a valuable tool."
