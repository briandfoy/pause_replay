The primary advantage which this module\n    offers over the existing modules with similar functionality is a\n    single interface which provides the most often required information\n    regarding uploaded files ( file name, file handle [file stored\n    within temporary file generated via new_tmpname function of IO::File\n    which offers secure, non-predictive file names], file type [as\n    specified by file extension], and mime type [for validation of the\n    nature of the uploaded file] ) - This is performed making use of the\n    existing CGI and File::MMagic methods (although there is some\n    overlap) and offers a very tidy, succinct interface for working with\n    multiple file uploads.\n\n    This module to my mind represents a very nature extension of the\n    existing modules.\n\n    This code is at near-release stage having gone through some review\n    and feedback on PerlMonks prior to this application for name space.\n    The only requirements at this point prior to release onto CPAN\n    (pending namespace approval) in a near-complete form is some\n    additional POD documenation."
