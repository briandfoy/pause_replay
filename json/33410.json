That's not bad as it is a part of big and interesting\n    Mail::IMAPClient infrastrcuture.\n\n    My module is a simple hand-written parser which does its job very\n    well and very fast.\n\n    There are some alternate names I thought over, like\n    Mail::IMAP::BodyStructure or Net::IMAP::BodyStructure. The latter\n    won't do as my module does nothing about \"Net::\", it's only a\n    parser. The former would be nice, but there's no Mail::IMAP::\n    anything on CPAN. That would be a waste of hierarchy level.\n    Mail::IMAPBodyStructure looks as ugly as Mail::Body::Structure or\n    IMAP::Body::Structure."
