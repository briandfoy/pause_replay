I created MiniXML - a pure perl, object-oriented API that\n    provides classes for XML documents, elements and nodes - to fill\n    these requirements.\n\n    It is a \"stand-alone\" module in that it does not require additional\n    libraries or even a compiler to install and is, in my opinion,\n    flexible and easy to use. A project site was created\n    (http://minixml.psychogenic.com) where you can find detailed\n    information on the interface. Developer response has so far been\n    positive.\n\n    I would appreciate any comments you might have concerning the\n    module and it's interface."
