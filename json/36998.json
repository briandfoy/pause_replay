Did I forget to register it, or is this\n    just some sort of database weirdness? No idea.\n\n    Actually, the reason I wanted to make sure it was registered is\n    because I'm handing its maintainership over to Chris Williams\n    (BINGOS). Personal reasons, lack of time, etc. It deserves someone\n    who will actually manage a new release once every couple of months."
