These do not\n    work very efficiently and cosume lot of time and memory when the\n    input matrices/vectors are of a large order like in tens of\n    thousands. Many applications use huge data structures that are often\n    very sparse and where storing 0s or non-content values is an\n    unnecessary burden on programs that involve heavy computations on\n    such large sparse data structures.\n\n    The main focus of Sparse module that we are proposing here is to\n    provide operations on large sparse data structures in Perl. We plan\n    to provide methods on sparse vectors and matrices in this.\n\n    We found only one module PDL::Sparse that supports sparse data\n    structures however it requires installation of PDL which is a very\n    big module itself.\n\n    Sparse module is developed in normal Perl and requires no extra\n    installations other than Perl language."
