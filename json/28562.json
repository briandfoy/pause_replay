This allows one to use Apache and mod_perl as a\n    daemon framework, and use any other protocol module which will read\n    and write to IO::Handles or Filehandles in a handler I think it\n    should be in the Apache namespace because it is essentially a\n    mod_perl module, and that's where all the other mod_perl bits seem\n    to live. To my knowledge no other module does anything like this."
