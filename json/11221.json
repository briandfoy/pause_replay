You need 133x67 characters\n    instead of 132x66? No problem. You need 350x200 characters? No\n    problem. (Magnifying glass not included.) You can choose any\n    combination of width and lines per page.\n\n    My number one usage of this module: printing source code for a good\n    read-through. Have you ever tried to print source code from Notepad?\n    What a brain dead program... you end up with a huge, unusable font.\n    It's not much better to print from a program where you can choose\n    the font either. Too much trial and error. By using this module the\n    printer can use *exactly* the right font to fit your widest line\n    without wrapping, leaving blocks visually intact.\n\n    Why is this module called Text::PCL::Basic? Because it does nothing\n    fancy with PCL. It's just a straightforward way to layout a\n    fixed-width page."
