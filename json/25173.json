It figures out which variable need to be\n    passed in, and which are candidates to be returned. Then it\n    generates the sub and a call to the sub.\n\n    Comes with a wrapper script that lets you pass the code back and\n    forth on Linux using the KDE clipboard.\n\n    Tentatively called Dev::Refactor.",
