However, the author of\n    Config::ApacheFormat was unwilling to accept the patches that added\n    some extensions to the Apache config syntax. Apache::ConfigParser,\n    did not fit my needs as it only parses Apache config files. Thus\n    Config::ApacheExtended was born. I chose Config::ApacheExtended\n    because, this module deals with configuration, and it handles files\n    that are Extensions of the apache format. (I thought of\n    Config::ApacheFormat::Extended, but I did not want to appear as\n    though the Config::ApacheFormat and My module were related. (For\n    several reasons, one being they are architecturally very different))\n    I am of course open to better suited names."
