It\n    worked, but it was too clumsy to be useful.\n\n    Parse::Native will use source code filtering and massive subroutine\n    exporting to allow Grammars to be written in pure perl in a manner\n    that is much more intuitive and much more elegant than\n    Parse::Nibbler.\n\n    I coded the fundamental sections to prove to myself that it would\n    work.\n\n    It does not parse yet, but the source code filtering interface has\n    been defined and the Grammars now look a lot cleaner than they did\n    in Parse::Nibbler."
