      "rationale" : "I was surpriced to realize that there are no S.W.I.F.T. modules to\n    be found on CPAN. I have written some modules that are application\n    specific and doesn't belong here, but then I thought that so must a\n    lot of other people have done the same thing. That's when the idea\n    of a collectively maintained repository of S.W.I.F.T. related\n    modules was born.\n\n    About the module name: This module will implement one specific\n    message type, the MT300. S.W.I.F.T. message types are all named as\n    MTnnn in all upper-case. The middle level \"Factory\" in the name is\n    important, since building messages and parsing messages are more\n    different than similar. A next step will then be to register the\n    SWIFT::Parse::MTnnn modules. But one step at a time... Finally,\n    S.W.I.F.T. is correctly written with all those dots, but I deem that\n    to be unpractical on CPAN and I want to ignore the dots when naming\n    the module tree.\n\n    Thereby I propose SWIFT::Factory::MT300.pm as a module name.\n\n    About the category: I propose category \"24, Interface Module to\n    Commercial Software\", but I'm open to suggestions. An alternative\n    could be \"5, Networking\".\n\n    Best regards SCHAFFTER"
