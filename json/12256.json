If you made Test::SimpleUnit\n    do the stuff Test::Class does it wouldn't be simple.\n\n    Different from Test::Unit - tightly integrated into Test::Builder\n    (and therefore Test::Builder). Easy to learn for users of Test::More\n    et al. Easy to refactor *.t scripts into Test::Class classes."
