      "why" : "The Digest::SHA module provides a Perl interface to all variants of\n    the Secure Hash Algorithm specified in the current NIST Secure Hash\n    Standard (FIPS PUB 180-2). In other words, the module provides\n    support for SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. The routines\n    underlying this module are written in C for speed.\n\n    Whereas most message digest packages are restricted to\n    byte-oriented data, the full SHA standard calls for bit-oriented\n    inputs as well. The Digest::SHA module addresses both types of\n    input, and allows digest calculations to be performed directly, or\n    iteratively in stages.",
