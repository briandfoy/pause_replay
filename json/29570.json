The modules interacts with\n    SQL statements in a library file that looks somewhat similar to a\n    Windows INI file, but without the key=value pairs. An entry might\n    look like this:\n\n    [baz-query] select * from baz;\n\n    This format makes the library simple to manage, even for those with\n    absolutely no perl knowledge."
