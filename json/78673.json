This simple change makes it much more powerful and\n    expressive:\n\n    print HTML [ $is_bold && b => 'is this bold?' ];\n\n    and please see the examples in the POD as well.\n\n    Also, I've used simpler syntax to denote already-escaped text: if\n    an element's tag name (the first item in its arrayref) is an\n    arrayref, then the first item in that arrayref is inserted into the\n    HTML without being escaped âÂ so you can just do\n\n    print HTML [ p => 'the following text was ', [[\n    '<b>already&nbsp;escaped</b>' ]];\n\n    This is a module my team has been using for many years in corporate\n    Perl applications, and now I'd like to add it to CPAN. Please let me\n    know if you think this would be appropriate! Thank you for your\n    time."
