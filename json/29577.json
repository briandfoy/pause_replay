OSPS is designed to make it easier for you to implement\n    need-to-know security for your server port #'s. OSPS is a simple but\n    effective system for making your private services that much harder\n    to hack. If your IDS/IPS is working then you should be fairly able\n    to detect a port scan looking for open services and you can defend\n    against those to a degree but if you are running your services on\n    WKS ports then scanning isn't required nor is any âman in the\n    middle attackâ. OSPS is designed to hide the service port #'s from\n    those who do not need to know and yet make them available to those\n    who do need to know.",
