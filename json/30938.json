This need not be the\n    only application of this module as any numeric 'tabular' data may be\n    plotted using this method.\n\n    Although it is easy to generate graphs 'on the fly' using GD and\n    the Perl module GD::Graph, having a re-usable module that can be\n    customised and rapidly deployed throughout a web infrastucture can\n    cut out a lot of 'cutting and pasting'.\n\n    The combination of CGI::Application, CGI::Session and GD::Graph\n    into this 'wrapper' module seeks to make this task easier and\n    quicker.\n\n    An on line graph together with an HTML page in which to render it\n    that is itself 'template driven' should be easy to set up within the\n    framework that this module has to offer. Session state data is\n    maintained by CGI::Session so there is little need to transfer\n    complex 'CGI parameter based' data between the outer web application\n    and this module. Thus data transfer is simplified and potentialy\n    more secure."
