      "rationale" : "yEnc is a new encoding format for transporting binary data in\n    nominally ASCII channels, such as usenet. It is an alternative to\n    uuencoding.\n\n    Although there are concerns about the architecture of yEnc (see,\n    for example, http://www.exit109.com/~jeremy/news/yenc.html), it is\n    now in widespread use in usenet binary groups. I need to decode\n    these postings, so I wrote a module to do it.\n\n    The yEnc format was developed for encoding usenet binaries, and\n    that is currently its most common use. This suggests a module name\n    of\n\n    News::yEnc.\n\n    An alternative would be to make yEnc:: a top-level name, like\n    MIME:: but... - yEnc isn't as big as MIME - The yEnc format will\n    likely stay confined to usenet\n\n    Also, a top-level yEnc:: module namespace violates CPAN\n    capitalization conventions, while a YEnc:: namespace is unaesthetic.\n\n    OTOH, a top-level yEnc:: namespace allows for both yEnc::Decoder\n    and yEnc::Encoder, when someone gets around to writing one. If we\n    put them all under News::, then we either have 3-level names, like\n\n    News::yEnc::Decode News::yEnc::Encode\n\n    or compound words in the module names\n\n    News::yEncDecode News::yEncEncode\n\n    which is a bit of a mouthfull."
