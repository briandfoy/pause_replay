It also has a different notation from Persistent. I\n    had originally intended to extend ``Persistent'' itself, but I was\n    never able to contact Winters to make suggestions and I'm not sure\n    some of them would fit well into his API.\n\n    I have a couple other Perl-centric projects (a mod_perl app and a\n    Tk app) that I am also working on, but I don't know that I would be\n    submitting those to CPAN anytime soon, if ever.",
