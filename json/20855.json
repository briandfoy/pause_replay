In the future we might want to publish the\n    actual server code here as well. The commonly used RDF queries are\n    available in the MusicBrainz::Queries module and we also have TRM\n    tagging available under MusicBrainz::TRM which is used to create\n    unique signatures for audio files that then in turn can be used by\n    MusicBrainz to identify the track and album information.\n\n    Because we currently do not fit in the XML::, Net:: WebService::,\n    RDF, Audio, etc. interfaces as a whole, we were hoping that it would\n    be okay to claim the MusicBrainz:: namespace. The Namespace is\n    pretty uniquely named and does not interfere with any other project\n    (AFAWK).\n\n    All discussions and work in this namespace is done on the\n    musicbrainz-devel mailing list that can be found at\n    http://www.musicbrainz.org/"
