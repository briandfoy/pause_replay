      "rationale" : "HTML defines 251 named entities. Existing modules provide\n    conversions of these named entities to/from numeric character\n    references and utf-8.\n\n    The XHTML+MathML DTD defines 2336 (2121 unique) named entities. A\n    facility for converting them is needed.\n\n    However, unlike HTML entities, two-way conversions are not\n    possible. In the HTML case, each of the 251 entities corresponds to\n    a unique Unicode character. In the case of MathML entities, there\n    are many entities that correspond to the same Unicode character, and\n    some entities correspond to a *string* of two or more Unicode\n    characters.\n\n    So it's not really possible to graft this functionality onto one of\n    the existing modules, without breaking their two-way nature.\n\n    Why a new root namespace? 1) Sticking it under the HTML namespace\n    would be confusing and inappropriate. MathML is a distinct markup\n    language, not a subset of HTML. 2) SVG (a similar XML-based markup\n    language for the Web) has its own root namespace. MathML should,\n    too. 2) I intend to contribute other MathML-related modules in the\n    future."
