      "why" : "PowerEdge::RAC supplies some functions that people may find useful\n    to remotely manage Dell PowerEdge servers that have a RAC card\n    installed. The PowerEdge::RAC module acts as a client to the RAC\n    cards built-in webserver. As such it can be run from any networked\n    computer that has the required modules installed. A simple script on\n    that computer can, using this module, remotely power on and off the\n    PowerEdge server. See http://lanceerplaats.nl/PowerEdge/RAC/RAC.html\n    and http://www.dell.com/us/en/biz/topics/power_ps2q02-bell.htm for\n    more info",
