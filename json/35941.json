This\n    means that clients can be written in any language for any platform,\n    graphical or text based.\n\n    It aims to fill the hole for an Application Server that Perl\n    doesn't have. I've been searching for years for reasonable solutions\n    before deciding to write BOF.\n\n    I'm not arguing for a new root namespace but there really ought to\n    be a chapter for business related modules in the Module List."
