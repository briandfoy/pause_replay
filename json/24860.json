      "why" : "Innovative OPAC Library (the kind which is a building with books in\n    it) interaction package. Many public and academic libraries use this\n    OPAC, basically rendering their catalog and patron account website\n    architecture the same. So it makes sense to me to write a Perl\n    module for interacting with this architecture, supplying methods to\n    search the catalog, check for items coming due, automatically renew\n    items, etc..\n\n    I already have some of this written, but I can't debug it for\n    libraries I don't have accounts with. I'm hoping that by making the\n    source available in several locations I can find others interested\n    in helping to debug for more of the hundreds of InnOPAC sites.\n\n    Once it's done, it probably belongs under the Biblio:: namespace,\n    I'll ask around and figure that out later.",
