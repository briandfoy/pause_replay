This is\n    clearly a biological application, therefore I intend to place this\n    module under root level namespace Bio.\n\n    There are many modules comprised in the bioperl distiribution.\n    However, most of these models are purely bioinformatics tools, i.e.\n    they deal with sequence (genomic as well as protein) analysis.\n\n    My module deals with a completely different aspect of system's\n    biology, the metabolism.\n\n    Therefore I chose the second level to differ from other modules and\n    propose the name Bio::Metabolic."
