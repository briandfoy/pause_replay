I don't think that's the\n    best name; in fact it is not for benchmarking so much as providing a\n    schedule of when a program reaches various locations you've marked.\n    The timing information is not therefore trustworthy for benchmarking\n    in that it is the product of only one iteration, but it is helpful\n    in figuring out how long the program takes to reach various points\n    and is a simpler and more succinct interface than Benchmark::Timer.\n    Can also be disabled easily so that timing calls can be left in."
