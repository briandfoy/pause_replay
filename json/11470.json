It provides\n    some sample Enigmas.\n\n    The apparently similar module Crypt::Enigma is aimed at providing a\n    historically-accurate Enigma rather than providing the facility to\n    create and explore your own, which may or may not use\n    historically-accurate ciphers. Crypt::OOEnigma has been briefly\n    discussed with the author of Crypt::Enigma.\n\n    This module was created in the process of reading and understanding\n    the related chapters of Korner's \"The Pleasures of Counting\". It is\n    hoped that other students of the theory of the Enigma will find\n    useful the opportunity to explore various Enigmas and their\n    components."
