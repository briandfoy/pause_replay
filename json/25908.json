The purpose is to provide code for a virtual MegaSquirt to use\n    in conjunction with tuning applications. The general idea is to take\n    datalogs from the unit and crunch them to suggest new fuel maps and\n    expand from there. The code will be sturdy enough to support GUI's\n    in the future.\n\n    Thanks.",
