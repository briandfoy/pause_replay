      "rationale" : "This module provides type categorisation, and is complementary to\n    type verification modules. It's intended for functions that want to\n    accept more than one type of argument, and treat different arguments\n    differently.\n\n    The type classification that it provides is designed to be useful\n    particularly for that purpose, and turns out to be quite similar to\n    the classification that Params::Validate uses. It divides scalar\n    values into these five mutually-exclusive categories:\n\n    * undef\n\n    * ordinary string\n\n    * typeglob\n\n    * reference to unblessed object\n\n    * reference to blessed object\n\n    It also supports finer distinctions within some of these\n    categories.\n\n    At first glance this module appeared appropriate for the \"data\n    types\" chapter of the module list, and possibly the Data::\n    namespace. However, it is actually more closely related to existing\n    modules in the \"argument processing\" chapter and the Params::\n    namespace. As its main intended use is, in fact, in argument\n    processing, it seems more appropriate to place it in the latter\n    location."
