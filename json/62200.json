It was designed to operate as\n    fast as possible even on very large populations (> 10000) and big\n    individuals (>> 32-bit). It uses C and XS code for speed reasons and\n    to reduce amount of used memory.\n\n    Available on CPAN AI::Genetic has several seriously limitations\n    (small populations and small individuals).\n\n    AI::Genetic::Pro was implemented in Military University of\n    Technology for scientific purpose."
