It is analogous to the\n    GroupLens system for Usenet. The best known implementation is Razor,\n    written in Perl. However, Razor has the apparent disadvantage that\n    the server code is not open, which diminishes people's trust in it\n    and also makes the server a single point of failure. This led to the\n    development of Pyzor (http://pyzor.sourceforge.net) which is written\n    in Python; it would be nice to have a Perl library interface to it."
