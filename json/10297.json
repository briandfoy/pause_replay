This module provides\n    make-like dependency tracking (with some of the flavor of cons).\n    Other than miscellaneous, the best place to put it is in 'Control\n    Flow Utilities'.\n\n    As for a namespace, since it's a more general dependency solution,\n    it doesn't belong under Make. It does more than just files, so\n    File::Depends won't work. The best I could come up with is plain\n    Depends.\n\n    I've put the documentation up at\n\n    http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~dj/Depends.html\n\n    Thanks, Diab"
