      "why" : "1, I have ported a BFGS function optimizer from Fortran to perl; as\n    the only optimizer available on CPAN is the simplex (from the same\n    Fortran source book), it might be of use for others. Math::BFGS\n    (currently not oop)\n\n    2, Currently, I finished the first version of an Evolution Strategy\n    function optimizer; this approach is comparable to the more known\n    Genetic Algorithms. Math::ES (oop)\n\n    3, As I am a computational chemist, there might be some chemistry\n    related modules to put on CPAN, mainly for parsing specific output\n    files of certain programs. Of course, they do already exist, but had\n    to cleaned up prior to publication.",
