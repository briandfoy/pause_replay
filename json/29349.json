But, I do think that having perl equivalents of a couple of\n    them (in particular date) would be very useful for people\n    integrating perl with a php app's data. How many people have a php\n    app running and want to write some perl code to enhance it - I don't\n    know, but I know I'm one.\n\n    In addition, I like to be complete. While I think a couple\n    functions are useful, I'm anal and would just go ahead and make all\n    of them in the odd chance that someone wants to call gettimeofday."
