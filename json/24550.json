      "rationale" : "Rationale for the module ------------------------ There are no\n    existing perl interfaces to the Prospect package; this module is\n    unique. We have endeavored to use other packages where possible\n    (e.g., Bio:: (aka bioperl)).\n\n    Rationale for the namespace --------------------------- The major\n    reason for choosing Prospect:: over a package name within the Bio::\n    or CompBio:: trees is that those are to be broad names assigned to\n    small groups of individuals. In particular, Bio:: is a big chunk of\n    namespace assigned to a group with enforced coding guidelines.\n    bioperl would probably not accept any package which doesn't adhere\n    to their coding guidelines.\n\n    I like ontologies and organization. If you can think of an\n    appropriate place to stick this module (be nice) then I'm happy to\n    discuss it. One possibility is to start a new tree with a designed\n    hierarchy and that is not owned by a single group. E.g., Biology::\n    Entities:: Sequence Structure Gene Protein Alignment ... GUI:: ...\n    Tools:: Prospect:: BLAST::\n\n    I know that there has been discussion on the bioperl mailing list\n    regarding breaking Bio:: up into subtrees in order to address this\n    issue, but I'm not aware of any progress on this yet.\n\n    Thanks, Reece"
