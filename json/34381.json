As I didn't find something like that on CPAN, I would\n    love to add this once it is finished...\n\n    I also started working on a pure perl, web based linux/windows\n    monitoring system incl. some administrative functions. Nothing new\n    at all, but as it is supposed to support skins, ssl and long term\n    monitoring (graphics/charts), it is probably another useful\n    monitor...\n\n    Cheers, michael",
