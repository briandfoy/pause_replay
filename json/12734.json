The main subroutine is &authenticate($config) simple\n    router configuration, with different authentication modes to be\n    offered to different IP addresses or ranges. Possible modes include\n    allow, deny, password and challenge-response. CGI::Htauth uses\n    Crypt::Tea, CGI::FormBuilder and CGI.pm. From a JavaScript browser,\n    The user is authenticated by encrypting a random challenge, so the\n    password is never transmitted, and subsequent traffic in both\n    directions is encrypted. Timeouts are handled and there are built-in\n    buttons for logout and password changing."
