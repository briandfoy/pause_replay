At its\n    simplest, the modules provide Diff and Patch analogous utilities,\n    producing/ingesting XML formatted diffgrams.\n\n    The modules use an algorithm inspired by the Doctoral Thesis on\n    XyDiff (http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~cobena/cdrom/www/xydiff/eng.htm),\n    which is a tree-based difference algorithm. The choice not to make\n    it a perl wrapper around XyDiff was the desire to create a pure perl\n    implementation, although it does have a dependency on XML::LibXML,\n    since it uses the DOM tree.\n\n    The initial diffgram schema will support insert,update,delete and\n    move operations.\n\n    The difference of the proposed solution to existing modules is as\n    follows:\n\n    XML::DifferenceMarkup is based on Algorithm::Diff, which uses LCS\n    for comparison. Given that XML is really a Tree, a tree-based\n    algorithm can capture a lot more contextual information, produce\n    better diffgrams and utilizing XPath in the diffgram produce output\n    that can be read and evaluated by a greater set of tools.\n\n    XML-SemanticDiff is a useful for analyzing difference between XML\n    documents but does not produce diffgrams or any way to generate\n    derivative XLM document using the knowledge about the differences\n    found."
