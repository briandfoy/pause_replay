So\n    we don't think CGI:: namespace is appropriate for TL, we desire the\n    root one.\n\n    Some features like Debug Screen and DBI Wrapper can be used not\n    only for web applications, but also batch scripts. The debugging\n    utilities provide the following features: - Send a mail containing\n    stack trace to the administrator - Profile the execution time of SQL\n    statements - Watch certain variables and log the content of them\n    whenever they change\n\n    In addition, TL has the following features that are other than\n    CGI-related: - Recognize Japanese holidays - Create and parse mails\n    in Japanese - Turn a web page to HTML mail - Sign a mail with S/MIME\n    - Process its own mail queue, and send mails using SMTP These would\n    be under Date:: or Mail:: if they were considered as separate\n    modules.\n\n    We want to avoid moving TL:: namespace to another, because TL has\n    already some actual achivements and we don't want to break the\n    compatibility."
