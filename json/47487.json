I think that\n    XML::TreePP is enough fast and easy to use!\n\n    XML::Mini is also pure Perl implementation, but it is 10 times\n    slower than XML::TreePP. XML::Simple is NOT pure Perl and it needs\n    XML::Parser. XML::Parser::Lite::Tree and XML::Parser::EasyTree don't\n    generate just a pure hash tree."
