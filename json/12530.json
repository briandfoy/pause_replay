      "rationale" : "During programming, I've found a myself writing functions to log\n    messages to the screen or to a file. This was always about 35-lines\n    of subroutine I re-used everywhere. Lately, though I enhanced it a\n    bit and made it a module so I could retrofit it into all my old\n    code.\n\n    I've always had a need to log to both the screen and to a file with\n    different logging levels. The other logging modules were either too\n    complicated to set up or to simplistic for my needs, but I did have\n    to add in some basic features. Overall, though, the goal was\n    simplicity of use.\n\n    Log::Timber has the following features:\n\n    1. Writes messages to the screen and/or to a file. 2. Logging\n    (threshold) levels are numeric (0=silent, 8=verbose). 3. Different\n    log levels can be set for screen and file. 4. Formats can be\n    different for screen and file. 5. Formats can include caller() &\n    time() prefixes (configurable). 6. Log's filename can be specified\n    or can be __FILE__ (changes during execution). 7. Configurable to\n    (add / not add / strip all & re-add) CR/LF to end of each line. 8.\n    Configurable to add HTML markup to ease viewing in HTML viewer.\n\n    The 'cute' name may make it memorable. If people hate the name, I'm\n    happy to change it to Log::BasicLog.\n\n    But, I figure the idea of a logging function that does what most\n    people need, in one module, with a simple interface, is a useful\n    thing.\n\n    It's OO perl. I'll make sure it's nice, has good tests, etc. It'll\n    be brain-dead simple to install and use."
