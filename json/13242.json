It has been in the public domain for\n    some time and it is a convenience issue. It would be very\n    inconvenient for current users with scripts in place if the\n    namespace needed to change because of CPAN requirements. I've\n    uploaded the most recent release to my author space (MIKER) where I\n    guess it will sit pending resolution of this question.\n\n    See: http://scans.bizsystems.net http://www.hackbusters.net/guests"
