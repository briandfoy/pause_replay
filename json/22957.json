I think I'm sticking\n    with SSN::Validate so I can get it uploaded and get more active\n    development done.\n\n    ---- Hello, I'm working on a module to do some validating of US\n    SSNs above any beyond seeing if they are \"9 digits\". I'm currently\n    working off the area data located at:\n    http://www.ssa.gov/foia/stateweb.html Currently, the module (infancy\n    stages, so I want it on the CPAN so others can pitch in) validates\n    SSNs based on those area ranges, making sure the group isn't '00'\n    and the serial isn't '0000'. I plan to work in the High Groups next.\n    As well, it will return the state for a given area. I am working\n    with the package name of SSN::Validate. No SSN:: root namespace\n    exists. I'm not sure if it should be Validate::SSN, as it would then\n    sit next to Validate::Net which could be seen as a namespace\n    pollution. I'd rather follow suite with the *::Validate modules.\n    Does SSN::Validate or SSN::Valid seem ok to use? Any other\n    suggestions? Cheers, Kevin"
