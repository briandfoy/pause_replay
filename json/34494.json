I wrote Net::MAC::Vendor to do\n    pretty muchthe same thing, but supply all the information that the\n    IEEE gives about the vendor (which is just the address, really).\n\n    Net::MAC::Vendor will search for the info on the IEEE web site, and\n    optionally cache things it has already seen. It can also parse the\n    text listing of all MAC prefix assignments.\n\n    I already coordinated this new release with Clinton, but rather\n    than add to the previous name, I think Net::MAC::Vendor is more\n    descriptive."
