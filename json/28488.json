PurpleNumbers also allow for a\n    form of Transclusion. The system originally started as a wiki\n    (included) but has been extended to allow wiki formatting with\n    purple numbers in other systems including mail archives, weblog\n    systems, text repositories. Examples of how it is used can be found\n    at the wiki URL above and at\n    http://www.burningchrome.com:8000/~cdent/wiki.cgi\n\n    The primary goal of requesting a namespace is so the module can be\n    discovered and installed via CPAN. I assume this is necessary for\n    that. If not, someone please correct me.\n\n    Having PurpleWiki as a top level namespace is because it does not\n    seem to adequately fit into one of the others, although it has\n    aspects of many."
