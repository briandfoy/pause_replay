Since it\n    uses AppConfig as a base, it's easier to use for scripts, and since\n    it (deliberately) uses HTML::SimpleParse instead of HTML::Parse as\n    its parser, it's suitable for use on pseudo-HTML code (such as WML\n    source, which is what I use it on myself). \"GenToc\" just stands for\n    \"Generate Table-Of-Contents\" but if you can think of a better name\n    for it so as not to confuse it with HTML::Toc, please do.\n\n    (It is b for beta, because in the time since I applied for PAUSE\n    membership, I have written it and put it on my web page, with the\n    caveat that its name might change)"
