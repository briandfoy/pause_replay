The name HTML::XHTML_Table is\n    close to DBIx::XHTML_Table and does not require a new rootlevel\n    namespace.\n\n    My wishes were to take over maintainence of HTML::Table, but Mr.\n    Peacock (in a recent email) explained that he not only desires to\n    retain maintainence, but he will also be re-designing / coding a new\n    version.\n\n    I believe this module should be listed in the module list because\n    it is the only module (to this date) that produces XHTML (i.e.\n    elements such as thead, tfoot, tbody, etc.), not just HTML. I plan\n    on using existing CPAN modules (XML among others) to create the\n    output unlike i did with DBIx::XHTML_Table so that valid XML is\n    guaranteed.\n\n    After HTML::XHTML_Table is complete and ready to go, i will upgrade\n    DBIx::XHTML_Table so that it is basically just glue code between DBI\n    and HTML::XHTML_Table, branching off to version 2 and allowing\n    version 1 to be a 'stand-alone' solution.\n\n    thanks, jeffa"
