Using this method, in production at my institution's\n    library, we achieve well over 99% accuracy in sorting. In practice,\n    errors have not been noticeable. Employing this algorithm leads to\n    much improved results over what our current and previous library\n    software vendors have provided.\n\n    Brian Cassidy (brian@nald.ca) and I (Roy Zimmer, zimmer@wmich.edu)\n    have been collaborating on getting this software to CPAN."
