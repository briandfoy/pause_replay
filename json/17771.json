The\n    templates themselves are generated using other Petal templates\n    (meta-templates). This module sprang from the need to generate a lot\n    of templates fast for a web application that I was working on,\n    however it is now the basis of an article that I am writing on using\n    meta-templates in Petal. I am currently awaiting review on the Petal\n    mailing list to see if anyone has a more appropriate name for this\n    module.\n\n    By the way, I am not the same Kurt Stephens as KSTEPHENS. If KSTEP\n    is too close, I will settle for KPS.",
