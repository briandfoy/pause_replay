One particular disability is a backtick without the console.\n    Altough the Microsoft console, may be started without a window\n    (start command with /b option or spawn program call), the Perl\n    system command on windows usually creates a window. Creating a\n    window causes immense user interface problem since it will randomly\n    pop-up and take focus over the current window, erasing current\n    entries into that window. Solutions such as \"Proc::SafePipe\" do not\n    run on Perls for Window.\n\n    This module provides an answer by using the \"open\" command with a\n    pipe to provide a backtick without a console that will run under\n    Perls on Microsoft Windows."
