Included are two 'sample' subclasses one for\n    DBD::Pg and one for ODBC. I intened to supply DQL::SqlObject::Sybase\n    and SQL::SqlObject::SQLite, but I wanted to get the ball rolling\n    ASAP to increase the odds that the next release will have any\n    bugfixes necessary, we well as those additional wrappers"
