The\n    goal is to retrieve an interval narrower than the Scale interval\n    ['-from'..'-to'] Thinking in 'Scale': - Option '-variable' is\n    replaced by two options '-varmin' and '-varmax'. - Two options added\n    '-lblmin' and '-lblmax' (although option '-label' acts for the whole\n    widget) - Option '-command' reacts on a change of any variable.\n\n    At this time, there is no method provided for this widget.\n\n    I think a good namespace will be Tk::Scale::Interval, although it\n    is not Scale based, because its purpose is to retrieve a pair of\n    values (vs the purpose of a Scale is to retrieve one value)"
