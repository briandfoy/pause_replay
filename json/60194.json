It is implemented in C\n    codes with XS interface.\n\n    This module implements most properties listed in the \"Unicode\n    Character Properties\" section in L<perlunicode> by simple query\n    functions. The usage is some how like C<$flag = IsL(ord($ucs_chr)>\n    which is similar to C<$ucs_chr =~ /\\p{L}/>. It also supports list\n    arguments.\n\n    The problem for lookup tables are size and the trade-off between\n    space and size. I used an simple paging method along with some\n    fine-tuning after observing that each properties for an codepage is\n    mostly monotonic.\n\n    For these about 170 Unicode properties, I wrote a generator to do\n    the page-based compression and the code generation. After C<make>\n    the resulting the .o binary file occupied about 1.3M disk space.\n\n    I chose the Unicode::Property::XS for its name because of the\n    functions it works for."
