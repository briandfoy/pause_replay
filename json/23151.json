I have a module for controlling access\n    to a pool of resources (logins on remote machines, processors on a\n    multi-processor system, whatever), where the pool may shrink or grow\n    over time (new logins added, processors unavailable during prime\n    hours).\n\n    Processes are assigned a resource if one is available, and will\n    block (or not), if none are. Resources are returned automatically\n    (using semaphores) if a process dies before returning them\n    explicitly. A logging mechanism records resource use.\n\n    I have found the module useful, and think others might, too.\n\n    I'll have to get approval for release from AT&T, so nothing will\n    happen soon, but I gather registration isn't instantaneous, either.\n    I've been calling the module AccessControl.pm, but I'm open to\n    better names and suggestions for where to file it. -- jpl",
