      "why" : "I have a Win32 script which checks the available free disk space\n    for all drives on a list of computers. Notification of free disk\n    space below the desired limit is sent to a different lists of email\n    addresses depending on responsibility. Notification is also sent to\n    a list of computers in a system pop-up message via the \"net send\"\n    command. This script is very useful to prevent database servers from\n    running out of free disk space and stopping production. You can view\n    the script at http://www.mcgintech.com/FreeDiskSpace.txt This link\n    does not contain the POD information you require. I am in the\n    process of adding this information. Thank you.",
