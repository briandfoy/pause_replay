Thus it will\n    enable to find legal moves (and move also) in a position, to have\n    the standard statistics, to convert different backgammon file\n    formats, to read (and write) bearoff databases, to interact with\n    gnubg, ... . All together it's just a convinient way to work in Perl\n    with backgammon analysis.\n\n    There is no other module in CPAN concerning the backgammon game and\n    from its function the namespace choice should be clear.\n\n    Two years ago, Tassilo v. Parseval, had already tried to get this\n    namespace. I contacted him, he neither had the time to finish the\n    module, neither got he the Games::Backgammon namespace. I'll munge\n    his code parts with my ones together."
