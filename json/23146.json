      "why" : "This will be my first module submission. I have implemented the A*\n    Pathfinding algorithim and wanted to make it available as something\n    like Games::Pathfinding::AStar or something like that. The interface\n    consists of a single exportable function which accepts a reference\n    to an object encapsulating your map, your starting node, and target\n    node and returns an array of node ids representing the path to get\n    there. Heuristic calculations are also left to the map object making\n    the AStar package as generally usefull as possible.\n\n    Maybe this is too simple a module? Thank you for your time. I await\n    your response.",
