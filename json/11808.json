This module allows you to both cache records\n    pulled by an SQL statement from a database in the memory as well as\n    look them up later at any time during execution of your script.\n\n    This also speeds up access to your data at run-time and\n    subsequently reduces load on the database. This module also supports\n    alternative key mapping, which is not offered by any other module. A\n    user of this module may add alternative key mappings at run-time to\n    be able to link certain records with specific keys etc."
