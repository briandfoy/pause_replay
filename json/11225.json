Out of the box its GUI is\n    decent but its command line utilities are enough of a mish-mash to\n    drive anyone insane.\n\n    The modules in the proposed NBU namespace implement all the\n    concepts touted in the NetBackup documentation: Volume Pool Robot\n    Storage Unit Drive Image etc.\n\n    There currently exists no generic top-level namespace for\n    backup/archiving concepts, although perhaps there should be one.\n    Hence I am proposing that the NBU namespace be reserved for\n    NetBackup and that the modules be categorized under commercial\n    software interfaces.\n\n    Humbly submitted to the Perl masters, Paul Winkeler"
