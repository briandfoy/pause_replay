By searching up from the bottom of $Bin the more local lib's\n    are added first (e.g., for modules in development subdir's).\n\n    The basic code was developed for a recent project I worked on and\n    saved a lot of shuffling around during development and deploying the\n    code.\n\n    Putting it under FindBin seems reasonable since it is an outgrowth\n    of FindBin to being with."
