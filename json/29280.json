      "rationale" : "Graphics::ColorObject is a module that does color-space\n    conversions, for example between RGB, HSV, and CMYK, but also much\n    more complex ones like NTSC-RGB to PAL-RGB, or daylight to\n    fluorescent light. I've just completed a rewrite that adds some\n    major new features, in particular support for the CIE (Commission\n    Internationale d'Eclairage) perceptually-linear color spaces, and\n    support for the different standard RGB spaces. The number of\n    supported color spaces is now up to 27, with accurate conversion\n    possible from any one of them to any other one. I think that as the\n    largest (and most complex ;) color-handling module out there, it\n    belongs on the list, especially since the list already has a\n    placeholder for that functionality (Image::Colorimetry).\n\n    BTW I'm open to any suggestions for a better name. Using \"Object\"\n    in the name is arguably bad practice. Some other possible names\n    would be \"Graphics::Colorspace\" which has been mentioned on this\n    mailing list before; or \"Graphics::ColorTransform\". However, perhaps\n    simply \"Graphics::Color\" would be best, because the instances of it\n    you make with new() are just colors, not spaces or transforms, and\n    you can actually say $c = new Graphics::Color(\"orange\");\n\n    This module has actually been around for a fairly long time\n    (originally called Color::Object since March 2001, and\n    Graphics::ColorObject since January 2003), but somehow it hasn't\n    made it into the module list yet. Earlier versions up to 0.3a2 were\n    written by AREIBENS (thanks!!).\n\n    Related modules: Image::Colorimetry by JONO which is in the\n    modulelist would appear to do many of the same things, but it is not\n    actually available in CPAN and I'm not sure it's ever been released\n    (status cpdO, i.e. under construction). There are a few other\n    modules that do simple color conversions between just a couple of\n    spaces, usually RGB and HSV (e.g. Graphics::RGBManipulate,\n    Imager::Color, and Color::Calc)"
