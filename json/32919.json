In any WWD enabled medium, instead of referencing actual\n    data such as a person's email address, users can reference an\n    \"Internet variable\", i.e.,\n\n    <wwd servername-or-ip/objectname [optional parameters />\n\n    Assume the following for objects:\n\n    idserver.org/name is set to \"John Baleshiski\" idserver.org/test is\n    set to \"This is a test.\"\n\n    Example webpage: <html><body> <wwd idserver.org/test />\n    </body></html>\n\n    Viewing that in a web browser will output \"This is a test.\"\n\n    Set idserver.org/test to \"wwd://idserver.org/name\"\n\n    A view in the web browser will be \"John Baleshiski\"\n\n    Set idserver.org/test to \"<dperl> return \"Hello from Perl.

Temporary passwords, temporary\n    authorization/deauthorization to view the data, view passwords, and\n    other controls are allowed by the WWD protocol.\n\n    Data can be restricted so only the owner can view it, only people\n    with the proper read password or permission, or anybody can view it.\n\n    White paper and forum to be set up on idserver.org."
