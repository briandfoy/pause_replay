There exist several tagging algorithms for\n    English text, but none of them seem to be implemented in Perl ( at\n    least not under an open source license, or on the CPAN ).\n\n    I've been using a POS tagger for my own work on latent semantic\n    indexing, and this seems like a good module to abstract out so that\n    other CPAN users can benefit.\n\n    For now the module is something of a homebrew - but we intend to\n    extend support to standard algorithms like Brill's tagger and\n    others, in future versions.\n\n    I think the namespace is appropriate, since this is ipso facto\n    specific to English, but I welcome other suggestions."
