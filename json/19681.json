This\n    project started as simply a framework for creating tables (DBD\n    dependant) and has expanded to include altering tables, querying,\n    updating, and inserting. The modules are DB2::db, DB2::Table, and\n    DB2::Row. \"DB2\" namespace was chosen based partly on the existance\n    of Oracle and Sybase namespaces. \"db\" rather than \"DB\" may look like\n    a pragma, except that it's in a namespace, and \"DB\" might be\n    confused for the DB module which I thought would be worse (given the\n    way that the DB module is treated special). Of course, the namespace\n    is still modifyable - this is already its third namespace I've used.",
