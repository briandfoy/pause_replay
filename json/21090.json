As well,\n    applications like OpenOffice and gLabels have their own private\n    collections of this type of info.\n\n    This module will provide an efficient and easy to use one-stop-shop\n    for paper sizes, label layouts and other print media items that I\n    haven't thought of. As well it provides internal unit-conversion and\n    some label position functions to unload that burden from users code.\n\n    I have a few forms in the module already but will flesh out using\n    any public data that I can find ... once API is firmed up a bit\n    more."
